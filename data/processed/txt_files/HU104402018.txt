For the Appellant:     Not present or represented
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal from the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Nixon which was promulgated on 11 December 2018.


    2. The appellant did not attend the hearing of the appeal.  I  put  the
       matter to the end of my list but by midday she had not  arrived  nor
       was there any representative present on her behalf. In  the  absence
       of any message from her I considered that it was in the interests of
       justice to proceed with the appeal in  her  absence.  A  substantial
       bundle of papers had been lodged by her in respect  of  the  appeal,
       and it seemed implicit from the covering letter that she was content
       for it to be determined irrespective of her presence.

    3. I duly heard from Ms Jones for the Respondent and  delivered  an  ex
       tempore decision allowing the appeal. After the  conclusion  of  the
       hearing, an email was received from  Ali  Balashe,  the  appellant's
       fianc� and sponsor. He apologised for not attending the hearing as a
       cousin had died unexpectedly the day before. In  the  light  of  the
       favourable disposal of the appeal, it is necessary  to  revisit  the
       matter.

    4. The appellant is a citizen of Morocco whose  application  for  entry
       clearance was refused on 4 April 2018.  The reason for  refusal  was
       an incomplete run of payslips covering a six month period  prior  to
       the date of application, a strict requirement of Appendix FM-SE.

    5. The judge  dealt  with  whether  the  appellant  had  satisfied  the
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE as follows:

         "13. I have not been provided  with  a  bundle  on  behalf  of  the
             respondent and am therefore not aware  of  what  evidence  was
             seen by the respondent.  In any event I remind myself that the
             obligation rests on the appellant to satisfy me that  she  met
             the necessary criteria and it was therefore her responsibility
             to ensure that I had before me the documents relied on.


         14.  I have been through the appellant's bundle in some detail  and
             have seen that it contains on 15th  December  2018  and  I  am
             therefore concerned with the six month period  prior  to  that
             date (on the assumption from  the  headed  payslips  that  the
             sponsor had been working for Royal  Mail  for  more  than  six
             months).  I remind myself that the requirements  to  meet  the
             criteria  for  financial  requirements  under  Appendix  FM-SE
             statement the appellant should provide six months of payslips,
             six months of personal bank statements and a letter  from  the
             employer stating that  the  period  of  employment  and  gross
             salary.


         15.  I have not been provided with  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's
             employer but I am prepared to assume that he  has  worked  for
             the same employer for twelve  months  or  more  owing  to  the
             number of payslips provided.   I  have  seen  all  six  months
             payslips bar one (for the week  commencing  11  January  2018)
             have been provided.  I note  that  there  is  a  corresponding
             deposit to the sponsor's bank account for pay for the  missing
             week.


         16.  I have looked in some detail at the bank statements  and  note
             that the dates between 18 July 2017 and 1 September  2017  are
             missing.  It is therefore clear to me that this is not a  case
             where  simply  one  payslip  is  missing  and  therefore   the
             respondent would have been expected to use her discretion over
             the evidential flexibility Rule  error  as  submitted  by  the
             appellant.  Over a month's bank statements and the  employer's
             letter are also missing.  Whilst it may well be argued that it
             seems apparent that the sponsor is earning  over  the  �18,600
             threshold that evidence has not been  appropriately  provided.
             Bearing in mind the issue raised in the  refusal  is  only  in
             respect  of  that  requirement  I  would  have  expected   the
             appellant would have been able  to  ensure  that  all  of  the
             necessary documentation was before me.  She has failed  to  do
             this and whilst I have some sympathy for her position the Rule
             set out very clearly what is required.  I find  that  she  has
             failed to meet the Rules."

    6. It is accepted by Ms Jones on behalf of the Secretary of  State,  as
       it was by the judge, that the single documentary deficit  identified
       by the Entry Clearance Officer had been adequately addressed by  the
       time the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal. The matters  on
       which the judge dismissed the appeal were not ones  which  had  been
       raised by the Entry Clearance Officer.


    7. Where, as is now conceded by the Secretary of State, all the missing
       documentation identified by the ECO had been provided, it was unfair
       of the judge to dismiss the appeal on a basis not  advanced  by  the
       Secretary of State nor part of the ECO's reasons for refusal.

    8. At the very least, the judge should have afforded the appellant  the
       opportunity of making good any apparent deficit  or  navigating  the
       judge to the documentation that was probably there  already,  albeit
       not well collated. I am satisfied, in the light  of  the  concession
       properly made on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  that  this
       constitutes an error of law and the decision must be set aside.

    9. In remaking the decision, I give effect to Ms Jones' concession that
       the requirements of the Rules are  satisfied  by  the  documentation
       provided by the appellant. I therefore allow the appellant's  appeal
       under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

   1) Decision of First-tier Tribunal set aside;
   2) Decision remade allowing the appellant's appeal under the  Immigration
      Rules;
   3) No anonymity direction is made.
