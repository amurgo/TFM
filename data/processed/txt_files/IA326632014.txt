For the Respondent:    Appeared in person without legal representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   I will hereafter refer to the parties as they were  before  the  First-
    tier Judge, i.e. Mrs Al Bitar will be referred to as the appellant  and
    the Secretary of State as the respondent.

2.   The appellant appealed to a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal against  a
    decision of the respondent dated 7 August 2014  refusing  to  vary  her
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

3.   The appellant had met her husband in 2012 when they  were  studying  in
    Brighton.  They married in November 2013 and wished to remain  together
    here.  Her husband is an Iranian born British citizen who came  to  the
    United  Kingdom  in  2004  and  was  recognised  as  a  refugee.    The
    application was refused on the basis that her husband's income did  not
    meet the required threshold of ï¿½18,600.

4.   The Judge concluded  that  the  appeal  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, but allowed it under Article 8  outside  the  Rules.
    The  Judge  noted  that  a  proportionality  evaluation  called  for  a
    balancing assessment of a range of factors rather than being a hunt for
    insurmountable obstacles.  The Judge noted that by the date of  hearing
    the appellant's husband appeared to  be  above  the  required  earnings
    limit, the bank statements were in healthy credit, the appellant  spoke
    English well, she said that she had no  relatives  in  Jordan,  in  her
    application form she had referred to grandparents and  aunts,  but  the
    Judge had not asked about them  at  the  hearing  and  there  was  also
    evidence that the couple had undergone tests for infertility and  hoped
    to start fertility treatment.  Investigations  had  revealed  that  her
    husband suffered from a condition which required surgery.   There  were
    significant health risks in this regard.  The Judge concluded  that  in
    light of the couple's ability to support themselves financially,  their
    English language  skills,  concerns  that  it  would  run  contrary  to
    tradition  for  the  appellant  to  live  alone  in  Jordan,  her  good
    immigration history, the time that had lapsed since the application was
    made  including  periods  of  delay  not  of  her  making,   well-known
    volatility and security issues in the Middle  East  currently  and  her
    husband's  medical  condition  the  refusal  was   a   disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect for family and private life.

5.   The respondent sought and was  granted  permission  to  appeal  against
    this decision on the basis that the necessary threshold  had  not  been
    crossed and that the circumstances could not properly be  described  as
    exceptional, and there had been a failure to factor  in  matters  which
    were not in the appellant's favour.

6.   As noted above, the appellant was  unrepresented  at  the  hearing.   I
    explained to her the difficulties she might face  in  trying  to  argue
    that there was no error of law in the decision bearing in mind that she
    is not a lawyer, and that Mr Avery would be arguing that there  was  an
    error of law.  Nevertheless she was keen  to  proceed  and  so,  having
    checked that she had all the necessary paperwork and that  her  English
    language skills were good enough for her to  proceed  in  English,  the
    hearing went ahead.

7.   In his submissions Mr  Avery  argued  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    consider whether there  were  compelling  or  exceptional  evidence  or
    circumstances to justify a consideration  outside  the  Rules  at  all,
    citing the decision of the Court of Appeal in SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 387.  The Judge had gone  straight  into  assessing  the  situation
    under Article 8 outside the Rules.  The Judge had  failed  to  identify
    exceptional or compelling circumstances or why he  should  depart  from
    the framework of the Rules which although they were not a complete code
    contained the general conditions.  He  had  noted  that  the  appellant
    could apply for entry clearance from outside the  United  Kingdom.   He
    had not asked the  appellant  about  the  relatives  to  whom  she  had
    referred on the form.  The fact that there was no clear  time  estimate
    as to how long an entry clearance application in Jordan would take  was
    not really material.  Exceptional circumstances could not be  found  on
    those facts.  The maintenance of immigration control had  been  ignored
    as a relevant factor at paragraph 34.  There was no mention of  section
    117 of the 2002 Act.  The Judge had failed to adopt a proper structured
    approach.  If the Tribunal agreed then the appeal should  be  dismissed
    as the appellant had the  alternative  of  making  an  entry  clearance
    application.

8.   In her submissions the appellant said her situation was still the  same
    in that she could not go back to Jordan as she  had  no  family  there.
    They were in the United Arab Emirates.  She could not live  by  herself
    in Jordan away from her husband as tradition did  not  allow  that  and
    also  she  was  now  33  weeks  pregnant  and  had  been  unwell   with
    complications, having to go to hospital  every  week.   She  could  not
    travel at the moment.  She wanted to be with her husband who  gave  her
    full support.  Also she belonged to  her  husband  after  marriage  and
    therefore could not go to Abu Dhabi as previously she could have a visa
    dependent on her father prior to her  marriage  but  according  to  the
    Rules in the UAE she  could  not  have  a  residence  visa  any  longer
    dependent on her father so she could not go there.  Also if she went to
    Jordan with the baby the baby  could  not  have  any  rights  there  to
    Jordanian ID.  It would be like being a  foreigner  there.   She  would
    love to have family and private life with her husband and child who had
    the right to live with her parents.  There was good care in the  United
    Kingdom and the child would be born in hospital here.  She herself  had
    been suffering from diabetes during pregnancy and there was a  risk  of
    the baby suffering from hypoglycaemia after she was born.   She  argued
    that these amounted to exceptional circumstances and that  the  Judge's
    decision was therefore incorrect.  Not letting her remain had  affected
    her in so many ways in life and she had experienced a lot of stress and
    they were not able to live normally like married people.  Also she  was
    a pharmacy graduate but could not work because her  passport  was  with
    the Home Office and she was losing more and more time in  her  practice
    year by year and she loved her job and wanted to be productive and help
    society.

9.   Mr Avery had no points to make by way of reply.

10.  I reserved my determination.

11.  In SS (Congo) it was said at paragraph 40 that the appropriate  general
    formulation for cases where a person is applying for leave to enter the
    United Kingdom is where they can  show  that  compelling  circumstances
    exist which are not sufficiently recognised  under  the  new  Rules  to
    require the grant of such leave and that this formulation  was  aligned
    to that proposed earlier in Nagre in relation to the  general  position
    in respect of the new Rules for leave to remain, (i.e. as in this case)
    adopted by the Court of Appeal in Haleemudeen.  It  was  noted  by  the
    Court of Appeal that this was a fairly demanding test,  reflecting  the
    reasonable relationship between the Rules  themselves  and  the  proper
    outcome of an application of Article 8 in the usual run of cases.

12.  Following on from this, it is also the case that it is necessary for  a
    Judge  to  effect  a   proper   balancing   exercise   in   determining
    proportionality, and I see force in the point made by Mr Avery that the
    assessment in this regard is essentially one-sided.  The point was made
    at paragraph 2 of the grounds that the appellant  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom  for  a  specific  circumstance,  namely  to  study   and   her
    anticipated residence was therefore a short term one.  No doubt all the
    factors referred to by the Judge at paragraph 34 are relevant  factors,
    but I consider that the Judge erred in  law  in  concluding  that  they
    amounted to compelling circumstances such as to require  the  grant  of
    leave in this case.

13.  As a consequence I find the Judge erred in  law.   However  although  I
    note  Mr  Avery's  submission  that  the  appeal  can   be   determined
    immediately, I think it is necessary for there to be factored  into  an
    evaluation of proportionality  the  fact  that  the  appellant  is  now
    pregnant, and has explained in greater detail than  I  think  was  done
    previously the reasons why she says she cannot return to Jordan, cannot
    go and live with her family in the UAE and the problems that her  child
    would experience in gaining any kind of status in Jordan in any  event.
    There also requires to be clarified the issue of any further  relatives
    of the appellant in Jordan.  The Judge did not take up the  point  made
    in her application form that she  has  grandparents  and  aunts  there.
    That is a matter that needs to be explored further also.  Accordingly I
    have concluded that the appropriate course of action in  this  case  is
    for the appeal to be heard in the First-tier Tribunal and I direct that
    it be heard at Hatton Cross by a judge other than Judge R Sullivan.

No anonymity direction is made.
