Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs Price of Counsel instructed by Addison & Khan
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against a decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       McCartney  promulgated on 25th June 2015, in  which  she  allowed  an
       appeal against the decision of the respondent of 29th  July  2014  to
       refuse an application for leave to enter the UK as  a  partner  under
       Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

    2. The appellant  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Mumbai)  and  the
       Respondent to this appeal, is Mrs. Tarnnum Saberbhai Momla.   However
       for ease of reference, in the course of this decision I  shall  adopt
       the parties' status as it was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I
       shall in this determination, refer to Mrs. Tarnnum Saberbhai Momla as
       the Appellant  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Mumbai)  as  the
       Respondent.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Davies
       on 15th September 2015.  The  matter  comes  before  me  to  consider
       whether or not the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McCartney
       involved the making of a material error of law, and if so, to  remake
       the decision.

    Background

    4. On 6th January 2014, the appellant applied for entry clearance as the
       partner of a British Citizen to settle in the UK  with  her  husband,
       Shahid Juber Datta,  whom  she  married  on  30th  March  2013.   The
       application was refused on the basis that the sponsor  did  not  meet
       the income requirement under Appendix FM-SE of �18,600.00. It appears
       that a holding response may have been sent by the respondent on  19th
       February 2014, explaining that the income threshold  requirement  was
       not met, but the  application  would  not  be  determined  until  the
       outcome of the MM and Others appeal that was then before the Court of
       Appeal.

    5. In the Appendix 2  'Financial  Requirement  Form'  submitted  by  the
       appellant at the time of the application for Entry Clearance,  it  is
       said that the sponsor has been  employed  as  a  Sales  Assistant  by
       Canvasbay Ltd since 2nd September 2012 and his annual pre tax  income
       from that employment is �13,011.  It is also said that Majorledge Ltd
       employed the sponsor as a Sales Assistant since  10th  January  2013.
       His annual pre tax income from that employment is  �6,552.00.   Those
       earnings are confirmed in the sponsor declaration dated 22nd November
       2013  signed  by  the  sponsor  who  states  that  his  earnings  are
       �19,563.22.

    6. The Refusal of Entry Clearance dated 29th July 2014  deals  with  the
       sponsors earnings in the following way:

             "...  On  your  application   form   (Appendix   2   Financial
             Requirement Form) your sponsor has stated that  he  meets[sic]
             the financial requirements through salaried  employment  only.
             Your sponsor claims to have 2 forms of  employment:  CanvasBay
             Ltd since  Sep  2012  as  a  Sales  Assistant  and  Majorledge
             Leatherwear as a Sales Assistant since January 2013.  Both are
             paid cash in hand and the  only  deposits  seen  entering  the
             account are either bigger than the income derived from  second
             job, and a lot smaller than monthly pay from main job.  The  6
             month  period  of  consideration  for   assessment   of   your
             application is- June to December- total pay = �8917.74 (x 2  =
             �17835.48).  Your sponsor does not have savings to  cover  the
             shortfall. The documents  submitted  do  not  show  that  your
             sponsor has been paid throughout the period of 6 months  prior
             to the date of application at a level of gross  annual  salary
             which  equals  or  exceeds  the  level  relied  upon  in   the
             application ..."

The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

    7. The respondent was not represented at the hearing before  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.  At paragraphs [5] to [7] of her decision,  the  Judge
       sets out the documents that were before the Tribunal.  At  paragraphs
       [8] to [17] of her decision, the Judge sets out the evidence that she
       heard from the appellant's sponsor.   It serves no purpose to  repeat
       what is set out in those paragraphs in this decision.

    8. At paragraphs [18] to [26], the Judge sets out her decision.   It  is
       clear that the Judge had very careful regard to the  evidence  before
       her, and that she carried out a careful analysis of the income of the
       sponsor insofar as she could from the evidence before her.  The Judge
       considered the evidence in relation to the earnings from the two jobs
       that the sponsor has, and found:

             "24. On the face of it the tribunal is satisfied that the  pay
                  meets the required thresholds.  Whilst both the grounds of
                  appeal and the submission from the  Respondent  calculated
                  different  figures  from  the  figures  given  above,  the
                  tribunal is satisfied that the  income  threshold  is  met
                  [sic] and vouched for on  paper,  particularly  given  the
                  production of the P60s for April  2014.  The  tribunal  is
                  satisfied  that  the  P60s  can  be  taken  into   account
                  notwithstanding that they were not produced at the time of
                  the application, given the P60s show the circumstances  of
                  the sponsor's pay  at  the  time  of  the  application  in
                  January  2014.    The  Respondent's  calculation  of   the
                  sponsor's pay is only set out briefly in the  Respondent's
                  written submissions, and the calculations are  not  clear.
                  In the absence of a  Presenting  Officer  to  explain  the
                  calculations, the tribunal has done its  own  calculations
                  and is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that  the
                  position is vouched on  paper.  However,  the  Respondents
                  also appear to say that they do not accept that  this  was
                  genuine information, as the bank statements showing monies
                  paid in, does not add up to the monies which  the  sponsor
                  claimed to earn.

             25.   The sponsor was a genuine and  credible  witness.     He
                  gave oral evidence, and provided an  adequate  explanation
                  for the wages payments being given to him in cash and  why
                  this was not all paid into the bank. He  readily  accepted
                  that it was  now  unusual  to  be  paid  in  cash  by  one
                  employer, and that it was a very unusual coincidence to be
                  paid in cash by both of his employers.  His evidence  that
                  he had asked his employers to pay him  directly  into  his
                  bank account.  For whatever reason, his employers were not
                  willing to do so. He gave explanations for  what  he  uses
                  some of his wages to pay directly out,  in  cash,  without
                  going through his bank account. It would be plausible that
                  he pays his rent in cash. It would also be plausible that,
                  given that his wife has not entered the UK,  he  spends  a
                  number of evenings a week at his mother's house  and  will
                  give  her  money  for  food.  There   was   therefore   an
                  explanation given orally by the sponsor as to why the cash
                  going into the bank does not match up to the  cash  he  is
                  paid.   Whilst he has  received  pay  rises  in  both  his
                  positions, from looking at the P60s between 2013 and  2014
                  in particular, his explanation was that he was  on  unpaid
                  leave in March 2013 whilst in India, and this affected his
                  overall pay for 2013.

             26.  The tribunal is satisfied that the sponsor does earn more
                  than �18,600 per year.    This was vouched on paper to the
                  Respondent at the time, although the tribunal can see  why
                  the Respondent may have had questions about  the  payments
                  being paid in cash not matching up  to  the  monies  going
                  through the sponsor's account, and the differences between
                  P60s for 2013 and the payslips for 2014.    There  are  no
                  other issues for the tribunal  to  determine.  Accordingly
                  the appeal is granted."

 The hearing before me

    9. The grounds of appeal are succinct.  The  respondent  refers  to  the
       need to demonstrate a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum  and
       submits that "The Appellant may only rely  on  the  Sponsor's  income
       which is demonstrated by specified evidence, contained in Appendix FM-
       SE".  The respondent submits that only wages paid into a bank account
       and appearing on the statements may be counted towards the  Sponsor's
       gross income in accordance with A1 1(n) of Appendix  FM-SE.    It  is
       said that it is not open to the Judge to draw  her  own  conclusions,
       based on the credibility of the Sponsor or  other  documents  in  the
       absence of those specified.

   10. At the hearing before me,  Mr  Tarlow  relied  upon  the  Grounds  of
       Appeal.  He submits that there was plainly evidence before the  Judge
       that the sponsor received payments in cash, and that he did  not  put
       all of his earnings into his bank account.  He submits that the Judge
       therefore erred in taking into account  the  gross  earnings  of  the
       sponsor, based upon calculations performed by the Judge herself.

   11. In reply, Mrs Price submits that the decision of the Judge  discloses
       no error of law, and if it does, any such error is  not  material  to
       the outcome of the decision.  She submits that paragraph A1, 2(c)  of
       Appendix FM-SE is satisfied.  She submits  that  the  Judge  accepted
       that the sponsor was paid in cash, and  that  not  all  of  the  cash
       receipts were paid into the sponsor's bank account.   The  Judge  has
       given adequate reasons for making that  finding.   She  submits  that
       after a careful examination of all of the evidence, it  was  open  to
       the Judge to conclude that the maintenance requirements of the rules,
       are met.  She submits that the approach adopted by the respondent  in
       this appeal is pedantic.  She referred me  to  the  decision  of  the
       Upper Tribunal  in  Thakur  (PBS  decision  -  common  law  fairness)
       Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 and submits that  the  Judge  considered
       the relevant factors and it was open to the Judge to  find  that  the
       substantive requirements of the immigration rules have been met.  She
       submits that the Judge  properly  applied  the  requirements  of  the
       rules, to the facts of the appeal before her.

DECISION AS TO ERROR OF LAW

   12. It is useful to begin by setting out  the  relevant  requirements  of
       Appendix FM-SE:

         Evidence of Financial Requirements under Appendix FM

         A1. To meet the financial requirement under paragraphs  E-ECP.3.1.,
         E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.  and  E-LTRC.2.1.  of  Appendix  FM,   the
         applicant must meet:

               .      (a) The level of financial requirement applicable  to
                 the application under Appendix FM; and

               .      (b) The requirements specified  in  Appendix  FM  and
                 this Appendix as to:

                     .     (i) The permitted sources of income and savings;

                  (ii)  The  time  periods  and  permitted  combinations  of
sources                         applicable to each permitted  source  relied
upon; and

                       (iii) The evidence required for each permitted source
         relied upon.

         1. In relation to evidencing the financial requirements in Appendix
            FM the following general provisions shall apply:

            ...

            (k) Where the gross (pre-tax) amount of  any  income  cannot  be
            properly evidenced, the net (post-tax) amount will  be  counted,
            including towards a gross income requirement.

            ...

          .   (m) Cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may  be
            counted as income under this Appendix, subject to  the  relevant
            evidential requirements of this Appendix.

            (n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted where the
            person's specified bank statements show  the  net  amount  which
            relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or  in  the
            relevant  specified  evidence  provided  in  addition   to   the
            specified bank statements in relation to non-employment income).
            Otherwise, only the net  amount  shown  on  the  specified  bank
            statements may be counted.

         ....

         2. In respect of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

         ...

            (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued  the  payslips  at
            paragraph 2(a) confirming:

               .      (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

               .      (ii) the length of their employment;

               .      (iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were
                 paid the level of salary relied upon in  the  application;
                 and

               .      (iv) the type of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term
                 contract or agency).

          .        (c) Personal bank statements corresponding  to  the  same
            period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a),  showing  that  the
            salary has been paid into an account in the name of  the  person
            or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.

          . ...

   13. In order to meet the financial requirement, the appellant  must  meet
       the requirements of Appendix FM-SE as to the  evidence  required  for
       each permitted source of income.  In this case, that is the sponsor's
       income from his employment.  Paragraph  A1  2(c)  of  Appendix  FM-SE
       requires  the  appellant  to   provide   personal   bank   statements
       corresponding to the same periods as the payslips  showing  that  the
       salary has been paid into an account in the name of the sponsor or in
       the name of the sponsor and the appellant jointly.  His employers did
       not pay the sponsor's earnings into a bank account.

   14. Paragraph A1 1(m) permits cash income on which the  correct  tax  has
       been paid, to be counted as income under Appendix  FM-SE  subject  to
       the relevant evidential requirements being met.   Paragraph  A1  1(n)
       operates such that the gross amount of any cash income may be counted
       where the person's specified bank  statements  show  the  net  amount
       which relates to  the  gross  amount  shown  on  their  payslips  but
       otherwise, only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements
       may be counted.

   15. At paragraph 24 of her decision, the Judge noted that the  respondent
       was concerned that the bank statements showing monies  paid  in,  did
       not add up to the monies that the sponsor claimed  to  earn.   Beyond
       the requirement to establish  a  gross  annual  income  of  at  least
       �18,600, the  Judge  makes  no  reference  in  her  decision  to  the
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE, and in particular to the requirements
       set out at paragraphs A1 1(m) and (n).  The Judge has plainly carried
       out a careful analysis of the sponsor's income by  reference  to  the
       wage slips and P60's that were  available  to  her  in  reaching  her
       overall conclusion that the sponsor does earn more than  �18,600  per
       year.  The Judge appears  to  have  done  so,  in  ignorance  of  the
       requirements of paragraph A1 1(n) of Appendix FM. Had  the  sponsor's
       bank statements shown the net  amount  which  related  to  the  gross
       amount shown on his payslips, the approach adopted by the Judge would
       have been permissible.  However that was not the case here  and  thus
       only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  could  be
       counted.  The Judge did not carry out the same  careful  analysis  of
       the net amount shown on the bank statements and in failing to do  so,
       in my judgment the decision discloses an error of law.

   16. I reject the submission made by Mrs. Price that the error of  law  is
       not a material one.  Whether one proceeds upon the  gross  income  of
       the sponsor or the net income of the sponsor is plainly  material  in
       an appeal of this kind.  The appellant was only just able to meet the
       substantive requirement to establish a  gross  annual  income  of  at
       least �18,600, but if one were to proceed, as required by Appendix FM-
       SE upon the basis that only the net amount  shown  on  the  specified
       bank statements may be counted, the substantive requirement could not
       be met.

   17. I also reject the submission made by Mrs. Price that there  has  been
       unfairness in the decision by the respondent, that is perpetuated  by
       the decision to refuse the appellant entry  clearance.   Thakur  (PBS
       Decision - Common Law Fairness) Bangladesh [2011]  UKUT  00151  (IAC)
       relates to a Tier 4 application,  and  establishes  that  even  where
       events have conspired to undermine the appellant's application, there
       is no burden  on  the  respondent  to  seek  out  documentation.  The
       evidential requirements here, were clearly set out in Appendix  FM-SE
       and it was in the  hands  of  the  appellant  to  comply  with  those
       requirements, when she applied.

   18. The First-tier Tribunal Judge erred by not adequately  analysing  the
       evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE and erred in  allowing  the
       appeal having concluded that the substantive maintenance  requirement
       was met simply by reference to her analysis of  the  evidence  before
       her as to the appellant's income.   In  those  circumstances,  in  my
       judgement there is a material error of law in  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal and the decision is set aside.

Re-Making the Decision

   19. I was invited by the parties  to  remake  the  decision.   Mr  Tarlow
       adopted the matters set out in the Refusal of Entry Clearance.

   20. Mrs Price referred me to the evidence that had been before the First-
       tier Tribunal as to the sponsor's income including the payslips,  and
       P60's.  She submits that the sponsor's income plainly exceeds �19,000
       and thus the maintenance requirement of �18,600 is met.  I asked  her
       during the hearing of  the  appeal  whether  any  schedule  had  been
       prepared of the appellant's income as disclosed by  his  wage  slips,
       and by reference to the monies credited to his bank account.  No such
       information had been prepared in readiness for  the  hearing  of  the
       appeal, and Mrs Price simply drew my attention to the bank statements
       that were  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  from  which  one  could
       establish the net amount credited and shown  on  the  specified  bank
       statements.

   21. I have taken into account all the evidence that was before the First-
       tier Tribunal and the submissions made by the parties.  Because  this
       is an appeal against refusal of entry clearance, I may only  consider
       the circumstances appertaining at the date of refusal, which was 29th
       July 2014.  I can however take into account  evidence  arising  after
       the  date  of  refusal,  if  it  is  relevant  to  the  circumstances
       appertaining at the date of refusal.  The burden of proof is  on  the
       appellant to establish that the requirements of the immigration rules
       are met, and the standard is a balance of probabilities.

   22. I remind myself that the appellant made  the  application  for  entry
       clearance on 6th January 2014.  Before the First-tier Tribunal,  Mrs.
       Price had submitted that the relevant period for  the  assessment  of
       documents was from July 2013 to January 2014.   Mr.  Tarlow  did  not
       submit before me that any other period was appropriate.

   23. For the reasons that I have already  set  out  in  my  error  of  law
       decision, little is to  be  gained  by  a  further  analysis  of  the
       appellant's wage slips and P60's.  There was no attempt to  challenge
       the analysis of those documents as set out in the decision of  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge McCartney, before me.

   24. There are a number of bank statements in the papers before  me.   The
       bank statements establish the following cash credits to the  sponsors
       HSBC bank account between 1st July 2013 and 23rd December 2013.

|23.12.13    |200.00         |[Appellant/97]        |


   25. The net amount shown on the specified bank  statements  establish  an
       income of �3300 during that 6-month period.  On  any  view,  the  net
       credits to the bank account would not establish that the  maintenance
       requirement  is  met,  and  the  appeal  therefore  fails  under  the
       immigration rules.

   26. Mrs Price also submitted that the refusal of entry  clearance  is  in
       breach of Article 8 ECHR.  She submits that  the  appellant  and  the
       sponsor have been married for a long time and that there are no other
       public interest considerations that apply.

   27. In SSHD v SS (Congo)  & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court  of  Appeal
       considered the  proper approach to applications for leave   to  enter
       the United  Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules  on  the  basis  of
       Article  8  of  the  ECHR  following  the  decision  in  R  (on   the
       application of MM  (Lebanon)) v SSHD [20141 EWCA Civ  985.   Richards
       LJ said that what was is in issue in relation to an  application  for
       leave to enter is more in  the  nature of an  appeal to  the  State's
       positive obligations under Article 8 (as referred to in Huang) rather
       than  enforcement of its  negative duty, which  is  at  the  fore  in
       leave  to remain cases.    Accordingly,  the  requirements  upon  the
       State under Article 8 are  less  stringent  in  the  leave  to  enter
       context, than in that of leave to remain.

   28. The reason that the appellant does not fulfill  the  requirements  of
       the Immigration Rules is because the evidential requirements set  out
       in Appendix FM-SE are not met  sufficiently  to  establish  that  the
       substantive  maintenance  requirement  is  met.  All  of  the   other
       requirements of the Immigration Rules are met.  It  is  not  disputed
       that the appellant is married to a British citizen.

   29. Looking at the matter through the  five  Razgar  questions,  I  would
       answer them therefore as follows. (1)  There  is  no  question  of  a
       proposed removal in this case, but only of whether the  appellant  is
       to be given leave to enter. Plainly  refusal  of  such  leave  is  an
       interference with the exercise  of  the  right  to  respect  for  the
       appellant and her sponsor's family life. (2)  The  interference  will
       have consequences of  such  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage  the
       operation of article 8. (3) Such interference would be in  accordance
       with  law,  namely  pursuant  to  the  applicable  immigration  rules
       (subject of course to the ultimate outcome of the article  8  issue).
       (4) and (5) These questions of justification and proportionality are,
       as has been said, often taken together. As  Strasbourg  and  domestic
       jurisprudence has consistently emphasised,  states  are  entitled  to
       have regard to their system of immigration control and its  generally
       consistent application, and a requirement that an entrant should meet
       the maintenance requirement  is  an  ultimately  fair  and  necessary
       limitation on what would otherwise  become  a  possibly  overwhelming
       burden on all of its citizens.

   30. s117 Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is a  factor  to  be
       taken into account in determining proportionality.  s117A(2) requires
       me to have regard  to  the considerations listed in sections 117B and
       117C. I am conscious of my statutory  duty to take these factors into
       account when coming  to  my  conclusions.  Maintenance  of  fair  and
       effective immigration control is in the public interest.   Similarly,
       it is in the public interest, and in particular in the  interests  of
       the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who  seek
       to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
       because such persons are not a burden on taxpayers,  and  are  better
       able to integrate into society.

   31. The requirements of the Immigration rules, require  an  applicant  to
       establish that the maintenance requirement is met by reference to the
       specified evidence.  The specified evidence provides an  audit  trail
       to establish that the income requirements are  properly  met.   In  a
       case such as this where the sponsor receives payments in cash, in the
       absence of the specified evidence it is difficult  to  establish  the
       provenance of the income claimed, and whether the income  requirement
       is properly met.  It is for that reason  that  Appendix  FM-SE  makes
       express provision that the gross amount of any  cash  income  may  be
       counted where the person's specified bank  statements  show  the  net
       amount which relates to the gross amount shown  on  their  pay-slips,
       but otherwise, only the  net  amount  shown  on  the  specified  bank
       statements may be counted.

   32. In my judgement, the reasons that the appellant is unable to  satisfy
       the requirement of the immigration rules is relevant  to  the  public
       interest matters that I am  required  to  take  into  account  in  an
       assessment of proportionality.  In the absence of any  countervailing
       factors weighing in favour of the appellant beyond the length of time
       that her marriage has endured, in my Judgement the refusal  of  entry
       clearance does not result in a disproportionate interference with the
       applicant and her sponsor's right to a family life.

   33. The appeal is therefore dismissed.
