Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss P Chandran, Counsel, instructed by Burney Legal
                  Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant who was born  on  12  November  1984  is  a  national  of
    Pakistan.  He entered the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General)  Student
    Migrant on 22 March 2011. His visa enabled him to remain until 24  June
    2012 and it was subsequently extended in the  same  category  until  15
    June 2015.

2.   On 31 December 2012 he met his sponsor, who is a British  citizen,  and
    their relationship began in January 2013.  On  22  December  2014  they
    married and on 2 April 2015 he applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  her
    spouse.  This was before his previous leave expired.   He  was  refused
    leave to remain as her spouse  on  14  July  2015.   He  appealed  that
    decision on 27 July 2015 and First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel dismissed
    the appeal on 30 October 2015.

3.   On 22 April 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Page refused  the  Appellant
    permission to appeal and said that his application and appeal had  been
    properly considered through the lens of the Immigration Rules. But on 2
    June 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede granted him permission to appeal.

4.   In the second paragraph of  her  grant  of  permission  she  said  "the
    assertion in the first  ground  that  there  was  sufficient  specified
    evidence before the judge to allow the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules merits further consideration."  It is this first ground  which  I
    address.

5.   When the Respondent refused the Appellant  leave  she  correctly  noted
    that in order for him to be granted leave to remain as a spouse he  had
    to meet the requirement in paragraph ELTRP.3.1 of Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules, which was he " must provide specified evidence  from
    the sources listed in paragraph ELTRP3.1 that his sponsor had  a  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600."  The specified evidence referred to
    which is in ELTRP.3.2 includes income from the partner  form  specified
    employment.

6.   The Appellant also had to show that  he  had  submitted  the  necessary
    evidence to meet the evidential Rules contained in  Appendix  FM-SE  to
    the  Immigration  Rules.   In  particular,  he  had  to  show  that  in
    accordance with A1. 1 )(a)(iii) of that Appendix he had  to  show  that
    the money had been paid into personal bank statements in  the  name  of
    himself, his partner or both, and in this case it is clear  that  money
    derived from his partner's employment was paid into such accounts.

7.   However, the Respondent  misdirected  herself  as  to  the  Immigration
    Rules when she refused the Appellant leave because at  page  2  of  the
    refusal letter she  said:

         "You have indicated on your application form that your partner  has
         been in full-time employment from January 2015. At the time of your
         application your partner had only been working for four months  and
         not the required six months.  We are therefore unable to take  this
         employment into account when dealing with  your  application.   You
         therefore fail to meet the above requirement in ELRTP.3.1."

8.   In fact that decision was incorrect because  Appendix  FM  does  permit
    sponsors, who have not  been  working  for  six  months  prior  to  the
    application, to put in certain alternative evidence and  in  particular
    paragraph A1. 2(ii) of Appendix FM-SE(1) says  that  an  applicant  can
    rely on any period of salaried employment in the period  of  12  months
    prior to the date or application if a person  has  been  employed  with
    their current employer for less than six  months,.  This  is  the  case
    here, as by the time of the Appellant's application that sponsor  would
    have been employed for four months.

9.   As the sponsor had not been employed by the same employed for a  period
    of  six  months  or  more,  the  Appellant  had  to  submit  additional
    information. That was in the form of a letter  from  the  employer  who
    issued  her  payslips.  The  letter  had  to  show  what  the  person's
    employment  was,  the  gross  annual  salary,  the  length   of   their
    employment, the period over which they were paid the  level  of  salary
    relied upon and the type of employment i.e.  was  it  permanent,  fixed
    term, contract or agency.

10.  The Appellant's bundle which was before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    includes a letter from the director of  Blees  Gold,  the  company  for
    which the appellant's partner was working and for which  payslips  were
    submitted. It says

         "I am the director of Blees Gold ... and confirm  in  writing  that
         Mrs Jenny Leigh James is currently employed  as  assistant  manager
         paid an annual salary of �19,200 per annum.  She  started  work  in
         January 2015 and she is a permanent employer of  Blees  Gold.   She
         works 40 hours a week. Should you require any  further  information
         please contact me."

11.  It appears to me that that letter which predates the application  meets
    all the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

12.  A1. 2 (c) of Appendix FM goes on to  say  that  she  must  also  submit
    personal bank statements  corresponding  to  the  same  period  as  the
    payslips showing a sum had been paid into an account in the name of the
    individual or the name of the person and her partner jointly.

13.  I have looked  at  the  evidence  which  has  been  submitted  and  the
    payslips from Blees  Gold  correlate  to  the  amounts  paid  into  the
    necessary bank statements down to the penny.

13.  Therefore, I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel  clearly  erred
    in law insofar as he did not apply the Immigration Rules correctly.  In
    particular, it was unclear in paragraphs 11  and  12  of  his  decision
    whether he understood that she did not have to have been   working  for
    six months because at paragraph 12 he goes on to consider the specified
    documents at the six months  point  which  was  after  the  application
    before the decision.   He  also  finds,  incorrectly  in  my  view,  at
    paragraph 13 of his determination that the letter I  have  referred  to
    above does not meet the requirements of  the  Rules.   He  also  finds,
    incorrectly in my view, at paragraph 14 that the bank statements do not
    correlate to the payslips.

14.  Therefore for  these  reasons  and  because  the  finding  was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules, I find there were errors of  law
    in the decision reached by First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel  which  was
    promulgated on 30 October 2015.

15.  There is no need for me to remit this appeal for a re-hearing.  I  keep
    the appeal in the  Upper  Tribunal  and  consider  the  merits  of  the
    Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  him
    leave to remain as a spouse.

16.  I have reviewed the evidence before me and for the reasons given  above
    when finding an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision;  I
    allow this appeal under the Immigration Rules. .




Notice of Decision

    1. I find errors of law in First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel's  decision
       and set it aside.
    2. I keep the appeal in the Upper Tribunal
    3.  I  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  by  the
       Respondent to refuse him leave under the Immigration Rules.
    4. It is not necessary to make an anonymity direction.
