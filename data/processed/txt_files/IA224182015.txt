                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Bangladesh, date  of  birth  5  May  1982,
    appealed against the Respondent's  decision,  dated  1  June  2015,  to
    refuse further leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 2 (General)  Migrant
    under the Immigration Rules.

IMMIGRATION HISTORY

2.   The Appellant entered the UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  being
    granted leave to enter on 30 December 2009.  Such leave  was  variously
    extended.  On 23 July 2013 he was granted leave to remain until 21  May
    2014 as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  The grant of leave was subject  to
    a condition restricting study to/at Access College London.

3.   He applied on 21 May 2014 to vary this leave with a CAS to  study  CIMA
    level 7 at the London College of Advanced  Management  (LCAM).   Whilst
    waiting for a decision on his  application  he  undertook  a  part-time
    course at the London School of Marketing (LSM) for which there  was  no
    CAS letter.  He did not apply  to  vary  from  LCAM  to  LSM.   At  LSM
    (between 26 May 2014 and 5 December  2014)  he  obtained  a  degree  of
    Master of Arts in marketing and  innovation  issued  by  Anglia  Ruskin
    University on 5 December 2014.

4.   He applied to vary ("switch") the Tier 4 application (of 21  May  2014)
    to Tier 2 (General) Migrant on 4 March 2015.  The 21 May 2014 (13  June
    2014 submission of documents) application was refused on 1 June 2015.

THE APPEAL STAGES

5.   The appeal before First-tier Tribunal Judge Shepherd was  dismissed  it
    on 17 January 2017.  Permission to appeal  was  refused  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pickup on 27 June 2017 and Upper Tribunal Judge Gill  on
    13 September 2017 but granted  by  the  Vice  President  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal C M G Ockelton on 19 December 2017.  On 16  February  2018  Mr
    Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer  for  the  Secretary  of  State,  the
    Appellant  in  person,  sought  to  raise  new  grounds   relating   to
    "switching" from the Tier 4 to Tier 2.

6.   My adjournment gave the parties time to make  written  representations.
    Mr Melvin's were dated 2 March 2018 and the Appellant's 22  March  2018
    and 30 July 2018.

7.   Mr Melvin relied on paragraphs  245HD  and  245ZY  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (the Rules) Period and conditions of grant.

8.   The Appellant relied on  paragraph  245ZY(c)(iv)(3)  of  the  Rules  to
    support his contention that his studies at LSM were supplementary study
    which was permissible.

9.   The "switching" issue was relied upon by the Respondent with  reference
    to the Immigration Act 1971 Section 3(1)(c)(ia) and  the  condition  on
    the grant of leave restricting his studies in the UK to Access College.

THE JUDGE'S DECISION

10.  The Respondent accepted the Judge erred in law because she  had  placed
    reliance on paragraph 245HD(d)(v)of the rules which did not  come  into
    being until 24 November 2016.  However, it was said the  error  of  law
    was not material.  The Judge found [D35] the application of 21 May 2014
    was made in time.

11.  The Judge accepted the Appellant had undertaken study between  May  and
    December 2014 whilst on 3C leave under the Immigration Act  1971.   The
    Judge found that the original CAS (2013) was only for  Access  College.
    Accordingly, the institution (LSM/Anglia Ruskin University) was not the
    one for which Tier 4 leave was last granted.  Paragraph 245HD(d)(iv) of
    the Rules  applied  and  the  Appellant  was  subject  to  a  condition
    preventing the May to December 2014 course of study at LSM.

12.  The March 2016 policy  guidance  on  "switching"  did  not  assist  the
    Appellant.

13.  I find that the "supplementary studies", as the Appellant  claims  them
    to be, were not permitted but rather a breach of the restriction of the
    23 July 2013 grant of Tier 4 leave. Thus, even though the  Judge  erred
    over the application of later Rules, the error makes no  difference  to
    the outcome because the appeal could not have succeeded.

14.  For the avoidance of doubt in Immigration Rules,  valid  from  2  March
    2015-16 March 2015, paragraph 245ZY applied to an application  made  at
    or after 4 March 2015 and set out the  conditions  on  which  leave  to
    remain  will  be  granted.   In  this  appeal  the  relevant  condition
    (restriction) was that of 23  July  2015  grant.   Thus,  even  if  the
    LSM/Anglia   Ruskin   University   degree   was   "supplementary",   as
    subjectively defined by the Appellant's, it was not with Access College
    and not otherwise permitted.

15.  The "switching" point was not the basis for the  Respondent's  decision
    of 1 June 2015 nor raised before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  and
    therefore no error of law.  However, were it necessary to  do  I  would
    have upheld the "switching" objection to the application  to  vary  the
    Tier 4 application.

16.  There was no unfairness or unlawfulness in  the  Respondent's  decision
    to impose the condition on  the  23  July  2013  grant  of  leave.   In
    reaching that conclusion  I  have  fully  considered  Naveed  (Student:
    Switching Institution: Requirements) [2014] UKUT 00516, and  EK  (Ivory
    Coast) [2014] EWCA Civ 1517.  There was no administrative error by  the
    college, nor  did  the  Respondent  have  any  responsibility  for  the
    Appellant's problem,  nor  did  the  Respondent's  conduct  create  the
    Appellant's problem. At its heart the Appellant has  misunderstood  the
    effect of the 23 July 2013 condition (restriction).

17.  The real effect of delay in determining the  21  May  2014  application
    has been to enable the Appellant to gain the material qualification  of
    his masters degree and the Appellant has remained lawfully in the UK to
    date.


NOTICE OF DECISION

18.  The Original Tribunal's decision stands. The appeal is dismissed
19.  No anonymity order made.
20.  The appeal has failed, therefore no fee award is appropriate.


Signed                                  Date 10 October 2018
