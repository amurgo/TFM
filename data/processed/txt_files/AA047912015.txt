                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Farrelly, promulgated on 2 December 2015, dismissing her appeal against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. The respondent's decision dated 4 March 2015 was based  in  part  on  a
    report from Verified AB, a Swedish company, dated 11 December 2014.  It
    was common ground between representatives that the report  follows  the
    same model of approach as reports by the company  Sprakab,  which  were
    the subject of M A B N and another v SSHD [2013] CSIH 68, SSHD v  MN  &
    KY [2014] UKSC 30.

 3. The report is signed off at page 9 after the following passage:

      The linguist named below is responsible  for  the  production  of  the
      final report, which includes analysis provided by  Verified's  trained
      analysts.

 4. The annexed qualifications of the linguist are these:

      Academic background

      The linguist holds a Master of Arts from the Department of Culture and
      Communication, received within the Graduate  School  in  Language  and
      Culture in Europe (University of Linkoping) (2013) and is scheduled to
      put forth her thesis for Master degree in General Linguistics  at  the
      University of Stockholm (2014).

      Courses of particular relevance in the context at hand  include  Field
      Linguistics and Linguistic Typology with a focus on  methodologies  of
      collection and interpretation of linguistic data.

      Professional experience

      The linguist has been employed with Verified since 2014.

      The linguist the linguist has previously worked with translation.

      Language skills

      Besides native skills in Farsi, the linguist has an excellent  command
      of English and a good command of Swedish.

 5. Annexed details of the two analysts show one to  be  a  first  language
    speaker of Kurmanji, from Syria, and the other to be a  first  language
    speaker of Bahdini, from Iraq.

 6. The report finds at 3.4 that  the  appellant  does  not  speak  Kurdish
    Kurmanji as spoken in the village of Syria  which  she  claims  as  her
    place of origin, and at 4.4  that  she  speaks  a  Bahdini  variety  of
    Kurmanji spoken in Iraq.

 7. The judge at �14 said that he gave "considerable weight" to the report,
    which made his task considerably  easier;  it  was  only  part  of  his
    assessment, which "may well have been the same on  general  credibility
    grounds", but was "a solid foundation upon which I base my conclusion".

 8. The submissions of Ms Loughran were based primarily on  M  A  B  N  and
    another at �18, which sets  out  a  note  of  reasons  issued  by  Lord
    Macphail in other proceedings.  The note in turn cites from  Guidelines
    by an international group of linguists:

      3. LANGUAGE ANALSIS MUST BE DONE BY QUALIFIED LINGUISTS

      Judgements  about  the  relationship  between  language  and  regional
      identity should be made only by qualified  linguists  with  recognized
      and up to date expertise, both in linguistics and in the  language  in
      question ...

      The sixth guideline reads in part:

      Linguists should  provide  specific  evidence  of  their  professional
      training and expertise ... so that a court may have the opportunity to
      assess these matters.

 9. The appellant's argument was that the report should have been found  to
    carry little weight because (a) the "linguist" was not shown to have  a
    qualification in the subject, and (b) she did not speak the language in
    question.

10. On point (a), Ms  Loughran  said  that  if  the  first  degree  of  the
    signatory of the report was  in  linguistics,  the  summary  could  and
    should have specified  "a  degree  in  linguistics".   Without  such  a
    statement, there was nothing to show that her Master  of  Arts  was  in
    linguistics.

11. The judge dealt with this submission at �11, saying:

      On the basis that linguistics is the  study  of  language  and  having
      regard to qualifications in my view the signatory is a  linguist.  She
      holds a Masters degree in  language  and  culture  in  Europe  and  is
      completing her Masters degree in general linguistics.

12. Mr Matthews submitted that the Judge was obviously right, and that  the
    linguist would only have been employed as such by Verified if  she  had
    the appropriate qualification.

13. On this issue, I consider that the  judge  made  no  error  of  law  by
    concluding from the evidence before him, for the reasons he gave,  that
    the linguist's qualifications were in that field.

14. Mr Matthews submitted that point (b) was resolved by the Supreme  Court
    in favour of the SSHD.

15. Ms Loughran argued that while the Supreme Court had not agreed with the
    Inner House that no weight could be given to  reports  of  the  present
    nature, it had not  gone  into  detail  on  this  issue,  and  had  not
    dissented from the analysis favoured by the Inner House, based  on  the
    Guidelines.  She said that the Judge fell into error by failing to deal
    with the submission that for this reason, the report deserved little or
    no weight.

16. Ms Loughran is correct to the extent that point (b)  was  mentioned  to
    the FtT, in particular in written submissions, and the  Judge  did  not
    deal with it.

17. Mr Matthews referred to the issues agreed in MN and KY at �21:


      i) Whether the immigration judges were entitled to attribute any
      weight to the Sprakab reports;
      ii) In what circumstances should witnesses providing evidence in such
      appeals be granted anonymity;
      iii) Whether there are any particular rules governing expert evidence
      tendered in the name of an organisation rather than an individual;
      iv) To what extent can such evidence be accepted in a form not
      prescribed by the Practice Directions;
      v) To what extent, and with what effect, can the Upper Tribunal give
      guidance as to the weight to be given to such reports, or the
      conclusions to be drawn from them.
18. He then went to the resolution of (i), (iii) and (iv) at �37:
      So here,  it  is  inappropriate  for  general  questions  relating  to
      Sprakab, its methodology and the presentation of its reports to be re-
      litigated  constantly  in  separate  FTT  hearings,  with   inevitable
      inconsistency of outcome. The Upper  Tribunal  were  right  in RB to
      address those issues. Subject to  appropriate  safeguards,  they  were
      entitled in my view to find no objection of principle to the admission
      of the Sprakab reports, whether because they were in the  name  of  an
      organisation rather than an individual, or in general for  failure  in
      other respects to comply with the practice directions. This discussion
      makes it unnecessary to consider in more  detail  issues  (i),  (iii),
      (iv); the short answer is that none of them points to  any  overriding
      objection to evidence in this form. ... As  Lord  Eassie  said,  in  a
      passage to which Mr Lindsay took no objection:
           "... in the end  one  naturally  has  to  consider  whether,  in
           substance, the tribunal in question has  been  provided  in  the
           case before it with expert evidence which the  tribunal  can  be
           satisfied is based  upon  an  appropriate  and  adequate  expert
           knowledge, given with the neutrality  required  of  the  expert,
           unencumbered by views falling outwith his field of expertise."

19. I note also �51 (ii) (a):
      As to language, the findings (on evidence) in RB are ... sufficient to
      demonstrate acceptable expertise and method,  which  can  properly  be
      accepted unless the evidence in a particular case shows otherwise.

20. I accept that MN and KY did not relax  the  usual  rules  about  expert
    evidence, and that credentials and expertise  must  be  scrutinised  in
    each case.  However, the methodology of Sprakab was generally  approved
    by the Supreme Court.  That methodology  was  the  use  of  two  native
    speaker analysts, overseen by a linguist, not necessarily qualified  in
    the language being examined - the same approach as in the present case.

21. There is no rule to  be  deduced  from  the  Guidelines  and  from  the
    decision of the Inner House to the effect that since MN and KY a report
    based on supervision by a linguist of two native speaker analysts is to
    be given little weight.

22. Error on point (b), if any, makes no difference, and so does  not  lead
    to the decision being set aside.

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

24. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
