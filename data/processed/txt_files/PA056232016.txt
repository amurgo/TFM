                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 28 February 2017.

 2. It is common ground that the  Judge  erred  in  law  by  purporting  to
    dismiss appeals by family members which  were  not  before  him.   That
    point is resolved at �15 below.

 3. There are 2 grounds of appeal:

         '1.  The judge erred by failing to refer to the  email  letter  and
         attachment by the appellant's brother dated 20 December  2016  (pp.
         12 - 14 appellant's inventory, pp.12 - 14 of written submission for
         the appellant.  The letter corroborates the appellant's statement.

         2.  The judge has not exercised  anxious  scrutiny  in  considering
         article 8 of the ECHR.  The oldest child of the appellant was  born
         in the UK and has spent about 6.5 years in the UK.   The  appellant
         and his family speak fluent English.  The appellant  and  his  wife
         have good education background.  Majority time ... in the  UK  they
         either have valid leave or an outstanding asylum claim.  They cause
         no harm to the  public.   It  is  disproportionate  to  remove  the
         appellant.'

 4. Having considered the grounds and  submissions  thereon,  I  find  that
    neither ground discloses error on a point of law.

 5. The email says:

         "... I wanna inform you that the situation in Libya has gone  worse
         than before, our family is in danger and they killed  our  brother,
         our sister was shot in the leg and ... is still in the hospital ...
         don't try to Libya and find a way to stay in your place."

 6. The judge said this at �34, relating to the cross-examination:

         "The appellant said that El Mehdi [his brother] has refugee  status
         in Canada ... It was pointed out that there  was  no  statement  or
         letter from El Mehdi explaining why he  had  been  granted  refugee
         status ...  The appellant was asked why his brother in Canada could
         not have provided a statement and ... said that  he  did  not  know
         that was required."

 7. And at �52, in explaining his conclusions:

         "... it is surprising there is not  a  statement  from  the  Canada
         based brother explaining why he was granted refugee status and what
         the role was of the militia."

 8. It was submitted that the  email  was  not  "properly  assessed".  That
    complaint is revealing in its vagueness.

 9. I find it clear that the  judge  was  aware  of  the  materials,  which
    included a copy  of  the  grant  of  status  and  the  email  from  the
    appellant's brother, but not a statement or a letter of  any  substance
    in relation to why the appellants' brother  had  been  granted  refugee
    status, or in relation to any support he could offer to the appellant's
    claims.  No significant point of corroboration was elucidated from  the
    email.

10. The judge at �52 was not overlooking the material from the  appellant's
    brother, but pointing out the paucity of support it gives to his case.

11. Mr Winter said that �56 of the decision, on article 8, was accurate  as
    far as it went, but failed to consider all relevant facts regarding the
    child's welfare, as required by the case law, and did not deal with the
    situation facing the child on return, set out in background  materials.
    Mr Matthews submitted that a case based on conditions in Libya was  not
    taken in the submissions in the FtT or in the ground of appeal  to  the
    UT.  In any event, he said that the highly experienced judge would have
    in mind the well-known background situation.  Mr Winter  answered  that
    the ground was broad enough  to  permit  the  argument;  every  feature
    favourable to  the  case  based  around  the  child  should  have  been
    considered; the country materials were referred to in  submissions  for
    the appellant, although not in context of the  child's  best  interests
    and article 8; alternatively, a further ground should be permitted,  or
    was obvious, having strong prospects of success.

12. Ground 2 is only reassertion of the  case  and  disagreement  with  the
    proportionality assessment.  It formulates no proposition of error on a
    point of law.

13. The situation to be considered was of the child returning as  a  member
    of the family, as the judge did.

14. No underlying case in respect of country conditions has been  disclosed
    of such strength as to attribute error  to  the  judge  by  overlooking
    materials and failing to perceive the obvious.

15. In respect of tribunal references PA/05615, 05610, 05629  &  05632/2016
    relating to the appellant's wife and children, those cases were subject
    to notices of no valid appeal issued on 6 June 2016 and were not before
    Judge Clapham for decision.  In so far as  his  decision  purported  to
    dismiss those appeals, it erred in law and is set aside.

16. In respect of the appellant's case under reference  PA/05623/2016,  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

17. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
