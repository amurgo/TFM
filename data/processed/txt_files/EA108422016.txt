Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Karim S Karim, instructed by Chris Alexander
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr David Clarke, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 26 March 2016 to refuse to issue  him  a  permanent  residence  card
    under Regulation 15 with reference to Regulation 10 (5)  and  10(6)  of
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 based on retained
    rights as the former spouse of an EEA citizen.  The sponsor, from  whom
    the appellant is now divorced, is an Austrian citizen.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria,  born  in  Lagos  in  1988,  who
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006 (he does  not  say
    on what basis) and remained here since then.    In  2008,  he  met  his
    former wife in London; by 2009 they were cohabiting and had decided  to
    marry, and on 5 June 2010, they  married  at  Waltham  Forest  Registry
    Office.

 3. The appellant's evidence was that from 1 May 1999 until 30 August 2012,
    the sponsor was a student.  No corroborative evidence of the  sponsor's
    study is produced. On  22  July  2011,  the  appellant  applied  for  a
    residence card, which was  issued  11  October  2011,  and  would  have
    expired on 11 October 2016 if the marriage had not  failed.  From  2013
    onwards, the appellant was registered for  employment  with  the  Delta
    Nursing Agency.   He  worked  when  called  upon  to  do  so,  but  his
    employment  was  not  continuous,  consisting  as  it  did  of   agency
    placements.

 4. The sponsor began to work and therefore to exercise Treaty rights on 18
    April 2011. Her exercise of Treaty rights from 18 April 2011 through to
    at least November 2015 is not disputed by the  respondent.  The  5-year
    period for which the appellant needs to show  that  he  was  exercising
    Treaty rights runs from 18 April 2011 to 18 April 2016.

 5. Meanwhile, unhappy differences had caused the appellant's  marriage  to
    fail. The parting  was  acrimonious,  with  the  sponsor  ejecting  the
    appellant from the matrimonial home but refusing to give him any of his
    personal  belongings,  including  important  documents,  such  as   his
    Nigerian passport.  In  September  2015,  the  appellant  reported  his
    missing passport to the police, who contacted his  estranged  wife  and
    she said that she had posted his documents to his new address.

 6. A divorce petition was issued in  May  2015  (the  Baigazieva  date  of
    termination of the marriage), and from  that  date  on,  the  appellant
    needed to show that he was exercising Treaty rights in his  own  right.
    Delta Nursing Agency confirmed that he  was  on  their  books  from  18
    January 2015 to 14 October 2015.

 7. There was no  evidence  of  employment  between  14  October  2015  and
    February 2016, when the appellant got a new job. He registered  with  a
    new agency and his first placement was on 13 February 2016,  his  first
    payslip on 24 February 2016.

 8. On 11 February 2016, the appellant  applied  for  permanent  residence,
    asserting  a   retained  right  of  residence  following  his  divorce,
    pursuant to Regulation 10(5) and 10(6) of the 2006 Regulations.

Refusal letter

 9. On 26 August 2016, the respondent refused  to  grant  the  appellant  a
    permanent right of residence as  requested.   The  respondent  accepted
    that the requirements to reside in the United Kingdom for at least  one
    year of the marriage, and to have been  married  for  more  than  three
    years, were met for both the appellant and sponsor.

10. The respondent had contacted the care home where  the  sponsor  worked,
    and her employer, Asprey House Care Home, had confirmed  that  she  was
    employed there from 1 April  2011  and  continuing  beyond  the  decree
    absolute of divorce on 9  November  2015.   There  was  no  documentary
    evidence of employment or exercise of  Treaty  rights  by  the  sponsor
    before April 2011.  The respondent refused the permanent residence card
    because he was not satisfied that since the  date  of  commencement  of
    divorce proceedings (May 2015) the appellant had been exercising Treaty
    rights continuously as a worker, as though he were an EEA national.

11. The refusal letter also dealt with  Article  8  ECHR,  noting  that  no
    Article 8 claim had yet been made and that  it  remained  open  to  the
    appellant to make such a claim on the appropriate form,  as  a  charged
    application.  The appellant's travel  document  was  retained  and  his
    application failed.

12. The appellant exercised his in-country right of appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

13. The First-tier Judge set out at [18] areas of  concerns  regarding  the
    copy payslips submitted  evidencing  the  appellant's  employment  with
    Extra Pay Limited.  The judge was troubled  that  every  single  weekly
    payslip showed a holiday  advance;  that  there  were  both  minor  and
    serious arithmetical errors on at least five payslips, including as  to
    the total net pay; and that incorrect week numbers appeared on some  of
    them.  The Judge also expressed concern regarding  the  sponsor's  Form
    P60, which was a photocopy, with no witness statement evidencing how it
    had been obtained.  Unfortunately, none of  these  errors  were  raised
    with the appellant or his representative at the hearing.

14. The First-tier Judge applied  Tanveer  Ahmed  and  concluded  that  the
    payslips and form  P60  were  unreliable  evidence,  that  he  was  not
    satisfied as to the sponsor's claimed employment, and  found  that  the
    requirements of Regulation 10(6)  were  not  met.    He  dismissed  the
    appeal.

Grounds of appeal

15. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal arguing  that  the  First-
    tier Judge erred by:

      1) Not making any, or any adequate credibility findings regarding  the
         appellant's  oral  evidence,  although  it  was  recorded  in   the
         decision;

      2) Incorrectly identifying the 5-year period for permanent  residence,
         which Mr Karim argued should be  calculated  between  the  date  of
         marriage on 5 June 2010 and 5 June 2015.  The  decree  absolute  of
         divorce had been pronounced on 9 November 2015;

      3) Failing to have  regard  to  the  respondent's  concession  in  the
         refusal letter and at the hearing, that the sponsor was  exercising
         Treaty rights in the United Kingdom from 18 April 2011  up  to  and
         including the date of divorce (9 November 2015);

      4) Failing to draw to the appellant's attention any  concerns  he  had
         about the documents produced being photocopies, nor giving him  any
         opportunity to comment on the First-tier Judge's concerns  relating
         to his payslips, as set out at  [18]  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         decision.

16. Mr Karim contended that, applying MM (unfairness: E & R)  Sudan  [2014]
    UKUT 00105 (IAC) such procedural impropriety was  sufficiently  serious
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  must  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

17. In addition, the  appellant  produced  letters  from  his  current  and
    previous employers which were not before the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    which he argued showed that  he  is  and  was  at  all  material  times
    employed and thus a qualified person under Regulations 10(5) and (6) of
    the 2006 Regulations.

18. Mr Karim relied on Ladd v Marshall and E & R v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49, but the grounds  of  appeal  do
    not explain why those decisions are relevant.

Permission to appeal

19. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Judge  Miller  on  31
    January 2018.  He considered it arguable that  the  concerns  regarding
    the appellant's payslips should have been put to him  at  the  hearing,
    and that there might be an explanation for the matters  which  troubled
    the First-tier  Judge.   Judge  Miller  also  considered  that  it  was
    arguably wrong for the Judge to  have  gone  behind  the  Secretary  of
    State's concession that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights in the
    United Kingdom.

20. At a hearing on 7 November 2018, Mr  Jarvis,  the  Senior  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer appearing, conceded that there had been a procedural
    error by the First-tier Judge in failing to put to the appellant issues
    concerning his payslips and/or to determine whether the  appellant  had
    accrued five years' respondent. Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  set  aside
    the decision for remaking in the Upper Tribunal.

21. On 1 February 2019, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  made  a  transfer
    order, deciding that it was not practicable for  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Coker to complete the remaking of the  appeal  decision  without  undue
    delay.  That is the basis on which  this  appeal  came  before  me  for
    remaking.

Upper Tribunal hearing

22. I take into account the brief record of the appellant's  oral  evidence
    in the First-tier Tribunal at [12]-[15]:

         "12. In  his  evidence  before  me,  the  appellant  confirmed  his
         personal details and the content of his statement.

         13.  He said the he stopped  work  in  October  2015,  because  his
         exwife was causing him problems.  "My boss told me to rest at home.
          After a few months, I went through the divorce.  I got  a  job  in
         February 2016".

         14.  How did he obtain his ex-wife's  P60?  -  "After  getting  the
         refusal letter, I spoke to a friend of my ex-wife.  I said I  would
         need the P60 from her.  Luckily she  [the  friend]  spoke  to  [the
         sponsor] and got the P60.  The friend could not come today".

         15.  In cross-examination, he  said  that  he  could  not  get  the
         original document but only a photocopy.  Before being  employed  by
         the Delta Nursing Agency, he was working with an energy company for
         6-7 months.  He is still with Acerta24 Agency, for whom he  started
         work in February 2016."

    There was no updated statement for the Upper Tribunal hearing.

23. The appellant adopted his First-tier Tribunal witness statement dated 5
    December 2017.  In that statement, he says he was born in Lagos Nigeria
    in March 1988 and is a Nigerian citizen.   He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2006 and has remained here ever since.   The  appellant  met
    his former wife in London in August 2008 and they became engaged to  be
    married in 2009, after courting and cohabiting for some time.  There is
    still no witness statement from the appellant's former wife,  nor  from
    the friend who obtained the form P60 from her.

24. The appellant gave supplementary evidence regarding the  break  in  his
    employment between  October  2015  and  February  2016.  There  was  no
    evidence from the Job Centre or any agency to indicate that during that
    period of almost 4 months, he was registered for employment or actively
    seeking work.  The appellant said that he had been looking  for  a  job
    but that was made more difficult as his former partner had his passport
    and would not return it.  The appellant had reported the  loss  of  his
    passport to the police.

25. He said he spent that time not resting, as in his oral evidence to  the
    First-tier Tribunal, but training to barber hair.   He  was  not  on  a
    barber training course or apprenticeship: he  learned  by  shadowing  a
    barber in the area, who was training him without payment.  There was no
    corroboration of this alleged training from the  barber  with  whom  he
    said he had trained, and the appellant gave no name for the barber.

26. In cross-examination, Mr Clarke asked whether  during  the  appellant's
    barber  training,  he  had  comprehensive  sickness  insurance  or  was
    registered as a job seeker.  The appellant replied in the  negative  to
    both questions.

27. The appellant explained that  he  had  stopped  working  at  the  Delta
    Nursing Agency because of the difficulty he was having  with  his  then
    wife, the  EEA  sponsor.   He  worked  in  a  hospital,  looking  after
    patients, but he had such problems at home with  the  sponsor  that  he
    could not continue with that work and had to  leave,  even  though  the
    appellant and the sponsor did not work at the same hospital.

28. The agency he was registered with said that  they  needed  to  see  the
    appellant's passport, but it was missing.   Later,  his  former  spouse
    admitted she had taken it and the police gave the  appellant  a  letter
    which he could use instead of his passport.

29. The appellant asserted that he could not  get  a  replacement  passport
    from the Nigerian Embassy without being lawfully in the United  Kingdom
    with a visa. There was no evidence from the Embassy to say that  travel
    documents were only issued to Nigerian citizens  who  could  show  that
    they were lawfully in the United Kingdom.

30. In answer to questions from me, the appellant said that his  wife  took
    his passport in early January or in February 2014 but the problems  its
    absence caused went on through to 2015.   He  never  recovered  it:  he
    reported its absence to the police on the 4 September 2014,  but  found
    out what had happened in  June  or  July  2015  when  his  former  wife
    admitted taking it, in her divorce statement.

31. During 2014, the appellant had worked on some  training  placements  in
    care homes, for which he got certificates (not produced) and he thought
    he had some bank statements from May 2015 at home which he had not  yet
    produced.  It was not possible to go straight into working  in  a  care
    home: you had to do training shifts and have immunisations.  He was not
    able to begin work until 2015, mainly because he could not get most  of
    his documents, which were with his former wife, who continued  to  give
    him problems even after the marriage  ended.   He  had  to  change  his
    telephone  number  and  was  prevented  from  working,  partly  by  the
    documentary difficulties and partly by being distracted by his domestic
    problems.

32. There was no re-examination.

Appellant's submissions

33.  For the appellant, Mr Karim acknowledged that there were  insufficient
    payslips and that there was a gap in the appellant's employment between
    October 2015 and February 2016.  The  evidence  about  the  appellant's
    Delta Nursing work was that he had only worked when called upon but was
    available for  work,  and  therefore  'a  worker'  from  February  2014
    continuously  until  October  2015.  The  appellant  had  given  candid
    evidence which should be treated as credible.

34. If the appellant had not made out his case on permanent  residence,  Mr
    Karim argued that he should be  allowed  to  vary  his  application  to
    Article 8 ECHR, which was not, in context, a 'new matter' requiring the
    consent of the respondent.

Respondent's submissions

35. For the respondent, Mr Clarke observed that the appellant's application
    had been for a permanent residence card based on a  retained  right  of
    residence as set out in Regulation 10(5) of the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006. Article 8 ECHR was  not  engaged:  the
    respondent had not served a section 120 notice and the application  and
    decision letter both related to permanent residence.   The  grounds  of
    appeal also related only to the  EEA  Regulations  and  the  respondent
    would not give his consent to the variation of the  appeal  grounds  at
    this late stage. It remained open to  the  appellant  to  make  a  paid
    Article 8 ECHR claim if he were so advised.

36. The appellant's explanation for his not working  between  October  2015
    and February 2016 was unsatisfactory.  He was not, therefore,  able  to
    show that he had been exercising Treaty rights continuously  since  the
    beginning of the divorce proceedings in May 2015.  The appellant  could
    have obtained evidence from either his former employers or HMRC  if  it
    existed.  The appellant could not show  that  he  was  analogous  to  a
    worker in that period and therefore could not meet the requirements for
    permanent residence and the appeal should be dismissed.

37. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

EEA Regulations 2006

38. The appellant is seeking a permanent right of residence  under  Article
    15(1)(f) of the 2006 Regulations:

         "15. -   (1)  The following persons  shall  acquire  the  right  to
             reside in the United Kingdom permanently- ...

                  (f)  a person who-

                      (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
                      with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
                      five years; and

                      (ii) was, at the end of that period, a family  member
                      who has retained the right of residence."

39. On the evidence before me, I find that the appellant has not discharged
    the burden of showing, to the ordinary civil  standard  of  balance  of
    probabilities, that he resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with
    the Regulations for any relevant 5-year period.   Although  he  married
    his wife in 2010, she did not begin to work until 18 April  2011.   The
    respondent accepted in the  refusal  letter  that  the  sponsor  was  a
    qualified person from 18 April 2011 and that she remained so  until  at
    least 9  November  2015,  when  the  decree  absolute  of  divorce  was
    pronounced.

40. I apply the guidance given at [3] in the judgment of Lord Justice Singh
    in Baigazieva v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 1088, that this appellant cannot rely on the sponsor's status as  a
    qualified person after the divorce proceedings were issued in May 2015.



41. Thereafter, he must prove that he is a family member who  has  retained
    the right of residence, for the rest of the period of 5 years (so until
    April 2016) and remained so at that date.

42. The EEA Regulations 2006 at Regulation 10(5) and 10(6) set out what  is
    required in order  for  a  non-EEA  citizen  to  retain  the  right  of
    residence following divorce, as follows:

         "10. (1) In these Regulations, "family member who has retained  the
             right of residence" means, ...  a  person  who  satisfies  the
             conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5). ...

             (5)  A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-

                  (a)  he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person
                  on the termination of the marriage or civil partnership of
                  the qualified person;

                  (b)  he was residing in the United Kingdom  in  accordance
                  with these Regulations at the date of the termination;

                  (c)  he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

                  (d)  ...

                      (i)  prior to the initiation of the  proceedings  for
                      the  termination  of  the  marriage  or   the   civil
                      partnership the marriage  or  civil  partnership  had
                      lasted for at least three years and  the  parties  to
                      the marriage or civil partnership had resided in  the
                      United Kingdom for  at  least  one  year  during  its
                      duration; ...

             (6)      The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

                  is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA
                  national, be a worker, a self-employed person or a self-
                  sufficient person under regulation 6; ...."

43. There is no difficulty about the conditions  in  Regulations  10(5)(a),
    10(5)(b), or 10 (5)(d).  The issue in this appeal is  confined  to  the
    operation of Regulations 10(5)(c)(i) and 10(6).  I note  that  although
    Regulation 4 of the 2006  Regulations  defines  'worker'  as  a  worker
    within the meaning  of  Article  39  of  the  Treaty  establishing  the
    European Community, and  also  provides  definitions  of  self-employed
    person, self-sufficient  person,  and  'student',  sub-paragraph  10(6)
    applies only to  workers,  self-employed  persons  and  self-sufficient
    persons, with no mention of 'students'.  I therefore spend no  time  on
    the claimed barber training, which  cannot  assist  this  appellant  in
    showing that he meets Regulation 10(6).

44. I have considered  whether  the  appellant  can  show  that  he  was  a
    qualified person (in context, a worker as defined by  the  Regulations)
    from May 2015, when the divorce proceedings began, until 18 April 2016,
    the fifth anniversary of the date when the sponsor began  to  work  and
    from which she is accepted to have been a qualified person.  I  do  not
    propose to investigate the validity or reliability of the  payslips  in
    evidence before the Upper Tribunal today.

45. Taken on its face value, the evidence of the Delta Nursing payslips  is
    that the applicant worked 5 shifts in week commencing 19 June  2015,  3
    shifts in week commencing 26 June 2015, 3 shifts on 17 July 2015, after
    which there is a 6-week gap.  The appellant's evidence was that he  did
    not register with the Job Centre when not working.

46. Absent evidence to the contrary, I approach this appeal  on  the  basis
    that there was a first gap in employment between 15 June 2015  and  the
    beginning of September 2015.  The copy payslips then indicate that  the
    appellant resumed work in September 2014, working  one  shift  in  week
    commencing  4  September  2015,  four  shifts  in  week  commencing  14
    September 2015, two shifts in week commencing 25 September 2015,  three
    in week commencing 2 October 2015 and one shift each in week commencing
    16 and 23 October 2015.

47. There is no payslip evidence  after  that,  and  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence is consistent in his witness statement and his  oral  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.   He  says  that
    (apart from his barbering) he did not  work  from  October  2015  until
    February 2016.

48. This appellant cannot,  therefore,  discharge  the  burden  on  him  of
    showing that it is more likely than not  that  he  completed  a  5-year
    period for a permanent right of residence by working in his  own  right
    between May 2015 and 18 April 2018, nor that he was  in  employment  at
    the end of that period.  On the contrary, I find that the appellant was
    not in the United Kingdom in accordance with  the  Regulations  in  the
    latter half of June 2015, all of August  2015,  November  and  December
    2015 and January 2015.

49. The appellant cannot, therefore, show that he has lived in  the  United
    Kingdom for 5 years 'in accordance with the Regulations' and he is  not
    entitled to a residence card evidencing a permanent right of residence.

50. If the appellant has an Article 8 ECHR claim, it is open to him to make
    a paid human rights application, but the present appeal cannot  succeed
    and is dismissed.

DECISION

51. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the appeal. .
