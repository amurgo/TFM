Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)    Appeal Number: EA/10840/2016

At Field House
                On 8th March 2018

                               Thami En Naeme

                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By way of a decision sent on 17 January 2018, permission to appeal  was
    granted in the following terms:

         "1.  In the light of  Khan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the First-tier Tribunal was  wrong
         in law to conclude that it did not have jurisdiction  to  hear  the
         appeal.


         2. The Tribunal is minded to find an error of law,  set  aside  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the case to the First-
         tier Tribunal.


         3. A party who is opposed to this course is directed to inform  the
         Tribunal in writing (giving reasons), not later than 7 working days
         from the  date  this  decision  is  sent  by  the  Upper  Tribunal.
         Following that period, the Upper Tribunal will issue its decision."

 2. The Respondent failed to respond to the Tribunal's invitation. By way
    of a letter of 6 March the appellant indicated agreement with the
    Tribunal's proposed course.


 3. Consequently, for the reasons identified above, I set aside the
    decision of the FtT and remit the appeal back to the FtT to consider
    afresh. The hearing listed for 20 March 2018 is accordingly vacated.




Signed:



Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor                    7/3/18
