Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs Eileen Bora - the Sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in these  proceedings  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ("ECO").  However, for convenience I refer to the parties as they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of Turkey, born on 20  November  1959.
    The proceedings arise out of his application on 19 September  2012  for
    entry clearance as a partner.  In order to put matters into context, it
    is necessary to say something  about  the  factual  background  to  the
    application and the personal circumstances of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor, Mrs Eileen Bora.

 3. The appellant and the sponsor, who is a  British  citizen,  married  in
    Turkey in 2003.  They lived in Turkey until 2007 when the appellant was
    granted entry clearance as a spouse.  They lived  together  in  the  UK
    until 2009 when they returned  to  Turkey.   On  14  October  2011  the
    appellant was subjected to a serious physical  attack  which  left  him
    with significant mental and physical disabilities.  It seems  that  the
    attacker was sentenced  to  a  term  of  ten  years'  imprisonment  for
    attempted murder.

 4. The application for entry clearance which is the subject matter of this
    appeal was made on 19 September 2012.  It was  refused  in  a  decision
    dated 8 November 2012.  In summary, the basis of the refusal  was  that
    the appellant was not able to meet the financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules as  set  out  in  Section  E-ECP.3.1  and  offers  of
    financial support from third parties could not be taken into account.

 5. The appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Foulkes-Jones  who
    considered  the  appeal  without  a  hearing.    In   a   determination
    promulgated on 11 September 2013 he  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules but allowed it on human rights grounds with reference
    to Article 8 of the ECHR.

 6. An out of time application was made by the respondent for permission to
    appeal against the decision of Judge Foulkes-Jones.  The basis  of  the
    application was that the appellant had been convicted of murder in 1986
    in relation to events in 1984.  That conviction was  not  disclosed  on
    the application form for entry clearance.   It  is  worth  stating,  in
    passing, that it is the sponsor's case  that  the  respondent,  or  the
    Secretary of State, was aware of  the  appellant's  conviction  in  the
    autumn of 2012 but did nothing with that information at the  time.   In
    relation to the non-disclosure of the conviction, the sponsor's case is
    that she was given "off the record" advice by the British Consulate  in
    Turkey to the effect that the UK authorities would not have been  aware
    of the conviction unless  the  appellant  himself  disclosed  it.   The
    sponsor, whilst acknowledging that she had been told by  the  appellant
    that he had a conviction for murder, was not told by the appellant what
    the actual details were.  Nevertheless, for several  reasons  she  does
    not believe that he was actually guilty of the offence.

 7. Returning to the history  of  the  appeal  proceedings,  permission  to
    appeal the decision of Judge Foulkes-Jones  having  been  granted,  the
    appeal came  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Hanson  and  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Lindsley in the Upper Tribunal on 10 January  2014.   By
    consent, the decision of Judge Foulkes-Jones  was  set  aside,  he  not
    having been aware of the conviction.  The appeal was  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

 8. That hearing was before Judge Lindsley sitting as a Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal. She allowed the appeal under Article 8.

 9. Permission to appeal against her decision was granted  and  the  matter
    next came before Upper Tribunal Judge Roberts on  22  July  2014.   She
    concluded that Judge Lindlsey's decision was vitiated by error of  law.
    She set aside her decision and re-made  the  decision,  dismissing  the
    appeal.

10. An application was made on behalf of the appellant  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Court of Appeal,  in  respect  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Roberts' decision.  The matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman
    who, on 14 October 2014, pursuant to rule 43 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, set aside  that  part  of  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Roberts' decision in terms of  the  re-making  of  the  decision.
    That part of Upper Tribunal Judge Roberts' decision in terms  of  there
    having been an error of law in the decision of Judge Lindsley, was  not
    set aside by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman.

11. In consequence of the decision having been set aside under rule 43  the
    appeal came before me for the re-making of the decision.

Upper Tribunal hearing 31 October 2014 - preliminary matters

12. Without making a definitive finding on the point, it does  appear  that
    there was some confusion as to the listing of the appeal before me,  in
    that Ms Kenny indicated that the notice of hearing was not sent to  the
    respondent by the Upper Tribunal in a timely manner. Ms Kenny said that
    she had learned that no one  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  had  been
    instructed to attend the hearing which was listed for the afternoon and
    that she had been provided with the papers for the appeal about an hour
    or so before the hearing.  She stated that in fact  she  had  only  had
    about ten minutes to consider the documents.  She said that preparation
    time would take about an hour or an hour and a half which  would  bring
    the time to about 4.00 p.m. In those circumstances,  she  requested  an
    adjournment.

13. The sponsor said that she had to return  to  Turkey  (to  be  with  the
    appellant) on Tuesday 4 November.  The hearing before me was on  Friday
    31 October.  The sponsor said that she was prepared for the hearing  to
    proceed, adding that she had been "messed around" by the Home Office in
    the past.  She said that leaving her husband at all is  very  traumatic
    for him.

14. I made enquiries to see whether there would be  a  court  available  to
    deal with the appeal on Monday 3 November, but no  court  was  in  fact
    available.

15. Ms Kenny repeated that there was further  preparation  that  she  would
    ideally have liked to have undertaken in order to conduct the appeal on
    behalf of the respondent. She did, however, state that she had  grasped
    the gist of the issues in the appeal.

16. Whilst, in other circumstances, it may well be  that  the  respondent's
    application for an  adjournment  would  have  been  successful,  I  was
    mindful of the position of the sponsor, specifically with reference  to
    her husband, the appellant, and the fact  that  she  was  returning  to
    Turkey on Tuesday.  To adjourn the appeal would have meant some further
    significant delay, and indeed expense on the part of the  sponsor.   It
    would also mean that she would have to leave  him  again  in  order  to
    attend a hearing before the Upper Tribunal.

17. Having regard to the overriding objective in rule  2  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, I decided that the interests  of
    justice were best served by proceeding with the appeal.

18. Mrs Bora was accompanied by Mr Roger Sayers,  described  at  one  stage
    within the documents before me as a McKenzie friend.  I indicated  that
    I would allow him to assist the sponsor as necessary but in truth,  the
    sponsor did not seek any assistance from Mr Sayers, she being  able  to
    make  submissions  and  deal  with  points  raised  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent as well as to clarify issues raised by me.

19. Because the appellant was  not  legally  represented,  the  proceedings
    before me took the form of my hearing  submissions  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent, as well as submissions by the sponsor, although  inevitably
    some of what the sponsor had  to  say  in  fact  constituted  evidence.
    There did come a distinct time in the proceedings when the sponsor  was
    cross-examined on behalf of the respondent.  Whilst  on  one  view,  in
    terms of the re-making of the decision, it could have  been  said  that
    there was no need  for  any  further  evidence,  I  concluded  that  in
    fairness to the appellant it would be appropriate for  all  aspects  of
    the  factual  issues  to  be  canvassed  before  me.   In  addition,  I
    considered that it was necessary for  the  respondent  to  be  able  to
    explore in more detail some of the matters in issue.

20. In the light of the way matters proceeded, the  next  subheading  is  a
    compendium of the submissions and evidence before me.

Submissions/oral evidence

21. Ms Kenny relied on the grounds of appeal in relation to the decision of
    Judge Lindsley.  The appellant had not  disclosed  on  the  application
    form the convictions for  murder  and  the  subsequent  conviction  for
    rioting whilst in prison.   It  was  submitted  that  Judge  Lindsley's
    determination does not give sufficient  weight  to  those  convictions.
    Furthermore, notwithstanding what is  said  about  the  care  that  the
    appellant needs, it is not clear who cares for him whilst  the  sponsor
    is not there.  She had plainly been able to leave  the  country.    The
    appellant lives with his brother and sister-in-law.

22. The appellant and the sponsor had chosen to live in Turkey and had been
    living  there for about four years so it was hard to imagine  that  the
    sponsor had not formed some sort of  private  life  during  that  time.
    Judge Lindsley had been correct in her assessment  that  the  sponsor's
    relationships with family in the UK do not amount to more  than  normal
    emotional ties between such family members.  The sponsor has a wish  to
    live in the UK but it is not necessary for her to do so.

23. Insofar as the sponsor refers to problems with  someone  in  the  local
    police force, that is a local  issue  and  she  could  live  elsewhere.
    There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor coming to the UK was anything more than a desire rather than  a
    need.

24. The sponsor referred me  to  the  fact  that  Judge  Foulkes-Jones  had
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 and there was no challenge  to  that
    decision for about nine weeks.  It was nine weeks later  that  the  BBC
    broke the news of the appellant's convictions. It was  only  then  that
    there was a challenge by the Home Office.

25. The sponsor referred to Judge Lindsley's determination  and  the  cases
    that she had referred to.  This was not a case of a "wish" to  live  in
    the UK.  Those were Judge Lindsley's words, not hers.

26. The sponsor said that she was aged 69 and is  on  various  medications.
    She has high cholesterol, joint pain and thyroid problems.  She is  not
    a well person herself.  She needs to look after the appellant 24  hours
    a day, seven days a week.  She has to look after him  in  every  sense.
    Since the attack on her husband her life has been absolute hell. Within
    the  Home  Office's  own  Rules,  in  some  circumstances   convictions
    resulting in sentences of over four years' imprisonment can  be  looked
    at sympathetically.

27. It is not a case of a wish to live in the UK but a need  to,  in  order
    for her quality of life. It is a misconception to  think  that  Turkish
    families stick together.  On the two occasions when she had to come  to
    Tribunal hearings in January and March 2014, her son came to Turkey  on
    one plane and she went out on another.  He stayed for a week in  Turkey
    in January and a week in March, looking after her husband.

28. In July, in relation to the hearing before Judge Roberts, she was  able
    to persuade two of her husband's sisters to come  up  from  Alanya  and
    Anatalia, 800 Km away.  It took two of them to look after him.

29. She lives with the appellant's older  brother  and  his  sister-in-law.
    She owns half of the house.  Her husband's brother works all night  and
    sleeps during the day. His wife works all day and is out most evenings.
     In 18 months she had not seen the appellant's sister-in-law  give  him
    so much as a glass of water.

30. On this occasion, she was so stressed that her son asked  her  to  come
    over and have some time with them.  She did not know that she would  be
    given this opportunity to plead her case again.  She had  had  to  come
    back to deal with matters in the  event  that  the  decision  of  Judge
    Roberts stood.  There were issues to be dealt with in relation  to  the
    house in the UK for which she had to come back.

31. On this occasion, she had to pay someone �400 for  a  period  of  three
    weeks to look after the appellant, as his  sisters  could  not  do  so.
    That is a lot of money and  above  the  going  rate  in  Turkey.   That
    answers the point as to who looks after him when she is in the UK.

32. They had already moved away from the  place  in  which  they  had  been
    fearful.  They moved two years ago, shortly after the first refusal  of
    the application.  To move to another part of Turkey would involve  rent
    and expenses.  She is not able to sell the house at the moment and  her
    husband needs somewhere stable in which to live.   In any event, moving
    would not solve  the  isolation  that  they  feel  and  the  day-to-day
    difficulties.  Her brother-in-law does want to sell  the  property  but
    �50,000 would be all that they would get for  it.   Her  brother-in-law
    owns half of the property.  It would be sold in a flash if  they  could
    come back to England.  It is an old property which was built before the
    earthquake in 1999 and it is subject to possible property damage.

33. She has six grandchildren and two sons, extended  family  and  all  her
    friends in the UK.  It is true that some could come and visit  but  now
    her husband is bedridden and disabled he would not be able to cope with
    a visit for two weeks at a time.

34. Gary, her youngest son, has experience of caring for  disabled  people.
    He and her eldest son knew about her husband before  the  incident  and
    between 2007 and 2009 they lived in the UK.  The appellant had a  great
    relationship with them.  They are both very frustrated about not  being
    able to do more to help.

35. They have plans as to how they would help if he  came  to  the  UK,  by
    taking him out of his bed everyday and putting  him  in  a  chair,  and
    taking him out for trips in a car.  At the moment the appellant  is  in
    bed 24 hours a day and looking at a blank wall.

36. There are reports from two neurosurgeons  who  say  that  there  is  no
    medical or surgical procedure  which  would  help  with  her  husband's
    condition.  All she wants to do is to improve the quality  of  his  and
    her life.  The only costs  would be prescription charges.   The  public
    interest does not say that he is a danger to anyone.

37. She knows from the information that she has that he did not commit  the
    offence of murder.  The "riot" was actually a celebration, although  it
    is the case that the incident had to be  quelled.  It was not, however,
    a riot.  After that the appellant had had a clean record.  When he  was
    in England for two years he worked and  paid  taxes  and  was  a  model
    citizen.  The conviction was 28 years ago.

38. In cross-examination the sponsor  said  that  she  had  had  a  thyroid
    problem for quite a long time.  She  has  been  taking  medication  for
    stress  since  the  attack  on  her  husband  in  2011.   She  has  had
    hypertension medication for at least the last fifteen years.

39. The property in Turkey has been owned for about seven  years.   If  the
    appellant was allowed to come to the UK they  would  try  to  sell  the
    property.

40. The person who is taking care of her husband at the moment  whilst  she
    is in the UK is a retired nurse, not someone that she knows personally.



41. In answer to my questions, the sponsor said that following the  refusal
    of the application for entry clearance they had  moved  away  from  the
    holiday resort of Alanya.  If relatives came to visit and stayed  in  a
    hotel, that would be expensive.  Her sons  could  stay  with   them  on
    short visits but there is a lot of animosity in the family between  her
    husband's elder brother and her sons.  They are angry that he does  not
    do anything to help.

42. She would never have dreamed of buying half the house but her husband's
    family kept asking for money.  They decided then to buy  a  portion  of
    the house. She obtained the title deeds to  half the  house.

43. In further submissions Ms Kenny said that it was a serious  matter  for
    the appellant's convictions to have been  hidden  from  the  ECO.   The
    sponsor's claim to have no private life is simply not  plausible  given
    the length of time she had  spent  in  Turkey.   If  the  situation  in
    relation to the apparent  hostility  of  the  appellant's  brother  and
    sister-in-law was so bad they would  not  continue  living  there.   It
    would be possible for them to relocate in Turkey,  and  live  somewhere
    more suitable to their needs.

44. The visits from the sponsor's supportive sons would be able to continue
    and that would provide the sponsor with some respite or relief.  In the
    meantime, the sponsor has been able to employ  a  nurse.  There  is  no
    reason why such professional help could not be provided  on  a  regular
    basis.  There is  nothing to suggest that  care  is  not  available  in
    Turkey.

45. The sponsor repeated, that finding somewhere else  to  live  in  Turkey
    would not solve  the  problems.   It  was  difficult  living  with  the
    appellant's family but the question was  what  were  the  alternatives.
    She owns half the house and is entitled to  live  there.   She  is  not
    saying that it is unbearable but it is very difficult.  She had had  to
    borrow money from her sons to pay for the nurse and she is living on an
    overdraft.  She is not able to do that on a regular basis and  care  is
    not readily available.  It is difficult to find such care and difficult
    to find someone who could be trusted.

46. The appellant gets shouted  at  because  he  calls  out  for  her,  the
    sponsor.  He gets called "cabbage head" by his family.   She  tries  to
    explain to them that it is not his fault, that he needs to see her  all
    the time.  For example, when she goes to the bathroom or  the  kitchen,
    he calls out for her and would say that he had missed her.  He  behaves
    like a 4 year old child.  Emotionally, it is very draining.

47. At the end of the hearing I allowed both parties a period of seven days
    to provide written submissions in relation  to  the  relevance  to  the
    appeal of the Immigration  Act  2014  ("the  2014  Act").   No  written
    submissions were received on behalf of the respondent but on behalf  of
    the appellant submissions were provided.

Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman's 'rule 43' set aside

48. It is as well to clarify that the framework within  which  the  hearing
    before me took place is established by Judge Freeman's  decision  under
    rule 43.  That rule allows the Upper Tribunal to set aside  a  decision
    which disposes of proceedings, "or part of such decision,  and  re-make
    the decision or the relevant part of  it".   It  is  clear  from  Judge
    Freeman's decision that it was only part  of  Judge  Roberts'  decision
    that was set aside, namely that part that deals with the  re-making  of
    Judge Lindsley's decision.  Thus, at paragraph (f) Judge Freeman stated
    that  Judge  Roberts  was  not  arguably  wrong  to  decide  that   the
    appellant's appeal should not have been allowed, going  on  to  explain
    why he came to that view.  At paragraph (n) it  is  stated  that  Judge
    Roberts' re-making of the decision was to be set aside and  re-made  by
    another Judge of the Upper Tribunal.

49. Thus, the hearing before me was for the re-making of the decision,  the
    issue of error of law in Judge Lindsley's decision  having  been  dealt
    with by Judge Roberts.

Re-making the decision

50. It is evident that a significant amount of the appellant's case is  not
    in dispute.  So much is clear from the  immigration  decision  refusing
    entry clearance.   There it is stated that the  ECO  acknowledges  that
    the appellant was the victim of a serious attack and as  a  result  has
    extensive  physical  disabilities  and  brain  damage.   It  was   also
    acknowledged that the appellant needs "at the moment"  permanent  care.
    It is stated that it is recognised  that  the  sponsor  is  unhappy  in
    Turkey and that the burden of the appellant's  care  is  "problematic".
    The  sponsor  had  provided  to  the  ECO  a  considerable  amount   of
    information regarding the situation of the appellant and the sponsor in
    Turkey, care that the appellant needs, his life in Turkey  compared  to
    that in the UK,  the  sponsor's  financial  situation  and  information
    provided by doctors in the UK.  The sponsor's age  and  what  she  says
    about her health difficulties were also acknowledged.

51. Judge Lindsley made certain findings of fact which  are  unaffected  by
    the error of law.  At [34] she found that the appellant has family life
    with his wife, the sponsor, and that they had been married  for  eleven
    years and cohabited throughout that period.  She found that  they  have
    lived together both in Turkey and in the UK for a period of  two  years
    with the appellant having entry clearance as a spouse during that time.



52. Notwithstanding the sponsor's  view  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    conviction for murder and what she said about  the  use  of  a  torture
    based confession with the lack of any other evidence,  she  found  that
    the appellant had in fact committed the murder  of  a  woman  whom  she
    understood to have been a cousin, as well as the murder  of  her  young
    child.  During his prison sentence he was also involved with  a  prison
    riot and given an additional sentence of  seven  months'  imprisonment,
    which he served in 2003.  She did, however, accept that the sponsor and
    the other witnesses had given truthful evidence to the effect that they
    found it difficult to believe that the appellant could  have  committed
    the murders, given the positive qualities they know in him.  It appears
    that the appellant was released as a result of presidential pardon.

53. At [42] Judge Lindsley concluded that the appellant had also  tried  to
    hide the fact of  his  convictions  from  the  respondent,  instead  of
    declaring them on the application form.  She found that  the  appellant
    and the sponsor  knew  and  understood  that  these  should  have  been
    declared.  She went on to state that whilst they may have received some
    unofficial advice from  the  British  Consulate,  they  ought  to  have
    declared the convictions.

54. At [43] she concluded that the appellant clearly does not  represent  a
    risk of reoffending and did not do so at the time of  the  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance. The evidence was to the effect that he  had  no
    other convictions other than the murders and the prison riot.

55. In the same paragraph she found that since the attack on the  appellant
    in 2011 he is now physically and mentally disabled in such a  way  that
    he cannot stand unaided or care for himself and is, as explained by the
    sponsor, scared of others including former friends and his  own  family
    members due to his acute vulnerability.

56. At [45] Judge Lindsley accepted that the appellant and the sponsor  are
    treated with hostility  by  the  appellant's  family  members  who  are
    unwilling to help with the appellant's care and who treat  him  roughly
    and in a  way  which  the  sponsor  finds  demoralising  and  which  is
    "alarming, saddening and painful to the appellant".  She gave  examples
    such as that the appellant's family call him "cabbage head",  give  him
    mouldy food, only occasionally agree to assist with showering  him  and
    then use water that is too hot.  Medication is obtained,  for  example,
    sleeping tablets, from doctors who have never  met  the  appellant  and
    which  medication  is  given  without  reference  to   his   particular
    condition, and which the sponsor fears will cause him harm.

57. As to the situation that would prevail in the UK, she concluded at [46]
    that they would live with the sponsor's adult sons who love and respect
    the appellant and who are willing to provide physical  care,  have  the
    patience to look after a disabled man with respect, and  have  time  to
    share friendship with him.  She concluded that the sponsor's  sons  had
    demonstrated their love and respect for the appellant whom  they  refer
    to as their stepfather, not just by writing letters and  attending  the
    Tribunal hearings but by spending significant periods of time in Turkey
    as his carer, performing intimate tasks for him.   She  also  concluded
    that there would be an extended  community  of  friends,  including  Mr
    Sayers, who would provide moral and practical support to the family  in
    the UK.

58. At [47] she referred to medical evidence to the effect that  there  was
    no "surgical or clinical intervention that would be relevant for him to
    receive".  However, she found that  the  limitations  on  the  care  he
    receives in Turkey due to the sponsor's lack of support from his family
    may lead to medical  problems.   She  accepted  that  being  bed-ridden
    causes medical issues such as  pressure  ulcers  and  depression  which
    would be likely to be avoided if he were cared for in  the  UK  by  the
    sponsor and her adult sons, and thus could be lifted  out  of  bed  and
    placed in a wheelchair during the day.

59. In terms of the sponsor's private life, Judge Lindsley found  that  her
    private life is  "non-existent"  in  Turkey.   She  cannot  speak  good
    Turkish and is thus hampered in all communications. She found that  she
    has no friends to turn to for support and socialising, no local  church
    community for joint  worship  and  moral  support  and  is  denied  the
    opportunity to be with her sons and grandsons and  see  them  grow  up.
    She stated that the sponsor is without  the  familiar  surroundings  of
    Kent and Sussex where she has lived for the majority of  her  life  and
    where she feels at home.  She stated that the  sponsor  is  denied  the
    majority of benefits of her British citizenship.

60. At [49] she concluded  that  the  sponsor  was  clearly  anxious  about
    possible further threats to the appellant and to her from the policeman
    who provided her husband  with employment prior  to  the  attack.   She
    accepted that those  fears  are  genuinely  held  by  the  sponsor  and
    concluded that they further hamper the quality of private life that  is
    possible for the sponsor in Turkey.

61. In relation to accommodation in the UK, she concluded that it would  be
    more than adequate and that they would have a private bedroom,  sharing
    only the communal areas with the sponsor's sons, rather than having  to
    exist in a cramped space, having only  the  end  of  the  sitting  room
    divided off with furniture as their own  space,  which  they  presently
    have in Turkey, without quietness and privacy, whilst living  with  the
    appellant's brother and sister-in-law in an  atmosphere  of  resentment
    and hostility.

62. It is plain that the  appellant  is  not  able  to  meet  the  relevant
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for entry clearance as a partner.
      In  the  first  place,  he  is  not  able  to  meet  the  suitability
    requirements under S-EC.1.4 in the light of his conviction and sentence
    for a term of imprisonment of more than twelve months.

63. Furthermore, he is not able to meet the financial requirements  of  the
    Rules as set out in paragraph E-ECP.3.1  in  terms  of  income.   Those
    requirements are to the effect that income  of  at  least  �18,600  per
    annum is needed but the sponsor's only source of income  is  a  pension
    paying in the region of �10,100 per annum.

64. No copy of any applicable guidance to Entry Clearance Officers has been
    provided, in terms of 'exceptional  circumstances'  or  'compelling  or
    compassionate circumstances'.  Nevertheless, in the notice of  decision
    the  ECO  states  that  full  consideration  as  been  given   to   the
    "compassionate factors" of the application, although the conclusion was
    that those factors did  not warrant the issuing of a visa  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Entry Clearance Manager's review also refers to
    compassionate circumstances, stating that the ECO referred the case  to
    the  UK  for  consideration   outside   the   Immigration   Rules   "on
    compassionate grounds".

65. Insofar as this is consideration of a discretion outside the Rules,  it
    is not a discretion that I have power to interfere  with  (see  Section
    86(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002).

66. However, it  is  evident  that  the  facts  of  this  appeal  call  for
    consideration under Article 8 of the ECHR.  That, it seems to  me,  has
    never been in issue.

67. In considering Article 8, I adopt the structured approach  set  out  in
    Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  The ultimate question in this appeal, is
    whether the decision of the respondent amounts  to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the right  to  family  and/or  private  life  of  the
    appellant, but also taking into account the same rights of the sponsor.
     The Article 8 rights of the sponsor are  clearly  in  play  here  (see
    Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39).

68. Much of the fact finding  exercise  has  already  been  done  by  Judge
    Lindsley.  I should however state,  that  the  mere  narration  of  the
    appellant's and the sponsor's circumstances in a sense presents only  a
    one  dimensional  view  of  their  life  in  Turkey.   However,   their
    circumstances are brought to life by the evidence of the sponsor and by
    what are, it  seems  to  me,  two  important  documents  amongst  those
    provided by the sponsor.  These are, a document which is  described  in
    an appendix, Appendix 6, of documents  provided by the sponsor, being a
    log of events whilst the appellant's stepson  Gary  took  care  of  the
    appellant whilst the sponsor attended the hearing at the Upper Tribunal
    on 10 January 2014.  That daily log of events extends  from  8  January
    2014 until 15 January 2014.  It very much supports the  conclusions  of
    Judge Lindsley in terms of the attitude of the appellant's brother  and
    sister-in-law to him.  It also reveals in stark form the very  intimate
    care that the appellant plainly needs.

69. The second document is described as Appendix 7 and is a daily log  kept
    by the sponsor "regarding the care of the  Appellant  while  living  in
    Adapazari offered in proof of abusive, inhuman and degrading  behaviour
    by the Appellant's family".  Aside again, from bringing to life, as  it
    were, the intense physical demands of  caring  for  the  appellant,  it
    reinforces evidence already  given  about  the,  often,  hostility  and
    indifference of the appellant's brother and sister-in-law.

70. It is always true that in cases of refusal of entry clearance there  is
    a  spectrum  of  consequences,  hardship,   or   difficulty   for   the
    disappointed applicant and their sponsor or other family  members.   In
    some cases, the hardship, or even  disappointment,  may  be  relatively
    modest.  It seems to me, that this appellant's case is at the other end
    of the extreme.  If allowed to come  to  the  UK  the  appellant  would
    benefit from the care and  support  of  other  family  members  of  the
    sponsor in the UK. Whilst there is no medical evidence on  this  issue,
    it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  his  life  in  the  UK   and   any
    rehabilitation that there may be in prospect would be enhanced  by  his
    living here.  Undoubtedly, the sponsor's  life  would  be  immeasurably
    enriched by having the care,  support  and  friendship  of  family  and
    friends in the UK.  That is all  apart  from  the  alleviation  of  the
    significant hardship on her in having to care for the appellant.

71. I do  accept  that  the  decision  of  the  respondent  amounts  to  an
    interference with the appellant's private life in the  sense  that  his
    private life would also be significantly enriched by being  in  the  UK
    with the benefits  that  I  have  described.   Likewise,  there  is  an
    interference with the sponsor's private life for the same  reasons.   I
    am not satisfied that there is  interference  with  their  family  life
    which they have together in Turkey.  It is family life which is fraught
    with difficulty, as is obvious from the facts, but it  is  family  life
    nevertheless.

72. There are, however, factors in  the  proportionality  assessment  which
    weigh against the grant of entry clearance.  The first of these is  the
    fact of the appellant's convictions. He was convicted  of  murdering  a
    woman and her young child, albeit many years ago. He was also convicted
    of a riot in prison, although that it  seems  to  me  is  very  much  a
    subsidiary matter.

73. There is no risk whatsoever of the  appellant  committing  any  further
    offences, given his physical and mental condition.  Deportation  cases,
    that is cases of expulsion from the UK, are  not  much  in  point  here
    except to say that it is recognised that there is more  to  the  public
    interest than the risk of reoffending.  The risk of reoffending plainly
    has an important part to play in excluding from the UK people  who  are
    likely to commit criminal offences.  That is not  the  case  with  this
    appellant.  Public interest in deterrence has a part to play, but  less
    of a part to play  than  in  expulsion  cases.    In  an  expulsion  or
    deportation case the argument for deterring others is clearer.  Foreign
    nationals are expected to be aware that if they  commit  offences  they
    face the risk of removal.  In the case of entry clearance,  an  offence
    committed before any  application  for  entry  clearance  was  ever  in
    contemplation does not bring deterrence into play in the same way.

74. That is not to say, however, that deterrence has no part to play in the
    suitability criteria in terms of  convictions.  There  plainly  can  be
    cases where offences are committed  notwithstanding  the  intention  to
    come to the UK in some capacity or  another,  and  for  which  criminal
    convictions may amount to a disqualification.

75. Similarly, it is reasonable to conclude that the public are entitled to
    expect that, as a general matter, the UK does not host individuals  who
    have been  convicted of serious offences, regardless of  whether  there
    is a risk of that individual reoffending.

76. Thus, in a significant way, the appellant fails  to  meet  one  of  the
    important requirements of the Immigration Rules, that is  to  say  that
    relating to suitability, in the light of his conviction.

77. In addition, there is the question of the failure to meet the financial
    requirements of the Rules.  Any analysis of the  extent  to  which  the
    appellant's sons would be able to assist financially were the appellant
    to come to the UK does not alter the fact that  the  appellant  is  not
    able to meet those financial requirements, those Rules representing the
    Secretary of State's view  of  the  level  of  income  required  by  an
    appellant seeking entry clearance.  That provision of  the  Immigration
    Rules plainly also has a public interest element.

78. As  I  have  indicated,  I  invited  the  parties  to  provide  written
    submissions in relation to  the  2014  Act.  Section  19  of  that  Act
    inserted an amended section 117 into the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  So  far  as  material,  the  new  provisions  are  as
    follows:
                                   "PART 5A

                ARTICLE 8 OF THE ECHR: PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS


        "117A Application of this Part


        (1) This Part applies where a court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
        determine
        whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-


        (a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and  family
        life
        under Article 8, and
        (b) as a result would be unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
        Rights Act 1998.
        (2) In considering the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
        tribunal must
        (in particular) have regard-
        (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
        (b) in cases concerning the deportation of  foreign  criminals,  to
        the considerations listed in section 117C.
        (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means  the
        question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
        respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
        8(2).


        117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
        cases


        (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
        public
        interest.
        (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
        interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
        persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
        to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
        (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
        (b) are better able to integrate into society.
        (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
        interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
        persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
        financially independent, because such persons-
        (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
        (b) are better able to integrate into society.
        (4) Little weight should be given to-
        (a) a private life, or
        (b) a relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,  that  is
        established by a person at a time when the person is in the  United
        Kingdom unlawfully.
        (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
        a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
        precarious.
        ..."

79. Thus, under Section 117B,  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is in the public interest. It is also in the  public  interest
    and in the interests of the economic wellbeing of  the  United  Kingdom
    that persons who seek to enter or remain in the UK are  able  to  speak
    English, and that they are financially independent. The  provisions  in
    relation to foreign criminals have no application to the  circumstances
    of this appeal, those provisions being concerned with  the  deportation
    of foreign criminals.

80. I have taken into account  the  written  submissions  provided  by  the
    sponsor in relation to the 2014 Act.  Materially, the sponsor refers to
    the appellant being able to speak  English,  a  matter  that  does  not
    appear to be in dispute. She  also  repeats  that  the  impact  on  the
    economy may be in the  form  of  occasional  prescription  drugs  only.
    Insofar as she refers to Judge Lindsley's assessment of the  amount  of
    funds that would be available to the appellant and the sponsor, I  have
    already  dealt  with  that  matter  with  reference  to  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules.

81. In general terms, in the covering letter dated 3 November  2014,  post-
    hearing, the sponsor refers to the respondent's  lack  of  preparedness
    for the hearing before me, suggesting that  this  raises  a  reasonable
    doubt in her mind in terms of whether this was a deliberate  tactic  to
    hide further inefficiencies at the  Home  Office.   She  suggests  that
    albeit that is a small issue in the scheme of things,  it  "impacts  on
    the fairness to the appellant when the Home Office can  get  away  with
    gaining extra time  by  possible  deception  thereby  over-running  the
    stated time guidelines to the detriment of the appellant".  There  was,
    it should be said, no criticism by the sponsor in relation to Ms Kenny,
    and nor could there be.

82. The  letter  refers  to  what  are  said  to  be  "unsubstantiated  and
    uninformed speculation"  on  behalf  of  the  representatives  for  the
    respondent, for example in terms of assertions that the  appellant  and
    the sponsor could  live in another part of Turkey, desptie  her  having
    repeatedly dealt with that matter.  Similarly, the assertion that it is
    nothing more than a "wish" for the appellant and the sponsor to  be  in
    the UK.

83. Whilst I accept that a denial of entry clearance to the appellant  will
    have significant personal implications for the sponsor, as well as  for
    the appellant, I am not satisfied that the respondent's decision  does,
    or  would,  amount  to  a  disproportionate   interference   with   the
    appellant's Article 8 rights in terms of family or private life.  As  I
    have already made clear, I accept that the lives of the  appellant  and
    of the sponsor would be significantly improved were the appellant to be
    permitted to come to the UK.  However, there is evidence that albeit on
    an infrequent basis, the sponsor is able to obtain  some  respite  from
    the intense physical and emotional strain of looking after her husband.
     Her son or sons have been able to visit from time to time  whilst  the
    sponsor has been in the UK.  There is no reason to suppose  that  those
    visits could not continue, either whilst the sponsor remained in Turkey
    or whilst the sponsor visited the UK.  I accept that this would involve
    a financial burden on the sponsor and/or her  sons,  but  the  evidence
    does not establish that such visits could not continue.

84. Furthermore on at least one occasion referred to in the  evidence,  the
    appellant's sisters have been able to visit to provide care for him  in
    the absence  of  the  sponsor.  In  addition,  nursing  care  has  been
    purchased for a period of three weeks. Whilst this  evidence  postdates
    the decision, it is evidence which relates to the circumstances  as  at
    the date of the decision.

85. I of course accept that  those  temporary  and  infrequent  periods  of
    relief for the sponsor are  no  substitute  for  the  much  fuller  and
    enriching private life that she, and the appellant, would  be  able  to
    enjoy in the UK. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied
    that the respondent has established that the decision to  refuse  entry
    clearance is a proportionate response to the  legitimate  aim  pursued.
    That legitimate aim encompasses the  public  interest  factors  I  have
    referred to, as well as maintenance of an effective immigration control
    that provides certainty  and  predictability  to  those  seeking  entry
    clearance.

86. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  having  been  set
    aside,  I  re-make  the  decision,  dismissing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.



Decision

87. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal having been
    set aside, the decision is re-made, dismissing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.









Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                                 6/01/15
