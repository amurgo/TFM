                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Borsada, promulgated on 19th July 2017, following  a  hearing  "on  the
    papers" in Birmingham.  In the determination, the judge  dismissed  the
    appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matters comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the United States of America, was born on
    6th August 1963, and is a female.  She appealed against the decision of
    the Secretary of State dated 19th April 2016, refusing her  application
    for a permanent  residence  card,  as  confirmation  of  her  right  to
    residence in the UK as an EEA family member.  The judge determined  the
    matter without an oral hearing on 10th July 2017.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. It is a feature of this appeal that  the  Appellant  has  already  been
    granted indefinite leave to remain.  This  was  on  the  basis  of  the
    status of her EEA national husband, who is a citizen  of  Germany,  and
    who had been living in the UK  since  1999,  and  was  granted  British
    citizenship himself in 2006, so that he is now  a  dual  national  with
    German nationality as well.  In an appeal  before  Judge  Borsada,  the
    Appellant had asked this particular aspect of her circumstances  to  be
    taken into account.   Judge  Borsada  noted  that  "evidence  of  joint
    residency and employment and self-employed had previously been supplied
    to the Respondent and was the basis of the  previous  grant  of  leave"
    (paragraph 4(i)).  It was the Appellant's argument that, given that the
    grant of indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2004, was made to her,
    before her husband's naturalisation as a British citizen in  2006,  her
    husband's subsequent British citizen  status,  should  have  no  affect
    under EU treaty law, on her right to claim a permanent residence  card.



 4. The judge observed that,

         "The Appellant argued that she had completed more than five  years'
         continuous residence in the UK from February 2000 with her husband,
         as a German citizen exercising his  treaty  rights  before  he  was
         naturalised and that right had not been lost as she  had  not  left
         the country" (paragraph 4(i)).

 5. Accordingly,  the  position  in  the  Tribunal  below  was  that,  "the
    Appellant argued that all she was doing was replacing or  renewing  her
    previous grant and the only evidence required was the evidence  of  the
    previous grant as well as evidence of continued residence  in  the  UK"
    (paragraph 4(ii)).

The Judge's Findings

 6. The  judge  went  on  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant  had  obtained
    indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK by way of a  grant  made  by
    the Respondent Secretary of State on 17th September 2004.  Indeed,  the
    Appellant had provided a letter from  the  Respondent  which  confirmed
    this.  The purpose of the present application, as the judge recognised,
    was that "she applied for a permanent residence card in order to have a
    more recent document showing her the existing  residence  status  which
    had been previously documented  by  way  of  a  stamp  in  her  own  US
    passport".  However, the judge went on to conclude with respect to this
    that, "it is not clear why in renewing her passport she did not ask the
    Respondent for a stamp to be provided in her  new  passport  confirming
    her pre-existing ILR".

 7. The position now before the judge was that the Appellant's husband  had
    been naturalised in 2000.  It was the case that

         "The  Appellant  asserts  her  continued  residence  and  continued
         employment in the UK but has provided no evidence to this  Tribunal
         in support of the claim and without this I can make no findings  of
         fact and the appeal therefore must fail on EEA grounds"  (paragraph
         6).

 8. The judge went on to also add that it was difficult to  understand  why
    this application was being made, or was ever necessary "as there is  no
    evidence to indicate that the Appellant has been  outside  the  UK  for
    more than two years" (paragraph 6).

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

The Grounds of Application

10. The  grounds  of  application  are  extensive.   They  state  that  the
    application by the Appellant on form EEA(PR),  Section  4,  was  for  a
    renewal of a residence document which had already been  issued  to  the
    Appellant as a non-EEA national under the EEA Regulations  2000.   This
    stated that the Appellant stayed in the UK indefinitely.  The Appellant
    presented valid reasons for her request to  renew  the  2004  document.
    There were three reasons she gave.

11. First, that from her practical experience she knew that  airline  staff
    and non-UK border control forces do  not  always  consider  a  passport
    stamp which states that, "at present there is  no  time  limit  on  the
    holder's stay in the United Kingdom" as sufficient proof of  the  right
    to travel to the UK.

12. Secondly, the long period of time since the  Home  Office  document  of
    2004,  had  seen  several  changes  in  immigration  legislation  being
    introduced, and the Appellant wanted to be absolutely clear  about  her
    existing status.

13. Third, there was "the changed political  environment  in  the  UK  that
    creates a practical  necessity  for  a  foreigner  to  have  a  recent,
    unambiguous immigration status document" to prove their legal residence
    in this country.  The Appellant in the grounds goes on to deal with the
    judge's wonder as to why the Appellant wishes to make this  application
    given that she had not been out of the UK for more than two  years  and
    had not lost her permanent residence.

14. The Appellant states that:

         "This statement ignores and completely misrepresents the nature  of
         my application for a permanent residence card on form EEA(PR) based
         on the existence of a permanent residence right.  As Section  4  of
         the form says: 'Only complete this section if you have a  permanent
         right of residence'."

15. On 22nd December  2017  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Judge
    Easterman.  He observed that "this does  not  appear  to  me  to  be  a
    straightforward matter" because the Appellant  already  had  indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK, which had been granted as long ago as  2004,
    and which took the form of a letter and a  stamp  in  out  of  date  US
    passport.  The Appellant states that this was granted on the  basis  of
    the 2000 EEA Regulations, given her marriage to her husband, who was  a
    German national at the time.  He was exercising treaty rights.    Since
    then he has acquired British  nationality  while  still  retaining  his
    German nationality.

16. Judge Easterman observed that the Appellant was  clear  that,  although
    she did not need a permanent residence card in order to remain in  this
    country, as a matter of convenience, she would like to have one and she
    claimed she was entitled to the issue of one on the basis of the Rules.
     If that was the case, then  this  application  was  entirely  arguable
    because the Appellant would  have  been  entitled  as  of  right  to  a
    permanent residence card.  Permission was granted.

17. There was no Rule 24 response.

Submissions

18. At the hearing before me, the Appellant appeared in  person.   She  had
    submitted that her case number was linked to that of her husband's case
    number.  He had arrived in the  UK  in  1999.   He  had  taken  British
    nationality in 2006.  She had been granted indefinite leave  to  remain
    on the basis of his having exercised treaty rights prior to  the  grant
    to him of British nationality status.   That  happened  in  2006.   Her
    rights were granted in 2004.  She wished to make sure that  her  rights
    continued.  She relied upon her grounds of application.

19. For her part, Ms Aboni submitted that there was  no  error  of  law  in
    Judge Borsada's determination.  She was aware  that  there  was  now  a
    recent Grand Chamber decision in the case of  Toufik  Lounes  (Case  C-
    165/16) which confirmed that the  fact  that  a  spouse  acquires  dual
    nationality, still retained intact for his dependant, the rights  which
    would accrue as an EEA national.  That decision  was  recent,  however.
    It was dated 14th November 2017.   Even  so,  the  Appellant  had  been
    granted indefinite leave to remain under domestic law.  If  she  wished
    to acquire a permanent residence card under EEA law, she had to furnish
    documentation demonstrating that her husband exercised EEA rights  over
    five years.  Judge Borsada did not have the necessary evidence.  He was
    clear that "the Appellant asserts a continued residence  and  continued
    employment in the UK but has provided no evidence to this  Tribunal  in
    support of the claim..." (paragraph 6).  There was  no  error  of  law.



Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are  as  follows.   This  is  a  case  which  the
    Appellant herself did not come prepared to deal with  at  the  hearing.
    However, if one looks at the Appellant's  bundle  (which  is  available
    from the hearing below) it  is  clear  that  the  Appellant  stands  to
    succeed on the basis of her pre-existing position.

21. There is a letter from the IND addressed to the Appellant on  18th  May
    2000.   It  states  that  her  passport  is  being  returned  with  the
    endorsement that she has the right to  reside  in  the  UK  with  Klaus
    Jurgen Becher "who is a European Economic Area  national  exercising  a
    treaty right in the United Kingdom under the treaty of Rome"  and  that
    she is "free  to  take  employment  or  to  engage  in  business  or  a
    profession while your husband continues to exercise a treaty right".

22. There is then a letter from the Home Office  on  17th  September  2004,
    which the Appellant has specifically relied upon in the hearing  before
    me today, which states that, "I am writing to say there are  no  longer
    any restrictions on the period for which you may remain in  the  United
    Kingdom".  If she leaves the UK, she will normally  be  readmitted  for
    settlement as a returning resident so long as "you have not  been  away
    for longer than two years".

23. There is then, most importantly, the EEA(PR) "guidance notes"  (version
    2.0 of December 2015).  This makes it  clear  that  it  relates  to  an
    application  "for  a  document  certifying  permanent  residence  or  a
    permanent residence card".  It states that the  Appellant  must  pay  a
    specified fee and give her biometric information.  It  has  a  specific
    section, which the Appellant in this case actually relied upon, to deal
    with the situation.  What is stated at "Section  4:  replace  or  renew
    your permanent residence document" is that, in order to proceed on this
    basis, the Appellant must provide proof of her status of "your previous
    document certifying permanent residence".  She must also send  evidence
    that she has not spent more than two years outside the UK, which is not
    the case here.  She has to show the stamps in her passport.

24. With respect to her residence in the UK, there is Section  5  which  is
    headed "Residence and Previous Documentation" and which states that  it
    is recommended that "you submit at least two documents for each year of
    residence".  In this respect, the examples that are given are that  the
    Appellant furnish HM Revenue & Customs'  documentation,  together  with
    Department  for  Work  &  Pensions'  documentation,  the  DVLA  and  TV
    licencing information, and bank statements, together with  council  tax
    bills, as well as electricity and gas bills, plus  water  rates  bills,
    and a tenancy agreement.  The document ends by stating  that  "previous
    passports, travel documents or national identity cards  you  have  held
    since living in the UK".

25. It is clear that the Appellant has availed herself of  this  particular
    provision which enables her to simply  apply  in  order  to  renew  her
    permanent residence document.  This  is  clear  because  the  Appellant
    states in a letter dated 31st  October  2016,  addressed  to  the  Home
    Office, that she has complied with all the conditions that were set out
    in the grant of indefinite leave to remain on 17th September 2014.  She
    has been continuously settled in the UK with her  husband  and  family.
    Moreover, "I have continuously been in business in the UK as a managing
    partner of our jointly owned family firm, Knowledge and Analysis LLP, a
    limited  liability  partnership,  resident  in   England   and   Wales,
    registration number OC303170".  It does not appear that the  judge,  in
    what was a "paper" hearing, expressly  referred  to  this  information.
    This does show that both the Appellant and her dual  national  partner,
    have been continuously in business for the time  that  they  have  been
    living in the UK.

26. In her application  of  31st  October  2016,  on  the  same  page,  the
    Appellant goes on to then explain also why she wants to have a  renewal
    of her permanent residence card.  She gives in particular two  reasons.
    First, that "it is awkward to always have to  refer  to  the  'no  time
    limit stamp' in my old US passport when travelling".  Second, that "the
    long period of time since your  letter  of  2004  in  combination  with
    regulatory changes since then and the current political  debates  about
    immigration create a sense of uncertainty about the  permanence  of  my
    residency status".  The letter that the Appellant wrote ends  with  the
    statement that, "I have  completed  the  form  EEA(PR)  insofar  as  it
    applies to my case and I am enclosing the required original  supporting
    documents, biometric information form and �65 fee."

27. In the circumstances therefore, it is  not  correct  to  say  that  the
    Appellant "has provided no evidence to this Tribunal in support of  the
    claim" (paragraph 6), because this is what the  Tribunal  had  properly
    set out to do, and had succeeded in doing so.

28. The Appellant had also given entirely sensible and  reasonable  reasons
    for why  she  wished  to  replace  or  renew  her  permanent  residence
    document.  All she had at the moment was by way of a stamp in  her  old
    US passport, and even  that  simply  said  "no  time  limit".   If  the
    Appellant has a legal right to apply for a permanent residence card, on
    the basis of a previously granted  status,  then  she  is  entitled  to
    exercise that right.  I accordingly make a finding of an error  of  law
    for these reasons.

29. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings by the previous
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons I have already given.



Decision

30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  I set aside the decision of the previous judge.   I
    remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is allowed.

31. No anonymity direction is made.

32. This appeal is allowed.
