For the Appellant:     Miss A Seehra
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Judge Ross presiding, which was promulgated on 11 October 2013 allowing
    the appeal on human rights  grounds  of  the  appellant,  Mrs  Sedigheh
    Nemati, who on 23 February 2013 applied for settlement  in  the  United
    Kingdom on the basis of her marriage to the sponsor, Mr Hassan  Nemati.
    As I have said the appeal was  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds  but
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.  I will need to come back to the
    significance of that in a moment.

 2. As for the background facts, the appellant is a national of  Iran.   We
    know from his witness statement that the sponsor, Mr  Nemati  was  born
    presumably in Iran on 20 May 1975 but is now a British national.  We do
    not know what date he became a British national or indeed when he  came
    to the United Kingdom.  The parties met in Dubai on 27 January 2012 and
    they got married on 4 November 2012 equally in Dubai.  There  was  then
    an application for entry clearance under the  Rules.   The  application
    was made on 23 February 2013, we think in  Abu  Dhabi  rather  than  in
    Dubai.  We gather that from paragraph 20 of the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination but in all events not a huge amount turns on  that  point
    given the relative geographical proximity of those countries.

 3. The application  for  entry  clearance  fell  to  be  considered  under
    Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.  According to paragraph 10 of the
    determination, although there is an issue as to the  accuracy  of  this
    which Miss Seehra has raised, the requirements which were in issue were
    that the appellant had to demonstrate a gross annual income of at least
    �18,600 gross, had to provide a P60 for the relevant period or periods,
    wage slips covering a period of six months prior to  the  date  of  the
    application and the appellant also had to show that she had  passed  an
    English language test in speaking and listening at a minimum  of  level
    1.  Plainly this required the production of  a  certificate  which  the
    appellant did not have.

 4. On 26 March 2013 the application was refused  on  the  basis  that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  evidence  provided
    met the Rules.  The Entry Clearance Officer was also not satisfied that
    the appellant had passed the relevant English language test.

 5. It is clear from the papers  that  at  some  stage  that  decision  was
    reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager who stated, and this is set out
    in paragraph 4 of the determination, that whereas  he  appreciated  the
    compassionate circumstances in this case to which we  will  come  in  a
    moment  the  fact  remains  that  the  appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

 6. The appeal against that decision was made on 9 June 2013 under  Section
    82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and was  brought
    on the basis that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer under the
    Rules was erroneous and moreover, and in any event, there was  a  claim
    under Article 8 of the Convention.  In short it would be an unjustified
    and disproportionate interference with human  rights  to  maintain  the
    exclusion of the appellant from the United Kingdom.

 7. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal regarding  compliance  with
    the Rules was that the sponsor husband had been working as an  accounts
    assistant with a company  called  Graphcrown  Limited.   Payslips  were
    produced showing gross monthly income of �1,700 equating to �20,400 per
    annum, that exceeds the threshold in the Appendix.  However as  at  the
    date of the application and the  decision  the  sponsor  had  not  been
    working for one year.  His P60 for the year ending 5 April 2012  stated
    that he had earned �1,200 and that for the year  ending  5  April  2013
    showed �16,431 net.  That second P60 postdated the decision.

 8. As for the English language requirement the appellant as we  have  said
    did not pass the test but she said that she  had  been  suffering  from
    stress.  We will return to that point in due course but  she  did  pass
    the test in July 2013 which was after the date of the  application  and
    of the decision.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal recognised that  the  case  could  not  succeed
    under the Rules, whether under Appendix FM  or  paragraph  276ADE.   He
    proceeded to consider the case under Article 8 of the Convention.   The
    First-tier Tribunal took into account the fact that the  appellant  and
    the sponsor now satisfied the Rules, that it would  be  oppressive  for
    the appellant to make a further application in Abu Dhabi and  that  the
    sponsor was suffering from epilepsy exacerbated  by  stress.   Further,
    the First-tier Tribunal said- see the final sentence of paragraph 19  -
    that he took into account  the  decision  of  the  House  of  Lords  in
    Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008]  UKHL  40
    in which it was made clear that it was no answer to an Article 8  claim
    to say that the appellant should return to his home country and make an
    application from there.

10. The First-tier Tribunal's conclusion on the Article 8 point was set out
    in paragraph 20.  Regard was had to the fact that the  sponsor  clearly
    does earn more than the amount  required  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    presumably because regard could be had to postdecision  evidence  which
    clearly demonstrated that.  Regard was also had to the fact that as the
    First-tier Tribunal said the evidence shows  that  the  then  appellant
    does now meet the English language requirement but did not do so at the
    time of the refusal which was recognised technically to be the relevant
    time.  There  were  other  factors  prayed  in  aid  which,  given  the
    submissions advanced to us we should cover in slightly more detail.

11. The first of these related to the health of the sponsor.   The  medical
    evidence was that he was suffering from epilepsy - see page 12  of  the
    respondent's bundle - and that his fits are triggered  by  stress.   Dr
    Rasheed, the author of the quite short medical report  stated  it  must
    have been the position that Mr Nemati lived alone but  is  at  risk  of
    harm during a fit and then we see this expression of opinion  "I  think
    having his wife with him would be a mental and emotional support to him
    as well as helping him with any physical problems which could occur  as
    a result of him fitting".   So that was  evidence  which  probably  the
    First-tier Tribunal could take into  account  since  it  was  available
    before the Entry Clearance Officer.

12. I am somewhat perplexed by the reference in paragraph 20 of the  First-
    tier Tribunal's determination to  the  suggestion  that  the  appellant
    suffers from epilepsy, I think that that must be a typographical  error
    and it should refer to the sponsor but anyway that was the first  piece
    of evidence.

13. The second piece of evidence was that the appellant was suffering  from
    stress on her own account.  That in part explained her failure to  pass
    the English language test  before  the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's  decision  and  that  there  are  also  family  problems  and
    pressures.  According to paragraph 3 of the determination the delay has
    caused considerable problems within  the  family  and  has  caused  the
    appellant's family to threaten to  divorce  the  sponsor.    Perhaps  a
    clearer way of putting it would be that the appellant's family would be
    putting pressure on her  to  divorce  the  sponsor  but  the  point  is
    nonetheless one that we clearly understand.

14. The third factor, and this again was a factor which  was  available  at
    the relevant date, is that in order to make  a  fresh  application  for
    entry clearance the appellant would have to travel to Abu Dhabi because
    the diplomatic and political circumstances currently extant  mean  that
    there is no British Embassy in Tehran.   According  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal the appellant could not travel  to  Abu  Dhabi  alone  and  we
    clearly accept that for all sorts of obvious reasons and she would have
    to persuade a member of her family to go with  her.   Apparently  there
    was reluctance to pursue the appeal any  further  and  there  would  be
    further delay and expense.  All that  was  clearly  understood  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

15. Having concluded that this was a genuine marriage which was subsisting,
    that  there was adequate accommodation and that the requirements of the
    Rules were now met, the First-tier Tribunal's conclusion  was  that  it
    was not proportionate in the circumstances to require this appellant to
    make another application.  There are exceptional circumstances and  the
    Article 8 claim was allowed.  It  is  against  that  finding  that  the
    Secretary of State appeals.

16. The preliminary issue which we need to consider is the attempt made  by
    Miss Seehra to seek to assail the finding which was against her client,
    namely that the immigration appeal was dismissed.  A Rule  24  response
    was filed by the claimant, strictly speaking  the  respondent  to  this
    appeal today taking a number of points but many of them but not all  of
    them relate to the case under the Rules which was dismissed  and  which
    was not separately appealed.

17.  Miss  Seehra  in  oral  argument  said  that  paragraph  10   of   the
    determination sets out the wrong requirements of  the  Rules  and  that
    paragraph 12 of the determination  is  inexplicable  because  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer did not take an  issue  in  relation  to  the
    absence of a P60 but the difficulty with that  submission  is  twofold.
    First of all paragraph  12  of  the  determination  is  clear  and  for
    whatever reason a finding of fact has been made that there has not been
    compliance with the Rules for two reasons.  First, the English language
    requirement was not met and secondly that  the  relevant  P60  was  not
    produced.  On the face of it, it would  be  difficult  to  assail  that
    finding but as it happens it is impossible to assail  that  finding  in
    the light of the decision of this Tribunal in Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department v EG & NG (UT Rule 17: withdrawal: Rule 24:  scope)
    Ethiopia [2013] UKUT 00143 (IAC) where a three  judge  member  of  this
    panel concluded that if one  wanted  to  assail  decisions  which  were
    adverse to the losing party notwithstanding that the losing  party  had
    won on other issues, in that case it was on Article 3, one had  to  put
    in a proper notice of appeal rather than seek to rely on the provisions
    of Rule 24 of the 2008 Procedure Rules.  It follows that it is not open
    to the claimant to seek to run these arguments under the Rules  whether
    it is the main argument or the alternative argument at paragraph 13  of
    the response document.  The case has to be  considered  solely  in  the
    light of the Secretary of State's appeal under Article 8.

18. It is the essence of the Secretary of State's appeal  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in taking into account  postdecision  evidence  and
    facts, namely, in particular -

    (a)   the  fact  that  the  appellant  now  met  the  English  language
         requirement, and

    (b)  the fact that the P60 for  5  April  2013  demonstrated  that  the
         sponsor now met the requirements of the Rules.

    It is clear that those matters were taken into  account.   It  is  also
    clear that other matters  were  taken  into  account  and  we  will  be
    returning to the significance of those in due course.

19. It is the submission of the Secretary of State relying on the dictum of
     Lord Phillips in the case of AS (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2009] UKHL 32 that in an entry clearance  case  it  is
    impermissible to take into  account  postdecision  facts  or  what  was
    described there as a change of circumstances.  Quoting from paragraph 9
    of the opinion of Lord Phillips:

         "In such circumstances it is  not  illogical  to  require  a  fresh
         application for entry clearance to  be  made.  Where,  however,  an
         appeal is made against refusal of leave to enter  by  an  appellant
         who is within the jurisdiction, consideration must  necessarily  be
         given to the position prevailing when the appeal is heard, at least
         where human rights are in issue as they usually are, for an adverse
         decision  on  the  appeal  will  render  the  appellant  liable  to
         deportation."

20. So it is clear that a distinction was being made between cases where an
    individual is within the United Kingdom and cases where  an  individual
    is seeking permission or leave to enter the United  Kingdom.   In  such
    cases, even if Article 8 is relied on, regard can only be  had  to  the
    evidence which was available to the Entry Clearance Officer.

21. There is this refinement that if an appellant relies on matters  before
    an Entry Clearance Officer and then seeks to improve on those self same
    matters by further evidence, that further evidence  may  be  admissible
    but what you cannot do is rely on further evidence to bring  your  case
    within the Rules whereas at the  relevant  time  your  case  could  not
    succeed under the Rules.

22. The approach of the House of Lords in AS (Somalia) is also borne out by
    the relevant provisions of the 2002 Act - see in particular Section 85,
    sub-Section 4 and Section 85A, sub-Section 2 -  it  is  only  in  entry
    clearance cases so far as is material to this appeal that  postdecision
    facts fall properly within account.  It therefore follows that an error
    of law has been perpetrated by this First-tier Tribunal in taking  into
    account postdecision facts and postdecision  facts  which  are  clearly
    material to the outcome. The decision therefore cannot stand  and  must
    be set aside.  We are in a position to re-take the  decision  today  on
    the available evidence because  it  is  plainly  in  the  interests  of
    justice that we do so.  No one submitted  that  the  matter  should  be
    remitted to a First-tier Tribunal for re-determination and I  think  it
    is fairly obvious that that would be  an  unjust  and  disproportionate
    result since it would cause further delays.  It is far  practicable  if
    we can, which we are to deal with  the  appeal  for  ourselves  on  the
    available evidence.

23. The points which the appellant is entitled to continue to rely  on  are
    the points summarised in paragraph 20 of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    which we have already made reference and which Miss Seehra pressed very
    strongly upon us.  It is her submission that it would be  unjustifiable
    or disproportionate, I am not sure it matters which, to require a fresh
    application to be made to the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  Abu  Dhabi.
    There are exceptional circumstances here which  merit  a  more  lenient
    approach and one which does not mandate stricter  requirements  to  the
    Rules.  There are health problems, there are cultural issues, there are
    threats of the possibility of the break-up of a relationship which  the
    First-tier Tribunal  has  recognised  at  the  moment  is  genuine  and
    subsisting and to require the appellant to travel to Abu Dhabi,  albeit
    not impossible, would be oppressive in all the  circumstances  of  this
    case.  So conducting the balancing exercise for ourselves under Article
    8 which is that which is required, Miss Seehra  strongly  submits  that
    the outcome should be the same.  Ms  Isherwood  for  the  Secretary  of
    State submits that that would not be right in  all  the  circumstances,
    that the evidence of threats is weak, she submits.    It  is  also  the
    case that the sponsor has remained in  the  United  Kingdom  all  these
    years with epilepsy without the assistance it seems of  anybody,  still
    less the appellant, who  of  course  is  not  here.   Furthermore,  the
    Immigration Rules are there for a purpose and it is the policy  of  the
    law, Ms Isherwood submits, that compliance with those Rules  should  be
    required unless there is an unjustifiably harsh  outcome,  to  use  the
    language of some of the cases in this Tribunal and Higher Courts.

24. We have weighed up those submissions very carefully and we come to  the
    following conclusions.

25. It is the policy of the law to require compliance with the  Immigration
    Rules which are there for a purpose.  Entry Clearance Officers  in  the
    paradine  case  are  in  a  position  to  assess  the  evidence  wholly
    satisfactorily and the Rules are not there to be circumvented unless it
    can be shown that to require compliance with them would  amount  to  an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome.  The parties married knowing that they had
    to meet the Rules.  They  may  have  been  optimistic  as  regards  the
    financial requirements of the Rules but they knew or  must  have  known
    that they could not satisfy the  English  language  requirements  since
    they did not have a certificate, all of that was known about or  should
    have been known about.

26. As for travel to Abu Dhabi, it is not the  finding  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that that would be impossible,  it  is  the  finding  of  that
    Tribunal that this would be difficult.  We accept and  understand  that
    but we are not talking about vast geographical distances,  applications
    can be made  online  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  interview
    appointments of course are given and there is no reason why frankly the
    sponsor cannot travel to Abu Dhabi to assist his wife in the making  of
    her application.  We fully understand the strength of the compassionate
    circumstances which have  been  prayed  in  aid  here  and  it  is  not
    necessary for us to repeat them but we have come to the conclusion that
    they are not so strong as to take this case out of the run of the  mill
    case where, as the Entry Clearance  Manager  recognised,  thousands  of
    applicants have to go through the process every year.

27. So, conducting the Article 8 balance for ourselves accepting  that  the
    point is not wholly clear-cut we do come  to  the  conclusion  that  it
    would not be unjustifiable  or  disproportionate  to  require  a  fresh
    application to be made under the Rules at the Entry Clearance Office in
    Abu Dhabi rather than to allow this case on a more  freewheeling  basis
    under Article 8 of the Convention.  So the upshot is that although  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside on the error of law we
    have identified the claim under the Human  Rights  Act,  in  particular
    with reference to Article 8 of the Convention, is refused.
