Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr E Barr (Counsel, instructed by Bhavsar
Patel Solicitors)
For the Respondent:        Mr D Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant is a citizen of India. On the 11th of February 2016 he
   applied for entry clearance as a spouse of a British national. The
   application was refused on the 1st of March 2016 and the Appellant
   appealed. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson at
   Birmingham on the 13th of July 2017 and allowed for the reasons given in
   the decision promulgated on the 25th of July 2017.

2. The application had been refused on a number of grounds including an
   allegation that false documents had been provided in support of the
   application and that the Sponsor did not meet the financial requirements
   of Appendix FM. The Judge found that it had not been shown by the ECO
   that the documents relied on were false. The Judge did go on to find that
   the documents were not reliable and stated that she excluded the claimed
   wages from calculating whether the Sponsor could maintain the Appellant.

3. The Judge then went on in paragraph 25 to consider the Sponsor's receipt
   of child benefit, working tax credit, child tax credit and carer's
   allowance giving her an income of �215.57 against an income support level
   for a couple of �181.75. The Judge found that the Appellant met the
   Immigration Rules and went on to find that exclusion of the Appellant was
   disproportionate.

4. The grounds start with the Judge's finding that the discrepancy in the
   wage slips discussed in paragraph 22 of the decision could be explained
   by a mistake by the employer and at paragraph 23 finds that they are not
   reliable. The Judge had not identified the distinction as to why they
   were unreliable but not false. Having stated that the wage slips could
   not be taken into consideration the Judge then took them into account in
   assessing whether the Sponsor's income was sufficient to meet the
   financial requirements. That error infected the article 8 findings.


5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by Designated
   Judge Manuell on the 20th of December 2017. He observed that it was not
   easy to see why the appeal was allowed given that a significant
   proportion of the key evidence had been found to be unreliable with all
   the implications that had for suitability under the Immigration Rules and
   proportionality.


6. At the hearing Mr Mills relied on the grounds and submitted that the
   finding that the ECO had not shown that the documents were false and that
   the Appellant had not show that they were reliable were contradictory and
   could not stand given that the same standard of proof applied. It was
   unclear how the Appellant could succeed on article 8 grounds and
   submitted that the decision should be set aside and remitted.


7. For the Appellant Mr Barr submitted that the findings were open to the
   Judge and that it was on the basis of the HMRC evidence that the Judge
   was entitled to find that the Appellant had adequate funds available for
   maintenance. The findings were not perverse and the Judge was entitled to
   have regard to the totality of the evidence including that from HMRC.


8. Where fraud is alleged the burden is on the ECO to prove on a balance of
   probabilities although it is frequently observed that cogent evidence is
   required to justify such a finding. It is for an Appellant to show that
   documentation submitted is reliable on a balance of probabilities. Given
   the different emphasis on the quality of evidence required it is not
   inevitably inconsistent for a Judge to find that the ECO's evidence does
   not show that documentation is false and to find that an Appellant's
   evidence is insufficient to show that documentation is reliable.


9. A Judge is entitled to find that the evidence presented is insufficient
   to discharge the burden of proof. Where that is the case and a party does
   not discharge the burden it does not follow that the opposite contention
   is proved, a Judge is entitled to find that the evidence presented does
   not permit a finding on a particular point to be made.


10. Having said that the Judge appears to have accepted the reasons put
   forward by the ECO in support of the contention that the documentation
   was false. In those circumstances the reasoning is less easy to follow
   and there appears in the findings made to be a distinction without a
   difference. In those circumstances the findings are contradictory and
   cannot stand.


11. Having found that the documentation relating to the employment could
   not be relied on the Judge then placed weight on the evidence from HMRC.
   If the employment evidence was unreliable, and that would be the
   information that HMRC were relying on. I do not see how the judge could
   then place reliance on the figures from HMRC to find that there were
   sufficient funds for maintenance if the underlying information was not
   reliable. That reasoning is inconsistent and not justified by the
   findings made.


12. Given the difficulties with the findings made in relation to the
   evidence relied on by the ECO, the contradictions that follow from that
   and the reliance on the figures from HMRC on what the Judge had found
   anyway was a flawed basis I find that the decision of Judge Watson
   contains errors of law and cannot stand. The decision is set aside with
   no findings preserved and is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-
   heard, not by Judge Watson.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-heard with no
findings preserved, not to be heard by Judge Watson.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 200  and I make o
order.

Fee Award

In remitting the appeal I make no fee award which remains for the First-
tier Tribunal at the conclusion of the remitted hearing.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
