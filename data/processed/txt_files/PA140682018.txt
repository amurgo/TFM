For the Appellant:     Mr Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Wilson Solicitors
LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a male national of Vietnam born in 1977. He  appeals
       with permission against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge Hone) to dismiss his appeal on  human  rights  and  protection
       grounds.

       Anonymity Order

    1. The Appellant is victim of trafficking.  I  must  therefore  make  an
       order in the following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  both  the
           Appellant and the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

       Background and Matters in Issue

    2. The uncontested facts are that the Appellant is a Vietnamese man  who
       entered the  United  Kingdom  sometime  in  November  2013  with  the
       assistance of an agent. The  Appellant  had  willingly  engaged  this
       agent with a view  to  entering  the  United  Kingdom  illegally  and
       working in order to provide for his wife and children back home. Once
       here he found that he had been tricked and that in fact he was  under
       the control of a trafficking gang who, under threat of violence,  set
       him to work cultivating cannabis.  In February 2014 the police raided
       a building where the Appellant was being held. He fled by jumping out
       of a  window  and  in  doing  so  badly  injured  his  back.  He  was
       hospitalised and upon his  discharge,  charged  with  cultivation  of
       cannabis. He was convicted  on  the  4th  July  2014  on  charges  of
       abstracting electricity and producing cannabis. He was sentenced to 9
       months imprisonment.

    3. The Secretary of  State  served  the  Appellant  with  notice  of  an
       intention to deport him. The Appellant appealed on the  grounds  that
       he required protection, and that he  was  a  victim  of  trafficking.
       These representations were refused and the  Appellant  appealed.  His
       appeal was heard by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Osbourne)  on  the
       12th January 2015. Judge Osbourne accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
       been trafficked, but dismissed the claim  on  the  grounds  that  the
       threat from the traffickers in Vietnam was  localised  and  that  the
       Appellant could reasonably be required  to  internally  relocate,  or
       seek the protection of the Vietnamese authorities, should  he  return
       there.   The Appellant was recognised as a victim of  trafficking  by
       the Competent Authority on the 29th May 2015.

    4. A fresh claim was refused by the Respondent on the 4th December 2018.
       That was the decision appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Before
       the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant's  case  was  that  he  owed  a
       substantial  'passage  debt'  to  moneylenders  recommended  by   his
       traffickers, who will regard it as outstanding. He fears serious harm
       because he is unable to pay that debt, and  because  his  traffickers
       will perceive him to have collaborated with the  British  authorities
       in providing information about the gang. The Appellant submitted that
       the serious harm feared would amount to persecution  for  reasons  of
       his membership of a particular social group.  The  Appellant  further
       alleged  that  his  removal  would  violate  the   United   Kingdom's
       obligations under Articles 3, 4 and 8 of the European Convention.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

    6. The Appellant now appeals  on  the  grounds  that  in  doing  so  the
       Tribunal erred in law in the following material respects:

        i) Failure to consider the expert evidence before it, viz a  report
           by country expert Professor Bluth which went to  the  matter  of
           whether victims of trafficking  could  be  considered  a  social
           group,  internal  relocation,  sufficiency  of  protection   and
           crucially ongoing risk  -  Professor  Bluth  believed  that  the
           Appellant was now at a potentially greater risk of harm than  he
           was in 2013;

       ii) Failing to take the following material matters into  account  in
           its assessment of internal flight: the fact that as  a  VOT  the
           Appellant is already vulnerable, that he has been diagnosed with
           major depressive disorder and PTSD which will worsen  should  he
           be returned to Vietnam, that there  are  practical  barriers  to
           relocation namely the Ho Khau registration system and that  this
           system  is,  by  means  of  corruption   and   bribery,   highly
           susceptible to abuse by loansharks and  traffickers  seeking  to
           locate victims;

      iii) Not engaging with the Demirkaya principle set out  at  paragraph
           399K of the Immigration  Rules.  The  fact  that  a  person  has
           already been subject  to  persecution  must  be  regarded  as  a
           serious indication of the  person's  fear  of  persecution.  The
           Tribunal did not direct itself to, or apply this principle;

       iv) Applying the wrong standard of proof in its assessment  of  risk
           and internal flight at its ï¿½41: "it is not certain that he  will
           come to the attention of the trafficking gangs";

        v) In invoking s8 of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  (Treatment  of
           Claimants etc) Act 2004 the Tribunal failed to consider that any
           finding under that section would be void because  the  Appellant
           has been found to have been trafficked; and

       vi) Failing to make any finding under the operative test on  Article
           8, as set out at paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  -  whether  there  are
           very significant obstacles to  the  Appellant's  integration  in
           Vietnam.

    7. Before me Mr McVeety for the Respondent accepted  without  hesitation
       that the grounds were made out. There was a lack of anxious  scrutiny
       in the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Mr  McVeety  was
       satisfied that the Tribunal had in particular  erred  in  failing  to
       address the detailed expert evidence of Professor Bluth.

    8. The parties agreed with me that the entire decision must be set aside
       and the decision remade. In view of the extensive nature of the  fact
       finding required it was agreed that this should  take  place  in  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

       Decision and Directions

    2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of  law  such
       that it must be set aside in its entirety.

    3. The decision in the appeal is to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal
       by Judge other than Judge Hone. The hearing is to be listed at Taylor
       House, with a Vietnamese interpreter and a time estimate of 3  hours.
       The Appellant is a vulnerable witness and this should be  taken  into
       account by the Judge hearing the appeal.

    4. There is an order for anonymity.

Unfortunately, on the morning of the hearing the Home Office experienced a
national outage of its internet system so Mr McVeety was unable to join
online. He was able to participate by telephone.
