Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms G Bexson
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case is a national of Ghana who was  born  on  25
    November 1953 so she is will soon be 65.  Having come to  this  country
    in April 2001 she has currently been here over seventeen years.

 2. The appellant in her first witness statement set out the  circumstances
    in which she came and the reasons why she never returned at the end  of
    her leave which she ought to have done.  What she says  about  this  is
    that she had been to this country before but returned in 2001 in  order
    to seek financial help from her brother-in-law who lived in the  UK  to
    support her children; she was unable to  obtain  this  and  there  were
    apparently disagreements with her family in  Ghana  because  by  custom
    after her first husband had died she had been expected to marry another
    person within that family but she had refused to do so.    Having  been
    left without financial support she felt she had no option other than to
    remain in this country.

 3. There is of course a large public  interest  in  enforcing  immigration
    control and that includes making it  clear  that  people  such  as  the
    appellant who have no right to remain in this  country  do  not  assume
    that they can just flout the Immigration Rules  and  remain  when  they
    have no right to do so.  However she did remain and after  having  been
    in this country for two years or so in 2003 she met Mr [K]; she saw him
    regularly and they formed  a  relationship  which  culminated  in  them
    moving in together in 2005.  They married in 2012.

 4. The respondent does not suggest that this is other than a genuine long-
    term permanent relationship or that the couple do  not  care  for  each
    other.  I add for the purposes of completeness as to this aspect of the
    case that having heard both the appellant and her husband give evidence
    I find that this is a genuine and subsisting relationship.

 5. The appellant made some attempts to obtain leave to remain  which  were
    unsuccessful but then in March 2016 she  applied  again  for  leave  to
    remain based on her family life with her husband under Article 8.  That
    application was  refused  and  her  appeal  against  this  refusal  was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge R G Walters in a decision  which
    was promulgated on 19 January 2018.   The  appellant  appealed  against
    this decision and  was  granted  permission  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Perkins who noted that the  judge  appeared  to  have  ignored  medical
    evidence which was contained within the file.

 6. The case then came before me  and  at  an  error  of  law  hearing  the
    respondent did not contest that as Judge Perkins  had  indicated  Judge
    Walters had indeed made a material error of law by ignoring the medical
    evidence.    It is for  this  reason  that  the  appeal  has  now  been
    relisted before me in the Upper Tribunal so that a fresh  decision  can
    be made.

 7. I gave directions on the last occasion as  to  further  evidence  which
    could usefully be served but the appellant has not been well served  by
    her solicitors, although I stress that none  of  the  fault  lies  with
    Counsel who has represented her  at  this  hearing.   It  appears  that
    although  some  instructions  were  given  by  the  appellant  to   her
    solicitors and material provided as well, this  was  not  forwarded  to
    Counsel or put in  as  evidence.   In  particular  there  was  evidence
    relating to the cost of medication which the appellant's husband  would
    require which was only put  before  the  Tribunal  today  after  I  had
    allowed a brief adjournment for this information to be  forwarded  from
    the appellant's solicitors who had had it for some considerable  period
    of time.

 8. Also although such evidence would have been helpful to the appellant no
    evidence was put before the Tribunal as to  the  cost  of  the  medical
    treatment in Ghana which Mr [K] would require if he was to move to that
    country, the sole income of the couple being just under �1,000 a  month
    from Mr [K]'s pension.  Accordingly this Tribunal has to do the best it
    can on the limited evidence available.

 9. The basis of the appellant's case is that, having regard to  paragraphs
    EX.1  and  EX.2  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Rules,   there   would   be
    insurmountable obstacles  to  the  appellant's  family  life  with  her
    husband  continuing  were  they  both  to  return  to  Ghana  and  that
    accordingly in these circumstances she should succeed under the  Rules.
    Insofar as the claim is based on Article 8 outside the Rules,  I  would
    of course have to have regard as the decision maker to what is set  out
    within Section 117B(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (inserted by the Immigration Act 2014) whereby it is provided  (at
    117B(4)(b)) that little weight should  be  given  to  the  relationship
    between the appellant and her husband because it was  "established  ...
    at a time when [the appellant was] in the United Kingdom unlawfully".

10. Also, by paragraphs 117B(4) and (5) I would have to give little  weight
    to the private life established by the appellant in this country during
    this time because it was established both when she was in this  country
    unlawfully  and  also  when  obviously  her  immigration   status   was
    precarious.

11. What is an "insurmountable obstacle" is defined within  paragraph  EX.2
    of Appendix FM as meaning "very significant difficulties which would be
    faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life
    together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail
    very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner".  As was made
    clear by the Supreme Court in the recently decided decision in  Agyarko
    and Ikuga [2017] UKSC 11 this is a high hurdle to be overcome.

12. As the Supreme Court in that decision made clear at paragraph  43,  the
    words "insurmountable obstacles" have to be  considered  on  the  basis
    that the decision maker has to ask itself  "whether  the  family  could
    'realistically' be expected to move".   Accordingly,  as  the  decision
    maker I now have to consider whether or not this couple could in  light
    of all the evidence which is now before the Tribunal "realistically" be
    expected to move.  This Tribunal has to ask itself whether or not  such
    difficulties as there may be, first of all would  be  very  significant
    and if so whether they could  not  be  overcome  without  very  serious
    hardship for either the appellant or her husband.

13. As I have already noted it would have been of great assistance if  this
    Tribunal had had before it better evidence relating to the difficulties
    both of access to medical treatment which the appellant's husband  will
    require (to which I will return in a moment) and also to  the  cost  of
    this treatment.

14. Mr Clarke on behalf of  the  respondent  very  properly  submits  (even
    though  I  do  not  for  reasons  which  follow  wholly  accept   these
    submissions) that in the absence of evidence as to what such  treatment
    would cost the court cannot assume that this couple  could  not  afford
    such treatment as would be required  and  could  not  assume  that  the
    pension (of under �1,000 a month), which is what  the  family's  income
    would be, would be insufficient to meet the costs of such treatment  as
    would be required in a poor country such as Ghana.

15. On behalf of the appellant, Ms  Bexson  submits  that  there  would  be
    difficulties which are apparent from the (admittedly now  very  out  of
    date) US State Department Report of 2010 which demonstrates that within
    Ghana healthcare is both difficult to access and not available  freely.
    Certainly, even though the medical reports are out of date, it is clear
    that Mr [K] would not be entitled to free medical care in Ghana and not
    all medical care is readily available, although as I have said there is
    insufficient evidence before the Tribunal to  enable  the  Tribunal  to
    make a precise finding as to the extent to which such medical  care  as
    might be necessary would be available or what it would cost.

16. Having this background in mind I  turn  now  to  consider  the  medical
    health of the appellant's husband which is the key factor in this case.
     Mr [K] is a 76 year  old  gentleman  who  is  a  British  citizen  and
    although of Ghanaian extraction has lived in this country for nearly 50
    years.  He was a teacher and during the course of evidence  spoke  with
    some passion and pride as to his previous career in which he had taught
    geography at a state school  to  O  level  students;  he  informed  the
    Tribunal that the results he obtained for his students  have  not  been
    bettered by subsequent teachers.  I have no reason to doubt other  than
    that the appellant's husband has been of great value to  the  community
    whose children he has served.

17. Although 76 should not these days be assumed to be "old" and there  are
    many people of that age who are in robust health unfortunately  Mr  [K]
    is not one of them.  There is  medical  evidence  before  the  Tribunal
    which although not necessarily as full as it might  be  is  nonetheless
    sufficient for this Tribunal to be  able  to  conclude  that  Mr  [K]'s
    condition might be properly described as frail.  Among  other  ailments
    he suffers from chronic kidney disease, he has  a  deteriorating  renal
    function, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, angina, dyslipidaemia,  sickle
    cell anaemia, sickle cell trait, cellulitis and an  enlarged  prostate.
    He also told me in evidence and I entirely accept that he has lost  the
    sight in his right eye and now has difficulties with his  left  eye  as
    well.  In addition he has severe hip problems.  He is very well  served
    as is his entitlement by the National Health Service  in  this  country
    and has a continuity of care which is of great assistance to  him.   It
    is hardly surprising given the  ailments  that  he  has  that  he  also
    suffers from hypertension and some depression.

18. The most recent medical evidence is from his GP,  Dr  Ahmed,  dated  20
    September 2018 who states that Mr [K]  is  "on  regular  treatment  and
    attends follow up clinic for his diabetes and hypertension review".  He
    also notes that for the last two years  Mr  [K]'s  health  "is  rapidly
    deteriorating and mentally he is much  stressed".   He  refers  to  his
    chronic kidney disease "due to diabetes and vascular disease" and  also
    refers to his arthritis of both hip joints, as well as low  back  pain.
    Mr [K] is reviewed by physiotherapists as well  and  is  under  regular
    treatment for his enlarged prostate.  He has persistent  dizziness  and
    he is off balance and often spinning following "his  insulin  dependent
    diabetes".  He is regularly reviewed by an endocrinologist.

19. I must have this medical condition in mind when I ask myself whether or
    not realistically this family could be expected to move to Ghana merely
    because they have not at the present moment put in compelling  evidence
    that the treatment which would be required would eat up  all  of  their
    income or that it would not be accessible.  As I indicated earlier I do
    not accept entirely the submission made by Mr Clarke that I should  not
    without such evidence make a finding that such treatment would  not  be
    available or affordable.

20. While it would have helped if precise figures had  been  produced  this
    couple does not have a  large  income,  being  dependent  on  Mr  [K]'s
    pension and the evidence which eventually was produced to the  Tribunal
    and which I accept was to the effect that the drugs which currently the
    appellant's husband takes would in Ghana cost in the region of �88  per
    month.  Clearly he would  also  have  to  pay  for  regular  visits  to
    hospital and to the various doctors he would need to see.  Currently in
    evidence and I have no reason to doubt that this evidence  is  entirely
    truthful Mr [K] visits a hospital for one reason or another on  average
    every fortnight, and he regularly sees his GP.   All  of  these  things
    would cost money in Ghana and also it is not at all clear just  how  he
    would access this treatment.

21. If forced to relocate to Ghana, this very frail man and his  64  or  65
    year old wife would between them have to locate a variety of  different
    doctors in order to  treat  the  various  ailments  for  which  Mr  [K]
    requires constant supervision and constant medication.   This  Tribunal
    does not consider that he can realistically be expected to relocate  to
    a country where he knows no doctors at the moment, where there is known
    to be difficulty of access to medical treatment in any event, and where
    the cost of such treatment is unknown.

22. As a matter of common humanity somebody in his  condition  and  at  his
    time of life should not be expected  (or  obliged)  to  relocate;  this
    Tribunal regards this as a paradigm case where there could properly  be
    said to be insurmountable obstacles to family life being  continued  in
    the country to which this couple would be obliged to go.  On the  facts
    of this case, the Tribunal is able to reach this decision even  without
    the detailed evidence as to accessibility and cost of  treatment  which
    could possibly have been made available had the appellant's  solicitors
    been more efficient  than  they  were.   The  appellant's  appeal  must
    accordingly be allowed within the Rules as EX.1 will apply in her case.



23. Having this in mind this is also in my  judgement  one  of  those  rare
    cases where the appeal should also be allowed outside the  Rules  under
    Article 8 because the circumstances are  sufficiently  compelling  that
    exceptionally it would not be proportionate to require  this  appellant
    and her husband to relocate to Ghana.

24. This Tribunal acknowledges that  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    consistent and effective immigration control is a strong one  and  that
    it is only exceptionally that in an individual case  the  circumstances
    would be so compelling that notwithstanding  this  public  interest,  a
    person should be allowed to remain under Article 8 outside  the  Rules.
    However the Tribunal  considers  the  facts  in  this  case  to  be  so
    compelling that it would be inhumane, in light of the very frail  state
    of health of Mr [K] which  is  overwhelmingly  obvious  both  from  the
    medical reports I have seen and from the  evidence  I  have  heard,  to
    require this couple to leave this country now.

25. It follows that this appeal must be allowed under Article 8  and  I  so
    find.

Notice of Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters  in  which  he
dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  the  respondent
refusing her application for leave to remain as containing a material  error
of law and remake the decision as follows:

The appellant's appeal is allowed, under Article 8.

No anonymity direction is made.
