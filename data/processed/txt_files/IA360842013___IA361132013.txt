Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Hayward (Counsel, instructed by Coram
                    Children's Legal Centre)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are mother and son and are nationals of India. They came
    to the UK as visitors in 2009 with the First Appellant's husband who is
    the father of the Second Appellant. The family did not leave the UK but
    overstayed. In May 2013 the husband was arrested attempting  to  remove
    the Second Appellant from the UK, he was later sentenced to  14  months
    imprisonment and subsequently he was deported to India. He is  referred
    to in this decision as the Defendant.

 2. The Appellants applied for leave to remain in  the  UK  on  asylum  and
    human rights grounds. The Appellants' case was and is that they  cannot
    return to India because of the danger posed to them  by  the  Defendant
    and members of his family who have threatened them and who will  target
    them in India. It is maintained that internal relocation  within  India
    is not reasonably available.

 3. The appeals were first heard by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant  at
    Hatton Cross on the 11th of December 2013. The appeals  were  dismissed
    for the reasons given in a determination promulgated  on  the  17th  of
    December 2013. In  the  determination  the  Judge  had  regard  to  the
    Appellants' immigration history, the support that they  were  receiving
    in the UK and found that they be expected to relocate within India  and
    that the best interests of the Second Appellant were to remain with the
    First Appellant and to return to India with her.

 4. The Appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal on  the  basis  that  the
    decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  made  no  reference  to  an
    expert's report relied on by them in support of their case.  Permission
    having been granted to the Upper Tribunal  the  issue  of  whether  the
    determination contained an error of law was heard by me on the  2nd  of
    July 2014.

 5. At that hearing I found that the decision did contain an error of  law,
    with reasons to be given in the final decision, and that it was  to  be
    relisted for a hearing on the  issues  of  the  Appellants'  return  to
    India, articles 2 and 3 and the contents of the expert's report. It  is
    not clear why the case then took over a year to re-appear for the final
    hearing and I take into  account  the  effect  of  that  delay  on  the
    Appellants and the uncertainty that they have had to contend with.

 6. The error of law concerned the consideration that the Judge  had  given
    to the expert report of Dr Gill. This was  relied  on  heavily  by  the
    Appellants to show that they could not safely return  to  India  or  be
    expected to relocate in the absence of male protection. The decision of
    the First-tier  Tribunal  made  no  reference  to  the  report  and  so
    contained no assessment of the evidence presented and  the  conclusions
    set out. Given that the report went to the principal issues of the case
    I found that in the absence of an assessment of that evidence and  with
    there being no discussion of how  it  related  to  the  other  evidence
    relied on by the Appellants the  determination  could  not  stand.  The
    intention was to remake the decision in the Upper Tribunal.

 7. Matters have moved on since the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The Defendant was deported to India as noted above. Thee Appellants now
    point to their being in fear of his family and now him with  the  added
    grievance that  he  has  been  imprisoned,  ejected  from  the  UK  and
    prohibited from returning. The facts were anticipated by Judge Grant in
    paragraph 17 of the determination, which remain unchallenged, where she
    found that the Defendant would pose a real risk to  the  Appellants  in
    her home areas in India.

 8. The decision in paragraph 17 was  predicated  on  the  basis  that  the
    Appellants would return to India before the Defendant  and  that  while
    they could not be expected to remain  with  family  members  in  either
    Gujerat or Hyderabad permanently they could return  in  the  short-term
    and use family support to  relocate  within  India.  Police  protection
    would not be  available  in  those  areas.  As  these  findings  remain
    undisturbed the issue is that of internal relocation.

 9. At  the  resumed  Upper  Tribunal  hearing  the  First  Appellant  gave
    evidence. This is set out in the Record of Proceedings and I  summarise
    it here. Her surname  is  Shia  Muslim  and  she  still  practices  her
    religion. Her mother lives  with  the  Appellant's  11  year  old  half
    brother in Hyderabad supported by the First Appellant's brother who  is
    a student and works part-time. Her mother has sisters  in  Gujerat  and
    Hyderabad and they are not her family. The family could not support her
    as they are struggling and now that she is single they would  not  take
    responsibility for her.

10. In cross-examination she said that her mother and step-father separated
    about 8 years ago, she did not know if he supported them  and  had  not
    asked. Her brother in the UK lives in west London,  she  did  not  know
    what he is studying and had  not  spoken  to  him  for  6  months,  his
    finances were limited and he would not  be  able  to  help.  The  First
    Appellant left school at 18 with no formal qualifications.  In  the  UK
    she had worked for people locally and had  done  henna  designing.  Her
    mother had bumped into the Defendant about 6 months ago. She is  closer
    to her mother now that she and the First  Appellant's  step-father  had
    separated. Any work available in India would be low paid,  about  ï¿½2  a
    month and she would not be able to pay for things.

11. Evidence was also given by  Ms  Pragna  Patel  of  the  Southall  Black
    Sisters dated the 6th of November 2014. The  report  is  in  the  Coram
    Children's Legal Centre bundle of December 2014. Her evidence was  that
    she born in Africa but is of Gujerati origin, has family there and  has
    visited India, most recently  in  July  2015.  In  the  course  of  her
    evidence she referred to the  Islamic  custom  of  a  father  receiving
    custody of a son and being entitled to ownership when the child reaches
    the age of 7 and that male preference is endemic. The view of women  as
    inferior is embedded in society.

12. Ms Patel also gave evidence on the prevalence of domestic violence  and
    the shame that divorce brings on a family as  well  as  the  danger  of
    being returned to husband despite the pleas of women to  the  opposite.
    There is the added complication  from  the  Appellant's  religion,  the
    nature of that community and the  increased  danger  of  violence  from
    state agents. Women's shelters were at best for short term respite  and
    these tended towards rehabilitating the woman back to  the  matrimonial
    or family home.

13. The improvement economically in India had not been translated  into  an
    improved position for women who were still  used  as  tools  and  dowry
    violence is on the increase. It would  be  wrong  to  assume  that  the
    Appellant's brother would provide for her,  he  would  be  expected  to
    provide for their mother but there would be no expectation  of  support
    for her.

14. In summary Ms Patel's evidence was that the Appellant would not be able
    to relocate  within  India.  She  lacked  the  education  or  financial
    resources to do so and did not have the  male  support  that  would  be
    required. In addition her husband would be entitled to custody  of  the
    Third Appellant and would  be  supported  in  that  both  socially  and
    legally. (That would be in addition to the findings of Judge Grant, set
    out above and unchallenged).

15. The Home Office rely on the Country Information and Guidance report for
    India relating to women  fearing  gender-based  harm/violence.  In  the
    section on Police and judicial  attitudes  and  responses  to  violence
    against women it was noted that the effectiveness  of  law  enforcement
    varied widely. Victims were often discouraged  from  reporting  to  the
    police through a fear of reprisals and the ability to pursue complaints
    was often not available to women. The report also refers to the  deeply
    entrenched patriarchal attitudes of those involved in enforcement which
    further  contributes  to  the  lack  of  reporting  and  withdrawal  of
    complaints.

16. The section on Single women contains  reports  that  single  women  are
    rejected by society  and  treated  with  indifference  by  the  federal
    government. A UN report of June 2013 reported that  certain  categories
    of women are extremely vulnerable to poverty and  that  includes  women
    who have been abandoned or are homeless.

17. With regard to the assistance available that section of the report sets
    out the  limitations  on  the  options  available  and  the  nature  of
    shelters. Whilst there are initiatives for women the other sections  of
    the report suggest that the effect they have even on the rare occasions
    they are available is limited, sporadic and unpredictable.

18. I start with the evidence of the First Appellant that was  accepted  in
    the first hearing that the Defendant, now back in India, would remain a
    source of danger to her in India. It was also  found  and  is  accepted
    that the First Appellant would, once the Defendant was back  in  India,
    be unable to remain in her home areas of Gujerat or Hyderabad.

19. The evidence that is set out above shows  that  the  Appellant  has  no
    effective male  support  or  protection  in  India  and  I  accept  the
    evidence. Whilst it is  possible  that  her  brother  did  not  provide
    support deliberately to enhance the Appellants' case I note that a lack
    of support from that quarter would  be  consistent  with  the  cultural
    norms that apply and there is nothing in the history  of  the  case  to
    suggest that the family do not operate within those norms. The evidence
    shows  that  the  First  Appellant  would  not  enjoy  male  protection
    elsewhere in India or that we would have access to financial support or
    that the very limited mechanisms of support would be  available  or  of
    use to her.

20. Added to the finding of the Defendant in the Appellants is the evidence
    that within the Muslim faith he would expect to receive custody of  the
    Second Appellant and would enjoy considerable support legally and  from
    state institutions in enforcing that expectation.

21. The burden is on the Appellants to show that they would be in danger in
    India and that return there  would  place  the  UK  in  breach  of  its
    obligations under the ECHR. As that is a  protection  issue  the  lower
    standard of proof, i.e. the real risk test, applies.  In  addition  the
    best interests of the Second Appellant have to be assessed as a primary
    consideration under the 2009 Act which may override the public interest
    in the maintenance of immigration control.

22. The combination of the findings previously made, the lack of  financial
    support  and  male  protection  and  the  absence  of  effective  state
    assistance and protection lead me to find that if the  Appellants  were
    to be returned to India there is a real risk  that  they  would  suffer
    treatment contrary to articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR. The  risk  is  that
    the First Appellant would be targeted  violently  and  for  the  Second
    Appellant the risk is that he may be targeted  violently  and/or  would
    again be abducted by the Defendant.

23. On that latter point I am satisfied that the previous  actions  of  the
    Defendant in trying to abduct the Second Appellant show clearly that he
    does not act in the best interests of the Second Appellant. There is no
    evidence suggesting that his best interests would be adequately  served
    by his being with his father in India rather than with his mother and I
    am satisfied that that is not the case.

24. With the danger to  the  Appellants  of  violence  and  abduction,  the
    absence of support and effective state protection and the inability  to
    relocate safely within India I find that the Appellants have shown that
    their removal would place the UK in breach of its obligations under the
    ECHR. The dangers there are such that it is in the  best  interests  of
    the Second Appellant to remain in the UK with his mother rather than to
    be exposed to the problems that would face them in India.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal allowing the appeal of the Appellants.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.)



Fee Award

In the light of the decision to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  (rule  23A
(costs) o f the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005  and
section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: Appeal allowed
