                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By a decision which is dated 16  October  2018,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Hanson found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law  such  that
    the decision fell to be set  aside.   His  reasons  for  reaching  that
    conclusion were as follows:

         "1.  The Secretary of State appeals with permission a  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox, promulgated on 4 May 2018, in  which
         the Judge allowed the appellant's appeal against  the  respondent's
         refusal to revoke a deportation order made on the 21 May 2013.  The
         Judge found that the decision was incompatible with the appellant's
         human rights.  The  reference  to  the  parties  as  appellant  and
         respondent is to their status as they appeared  before  the  First-
         tier Tribunal.

         Background

         2.   The appellant was born on 15 January 1973 and is a citizen  of
         the Democratic Republic of Congo. The appellant entered the  United
         Kingdom on 6 September 2003 and  claimed  asylum  on  11  September
         2003. The appellant secured a visit Visa in Addis Ababa on 20 March
         2003. On 30 September 2008 the appellant  was  convicted  at  Leeds
         Crown Court for possessing  a  false/improperly  obtained  identity
         document and sentenced to 6 months  imprisonment  suspended  for  2
         years. The appellant had been served with IS151A for  entering  the
         United Kingdom on a false document.

         3.   On 7 January 2010 the appellant was convicted at  Leeds  Crown
         Court for possessing a false/improperly obtained identity document,
         2 counts of failing  to  disclose  information  to  make  gain  for
         himself or to cause loss to another and  breach  of  the  suspended
         sentence.  The  Court  sentenced  the  appellant   to   16   months
         imprisonment four  months  of  which  resulted  from  the  original
         conviction.

         4.   The appellant's appeal against the order for  his  deportation
         from the United Kingdom  was  dismissed  on  20  August  2013.  The
         appellant became appeal rights exhausted on 7 January 2016. Further
         submissions were lodged on 18 April 2016 and 1 February 2017 with a
         request for the respondent to revoke the deportation order.

         5.   The  appellant  met  his  wife  in  2006  and  they  commenced
         cohabitation on 1 June 2008. On 11 June 2012 the appellant  married
         and on 26 June 2015 a child was born. The appellant and his  family
         live in Leeds with the appellant's wife working part-time with  the
         University of Leeds as an Educational Staff Development Coordinator
         with an annual income of �10,000.

         6.   The appellants nationality is not disputed nor that he  has  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife  and  a  parental
         relationship with his daughter.

         7.   The Judge at [42] sets out a  self-direction  that  ultimately
         the question to be determined is  how  a  fair  balance  should  be
         struck  between  the  competing  public  and  individual  interests
         involved.

         8.   It was accepted the appellant came within paragraph 398(b)  of
         the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  sole  issue  to  be   determined
         thereunder is whether it would be unduly harsh for the  appellant's
         daughter to remain in the United Kingdom if he was to be  deported.
         The Judge at [46] refers to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
         MM (Uganda) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  617  in  which  it  was  found  that
         assessing  whether  the  impact  is  'unduly  harsh'  requires   an
         assessment of the public interest in removing foreign criminals and
         the need for a proportionate interference in any article 8 rights.

         9.   The Judge was satisfied that great weight was to be  given  to
         the public interest in removing the appellant as a foreign criminal
         [50]. The Judge noted the appellant had been in the United  Kingdom
         unlawfully for over 14  years  and  is  the  subject  of  a  signed
         deportation  order  [51]  and  that  the  appellant  commenced  his
         relationship with his wife at a time he was in the  United  Kingdom
         unlawfully and his status precarious [52]. The Judge balances  this
         by reference to the appellant's daughter whom he takes  to  nursery
         and whom  he  looks  after  whilst  his  wife  is  working  at  the
         University [53].

         10.  The Judge attached no weight to  the  appellants  evidence  in
         light of his conviction for dishonesty  and  forceful  observations
         about his character made in the earlier decision [54] but noted the
         benefit of the appellant's  wife's  evidence.  At  [56]  the  Judge
         writes:

             "56. However, I have had the benefit of  [H]'s  evidence.  The
             Presenting Officer noted that she began the relationship  with
             her eyes open. She knew his immigration and  criminal  history
             and therefore knew  there  was  a  risk  that  they  could  be
             separated. He also noted that they had conceived a child prior
             to the previous hearing and submitted that this was an attempt
             to bolster his case. In my view, the  Presenting  Officer  has
             acted unfairly. This is a very serious accusation, but he  did
             not put this to the witness. She has not had an opportunity to
             respond  and  I  noted  that  she  told  me  that  she  had  a
             miscarriage at the time."

         11.  At [56] the Judge records he found the appellant's wife to  be
         an impressive witness leading to a  conclusion  at  [59]  that  the
         Judge felt able to go behind the assessment of the earlier tribunal
         as to the appellant's approach to the relationship.

         12.  The Judge took the child's best interests into  account  as  a
         primary consideration and concludes at [62] that he can  go  behind
         the earlier findings in respect of the child's  best  interests  on
         the basis that concerns recorded in 2013 did not reflect  the  true
         situation.

         13.  At [67- 78] the  Judge  draws  together  the  threads  of  the
         assessment in the following terms:

             "67.     I have found this appeal difficult to  determine  and
             issues are finely balanced.  The  Appellant  has  to  identify
             "very compelling reasons"  against  deportation.  On  the  one
             hand, the Appellant has 2 convictions for 5 offences committed
             between 30 September 2008 and 17 January  2010  including  for
             possession of a false documents and for  failing  to  disclose
             information to make gain for  himself  or  to  cause  loss  to
             another. The Presenting Officer advised that the cost  to  the
             public was approximately �14,000, a significant sum of money.

             68.  The Appellant also breached a suspended sentence. As  was
             noted  by  the  sentencing   judge,   this   is   particularly
             disquieting, as the first  judge  had  effectively  given  the
             Appellant a chance to change and he did not do so.

             69.  Further, the public interest  in  the  maintenance  of  a
             deportation order of those who have  committed  a  crime  goes
             well beyond merely depriving the offender in question from the
             chance to reoffend in the UK:  it  extends  to  deterring  and
             preventing serious crime generally  and  to  upholding  public
             abhorrence of such offending.

             70.  In addition, the  Appellant's  immigration  history  ways
             against him. He has been residing illegally in the UK for over
             14 years, married his wife, after deportation proceedings  had
             commenced and has been subject to deportation order for nearly
             5 years.

             71.  Notwithstanding the seriousness of the  offence  and  his
             extremely poor immigration history, on balance, I am satisfied
             that the Appellant discharged the  burden  of  proof.  He  has
             demonstrated that it would be unduly harsh for his daughter to
             remain in the UK without him.

             72.  Although the offences  are  serious,  significantly,  the
             sentencing judge when making a recommendation for deportation,
             stated "apparently.... I am required to  do  so"  (M4  of  the
             Respondent's first bundle). In my view, this suggests that the
             Judge may not have made the  recommendation,  if  they  had  a
             choice, in my view, this slightly dilutes the public  interest
             in the Appellants deportation. By way of possible  explanation
             for the Judge's possible reluctance, I  note  the  Judge  also
             describes the Appellant as a hard-working individual.

             73.  In addition, I am satisfied that there is a very low risk
             of the Appellant reoffending. The FTT had  not  been  able  to
             properly assess the risk of reoffending, but it is now over  8
             years since he committed any offence.  In  my  view,  this  is
             relevant, in so far as it demonstrates his commitment  to  the
             relationships with his wife and daughter.

             74.  Further, the Appellant's daughter is nearly 3  years  old
             and he shares responsibility for  her  with  his  wife.  I  am
             satisfied, in contrast to the FTT, that he has a positive  and
             formative role to play in her upbringing.  In  my  view,  this
             factor  is  very  significant  and  weighs  heavily   in   the
             Appellant's favour.

             75.  Further, the Appellant and his wife have been in a  long-
             term relationship for over 12 years. In my  view  this  is  an
             additional factor in the Appellant's favour. They  are  likely
             to provide a stable and loving environment for their daughter.

             76.  Although  the  Appellant  has  not  provided  independent
             evidence of the likely impact on the daughter, I am  satisfied
             that I can attach weight to his wife's evidence. The effect of
             the decision is that he will be permanently separated from his
             wife and daughter and that his wife told me that they will  be
             devastated.

             77.   Finally,  the  Respondent  conceded  that  it  would  be
             inappropriate for the child to leave the UK. In my view,  this
             is an  important  consideration.  I  attach  very  significant
             weight to the fact that the family unit  would  be  separated,
             probably permanently,  at  the  very  least  for  the  child's
             formative years. I am satisfied  that  this  would  be  wholly
             contrary to the child's best interests.

             78.  On the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that  the
             Appellant has demonstrated on balance that it would be  unduly
             harsh for his daughter to remain in the UK without him. In  my
             view, there are cumulatively,  very  compelling  factors  that
             outweigh  the  strong  public  interest  in   the   Appellants
             deportation. Accordingly, I am satisfied  that  the  Appellant
             meets the requirements of  paragraph  398,  having  regard  to
             sections 117 A - 117 C of the 2002 Act.

             79.  Although this is not determinative  of  the  appeal,  the
             Presenting Officer has not raised any other factors that weigh
             against the Appellant."

         14.  The Judge at [81] finds that the proposed interference in  the
         appellant's family life with his  daughter  is  unnecessary  having
         attached significant weight to the finding it will be unduly  harsh
         for the appellant's daughter to live in the United Kingdom  without
         him.

         15.  The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  which  was
         granted on 4 June 2018 by another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal,
         the operative part of the grant being in the following terms:

             "3.  The grounds argue failure to have regard to relevant case
             law and to identify anything sufficiently compelling about the
             Appellants circumstances. The relatively  brief  reasoning  at
             paragraphs 71 - 78 of the decision, indicating at paragraph 76
             the lack of any independent evidence as to the effect  on  the
             child of separation from  her  father,  supports  and  renders
             arguable this contention.

             4.   There is therefore an arguable error of law disclosed  by
             the application."

         Error of law

         16.  The appellant's appeal is against the respondent's refusal  to
         revoke the deportation order on the basis that doing so will breach
         his human rights and/or those of his family. It  was  conceded  the
         key issue in relation to this matter is the question of whether the
         appellant's removal  will  be  unduly  harsh  upon  his  3-year-old
         daughter.

         17.  Whilst the focus of the Judge upon  the  relationship  between
         the appellant, his wife, and daughter was an integral part  of  the
         process, the Judge was required to undertake it  is  arguable  from
         reading the decision that it appears the Judge based  the  decision
         to allow the appeal upon such relationship  without  an  adequately
         assessment of the question of whether the appellant's removal would
         be 'unduly harsh'.

         18.  In MM (Uganda) and [2016] EWCA Civ 450 it was  held  that  the
         phrase 'unduly harsh' plainly meant the same in section 117C(5)  of
         the 2002 Act as it did in paragraph 399 of the  Immigration  Rules.
         It was an ordinary English expression coloured by its context.  The
         context invited emphasis on two factors: first, the public interest
         in the removal of foreign criminals and, secondly, the need  for  a
         proportionate assessment of any interference with Article 8 rights.
         The public interest factor was expressly vouched by  Parliament  in
         section 117C(1). Section 117C(2) provided that the more serious the
         offence committed, the greater the public interest in  deportation.
         That steered the tribunals and the court  towards  a  proportionate
         assessment  of  the  criminal's  deportation  in  any  given  case.
         Accordingly, the more pressing the public interest in his  removal,
         the harder it would be to show that the  effect  on  his  child  or
         partner would be unduly harsh. Any other approach  would  dislocate
         the 'unduly harsh' provisions from  their  context  such  that  the
         question of undue hardship would be decided wholly  without  regard
         to the force of the public interest in deportation. In such a  case
         'unduly' would  be  mistaken  for  'excessive',  which  imported  a
         different  idea.  What  was  due  or  undue  depended  on  all  the
         circumstances, not merely the impact on the child or partner in the
         given case. The expression 'unduly harsh' in  section  117C(5)  and
         paragraph  399(a)  and  (b)  required  consideration  of  all   the
         circumstances, including the criminal's  immigration  and  criminal
         history.

         19.  In IT (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ 932 it was held that the First-
         tier Tribunal had  not  given  appropriate  weight  to  the  public
         interest when revoking a deportation order made against  a  foreign
         criminal. The undue harshness  standard  in  section  117C  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, read in  the  context
         of the Immigration Rules, meant that a deportee had to  demonstrate
         that there were very compelling reasons for revoking a  deportation
         order before its expiry.

         20.  It is accepted the Judge makes reference to some of the  above
         case law and takes into account the appellant's immigration history
         and criminality  and  the  consequential  decision  to  deport  the
         appellant from the United Kingdom which was upheld on appeal.  This
         is therefore not an appeal against the initial decision  to  deport
         or an assertion that making such a decision would  be  contrary  to
         the appellant's human rights,  as  an  appeal  on  that  basis  was
         dismissed by the First-Tier Tribunal earlier as noted by the Judge.

         21.  The appellant's argument is that even though  the  deportation
         order had not been executed, in that the  appellant  has  not  been
         removed  from  the  United  Kingdom,  to  do  so  now  would  be  a
         disproportionate breach of his protected rights.

         22.  The Judge was arguably correct  not  to  find  that  would  be
         unduly harsh for the appellant's  wife  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom without him as there was no  evidence  to  support  such  a
         contention and the parties were  fully  aware  of  the  appellant's
         immigration history when they entered into their relationship.

         23.  The Judge seems  to  be  of  the  opinion  that  the  physical
         separation of the appellant from his daughter is  a  major  factor,
         but this is the effect of deportation.

         24.  It is arguable the Judge was required to do more than to  find
         that, even if contrary to the child's best interest to be separated
         from her father, this  meant  the  requisite  test  was  satisfied.
         Whilst accepting  a  strong  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
         removal it is made out the Judge  did  not  properly  consider  all
         relevant factors and undertake the exercise required  of  him  when
         applying the undue harshness test.

         25.  The submission on the appellant's behalf that  the  Judge  did
         not make the decision in isolation is not made out, as the  failure
         to assess matters by reference to relevant case law, as referred to
         in the Secretary of States application for permission to appeal and
         subsequent submissions, indicates this is precisely what the  Judge
         did.

         26.  The submission there was no possibility of  contact  with  the
         child if the appellant  was  deported  was  not  made  out  on  the
         evidence. Even if physical contact will be problematic in terms  of
         the child travelling to the DRC it is not made out indirect contact
         could not be facilitated or anything adverse in the nature  of  the
         relationship and contact between the appellant and the child  being
         changed  to  such  a  basis,  beyond  the  impact  of  the  initial
         separation.

         27.  The Judge noted the child was 3 years of age but there was  no
         independent evidence, contrary to submissions to  the  contrary  at
         the Initial hearing, to  support  the  contention  that  separation
         would be unduly harsh by reference to any adverse impact  upon  the
         child.

         28.  Although it was submitted that the circumstances  justify  the
         decision and that is in the range of those reasonably open  to  the
         Judge on the evidence this  argument  cannot  be  substantiated  in
         light of the failure of the Judge to consider all the evidence with
         the required degree of anxious scrutiny and undertake the  required
         legal test.

         29.  It is not disputed  that  the  appellant  may  have  a  strong
         relationship with his daughter and she with him, but  this  is  not
         the determinative factor, per se.

         30.  There is merit in Mrs Peterson's argument that the Judge  gave
         more weight to the evidence of the wife  and  therefore  failed  to
         address a proper test set out  in  case  law  and  to  make  proper
         findings in relation to the same.

         31.  I find the Secretary of State has made out his case  and  find
         material error of law in  the  decision  to  allow  the  appeal  in
         relation to the finding  that  the  appellant's  removal  from  the
         United  Kingdom  would  have  unduly  harsh  consequences  for  his
         daughter, such as to make the decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
         deportation order disproportionate. The decision of the  First-Tier
         Tribunal shall be set aside. The appellant's immigration, criminal,
         and family  history  shall  be  preserved  findings  as  shall  the
         findings in relation to the nature of the relationship between  the
         appellant, his wife and their daughter. The issue to be  determined
         remains whether the effect of  the  appellant's  removal  from  the
         United Kingdom upon his daughter will be unduly harsh in  light  of
         the fact that neither the appellant's wife nor daughter are  to  be
         removed from the United Kingdom; making  this  a  family  splitting
         case.

         32.  The appeal shall be further considered by the  Upper  Tribunal
         in accordance with the following directions:

             a.   List for a Resumed hearing before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
             Hanson on the next available date sitting  at  Bradford.  Time
             estimate 3 hours.

             b.   If the appellant requires an interpreter for the purposes
             of giving evidence his representative must advise the Tribunal
             of the language and dialect required, no later  than  14  days
             from receipt of this decision.

             c.   The appellant must file with the Upper Tribunal and serve
             upon the respondent's representatives a consolidated, indexed,
             and paginated bundle containing all the  documentary  evidence
             upon which he intends to rely no later than 4 PM  23  November
             2018. Witness statements in the bundle must be signed,  dated,
             and contain a declaration  of  truth.  Such  statements  shall
             stand as the evidence in chief  of  the  maker  who  shall  be
             tended  for  the  purposes  of   cross-examination   and   re-
             examination only.

             d.   Evidence not filed in  accordance  with  the  time  limit
             provided above shall not be  admissible  without  the  express
             permission of the Upper Tribunal, such permission to be sought
             by a proper application filed before  the  expiration  of  the
             time limit  which  clearly  identifies:  (i)  the  reason  for
             failure  to  comply  with  this  direction,  (ii)  the  person
             responsible, (iii) the nature of the evidence the appellant is
             unable to file within the specified time limit and  the  issue
             it seeks to address, (iv) when such evidence is likely  to  be
             available, (v) whether the respondent consents to the evidence
             being provided late, and (vi) the effect on any  hearing  date
             of that evidence being provided outside the permitted period.

         Decision

         33.  The First-Tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set
         aside the decision of the original  Judge.  This  appeal  shall  be
         managed in accordance with the directions set out above  to  enable
         the Upper Tribunal to substitute a  decision  to  either  allow  or
         dismiss the appeal."

 2. Following the making of a transfer order,  I  heard  the  appeal  at  a
    resumed hearing on 6 December 2018 at  Bradford  when  Mr  Sobawale  of
    Counsel appeared for the appellant and Mrs  Pettersen,  a  Senior  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, appeared for the respondent.

 3. Particulars of the appellant's offending  and  the  preserved  findings
    from the First-tier Tribunal are contained in Judge  Hanson's  decision
    [31].  Judge Hanson summarised the issue before the resumed hearing  as
    being

         "whether the effect of the  appellant's  removal  from  the  United
         Kingdom upon his daughter will be unduly harsh in light of the fact
         that neither the appellant's wife nor daughter are  to  be  removed
         from the United Kingdom; making this a family splitting case."

 4. The appellant gave evidence in English.  He explained that he cared for
    his daughter on a  "day-to-day  basis".   He  did  not  want  to  be  a
    "stereotypical father" who left childcare entirely to the mother.   The
    appellant cannot work so he spends a lot  of  time  with  her.   Cross-
    examined by Mrs Pettersen,  he  explained  that  his  daughter  attends
    nursery  three  days  a  week  (Tuesday,  Wednesday,  Thursday).    The
    appellant's wife had never been to DRC.  The appellant  said  that  his
    wife's brother, parents and sister lived in Leeds but that they did not
    support the family financially.  The  appellant's  wife  works  at  the
    University of Leeds.

 5. I heard evidence from Mrs [M].  She also spoke in English  and  adopted
    her written statement as her evidence-in-chief.

 6. I reserved my decision.

 7.  As  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  observed,  the  appellant's
    immigration history is very poor.  He  had  resided  illegally  in  the
    United Kingdom for over fourteen years and has got married during  that
    period indeed doing so after the deportation proceedings had  commenced
    against him; he has been subject to a deportation order for five years.
     The appellant had also breached a suspended sentence.

 8. The appellant has to show that he falls within the Exception set out in
    Section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act:

         'Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.'

 9. I have read and agree with Judge Hanson's summary of the  jurisprudence
    concerning the meaning of "unduly harsh" at [18] of his  error  of  law
    decision.  The appellant's child was born in June 2015 so  is  3  years
    old.

10. Mr Sobawale submitted that the appellant's offence was not particularly
    serious, set against deportation occasioned by  offences  of  violence,
    drugs or of a sexual nature.  However, what is clear from KO  (Nigeria)
    2018 UKSC 53 is that the nature of the father or the parent's offending
    is not a consideration in the determination of the best interests of  a
    child.  Just as the seriousness of offending should not  feature  as  a
    factor raising the threshold of "best interests"  or,  indeed,  "unduly
    harsh" so the converse must  also  pertain.   Even  assuming  that  the
    appellant's offending can be categorised as "less  serious"  (and  that
    remains debateable) that cannot be a factor  which  renders  separation
    unduly harsh and which impacts  on  the  child's  best  interests  more
    readily than would have been the case with  "more  serious"  offending.
    Offending is essentially neutral as a factor in the analysis.

11. Both advocates at the resumed hearing discussed the possibility of  the
    family having to meet up in a third country (Mrs Pettersen suggested  a
    "tourist  destination")  for  face-to-face  meetings  given  that  both
    parties accept that the DRC is currently too dangerous for  either  the
    appellant's wife or the child to visit. Taking a 'real world'  view,  I
    find that there is little likelihood of direct contact  occurring  even
    infrequently in a third country.  I consider that this appeal has to be
    determined on the basis that the physical separation of  the  appellant
    and his partner and child are likely to be long term and  that,  whilst
    there may possibly be sporadic contact face-to-face, the maintenance of
    any relationship will have to occur by way of  written  and  electronic
    communications.  The question, therefore, is whether, given the  nature
    of the separation as I have characterised it, it would still be  unduly
    harsh for the child and her partner to be separated from the appellant.

12. Judge Hanson drew attention to the absence of any independent  evidence
    regarding the likely effect of separation from the appellant  upon  the
    child.  However, I also record Mr Sobawale's submission that  it  is  a
    difficult to see what meaningful  evidence  could  be  produced  by  an
    expert given that the child is only 3 years old.

13. Whilst I am sympathetic to Mr  Sobawale's  submission,  that  the  fact
    remains there is no evidence to support his  submission  (see  skeleton
    argument at [14]) that the impact of removal

         "... on A's daughter would be in the short, medium  and  long  term
         surpass the level of harshness deemed acceptable for the  child  of
         any deportee in a family  split  case  given  that  the  prevailing
         country situation in the DRC precludes the appellant's  partner  or
         daughter from ever visiting or maintaining a  family  life  of  any
         substance following A's forced removal."

    In a great many cases where families are split, the non-resident parent
    completely ceases contact with the child.  Such a definitive separation
    may occur when all the parties are in the same country let  alone  when
    they are separated by thousands of miles as will occur in  the  instant
    appeal.  The reality in this case is that the parent and child will  be
    completely separated at least for the foreseeable future.   However,  I
    find that such a separation does not  involve  a  degree  of  harshness
    which would go beyond what would necessarily  be  faced  by  any  child
    whose parent is deported.  A  finding  of  undue  harshness,  like  any
    finding, can only be made if there is evidence to support  it  and,  in
    this case, there is no evidence to show the impact  of  deportation  on
    the child would extend beyond what one would  expect  in  any  case  of
    separation thereby rendering it 'unduly' as opposed  to  only  'harsh'.
    Mr Sobawale's submission that the impact of separation  on  this  child
    would 'surpass the level of harshness deemed acceptable for  the  child
    of any deportee' is simply not supported by any evidence. I  appreciate
    the difficulties faced by the appellant and  his  representatives.  The
    child is so young that it would  be  pointless  and,  indeed,  probably
    harmful to ask how the  child  may  feel  if  the  father  were  to  be
    deported, questions which a child of such an age is unlikely to be able
    even to comprehend let alone answer coherently.   With  no  enthusiasm,
    therefore, I am drawn to the conclusion that the appellant  has  failed
    to satisfy the provisions of the Exception set out in Section  117C(5).
    In consequence, the appeal is dismissed.
