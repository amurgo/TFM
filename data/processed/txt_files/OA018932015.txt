Representation:

For the Appellant:     No Appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 3 June  1983.  She  has
      been given permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Thorne, dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's
      decision to refuse to grant her entry clearance to the UK as a partner
      under Appendix FM of the immigration rules.

   2. The appellant's application was refused on 26 November  2014,  on  the
      basis that the respondent was not satisfied that her relationship with
      her sponsor was genuine and subsisting and was not satisfied that  she
      was seeking entry to enable her marriage to the sponsor to take place.
      The application was also refused on the basis that the respondent  was
      not satisfied that the appellant and her  partner  would  be  able  to
      maintain and accommodate themselves  adequately  without  recourse  to
      public funds.


   3. With regard to the latter, the respondent accepted  that  the  sponsor
      was exempt from meeting the requirements  of  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of
      Appendix FM as he was in receipt  of  Personal  Independence  Payments
      (PIPs). Accordingly the appellant had to show that the sponsor  had  a
      level of income less housing costs that was greater than or  equal  to
      the weekly income support level of  a  couple  of  �113.70  per  week,
      �492.70 per month.  The  respondent  noted  that  the  sponsor  earned
      �2848.75 from non-salaried employment in the six months prior  to  the
      application, which was �474.79 a month. When added to  the  amount  of
      PIPs received, and after deducting monthly housing costs, that left  a
      net income of �427.40 a month, which was  not  adequate  to  meet  the
      requirements of the rules in E-ECP 3.3(b).

   4. The appellant appealed against that decision. Her appeal was heard  in
      the First-tier Tribunal on 24 June 2015 by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Thorne. The sponsor did not attend the  hearing  but  the  appellant's
      legal representative attended. The judge noted that the  sponsor  was,
      by then, in the terminal stage of rectal cancer and did not have  long
      to live. The judge accepted that the appellant and sponsor were  in  a
      genuine and subsisting relationship and had intended to live  together
      and marry. However he found that the  financial  requirements  of  the
      rules could not be met and he dismissed the appeal on that  basis.  He
      also considered Article 8 but concluded that the respondent's decision
      did not breach the appellant's human rights.

   5. Permission to appeal that decision was sought on the grounds that  the
      judge had erred by finding that the  sponsor's  level  of  income  was
      insufficient to meet the income support level, when it was;  that  the
      judge had failed to take account of the offer of third party  support;
      and that the judge had  erred  in  concluding  that  the  respondent's
      decision did not breach the appellant's Article 8 rights.

   6. Permission was granted on 24 November 2015.

   7. At the hearing before me, there was no appearance by  the  appellant's
      solicitors. Enquiries revealed that they  were  no  longer  instructed
      following the unfortunate death of the sponsor.


   8. Mr McVeety made brief submissions and I  indicated  that  I  would  be
      upholding the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision,  although  sadly  the
      outcome of the hearing makes little difference to the appellant now.

Consideration and findings

   9.  In the absence of any representative for the appellant  I  have  some
      difficulty in ascertaining how the calculations set out in the grounds
      of appeal at [5] were made, in regard  to  the  sponsor's  income.  It
      seems to me that the judge's calculations reflected those made by  the
      respondent and were the correct ones on the evidence available. It  is
      clear that, by the time of the respondent's decision, the sponsor  was
      sadly  already  ill  and  that  his  hours  of  work   were   reducing
      significantly. As the letter from his employer  at  page  128  of  the
      appeal bundle showed, he was paid by the hour and  was  not  salaried,
      and it is no doubt due to his deteriorating health that a  calculation
      of his income in the six months  before  the  application  produced  a
      lower calculation of average monthly income than a calculation  taking
      account of the previous 12 months. Sadly the calculation based on  the
      previous six months more accurately reflected the  true  position  and
      the judge therefore  properly  found  that  the  appellant  could  not
      demonstrate that the sponsor would be able  to  maintain  her  to  the
      required level in the UK.

  10. As to the failure to take account of third party support,  I  find  no
      evidence of the level of such support in the evidence that was  before
      the judge, even if he was able to take account of third party  support
      in  considering  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet   the   financial
      requirements of the rules. I do not consider that  any  error  of  law
      arises in that respect.


  11. With regard to Article 8, it is clear that the  judge  gave  full  and
      careful consideration to the appellant's circumstances and to those of
      the sponsor, and was sympathetic to their situation. His reference  at
      [63(vii)] to Yemen  and  to  the  related  circumstances  was  clearly
      included in error, but it is also plain that it had no material impact
      on his decision. Having given detailed consideration to  all  relevant
      matters the judge gave cogent reasons for concluding that  the  public
      interest outweighed the interests of the appellant and sponsor. He was
      entitled to conclude as he did on the evidence before him.

  12. For all of these reasons I find that the judge's decision,  under  the
      immigration rules, and in relation to Article  8,  was  one  that  was
      fully and properly open to him and that it contains no errors of  law.
      Accordingly, I uphold the judge's decision.

DECISION

  13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
