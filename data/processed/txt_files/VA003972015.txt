                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Maciel of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 6th September 2016.

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan, born 1st  January  1947.
    She is now 70 years of age.

 3. On 15th November 2014 the Appellant applied for a visa to enable her to
    visit relatives in the United Kingdom.  In  her  application  form  she
    indicated that she wished to visit for approximately two  months.   She
    stated that she is married and lives with her  husband  Fazal  Hussain.
    The couple  have  adult  children,  but  no  dependent  children.   The
    Appellant described herself as being supported by her husband and other
    family members and friends.  She explained that she wished to visit the
    United Kingdom to visit her uncle who is in ill-health,  and  that  she
    also intended to visit her daughters, sons, brothers, uncles and  aunts
    and their family members,  who  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom.   She
    explained that it would be more convenient  for  her  to  visit  family
    members in the United Kingdom,  rather  than  family  members  have  to
    travel to visit her in Pakistan.

 4. The Appellant submitted with her application an affidavit from Mubashar
    Hassan, her  son-in-law  who  confirmed  that  he  and  his  wife,  the
    Appellant's daughter live with the Appellant, and he is responsible for
    working the family farm and selling the produce.   The  Appellant  also
    submitted an affidavit from her husband, in which  he  confirms  owning
    agricultural land, and confirms  that  his  son-in-law  cultivates  the
    crops.  The  Appellant  submitted  a  statutory  declaration  from  her
    brother Nisar Ahmed, in which he confirmed that he would  pay  for  her
    trip to the United Kingdom and maintain and accommodate her during  her
    stay in this country.

 5. The application was refused on  27th  November  2014.   The  Respondent
    referred to paragraph 41(i) and (ii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  not
    being satisfied that the Appellant was genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
    visitor for a limited period, nor that she intended to leave the United
    Kingdom.  The Respondent noted  that  the  Appellant's  husband's  bank
    statement showed only interest payments,  whereas  the  bank  statement
    submitted by the Appellant showed funds equivalent to ï¿½1,182, deposited
    just prior to the visa application.  There was no evidence  as  to  the
    provenance of those funds.  The Respondent was not satisfied  that  the
    funds would be genuinely  available  to  the  Appellant,  or  that  the
    balance in her bank statement was an accurate reflection of  her  usual
    financial position.

 6. The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant had demonstrated  that
    she was in receipt of an income in Pakistan, and noted that funds  were
    sent from the United Kingdom.  The Respondent was  not  satisfied  that
    the Appellant had ties to Pakistan.

 7. The Appellant appealed to the FtT.  It was contended that funds in  the
    Appellant's bank account had been supplied by her family in the  United
    Kingdom.  Her husband had supported her financially and the family  own
    land.  The Appellant would return to Pakistan as her husband and family
    members reside there.  The Appellant has  family  both  in  the  United
    Kingdom and Pakistan.   It  was  contended  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 were satisfied, and the refusal breached Article 8 of  the
    1950 European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 8. The FtT heard the appeal on 10th August 2016.  Evidence  was  given  by
    one of the Appellant's daughters Khurshid Rehman, and one of  her  sons
    Tohid Hussain.  The FtT found that the Appellant is partially dependent
    financially upon relatives in the United Kingdom although she  and  her
    husband have their own home, and receive an  income  from  their  land.
    The FtT found that the Appellant made a genuine application  for  leave
    to enter as a visitor and genuinely intended to remain for a period  of
    up to six months, and thereafter  return  to  Pakistan  to  rejoin  her
    husband and other close relatives.

 9. However the FtT found that this was not the issue in  the  appeal,  and
    that the Appellant only had a right of appeal on human rights  grounds.
    The FtT found that the Appellant had not established family  life  with
    her relatives in the United Kingdom, nor had she established a  private
    life in this country.  Therefore Article 8 was  not  engaged,  and  the
    appeal was dismissed.

10. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    In summary the Appellant contended that the FtT had  erred  in  law  by
    failing to give any reasons for concluding that  family  life  did  not
    exist between the Appellant and her children in the United Kingdom.  If
    the FtT had properly directed itself, it would have found  that  family
    life did exist which engaged Article 8.  While  it  was  accepted  that
    something more than normal emotional ties must exist in order to engage
    family life between an adult parent and adult child, the FtT found that
    the Appellant was partly financially dependent upon her children in the
    United Kingdom.

11. It was also contended that even if the Appellant did not have a  family
    life with her children in the United Kingdom, Article 8 was engaged  on
    the basis of her private life, as she had a large number  of  relatives
    in the United Kingdom, including grandchildren,  and  wanted  to  visit
    them.

12. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge Grant-Hutchison  of
    the FtT, but subsequently granted by Mr Justice Mitting sitting in  the
    Upper Tribunal, who found it arguable on the facts found  by  the  FtT,
    that the Appellant did enjoy family life with her  UK  based  children,
    their spouses and her direct UK based descendants.

13. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  In summary it was contended that  the  FtT  had  not  materially
    erred in law.  It  was  open  to  the  FtT  to  find  on  the  evidence
    presented, that family life which would engage Article 8 did not exist.
     If the appeal could not succeed with  reference  to  family  life,  it
    could not succeed with reference to private life.

14. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.



The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of law

15. Mr Rai relied upon the grounds seeking permission to  appeal,  together
    with the grant of permission.  I was asked to find that  there  was  an
    absence of adequate reasons for the conclusion reached by the FtT  that
    family life did not exist.

16. Mr Armstrong relied upon the rule 24 response and  submitted  that  the
    FtT had not erred, and the evidence submitted by the Appellant did  not
    disclose further elements of dependency.

17. Mr Rai responded by pointing out that the FtT had  made  a  finding  of
    partial financial dependency.

18. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my  decision  which  I
    now give.

19. I am  persuaded  that  the  FtT  did  not  give  adequate  reasons  for
    concluding that family life was not engaged between the  Appellant  and
    her relatives in the United Kingdom.  I set out below the head note  to
    Budhathoki (reasons for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC);

         It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for  First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate  approach  to  deciding  cases.   It   is,   however,
         necessary for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the
         evidence and explain in clear and brief  terms  their  reasons,  so
         that the parties can understand why they have won or lost.

20. Although the FtT referred to case law  on  the  issue  of  family  life
    between adults, the conclusion at paragraph 30 that there is no  family
    life in existence for the purposes of  Article  8,  is  not  adequately
    reasoned, and I accept the Appellant's contention that it is not  clear
    why this conclusion was reached.

21. When I announced that I was reserving my decision as to error of law  I
    asked the representatives for their proposals,  in  the  event  that  I
    found a material error of law.  No Sponsor or  witnesses  had  attended
    the error of law hearing.  Both representatives indicated that it would
    be appropriate, if an error of law was found, for the Upper Tribunal to
    remake the decision without the necessity of a further hearing,  taking
    into account the evidence that was before the FtT.  Having reflected, I
    find this to be an appropriate course of action.

Remaking the Decision

22. I have taken into account the  documents  that  were  before  the  FtT.
    There is a Respondent's bundle containing 42 pages, Notice  of  Appeal,
    and an Appellant's bundle comprising  59  pages.   I  have  taken  into
    account all the evidence, including the witness statements.

23. The issue to be decided in this  appeal  is  whether  the  Respondent's
    decision breaches Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights which I set out below;

         Right to Respect for Private and Family Life

         1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his private  and  family
             life, his home and his correspondence.

         2.   There should be no interference by a public authority with the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

24. The burden of proof is on the Appellant  to  show  that  Article  8  is
    engaged.  The standard of proof is a balance of probability.

25. I have adopted the five stage approach advocated in Razgar [2004]  UKHL
    27, which indicates that the following questions should be  considered;



      i) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public  authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?

     ii) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity  as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    iii) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

     iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society  in
         the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
         well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
         for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
         the rights and freedoms of others?

      v) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate  public
         end sought to be achieved?

26. The decision in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 means that if Article  8  is
    engaged, I must consider the family lives of all members of the family,
    not only the Appellant.

27. Although Razgar relates to a removal case,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    principles are appropriate when considering an entry clearance  appeal.



28. I have regard to the guidance given in AG (Eritrea) [2007] EWCA Civ 801
    at paragraph 28, in which it is  stated,  in  summary,  that  while  an
    interference with private or family life must  be  real  if  it  is  to
    engage Article 8(1) the threshold of engagement is not a specially high
    one.

29. The Upper Tribunal in Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261
    (IAC) stated at paragraph 9 which I set out below in part,

         The first question to be addressed in an appeal against refusal  to
         grant entry clearance as a visitor where only human rights  grounds
         are available is whether Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged  at  all.
         If it is not, which will not infrequently be the case, the Tribunal
         has no jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment of the decision of
         the ECO under the rules and should not do so.

30. The Upper Tribunal in Mostafa (Article 8  in  entry  clearance)  [2015]
    UKUT 00112 (IAC) stated at paragraph 24 which I set out below in  part;



         Thus we refrain from suggesting that, in this  type  of  case,  any
         particular kind of relationship would always attract the protection
         of Article 8(1) or that other kinds  of  relationship  would  never
         come within its scope.  We are, however, prepared to  say  that  it
         will only be in very unusual circumstances that a person other than
         a close relative will be able to show that  the  refusal  of  entry
         clearance comes within the scope of  Article  8(1).   In  practical
         terms this is likely to be limited to cases where the  relationship
         is that of husband and wife or  other  close  life  partners  or  a
         parent and minor child and even then it  will  not  necessarily  be
         extended to cases where, for example, the proposed visit  is  based
         on a whim or will not add significantly to the time that the people
         involved spend together.

31. In this appeal one of the main reasons for the proposed  visit  was  to
    enable the Appellant to visit her elderly uncle who was in  ill-health.
    Sadly he passed away before the FtT hearing took place.  The  Appellant
    indicated in her witness statement that she still wished to  visit  her
    family in Birmingham and London in the UK, and would like to attend the
    wedding of her niece on 30th July 2016.  The Appellant  confirmed  that
    she has far more ties in Pakistan than in the UK,  and  that  she  only
    wished to undertake a short visit to have a  holiday  with  her  family
    members in the UK, which would include visiting her uncle's grave.

32. The Appellant has at least one adult sibling  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    that being Nisar Ahmed, and according to her daughter who gave evidence
    before the FtT, Khurshid Rehman, she has  nine  children,  and  two  of
    those children live in Pakistan.   There  are  seven  children  and  23
    grandchildren in the  United  Kingdom  and  some  great  grandchildren.
    There are six grandchildren in Pakistan.

33. I have to decide whether the Appellant has established family life with
    her relatives in the UK, that would  engage  Article  8.   Perhaps  the
    appropriate starting point is paragraph 25 of Kugathas [2003] EWCA  Civ
    31 in  which  Lady  Justice  Arden  stated  that  family  life  is  not
    established between an adult child and his surviving  parent  or  other
    siblings unless something more exists than normal emotional ties.  Such
    ties might exist if the Appellant was dependent on his family  or  vice
    versa.  It is not essential that members of the family should be in the
    same country, although it will probably be exceptional if  family  life
    was found between family members living in different countries.

34. I then move to consider Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC) and  note  that
    paragraphs 50-62 of this decision were  specifically  approved  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Gurung and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 8.  In Ghising  it
    was accepted that the judgment in Kugathas  had  been  interpreted  too
    restrictively in the past  and  ought  to  be  read  in  the  light  of
    subsequent decisions of the domestic  and  Strasbourg  Courts.   Family
    life may continue between parent and child even  after  the  child  has
    attained his majority.

35. The Upper Tribunal found that the issue under Article  8(1)  is  highly
    fact sensitive.  Rather than applying a blanket  rule  with  regard  to
    adult children, each case should be  analysed  on  its  own  facts,  to
    decide whether or not family life exists, within the meaning of Article
    8(1).

36. At paragraph 61 of Ghising there was reference to AA v  United  Kingdom
    (application no 8000/08), in which it  was  found  that  a  significant
    factor will be whether or not the adult child has founded a  family  of
    his own.  If he is still single and living  with  his  parents,  he  is
    likely to enjoy family life with them.

37. I have also considered Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 630 and I  set  out  below
    paragraph 24;

         24.  I do not think that the judgments to  which  I  have  referred
             lead to any difficulty in determining the correct approach  to
             Article 8 in cases involving adult children.  In the  case  of
             adults, in the context of immigration  control,  there  is  no
             legal or factual presumption as to the existence or absence of
             family life for the purposes of Article 8.  I point  out  that
             the approach of the European Commission for Human Rights cited
             approvingly in Kugathas did not  include  any  requirement  of
             exceptionality.  It all depends on the facts.   The  love  and
             affection between an adult and his parents  or  siblings  will
             not of itself justify a finding of a family life.   There  has
             to be something more.  A young adult living with  his  parents
             or siblings will normally have a family life to  be  respected
             under Article 8.  A child enjoying  a  family  life  with  his
             parents does not suddenly cease  to  have  a  family  life  at
             midnight as he turns 18 years of age.  On the  other  hand,  a
             young adult living independently of his parents may  well  not
             have a family life for the purposes of Article 8.

38. With reference to family life between grandparents and grandchildren, I
    have considered Dasgupta [2016] UKUT 28 (IAC) and  set  out  below  the
    second paragraph of the head note;

         (ii)  the  question  of  whether  there  is  family   life   in   a
             child/grandchild context requires a finding of something  over
             and  above  normal  emotional  ties  and  will  invariably  be
             intensely fact sensitive.

39. I now set out the facts as I find them in this appeal.   The  Appellant
    is now 70 years of age.   She  lives  with  her  husband,  one  of  her
    daughters and her son-in-law and their children.  The family own  their
    home and farmland.  I accept the Appellant's description in her witness
    statement when she describes herself and her family as  self-sufficient
    farmers.  I accept what is said  by  Mubashar  Hassan  in  his  witness
    statement at page 20 of the Appellant's bundle, in which  he  describes
    cultivating and selling crops, and states;

         "We make a good living farming in the village thus we have a lovely
         home and the quality of life for us is that of a higher scale  than
         some others."

40. The Appellant has children  and  grandchildren  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom, and also has children and grandchildren living in Pakistan.

41. The Appellant has not lived in the same household as her family in  the
    United Kingdom for a considerable period of  time.   Evidence  has  not
    been presented as to the exact length of time, but I find  that  it  is
    substantial, bearing in mind that the family in the United Kingdom  are
    either British citizens or settled in this country.  Relatives who  are
    living in the United Kingdom have, by choice, moved away from  Pakistan
    to settle in the United Kingdom.  Some of the  younger  family  members
    have been born in the United Kingdom, and I find that the Appellant has
    not met some of her grandchildren and great grandchildren.

42. The evidence indicates that the Appellant has  not  previously  visited
    the United Kingdom.  She indicated in her application form that she had
    not travelled to the United Kingdom in the last ten years, and had been
    refused a visa in 2011 and in 2014.

43. I find that little evidence has been  given  as  to  the  frequency  of
    contact that the Appellant  has  with  family  members  in  the  United
    Kingdom and the type of contact.  On the evidence presented, I can find
    no evidence of regular contact between the Appellant and family members
    in the United Kingdom.

44. Mrs Khurshid Rehman gave evidence to the  FtT  that  she  last  visited
    Pakistan approximately eighteen months before the FtT hearing,  because
    her father-in-law had passed away.  Her children did not accompany her.
     I accept her evidence that her children did not want to visit Pakistan
    and did not want to take their children there.  Mr Tohid  Hussain  gave
    evidence that he could not afford to take his family to  Pakistan,  and
    his children were too young to travel, and his family did not  wish  to
    travel to Pakistan.

45. I accept that money is sent to the Appellant by family members  in  the
    United Kingdom.  In particular Mr Hussain sent money to  the  Appellant
    on 20th October 2014, 5th November 2014, and 14th November  2014,  just
    before the application for entry clearance was made.  However I  accept
    that money was not just  sent  at  the  time  of  the  entry  clearance
    application, for example there is  attached  to  Mrs  Rehman's  witness
    statement dated 8th April 2016, a schedule of money that she  has  sent
    to the Appellant between July 2013 and April  2016.   This  amounts  to
    ï¿½3,671.

46. The family  members  in  the  United  Kingdom  have  formed  their  own
    families.  I find that they live independently of  the  Appellant,  and
    she lives  independently  of  them.   It  is  not  suggested  that  the
    Appellant is totally financially dependent upon her  relatives  in  the
    United Kingdom.  In fact, the evidence indicates that the Appellant and
    her family  in  Pakistan  are  self-sufficient,  earning  a  living  by
    farming, but presumably the money from the United  Kingdom  gives  them
    the higher standard of living referred to by  Mubashar  Hassan  in  his
    witness statement.

47. I set out below paragraph 50 of Gurung and Others;

         50.  We accept the submissions of Ms McGahey that the FtT  did  not
             make any error  of  law  in  reaching  its  conclusions.   The
             critical issue was whether there  was  sufficient  dependence,
             and in particular  sufficient  emotional  dependence,  by  the
             Appellants on their parents to  justify  the  conclusion  that
             they enjoyed family life.  That was a question of fact for the
             FtT to determine.  In  our  view,  the  FtT  was  entitled  to
             conclude that, although  the  usual  emotional  bonds  between
             parents and their children were present, the requisite  degree
             of emotional dependence was absent.

48. I do not find that the Appellant has proved  that  there  is  emotional
    dependence by her on her family in the United Kingdom  or  vice  versa.
    The Appellant initially wished to visit her uncle, and still wishes  to
    visit notwithstanding his  passing.   The  Appellant  has  described  a
    relatively short visit in the way of a holiday, to enable her to  spend
    time with family members in the United Kingdom.  That, in my  view,  is
    entirely understandable, but I am not considering whether the Appellant
    has proved she is a genuine visitor or that she intends  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  I have to decide whether the Appellant has established
    family life that would engage Article 8,  with  her  relatives  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I find on the evidence  presented  that  she  has  not
    discharged the burden of proof.  There are clearly emotional bonds with
    the relatives  in  the  United  Kingdom,  but  the  evidence  does  not
    indicate, notwithstanding that some money is  sent  to  the  Appellant,
    that anything more exists than the normal emotional ties.  I  therefore
    do not find Article 8 is engaged on a family life basis.

49. I do not find that Article 8 is engaged on a private life  basis.   The
    Appellant's private life is in Pakistan, not in the United Kingdom.

50. Because I find that Article 8 is  not  engaged,  it  is  therefore  not
    necessary or appropriate to go on and  consider  the  remaining  Razgar
    questions.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT contained an error of law and was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

The FtT made  no  anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no  request  for
anonymity made to the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity order.
