For the Appellant:     Miss G Patel (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Chambers promulgated on  the  17th  February  2017,  in
      which he dismissed the Appellant's asylum appeal.

   2. It was the Appellant's case before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
      Appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born in 1976.  It is  his  case
      that  whilst  still  in  Iran,  he  had  converted   from   Islam   to
      Christianity, at a time when his young son was  unwell  and  suffering
      nose  bleeds  and  that  a  friend  of  his  had  introduced  him   to
      Christianity telling him that God would cure  his  son  and  that  the
      Appellant had prayed to Jesus that night and that the Appellant stated
      that within a week his son was cured.  It  was  the  Appellant's  case
      that whilst in Iran he had been to house churches,  but  on  the  15th
      July 2015, his friend's father-in-law telephoned the Appellant to warn
      him that his friend and other church  members  had  been  arrested  in
      connection with their Christian worship and  that  Etella'ed  officers
      had raided the Appellant's home and arrested his wife, having received
      information the Appellant believes from his friend.   The  Appellant's
      case is that he had fled to the UK and continued attending  church  in
      the UK.

      The reasons of the First-tier Judge

   3. The full reasons for Judge Chambers' findings are a matter  of  record
      and are set out within his decision and are therefore not repeated  in
      their entirety here, but in summary, Judge Chambers found  that  there
      were discrepancies regarding the timetable that the Appellant had  put
      forward regarding the length of time after his friend  had  talked  to
      him about Christianity that it was that he ended up  having  to  leave
      Iran, and discrepancies about the number of times that he was said  to
      have attended at a house church in Iran.  Judge Chambers further found
      that it was odd that the authorities were not seemingly interested  in
      his wife to the same extent that the Appellant claimed that they  were
      interested in him, given that on his account she was as much  at  risk
      as the Appellant and that if released and  the  wife  was  a  trap  to
      capture the Appellant the trap was seemingly  never  sprung  and  that
      after disappearing and becoming wanted and after  his  wife  was  sent
      home the Appellant visited the house without  any  repercussions.   He
      further  found  that  the  Appellant's  wife  was  not  said  to  have
      experienced any problems with the authorities since in Iran  and  that
      there were no statements from other numerous  members  of  the  family
      affected by incidents the Appellant complained of.  He  further  found
      there was no evidence concerning his son's health.  He  further  found
      that the Appellant would not have returned home, after  his  home  had
      been visited by the authorities and searched and his wife arrested, as
      claimed, if in fact the Appellant was genuinely wanted by the  Iranian
      authorities.

   4. However, the Appellant did not simply rely upon his claimed conversion
      to Christianity in  Iran,  but  also,  as  Judge  Chambers  found,  he
      contended that by reason of  events  in  the  United  Kingdom  he  was
      rendered a  refugee,  by  his  attendance  initially  at  the  Milnrow
      Evangelical Church and subsequently at the Longton Community's Church.
       Judge Chambers  took  account  of  the  letters  in  support  of  the
      Appellant from the Reverend Ferguson, a letter from Mr Ron Farrington,
      a senior pastor at the Longton  Community  Church  in  Preston  and  a
      letter from the David Harding, a pastor  at  the  Milnrow  Evangelical
      Church and a letter from the Deacon of the Evangelical Church, Mr Paul
      Salem.

   5. However, in line with  the  decision  in  the  case  of  Ali  Dorodian
      01TH01537, from August 2001, and the guidelines given  in  that  case,
      Judge Chambers noted that the Appellant  through  his  solicitors  had
      complied with the guidance in terms of  providing  the  statements  or
      letters from the Dorodian witnesses to  the  Home  Office  before  the
      hearing of the appeal in order to give the Home Office time to make at
      least a basic check on the Minister's existence and standing, but that
      in circumstances where the evidence of the Minister was  not  accepted
      then Judge Chambers noted that Mr Richards on behalf of the Respondent
      had not accepted the evidence of the letter set out in the Appellant's
      bundle and wanted an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.  Miss
      Patel who represented the Appellant in the  First-tier  Tribunal,  had
      obtained specific instructions and stated that it was not intended and
      had never been intended to call live evidence at [38].  Judge Chambers
      noted that the explanation of the main witness not attending  was  not
      said to be a reluctance to attend, but an inability to  find  time  to
      attend because of the  pressing  nature  of  his  work  and  that  the
      Appellant simply wanted to rely upon the letters and had not sought an
      adjournment, despite Miss Patel telling me that she had  been  invited
      by the Judge to consider whether or not an adjournment was sought,  in
      order to secure attendance of a witness who would be able to act as  a
      Dorodian witness and vouch for the Appellant's attendance at church.

   6. Judge Chambers considered the letters  that  had  been  submitted  and
      considered the weight that could be attached to them, and although  it
      was accepted that the Appellant had made  contact  with  churches  and
      undertaken studies including studying  English  Judge  Chambers  found
      that it had not been shown that the Appellant had converted from Islam
      to Christianity.  He bore in mind that  the  Appellant  had  not  been
      baptised and there is no evidence to suggest that he was going  to  be
      baptised  at  [49].   He  found  that  the  Appellant  had  not   been
      appropriately vouched for by the Minister of some  established  church
      in regard to having church membership.

   7. Judge Chambers further noted that wider issues  concerned  whether  or
      not the  Appellant  would  be  seen  or  perceived  as  a  convert  to
      Christianity if returned and noted that both sides had agreed that  if
      he would be seen or perceived as a convert he would  be  at  risk  but
      found that given his findings in respect of the events in Iran and the
      United Kingdom it was not made out that the Appellant would be so seen
      or perceived,  and  he  therefore  dismissed  the  Appellant's  asylum
      appeal.

      The grounds of appeal

   8. The Appellant has sought to  appeal  against  that  decision  for  the
      reasons set out within both the initial and  renewed  application  for
      permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   I  have  fully  taken
      account of those arguments  and  Grounds  of  Appeal  in  reaching  my
      decision.

   9. The Grounds of Appeal are a matter of record  and  are  therefore  not
      repeated in their entirety here, but in summary, it is argued  by  the
      Appellant that the Judge appeared to have worked from the premise that
      an individual had to be baptised to be considered a  genuine  convert.
      It was further argued that the Judge had  taken  it  upon  himself  to
      purportedly look into the Appellant's soul contrary to the decision of
      the Ministry of Court in the case of SA Iran [2012] EWHC 2575 (Admin).
       It was further argued that the Judge had failed to  take  account  of
      the evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  been  attending  church  from
      September 2014 within a month of his arrival in the UK  and  therefore
      had been attending church for  over  2�  years  by  the  date  of  the
      decision and the Judge  had  not  noted  that  the  Reverend  Ferguson
      continued to be a Minister of the Longton Community Church as well  as
      being a chaplain for Cornerstone.  It  is  next  argued  that  in  the
      circumstances of the  Appellant's  case  that  as  the  Appellant  had
      converted to Christianity in Iran, Dorodian  did  not  apply  in  this
      case.  It is then argued that the Judge had not  considered  the  risk
      upon return from someone who was professed to be a convert  adequately
      and that within the case of SA (Iran) it  was  stated  at  [24]  "that
      there must be a real risk that if she has professed herself  to  be  a
      Christian, and conducted herself as one, in that  profession,  whether
      true or not, may be taken in Iran as evidence  of  apostasy".   It  is
      further argued that the Judge misdirected himself regarding the  legal
      exit as it is argued that the issue is not a legal exit but a risk  on
      which there  was  an  undocumented  returnee  and  that  he  would  be
      identified as an undocumented returnee and questioned upon return  and
      he will not be expected to lie about his basis for claiming asylum.

      Permission to appeal

  10. Permission to appeal was initially refused by  Designated  Immigration
      Judge Shaerf on the 8th July 2017, but following consideration of  the
      renewed Grounds of Appeal, permission  was  granted  by  Deputy  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Mailer on the 7th August 2017 on the  grounds  that  it
      was arguable that the Dorodian guidance did not apply in the  case  as
      the Appellant had contended that he converted to  Christianity  whilst
      in Iraq and it was also arguable that he may be perceived as a convert
      by the authorities on return having regard to the cases of RT Zimbabwe
      and SSH (Iran).

      The Rule 24 reply

  11. Within the Respondent's Rule 24 Reply dated the 22nd August  2017,  it
      was argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had  directed  himself
      appropriately and the grounds merely amount to a disagreement with the
      findings  and  that  the  Judge   had   given   sound,   well-reasoned
      conclusions.  It was argued that the  consideration  in  Dorodian  was
      appropriate in the case  and  remained  a  useful  framework  for  the
      assessment of whether or not an Appellant has genuinely converted  and
      that in a case where an Appellant  is  said  to  have  attended  house
      churches in Iran and  churches  in  the  UK  the  distinction  between
      conversion in Iran and the UK is an artificial one.  It is  said  that
      there were serious credibility issues with the Appellant's account and
      the Judge was entitled to reject his claim.

  12. It was on that basis that  the  case  came  before  me  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

      The oral submissions

  13. I am grateful for the oral submissions on both Miss Patel  of  Counsel
      and Mr Bates on behalf of the Respondent,  which  are  fully  recorded
      within the record of proceedings.

  14. Miss Patel contended  there  were  essentially  2  issues  upon  which
      permission to appeal had been granted, firstly, regarding  whether  or
      not the case of Dorodian applied and whether or not the absence  of  a
      Dorodian witness was a relevant issue  in  a  circumstance  where  the
      appellants claim to have converted to  Christianity  whilst  in  Iran.
      She argued that Dorodian did not apply in the  circumstances  of  this
      case, given that the conversion was in Iran, rather than in the UK.

  15.  In respect of the second ground, she argued that the Appellant  would
      be at risk upon return as a professed convert to Christianity and that
      he would be questioned upon return and he would  not  be  expected  to
      lie, such that there was a potential risk of  ill  treatment  for  the
      purposes of Article 3 upon return.  She referred  me  specifically  to
      paragraph 24 of the decision in SA  (Iran),  referred  to  within  her
      Grounds of Appeal, but did concede that  that  was  an  administrative
      court decision on judicial review, and  was  not  a  Country  Guidance
      case.  However she argued that  the  Appellant  would  be  subject  to
      questioning and that he would not be expected to lie about  the  basis
      upon which he claimed asylum, and that  by  that  stage  he  had  been
      attending church for 2� years, and  that  his  detention  for  further
      questioning would subject him to an Article  3  risk.   However,  Miss
      Patel conceded that there was no expert or other evidence  before  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  regarding  the   perception   of   the   Iranian
      authorities to someone who had sought to claim asylum on the basis  of
      a professed conversion to Christianity.  She  argued  in  that  regard
      that there would have been no such evidence,  as  professed  Christian
      converts were not in fact being returned to  Iran,  so  there  was  no
      evidence from returnees, as to their  treatment.   However  he  argued
      that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers should be  set
      aside.

  16. In his submissions in reply, Mr Bates argued that this was the  second
      time that this case had come before the Upper Tribunal, the case being
      heard by Judge Chambers,  following  a  previous  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge's decision having been set aside by the Upper Tribunal and  then
      the case remitted back to the First-tier  Tribunal.   He  argued  that
      Judge Chambers specifically asked whether or not  an  adjournment  was
      sought on the basis of a lack of a Dorodian witness who  was  able  to
      give live evidence  and  submitted  that  Dorodian  was  still  highly
      relevant in the case where part of the Appellant's case  was  that  he
      had been undertaking church attendance and Christian activities whilst
      in the UK, even if he claimed he had converted whilst in Iran and that
      the attendance at church in the UK was part and parcel of  his  claim,
      and that Dorodian should be applied to that UK church  attendance,  as
      part of the consideration of overall credibility.  He noted  that  the
      Judge had found at [45] that the Home Office had not  been  given  the
      opportunity to test the evidence of Reverend  Ferguson  in  court  and
      that the Judge had considered both the claim for conversion  in  Iran,
      and made  findings  in  respect  of  that,  and  also  considered  the
      professed church attendance  in  the  UK.   He  argued  there  was  no
      material error in that regard.

  17. In respect of the second argued ground of appeal, he argued  that  the
      appellant was simply attempting to relitigate the cases of SSH and HR,
      and that those cases were Country Guidance to the effect that  illegal
      exit and being a failed asylum seeker did not in itself put someone at
      risk, irrespective of the basis upon which they  claimed  asylum.   He
      noted how the panel in SSH at paragraph 30 had said that Judges should
      exercise a reasonable amount of sensibility regarding the approach  of
      the Iranian authorities upon return, and that the  examples  given  at
      paragraph 31 of the Judgment related to those that had  been  of  pre-
      existing interest to the Iranian authorities, but  this  Appellant  he
      argued had no profile and was simply an economic migrant.   He  argued
      that the Appellant, if telling the truth, would  say  upon  return  if
      asked, that he had simply pretended to be  a  Christian  in  order  to
      claim asylum, and although a returnee, the Iranian  authorities  would
      have no particular reason for being interested in him, given his  lack
      of previous profile.  He argued there was no material error in respect
      of the Judge's findings upon risk upon return.

  18. I reserved my decision.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  19. Miss Patel in her oral submissions confined herself to the  2  grounds
      upon which permission to appeal had been granted,  and  did  not  seek
      permission to argue the other points  raised  within  the  Grounds  of
      Appeal and did not seek to argue such points before me.   She  limited
      her submissions, quite properly, to the grounds upon which  permission
      had been granted.

  20. In respect of the first ground of appeal, as to  whether  or  not  the
      case of Ali Dorodian 01TH01537  did apply in this case, although it is
      clear having  read  the  evidence  and  having  fully  considered  the
      Judgment of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers  that  the  Appellant's
      case has always been that he converted to Christianity whilst still in
      Iran, having prayed to God following the illness of his child, who  he
      said had been cured as a result, the Appellant's case was not  limited
      to his conversion whilst in Iran.  Part and parcel of the  Appellant's
      case was that he had continued to attend church whilst in the UK, both
      at the Milnrow Evangelical  Church  and  at  the  Longton  Communities
      Church, and that such attendance at church in the UK was  evidence  of
      his conversion to Christianity, and would also heighten the risk  that
      he faced upon return to Iran.

  21. In a well-crafted and thorough  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Chambers has not simply found that the  lack  of  a  Dorodian  witness
      meant that the Appellant's appeal should fail, but has quite  properly
      given full, clear, adequate and sufficient reasons for  rejecting  the
      Appellant's account regarding his claimed conversion  to  Christianity
      whilst in Iran between [23] and [30].  He has then gone on to consider
      the Appellant's claimed attendance at church in the UK,  in  order  to
      determine whether or not the Appellant has attended at church  in  the
      UK, and whether or not this is evidence of Christian  conversion,  and
      whether that  would  put  the  Appellant  at  risk  upon  return.   In
      considering the question of the Appellant's attendance  at  church  in
      the UK and whether or not the Appellant was a genuine convert,  taking
      all of the evidence in the round, I find that Judge Chambers was quite
      correct in considering the decision in Ali  Dorodian  at  01/TH/01537,
      and the guidance given in that case.  Between [36] and [41], the Judge
      has considered the case of Dorodian, and the guidance  given  therein,
      and out of fairness to the Appellant had quite properly noted that the
      statements of the witnesses had been sent to the Home Office, but that
      Mr Richardson on behalf of the Respondent wanted  the  opportunity  to
      cross-examine the witnesses and that Miss Patel had obtained  specific
      instructions and had stated that it was  not  intended  to  call  live
      evidence, nor had it ever been intended to call live evidence and that
      the letters were all that the Appellant wanted  to  rely  upon.   Miss
      Patel before me confirmed that she  had  been  given  the  opportunity
      specifically by Judge Chambers to consider whether or not  she  wanted
      an adjournment, but had not taken such an  opportunity,  as  she  said
      that Reverend Ferguson would have been unable to attend not because he
      was reluctant to attend but because of  the  pressing  nature  of  his
      work.

  22.  Judge Chambers was quite entitled to consider the fact that there was
      no live witness whose evidence could be  tested  by  means  of  cross-
      examination, but  did  between  [42]  and  [49],  fully  consider  the
      contents of the letters that had been given by the Reverend  Ferguson,
      Pastor Farrington, Pastor Harding and Mr Salem, and has  given  clear,
      adequate and sufficient reasons for placing little  weight  upon  that
      evidence.  Indeed, he noted at [44] that  Reverend  Ferguson  had  not
      been accepted as an appropriate person to  vouch  for  the  Appellant,
      based that he was last a minister of a church in  any  real  sense  in
      April 2012  and  that  his  chaplaincy  at  Cornerstone  which  was  a
      community interests company, did not render him to be a minister of  a
      church established in the country but  that  the  fact  that  Reverend
      Ferguson had not attended, meant that the issue as to whether  or  not
      he was an appropriate Dorodian witness could not be tested.   Although
      that is criticised in the Grounds of Appeal, and that it is said  that
      Reverend Ferguson continues to undertake bible study classes  for  the
      church Longton Communities Church, the extent of his involvement  with
      the church was not able to  be  tested,  as  Judge  Chambers  properly
      found, due to his lack of attendance at the appeal hearing.

  23.  Judge Chambers further noted that Reverend  Ferguson  in  respect  of
      Pastor Ron Farrington had said that Pastor Farrington would only  know
      the Appellant by the briefest of welcomes/chat on a Sunday morning  in
      Preston and the minister of a large church would find it hard  if  not
      impossible to answer questions put by the  Tribunal  and  that  Pastor
      Farrington  himself  had  said  that  he  would  only  provide  "basic
      information" on the Appellant.  Judge  Chambers  had  noted  that  the
      letter from David Harding was dated the 8th December 2014 and that the
      Appellant was said to have expressed a desire to be baptised  and  the
      request had been considered, but there was said to be nothing from the
      date of that letter on that issue  from  the  author,  and  there  was
      nothing to say whether or  not  the  Milnrow  Evangelical  Church  had
      accepted that the Appellant had actually converted to Christianity  or
      not and only referenced what the Appellant had told them.  He  further
      noted that the letter from Mr Salem was dated from  the  20th  October
      2014 and was said to be relating simply to the Appellant's  attendance
      during the previous 4 weeks at Sunday  worship  and  English  language
      lessons but that little evidential weight could be attached to what he
      considered to be a somewhat stale letter.

  24.  In such circumstances, the Judge has more  than  properly  considered
      the weight to  be  attached  to  the  documentary  evidence,  but  was
      entitled to bear in mind,  the  fact  that  those  witnesses  had  not
      actually attended to give evidence,  in  support  of  the  Appellant's
      appeal, or to provide up-to-date evidence  regarding  the  Appellant's
      church attendance as evidence of the genuineness of his conversion  to
      Christianity.

  25. The way that Judge  Chambers  has  approached  the  evidence  both  in
      respect  of  his  findings  regarding  the   alleged   conversion   to
      Christianity whilst in Iran, and in the Appellant's claimed attendance
      at church whilst in the UK, has been dealt with properly by  him,  and
      that the Judge was quite entitled, where part of the Appellant's  case
      related to his attendance  at  church  in  the  UK,  to  consider  the
      guidance given in the case of Dorodian.  There is no material error by
      Judge Chambers in that regard.

  26. In respect of the second ground of appeal replied upon by Miss  Patel,
      as to whether or not the Appellant would  be  perceived  as  being  an
      apostate upon return  having  claimed  asylum  on  the  basis  of  his
      conversion to Christianity, the decision of His Honour  Judge  Gilbart
      QC sitting as a  Deputy  High  Court  Judge  in  the  case  of  R  (on
      application of SA (Iran)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
      [2012] EWHC 2575 (admin) was a judicial review against the decision of
      the Secretary of State to  certify  that  the  Appellant's  claim  for
      asylum in that case was  clearly  unfounded.   It  is  not  a  Country
      Guidance case, as Miss Patel quite properly concedes.   Although  Miss
      Patel relied upon paragraph [24] of the Judgment of His  Honour  Judge
      Gilbart QC, that "There must be a real risk that if she has  professed
      herself to  be  a  Christian,  and  conducted  herself  as  one,  that
      profession, whether true or not, may be taken in Iran as  evidence  of
      apostacy".  However, as Judge Gilbart noted in that same paragraph "On
      the basis of the Home Secretary's now stated position,  amounts  to  a
      potentially  different  circumstance  from  that  addressed   by   the
      Immigration Judge".  Indeed, it is clear  having  read  the  Judgment,
      that this  was  an  issue  which  although  Judge  Gilbart  considered
      required mentioning, did not actually form part of the  ratio  of  the
      case, which finished at paragraph 20 of the  decision,  and  that  the
      subsequent matters were effectively orbiter  comments,  and  therefore
      did not form part of the  ratio.   In  any  event,  it  appears  Judge
      Gilbart, made that statement without any analysis  of  any  background
      evidence as to  whether  or  not  a  profession  of  Christianity  and
      conducting oneself as a Christian, would in itself mean  that  someone
      would be viewed as an apostate upon return, and simply  said  that  it
      "may" be taken in Iran as evidence of apostacy.

  27. However, it was stated by the Upper Tribunal in the  Country  Guidance
      case of SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]
      UKUT 00308  "We  can  understand  the  sensitivity  that  the  Iranian
      authorities may have towards perceived slights against their own state
      in the form of untruthful allegations about the conduct of the  state,
      but equally one can expect a  degree  of  reality  on  their  part  in
      relation to people who in the interests of  advancing  their  economic
      circumstances would make up  a  story  in  order  to  secure  economic
      betterment in a wealthier country".

  28. In this case, although the Appellant clearly would not be expected  to
      lie upon return, if actually telling the truth, given the findings  of
      Judge Chambers, if he were questioned upon the issue, he would have to
      say that, although he had claimed asylum in the UK, he had  fabricated
      his claim of conversion to Christianity, in order to be able to  claim
      asylum,  for  what  Judge  Chambers  found  was  economic  betterment.
      However, as Judge Chambers  found,  this  Appellant  actually  had  no
      previous profile that would put him at risk upon return,  which  would
      lead to extensive questioning at the pinch point, other than the  fact
      that he was a failed asylum seeker, but the Country Guidance cases are
      clear that simply being a failed asylum seeker, is insufficient to put
      him at risk upon return.  In such circumstances, there is  no  binding
      authority for the proposition sought to be advanced by Miss Patel that
      simply having claimed  asylum  on  the  basis  of  being  a  Christian
      convert, would be sufficient to lead to  further  questioning  by  the
      Iranian authorities upon return and a breach of Article 3.

  29. Although she sought to advance the argument that  by  that  stage  the
      Appellant had been attending church for 2� years, and  although  Judge
      Chambers accepted that he had  made  contact  with  churches  and  had
      undertaken studies including the study  of  English,  there  had  been
      insufficient evidence presented to show that  he  had  converted  from
      Islam to  Christianity  and  to  confirm  the  extent  of  his  church
      attendance, and the genuineness of any conversion. These were findings
      open to him on the evidence before him.

  30. Further, although Miss Patel says that  there  would  be  no  evidence
      available in respect of how the Iranian authorities would  perceive  a
      returnee who was undocumented who was a failed asylum seeker  who  had
      claimed conversion to Christianity and as to whether  that  in  itself
      would put him at risk, as  no-one  has  actually  been  returned,  the
      Country Guidance case I find, is not limited to any  particular  basis
      of a claim, but is authority for the proposition that illegal exit  in
      and of itself and being a failed asylum  seeker,  does  not  place  an
      Appellant at risk,  in  a  circumstance  where  there  is  no  adverse
      interest in him.  Further, SSH and HR make clear that an Iranian  male
      whom it is sought to return to Iran who does not  possess  a  passport
      will return on a laissez-passer which he can obtain from  the  Iranian
      Embassy on proof of identity and nationality.

  31. In the absence of any binding authority in support of the  proposition
      advanced by Miss Patel, and in the absence of any specific evidence on
      the point, Judge Chambers was perfectly  entitled  to  find  that  the
      Appellant, given his findings, would not be perceived as a convert  to
      Christianity  by  the  Iranian  authorities  upon  return,  and   that
      therefore he would not be at risk.  The Judge has perfectly adequately
      dealt with and considered that issue and made findings which were open
      to him on the evidence before him.  There is no error of law  in  that
      regard.

  32. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers therefore does  not
      contain any material error of law and is maintained.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chambers  does  not  contain  any
material error of law and is maintained.   The  Appellant's  appeal  against
that decision is dismissed;

I do make an anonymity direction in this case given that the  case  concerns
a claim for protection, from the authorities in Iran.  Pursuant to  Rule  14
of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, unless  and  until  a
tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellant  is  granted  anonymity.
No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or
any member of his family.  This direction applies to  amongst  others,  both
to the Appellant and  to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed
