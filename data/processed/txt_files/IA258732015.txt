Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is hereafter referred to as "the Secretary of State"  and
    the Respondent is referred to as "the Claimant".

2.   The Claimant, a national of Sri Lanka,  date  of  birth  4  July  1966,
    appealed against the Secretary of State's decision, dated 2 July  2015,
    to refuse an application for leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, particularly Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE,  but  also  with
    reference to  Article  8  ECHR.   His  appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Malone (the Judge) whose  decision  [D],  on  11  August
    2016, dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules, but allowed  it
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

3.   On 30 March 2017 I decided that  the  Original  Tribunal  had  made  an
    error of law and that the decision would have to be remade in the Upper
    Tribunal.  It is clear, as I directed, that the issues to be  addressed
    were whether Article 8  ECHR  was  engaged,  and  if  so,  whether  the
    Secretary of State's decision was disproportionate  or  compliant  with
    Article 8 ECHR.

4.   I gave a direction for the  service  of  any  further  evidence  to  be
    provided seven working days before the resumed hearing.

5.   The Claimant did produce a bundle  of  additional  documents,  being  a
    supplementary statement by the Claimant, a statement by the  Claimant's
    partner, correspondence from  the  Claimant's  partner's  children  and
    other family members, a  medical  letter  relating  to  the  Claimant's
    partner's health, family photographs and information relating to one of
    the Claimant's partner's daughter, together  with  recent  evidence  to
    prove address and effectively cohabitation.

6.   Mr Tufan emphasised at the outset that the Secretary of State  held  to
    the view that there were no  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances
    that warranted the consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.

7.   Mr Burrett submitted that there were such circumstances which  went  to
    show that the Secretary of State's decision was disproportionate.

8.   The background  to  the  relationship  between  the  Claimant  and  his
    partner, both of whom remain married to others at the present time, was
    fully set out in the original Claimant's bundle  that  was  before  the
    Judge, together with the supporting documentation,  evidence  of  their
    cohabitation  and  their  then  current  arrangements.   The  Judge  in
    considering this matter accepted that the Claimant's partner  had  been
    the subject of abuse and domestic violence, which had been witnessed by
    their children, and that she, that is  the  partner,  had  been  in  an
    unhappy relationship which had been brought to an end by the process of
    legal separation in the British courts.

9.   The Judge found all  those  witnesses  who  gave  evidence  honest  and
    reliable and accepted their oral and written evidence.   Those  matters
    are summarised succinctly [D15 to 35].  Whilst it was accepted that the
    Claimant could not  meet  the  family  life  requirements  set  out  in
    Appendix FM, or the private life  requirements  set  out  in  paragraph
    276ADE, the Judge accepted  that  it  was  for  the  Claimant  to  show
    compelling circumstances justifying the consideration  outside  of  the
    Rules.

10.  The Judge then set [D 37] and following considerations which  he  found
    as a fact bore on the issues, and, in particular,  confirmed  that  the
    Claimant enjoyed a family life with his partner and  their  then  adult
    children.  The  adult  children  of  the  Claimant's  partner  are  all
    undertaking further education at university and, with the exception  of
    the second child who had a period in college accommodation,  which  has
    come to an end, reside at home.  They are undoubtedly dependants of the
    Claimant's partner and they are certainly dependent  to  a  degree  for
    their emotional support and guidance upon the Claimant.  The Judge  had
    no doubt that the Claimant's partner had been abused  and  bullied  and
    emotionally blackmailed by the father of her children, and that he  had
    left her with debt and caused problems with her physical health through
    the pressures  he  had  put  upon  her.   The  children  had  grown  up
    witnessing their mother's abuse, and they did so, as the  Judge  found,
    when they were  at  vulnerable  ages.   The  Judge  realised  that  the
    Claimant had brought some sense of stability and security and wellbeing
    to the family and had played a major role in taking them away from  the
    darkest areas where the Claimant's partner's husband  had  taken  them.
    It is also clear that the children wrote in support of the Claimant and
    gave evidence which the Judge accepted, and found of significant  value
    and contribution, in his assessment of those exceptional circumstances.

11.  Whilst the Judge erred  in  failing  to  properly  address  the  public
    interest, the fact is that the considerations of  the  public  interest
    are important, not least in view of  the  Claimant's  poor  immigration
    history and his personal circumstances.  I take into account  that  the
    Judge made a favourable assessment  of  the  Claimant's  character  and
    contribution whilst recognising that the Claimant was an overstayer and
    had worked in the United Kingdom.

12.  It is clear that the Judge understood, although it was not  perhaps  as
    fully expressed as it could have been, the extent to which  the  family
    members truly related to him and saw the value he gave to settling  the
    relationship with their mother, his partner, and  the  stressful  times
    that they had all been through.  The Claimant's daughter, Lakna, who is
    at Hertfordshire University studying Economics, her daughter Nisdi, who
    is studying Automotive Design at Brunel, and her son, Santush,  who  is
    studying Business and Management at Hertfordshire University all  speak
    well of the  Claimant  and  the  contribution  he  makes.   Photographs
    similarly produced evidently show affection,  both  by  the  Claimant's
    partner and the children.

13.  The Claimant's partner's daughter  Nisdi  gave  evidence  and  was  not
    challenged as to the substance of the issues which she addressed in her
    letter dated 19 June 2017.  Similarly, there was  no  challenge  by  Mr
    Tufan to the contents of the 20 June letter from Lakna or the  29  June
    letter  from  Santush.   Similarly,  there  was  no  challenge  to  the
    Claimant's partner's cousin's statement, nor to the Claimant's father's
    statement, nor to the Claimant's partner's brother statement.

14.  The overall position was that on the  findings  of  fact  which  stood,
    which were not actually challenged by the Secretary of  State,  I  find
    the circumstances are not addressed  within  the  Rules  and  they  are
    sufficiently exceptional to be taken into account in an  assessment  of
    Article 8 ECHR.  I therefore  find on the balance  of  the  information
    relating to the Claimant, his partner and the family  of  which  he  is
    part, that the Claimant has discharged the burden of proof, of  showing
    that Article 8 ECHR was engaged in that Article 8  family/private  life
    rights were engaged, and that the effect of  interference  was  and  is
    significant.  I find that the Secretary of State's decision is  lawful.
    There is a clear the public interest in maintaining immigration control
    and  the  public  interest  in  dealing  with  persons  who  breach  UK
    immigration law.  The  question  is  whether  the  public  interest  is
    outweighed by the particular circumstances of the Claimant's case.

15.  In considering this matter I have applied  Sections  117A  and  Section
    117B of the NIAA 2002 (as amended) and taken into account the fact that
    the Claimant can work, could obtain employment and wishes to do so.   I
    also take into account that his English language skills can be improved
    and such progress as he has made has been in the  right  direction.   I
    further find that the position is there is no evident  reason  why  the
    Claimant should be a burden upon the taxpayer.  He is fit,  well,  able
    to work  and  in  the  circumstances  wishes  to  continue  to  make  a
    contribution to the upbringing of three, albeit adults,  young  persons
    who have yet to make their own way in life; being independent.

16.  In these circumstances I have particularly noted the submissions of  Mr
    Tufan concerning the generality of the law, as expressed in relation to
    the position of return to Sri Lanka by the Claimant for the purposes of
    making an out of country application, and the length of time  in  which
    such applications are processed.  Of course the outcome  is  unresolved
    as to what that might be, but the Home Office figures for the number of
    days in which 93% of applications are decided is 60 days, and  100%  of
    applications are decided in 90 days.

17.  I take into account the position of whether or not it is reasonable  to
    expect the Claimant to go back  to  Sri  Lanka.   In  considering  that
    matter I have also taken into account the decision of the Supreme Court
    in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 and the view expressed therein about both the
    precariousness of life in the UK and the extent to which there needs to
    be an assessment of the precariousness of the circumstances in which  a
    person has knows themselves to be.  I do so, but it does not seem to me
    that  the overall body of the evidence  goes  to  show  that  a  person
    should, in each and every case, be expected to  return  to  their  home
    country and make an out of country application: For it to be  so  would
    be disproportionate and at odds with case law on the point.

18.  I do not speculate on whether the Claimant could meet the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, although Mr Burrett submitted that they self-
    evidently  would,  but  rather,  he   argued,   that   it   is   simply
    disproportionate to expect that course to be followed. I agree with  Mr
    Burrett that requiring the Claimant  to  do  so  would  be  disruptive,
    costly, create unnecessary  uncertainty  and  upset  to  no  meaningful
    purpose other than an unreasoning application of the Rules.

19.  In the circumstances it seemed to me that the precariousness  of  which
    the Claimant has been under relates both to  private  and  family  life
    issues, but that the sum of the favourable points that can be  properly
    made in relation to the best interests of British  nationals,  be  they
    under 18 or recently so over, means that they  should  not  suffer  the
    unsettling consequences, for which there is no need or purpose, by  the
    interruption in their care and way of life, in the Claimant  having  to
    remove to Sri Lanka.

20.  I conclude that the public interest should be given substantial  weight
    but  is  outweighed  in   the   proportionality   assessment   by   the
    circumstances of the adult children of his partner, the role  he  plays
    in their lives and the interests of his partner.  It must  be  material
    that the partner and the children are all British  nationals  who  have
    largely grown up in the United Kingdom and certainly made  their  adult
    lives here and no  interest  in  removing  from  the  UK.  I  find  the
    Secretary of State's decision is disproportionate.

21.  I have formed no view as to whether or not there really are threats  to
    the Claimant from his partner's ex-husband in the sense of  the  burden
    and standard of proof in civil cases, but  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    Claimant's partner's ex-husband has been accepted as a man of violence,
    of intemperate  behaviour,  and  he  has  articulated  threats  of  his
    intentions to do the Claimant harm which,  apparently  have  been  made
    both to the Claimant's children but also persons who he  knows  in  the
    United Kingdom.

22.  In these circumstances, whilst  I  make  no  final  conclusion  on  the
    matter, it seems to me that it is a  relevant  consideration  to  which
    some weight could be given as to difficulties that the  Claimant  might
    face on a return to Sri Lanka.

NOTICE OF DECISION

23.  The  Original  Tribunal's  decision  does  not  stand.   The  following
    decision has been substituted.  The appeal of  the  Claimant  has  been
    allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

ANONYMITY DIRECTION

No anonymity direction was sought nor is one required.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of �140.00 was paid and there is essentially  no  material  change  in
the  circumstances,  rather  that  the  exercise  has  been  undertaken   in
connection with the reasonableness of the decision.   In  the  circumstances
it seems to me that a fee award in that sum is properly to be made.
