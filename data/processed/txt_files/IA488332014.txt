                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of KM, a  citizen  of  India  born  25  March  1975,
    against the decision of 14 November 2014 to refuse her application  for
    leave to remain and to set removal directions against her under section
    47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The  appeal
    having been dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal, she  now  appeals  to
    the Upper Tribunal with permission.

 2. Her appeal arises from an  application  that  she  made  for  leave  to
    remain. Its basis  is  best  found  in  the  decision  of  Judge  Flynn
    following a hearing on 27 June 2014. She claimed to  have  entered  the
    United Kingdom illegally on 31 November 1998 with an  agent  and  false
    passport, and based on that length of residence applied on  27  January
    2010 applied to remain here. That application was refused and  in  June
    2010 her subsequent appeal was allowed on the  basis  of  the  same-sex
    relationship into which she had entered in the latter part of 2007. The
    Home Office implemented the result  of  that  appeal  by  granting  her
    further leave until 27 September 2013. She applied for an extension  of
    leave, admitting  she  was  no  longer  in  that  relationship,  though
    emphasising that she was now the mother  of  a  British  child  born  6
    August 2012 for whom she had sole responsibility. That application  was
    refused on 15 November 2013. She now argued that she had no  social  or
    family background in Kashmir, her parents and husband having died;  she
    had no siblings. Her daughter's birth  certificate  did  not  bear  her
    father's name which would expose them  to  risk  there,  as  would  her
    gender preference if it came to light. She had  strong  connections  in
    this country by way of her circle  of  friends  and  had  worked  here,
    though she was now on a benefits package totalling some ï¿½1,000 monthly.

 3. The appeal before Judge Flynn did not determine  the  Appellant's  case
    conclusively as he found that the Secretary of State  had  inadequately
    addressed the best interests of her child in the November 2013 decision
    which was therefore not  in  accordance  with  the  law.  He  otherwise
    accepted her history as claimed, and noted that  the  country  evidence
    before him by way of the Home  Office  Country  of  Origin  information
    report of March 2012 did not suggest the Appellant  would  be  at  risk
    back in Kashmir because of her  gender  preference  or  her  daughter's
    illegitimacy.

 4. The reconsideration of her case resulted in a  further  refusal  on  14
    November 2014 because, having spent her formative years in  India,  she
    could not demonstrate a lack of social, cultural or family ties  there.
    Outside the Rules, her resourcefulness in successfully  making  a  life
    for herself in the United Kingdom indicated that  she  could  similarly
    succeed in relocating within India; there was no reason to  think  that
    the authorities would discriminate against her because  of  her  gender
    preference given that she would not have to  reveal  it  to  them.  Her
    child could be raised by her and there was no reason to  anticipate  an
    unjustifiably harsh lifestyle abroad.

 5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  she  could  not  satisfy  Rule
    276ADE(vi), on the basis that she could not establish that  she  lacked
    cultural ties in India, albeit that she had no family  or  social  ones
    there. It found that there was a compelling case for departure from the
    Rules given that she had genuine friendships in this country that  went
    beyond economic ties, and had no family or friends in India: this would
    make it difficult  for  her,  as  a  member  of  the  lesbian  and  gay
    community, to form relationships, and that as a result she would suffer
    an element of hardship and societal discrimination.  That appears to be
    the totality of the reasoning: although there  are  several  paragraphs
    under the heading Analysis of the evidence and my findings, it is  very
    difficult to accept that this is the concluded reasoning of the  Judge,
    given that much of the text appears to be a rehearsal of  the  evidence
    that was given combined with the submissions made below.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted on 31 October 2015, in line  with  the
    grounds of appeal, on the basis that the failure  to  consider  section
    117 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was an  arguably
    material error of law.

 7. Before me Mr Duffy contended the decision was flawed for its failure to
    specify and  consider  the  statutory  criteria  relevant  to  judicial
    decisions made outside the Rules. Ms Haji responded that  the  decision
    was legally adequate and that the matters within section 117  had  been
    dealt with, and thus the lack of express citation of that provision was
    not fatal.

    Findings and reasons

 8. The relevant parts of the Immigration Rules are

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on  the
         grounds of private life

         276ADE

         (1)      The requirements to be met by an applicant  for  leave  to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
         date of application ...

             (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK  for  at  least  20
             years (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (iv)       is  under  the  age  of  18  years  and  has  lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years  (discounting  any
             period of imprisonment) and it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or ...

             (vi)      subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged  18  years  or
             above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment) but  there  would  be
             very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into
             the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave
             the UK."

 9. Having considered the competing submissions before me, I am  driven  to
    the conclusion that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  represents
    an inadequate determination of the issues that were before it.

10. Firstly, there was no recognition of the factors that via section  117B
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  have  received  the
    imprimatur of Parliament as a statement of the public  interest.  There
    is no discernible reasoning in that short portion of the decision which
    can reasonably be read as amounting to findings upon the  evidence,  as
    opposed to a mere exposition of  the  materials  and  arguments,  which
    grapples with the questions of her precariousness of residence  or  the
    burden she represents on public funds.

11. Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal referred to "an element  of  hardship
    and also societal discrimination". The Country Guidelines  decision  of
    MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India CG [2014] UKUT 65 (IAC)  notes
    that

         "d.      Same-sex orientation is  seen  socially,  and  within  the
         close  familial  context,   as   being   unacceptable   in   India.
         Circumstances  for  same-sex  oriented  males  are  improving,  but
         progress is slow.

         e. It would not, in general, be unreasonable or unduly harsh for an
         open same-sex oriented male (or a person who  is  perceived  to  be
         such), who is able to demonstrate a real  risk  in  his  home  area
         because of his particular circumstances, to relocate internally  to
         a major city within India.

         f. India has a large, robust  and  accessible  LGBTI  activist  and
         support network, mainly to be found in the large cities."

12. Those findings, whilst clearly raising concerns as to the  difficulties
    that might be faced by lesbians (who are apparently,  unlike  men,  not
    facing an improving prospect), they clearly countenance the possibility
    that gay individuals might be able to make a  life  for  themselves  in
    India. At [191](4) the Tribunal noted,  on  the  one  hand,  that  "the
    existence  of  [legislation  criminalising  same-sex  sexual   activity
    undertaken in private]legislation would, upon the appellant's return to
    India, constitute[s] an arbitrary interference with his  privacy,  this
    being irrespective of the rarity of prosecutions brought under it";  on
    the other, it held out the possibility that LGBTI groups might  provide
    significant levels  of  support  to  returnees.  The  Appellant's  case
    demands more nuanced  consideration  having  regard  to  these  various
    strands in the country evidence than it has so far received. Next  time
    it is put her advisors will  doubtless  assist  her  to  address  these
    themes.

13. This is not an appeal where there are meaningful  findings  upon  which
    the Upper Tribunal can build, and thus it is allowed to the extent that
    it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

ANONYMITY ORDER

I note that the Appellant's case has,  understandably  given  the  sensitive
issues involved, previously been subject to an anonymity order.  I  consider
it appropriate to follow that approach.  Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member
of her family.  This direction applies both to  the  Appellant  and  to  the
Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.
