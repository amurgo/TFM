Representation:
Appellant   Mr Uppal (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Ms Brocklesby-Weller (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Nepal. The appellants  are  husband  and
    wife. The first-named appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  October
    22, 2009 with leave to enter from October 22, 2009 until May  21,  2011
    as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant. This  leave  was  subsequently  extended
    until June 28, 2014.  Her  husband  was  granted  leave,  as  a  spouse
    dependant, at the same time and his leave had been extended to coincide
    with his wife's leave.

 2. On October 26, 2012 they lodged an application to extend their stay  as
    Tier 4 (General) Migrant and dependant but  the  first-named  appellant
    later discovered that the CAS she had  submitted  was  fraudulent.  The
    respondent's decision was delayed  because  the  first-named  appellant
    assisted the authorities with their enquiries. On November 18, 2013 the
    first-named appellant submitted a further Tier  4  application  with  a
    fresh CAS from Grenville College.

 3. The respondent wrote to the appellants on March 13, 2015  advising  the
    first-named appellant to submit a fresh CAS because Grenville College's
    licence was revoked. She was given sixty-days to  obtain  a  fresh  CAS
    certificate in line with the respondent's stated policy.

 4. On May 12, 2015 the appellants'  solicitors  wrote  to  the  respondent
    explaining that the first-named appellant had tried  to  obtain  a  CAS
    from various  colleges  and  universities  but  had  been  unsuccessful
    because "sessions" had already started. The letter also mentioned  that
    the colleges/universities had asked for an explanation for  the  delay.
    The solicitor suggested that the respondent should have sent a  letter,
    explaining the problems, with the March 13, 2015  letter  and  that  it
    would be unfair and unjust not to extend the sixty-day period further.

 5. The respondent refused their applications on May 26, 2015 as the first-
    named appellant did not have a CAS certificate and  took  decisions  to
    remove them pursuant to Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 6. The appellants appealed the decisions to remove them on June  10,  2015
    under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

 7. The appeals came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Turquet
    (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on September 23, 2015 and  in  a
    decision promulgated on October 8, 2015 she refused their appeals under
    both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 8. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on October 19, 2015  submitting
    the First-tier Judge had erred. It  was  argued  the  Judge  had  erred
    because she did not deal with failure to  consider  representations  in
    letter of May 12, 2015 and  failed  to  consider  whether  the  refusal
    letter was defective.

 9. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Grant-Hutchinson  granted  permission
    finding both grounds arguable.

10. In a Rule 24 letter dated April 15, 2016 she argued the Judge was aware
    of the issues as set out in paras 7-8 of the decision. At paragraphs 18-
    19 of the decision the Judge considered the evidence and case  law  and
    considered the immigration history but for reasons  given  in  para  19
    found against the appellant.

11. The matter came before me on the above date  and  I  heard  submissions
    from both representatives after which I reserved my decision.

12. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make no order.

    SUBMISSIONS

13. Mr Uppal adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted the  letter  dated
    May 12, 2015 had been supported by a statement that was found on  pages
    24 and  25  of  the  appellant's  bundle.  He  submitted  that  in  the
    circumstances the  standard  sixty-day  extension  was  not  sufficient
    bearing in mind it took 2 ï¿½ years for the respondent to make a decision
    on the application. The appellant was entitled to  an  explanation  for
    the delay and the respondent had not done this in her refusal letter.

14. Ms Brocklesby-Weller relied on the Rule 24 response and  submitted  the
    respondent  was  under  no  obligation  to   explain   the   delay   in
    circumstances where the  appellant  had  been  given  an  extension  to
    provide a CAS certificate. The appellant had  evidence  to  provide  to
    colleges and/or universities as she had correspondence contained in the
    bundle. There was no legal requirement to provide  what  the  appellant
    was asking for and  the  problems  experienced  by  the  appellant  had
    nothing to do with the respondent. The  refusal  letter  was  compliant
    with the respondent's own policy  and  following  the  decision  in  EK
    (Ivory Coast) [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 the respondent had applied the  same
    formulated approach to this appeal as they would to others.  The  Judge
    was aware of the problems and the first-named  appellant's  explanation
    but reached a decision open to  her.  The  respondent  reached  a  fair
    decision  and  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  back   that   stance   in
    circumstances  where  the  blame  for  the  CAS  issues  was  not   the
    respondent's.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

15. The first-named appellant applied to  extend  her  stay  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) migrant. The second-named appellant's appeal  was  contingent
    on the first-named appellant's appeal succeeding.

16. In this case the respondent initially gave the  appellant  a  sixty-day
    extension to  submit  a  fresh  CAS  certificate  because  her  current
    sponsor's licence had been revoked.

17. The first-named appellant had experienced a number of problems with her
    education in the United Kingdom-a fact recognised by the Judge  in  her
    decision. She noted the appellant arrived in October 2009 to  undertake
    an MBA course. The college she attended at went  bankrupt  so  switched
    course and commenced an ACCA course at the London College of  Theology.
    Their licence was revoked and she then went to a  consultant  who  gave
    her the fake CAS enabling her to study law at  Kings  College,  London.
    She then obtained a CAS for Grenville College to  study  a  diploma  in
    health care management but as became clear that college's  licence  was
    also revoked. The Judge concluded she had done very  little,  education
    wise, since being here and  had  hopped  from  one  course  to  another
    without explaining why.

18. At the hearing I clarified with Mr  Uppal  whether  the  appellant  had
    submitted any rejection letters or  requests  for  further  information
    from any college or university and he indicated that no college had set
    out their position in writing. There was therefore no  evidence  before
    the Judge other than the appellant's own evidence.

19. Mr Uppal's argument today is that  the  respondent  should  have  given
    reasons for the delay in dealing with the appellant's  application  and
    that by failing to do so the respondent treated the appellant unfairly.
     Mr Uppal did not provide me with anything that supported his  argument
    that reasons for delay had to be spelt out in the refusal letter.

20. The Judge was dealing with an application by the first-named  appellant
    to continue her studies. She needed a CAS  certificate  and  failed  to
    produce one. Her failure to obtain one was not the respondent's  fault.
    The cases of EK  (Ivory  Coast)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1517,  Thakur  (PBS
    decision-common law fairness) Bangladesh [2011]  UKUT  151,  Patel  and
    others [2013] UKSC 72 all talk about fairness. Where the fault does not
    lie with the appellant then an extension  should  be  granted  and  the
    respondent's policy is to grant a two-month extension.  This  extension
    was given to the appellants.

21. At paragraph [33] of EK Sales LJ said-

         "I do not consider that an approach by the Secretary of State which
         involves a simple check whether an applicant has in place  a  valid
         CAS letter at the time the decision is made on  their  application,
         rather than seeking to inquire further into the  background  if  it
         appears  that  a  CAS  letter  has  been  withdrawn,  involves  any
         unfairness to an applicant for which the Secretary of  State  bears
         responsibility. The  PBS  places  the  onus  of  ensuring  that  an
         application is supported by evidence to meet the relevant test  for
         grant of leave to enter or  remain  upon  the  applicant,  and  the
         Immigration Rules give applicants fair notice of this. The  essence
         of the CAS element within the PBS is that the  Secretary  of  State
         relies on a check on certification by approved colleges,  and  does
         not have to investigate further. It is inherent in the scheme  that
         an applicant takes the risk of administrative error on the part  of
         a college."

22. It was not disputed that a sixty-day policy extension exists. In  Naved
    (Student - fairness - notice  of  points)  [2012]  UKUT  14  (IAC)  the
    Tribunal stated-

         "Fairness requires the Secretary of State to give an  applicant  an
         opportunity to address grounds for refusal, of  which  he  did  not
         know and could not have known, failing which the resulting decision
         may be set aside on appeal as contrary to law ...".

23. The delay in dealing with this appeal would not have altered  the  fact
    there was no CAS certificate. Putting a paragraph  in  the  letter  may
    have told the appellant that the respondent was aware of the delay  but
    ultimately this application was refused because the  appellants  failed
    to provide the CAS within the  extended  period  allowed.  Nothing  was
    adduced to the Judge nor myself suggesting the respondent's decision is
    unlawful because delay was not explained.

24. Although I  sympathise  with  the  appellants'  predicament  I  am  not
    persuaded the Judge approached their appeal incorrectly.

25. If no extension had been given,  then  the  position  would  have  been
    different. However, the fact the appellant was unable to provide a  CAS
    within the sixty-day period and failed to put forward any evidence that
    the delay prejudiced her obtaining a CAS draws  me  to  the  conclusion
    that the Judge did not err in this appeal.

26. The Judge was clearly aware of all of the arguments  but  rejected  the
    arguments advanced by the appellants. Her findings were open to her and
    there is no error in law.

    DECISION

27. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on  a  point  of  law.  I  uphold  the  original
    decision.
