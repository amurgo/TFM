Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Maleque, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr M Mathews, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan who came to the United  Kingdom
    as a student on 21st December 2010.  She did not  complete  the  course
    and her visa was curtailed.  She failed to leave the United Kingdom and
    was served with an enforcement notice as an overstayer.  Her claim  for
    asylum was lodged on 15th December 2012 and refused by  the  Respondent
    on 14th January 2013.  The Appellant  exercised  her  right  of  appeal
    which was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Peter Grant-Hutchison  who
    dismissed the appeal in a determination promulgated by the Home  Office
    on 15th April 2013.

 2. Grounds of application were lodged.  It was said  that  the  judge  had
    erred in law in that he had failed to consider the terms of  an  expert
    report from Dr Gil Daryn and there was no reasoning from the  judge  as
    to whether the findings of the expert report were accepted and if  they
    were not the reason why.  Furthermore the judge had found at paragraphs
    20 and 22 of his determination that the Appellant would be at real risk
    of serious harm and there would be a breach of Articles 2 and 3 ECHR if
    he was returned to Pakistan.  Despite those findings the judge had gone
    to dismiss the  appeal  on  both  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection
    grounds.

 3. Permission to appeal was initially refused but on renewal to the  Upper
    Tribunal Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun found that it was arguable that the
    judge came to no conclusions as to whether he accepted or  rejected  Dr
    Daryn's report or his findings.  It was also arguable that the findings
    at paragraphs 20 and 22 were at odds with the appeal being dismissed on
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds.

 4. Thus the appeal came before us.

 5. For the Home Office Mr Mathews said that it was clear enough that there
    were typographical errors in paragraph 20 and 22 of  the  determination
    when the judge had apparently concluded that there was a real  risk  of
    serious harm and that it would be a breach  of  Articles  2  and  3  to
    return the Appellant to Pakistan.  Reading the judgment as a  whole  it
    was obvious that the reasoning of the  judge  was  that  the  Appellant
    would not be at risk of serious harm and   that  she  could  reasonable
    relocate.  However he accepted that there was an error of  law  in  the
    judge failing to make any findings on the expert report from Dr  Daryn.



 6. In the light of  that  proper  concession  we  concluded  there  was  a
    material error of law and we indicated to the parties that we would set
    the decision aside and make a fresh  decision.   Mr  Maleque  indicated
    that he agreed with us that there was  no  need  to  take  any  further
    evidence from the Appellant and both parties said they  were  ready  to
    proceed with submissions.

Submissions for the Home Office

 7. Reliance was placed on the reasons given in the refusal letter.   There
    was no evidence that the Appellant's family were aware  of  her  having
    given birth or their reaction to that.  Against that background it  was
    difficult to see that she would be at real risk of being a victim of an
    honour killing.

 8. She had the option of internal relocation.  There was no evidence  that
    her family were  able  or  had  the  wherewithal  to  track  her  down.
    Pakistan was a very  large  country  with  a  population  of  over  100
    million.

 9. As set out in KA and  Others  (Domestic  violence  -  risk  on  return)
    Pakistan CG [2010] UKUT 216 (IAC) paragraphs  231  to  233  there  were
    agencies willing to assist the Appellant and the address  of  a  crisis
    centre was said to  be  strictly  confidential.   This  was  a  country
    guidance case and there was no need to depart from it  which  was  what
    the expert had done.

10. Furthermore the Appellant was healthy, well educated, and  would  enjoy
    the benefit of a package should she volunteer to return to Pakistan all
    is set out in the refusal letter.

11. There was no reason to conclude that her  family  would  establish  her
    whereabouts in order do her harm.  In any event as set in KA commencing
    at paragraph 193 there was a  sufficiency  of  protection  for  her  in
    Pakistan.  Asking her to relocate would not be unreasonable  or  unduly
    harsh.  We were asked to dismiss the appeal.

Submissions for the Appellant

12. For the Appellant Mr Maleque relied on  the  submissions  made  by  his
    colleague  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  namely  that   the
    Appellant feared being killed.  She had not contacted her family  since
    she fell pregnant for the second time.  Honour killings do  occur.   Dr
    Daryn had outlined the scale of the problem and had concluded that  she
    faced persecution.  Reliance was placed on  the  terms  of  Dr  Daryn's
    report.  In terms of  the  package  given  to  the  Appellant  for  her
    voluntary return Mr Maleque understood the  financial  support  to  the
    Appellant to be in the region of �200 - �500 which offered no long-term
    solution to the Appellant.

13. We were asked to allow the appeal.

14. We reserved our decision.

Conclusions

15. As noted by the First-tier Tribunal Judge the Appellant  did  not  tell
    her family that she is pregnant (she now has a baby) and she  does  not
    know how they would react to her news.  While it is clear that she  has
    not contacted her family for a long period of time  there  is  also  no
    evidence that her family have made any attempt  to  have  contact  with
    her.  It is not stated or even hinted that any threats,  of  any  kind,
    have been made to the Appellant.  Absent such threats the evidence does
    not go nearly far enough to conclude that there is a real risk that the
    members of her family in Pakistan  would  attempt  an  honour  killing.
    While it is true that the background material and the  expert  make  it
    clear that honour killings do occur  it  cannot  be  said  that  honour
    killings are so widespread and systematic that they create a real  risk
    to this Appellant.  Furthermore, as noted in KA,  whether  a  woman  on
    return faces a real risk of an honour killing depends on the particular
    circumstances.  In general such a risk is  likely  to  be  confined  to
    tribal areas such  as  the  Northwest  frontier  province.   For  these
    reasons we disagree with the conclusion of Dr Daryn who has  stated  in
    paragraph 26 that there was a "serious" risk of her being a  victim  of
    an honour crime.

16. The Appellant has therefore failed to prove, even to the lower standard
    of proof, that there is a real risk that she would face serious harm if
    she returned to her  family.  Having  said  that  we  accept  that  the
    Appellant has cut ties with her family and on her  evidence  would  not
    feel able to go back and reside with them.

17. She would therefore be returning to Pakistan as a single female with  a
    child born out of  wedlock.   Given  that  her  family  have  shown  no
    inclination to try and contact and trace her in the United  Kingdom  it
    may be doubted whether  they  would  even  know  she  had  returned  to
    Pakistan.  We would have thought, given the  entire  lack  of  contact,
    they would be unlikely to know that she had returned.  As noted  in  KA
    Pakistan is a very large country geographically and has a population of
    around 173 million.  We do not accept that, as Dr Daryn  suggests,  the
    Appellant's family will be able to trace her  if  she  is  returned  to
    Pakistan.

18. It is not  disputed  that  the  Appellant  is  a  well  educated  woman
    certainly by Pakistani standards.  As noted in KA at paragraph  231  it
    is extremely difficult to accept  the  view  that  the  centres/refuges
    generally fail to keep their addresses secret from the families of such
    women.  As already noted paragraph 332 states that the address  of  the
    shelter is strictly confidential.  As KA makes clear it is essential to
    look at the personal circumstances of the Appellant.  It is clear  that
    there is some kind of return package  available  to  the  Appellant  to
    assist her in the early stages of her return and  given  her  education
    here she is in a far better position than  others  to  try  and  secure
    employment and accommodation beyond the crisis centre or refuge.  While
    Dr Daryn speculates (paragraph 39) that she would probably face a  life
    of insecurity and destitution and might be subject to  abuse  and  even
    trafficking such a view is not backed up by evidence  and  we  disagree
    with it.  On the contrary we think that with her educational background
    it is likely that in due course the Appellant would be able to  find  a
    job and there is no evidence before us that she would face  a  life  of
    insecurity and destitution.  The suggestion  from  Dr  Daryn  that  she
    might be subject to abuse and even trafficking seems to us to be highly
    speculative.

19. For these reasons and having regard to the guidance expressed in KA  we
    conclude that it would not be unreasonable or unduly  harsh  to  expect
    the Appellant to internally relocate within Pakistan.

20. We are therefore dismissing this appeal.

















Decision

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

22. We set aside the decision.

23. We remake the decision in  the  appeal  by  dismissing  it  on  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights grounds.
