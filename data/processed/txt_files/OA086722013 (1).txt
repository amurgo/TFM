Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Saleem of RKS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwncyz

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge  Gladstone
    made following a hearing at Manchester on 31st January 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 29th August  1993.   She
    applied to come to the UK as the spouse of a British  citizen  but  was
    refused entry clearance  on  13th  March  2013.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied with the evidence provided by the Sponsor  in
    relation to his rental income.  It is not disputed that he was, at  the
    time of the decision, in employment with HSBC and  he  earned  �15,300.
    In order to meet the financial requirements of the Rules  he  needs  to
    earn �18,600.  It is claimed that he receives rental income  of  �7,200
    per annum.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer set out the evidential  requirements  which
    must be provided in order to meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules  as
    specified in Appendix  FM-SE  and  stated  that  the  Sponsor  had  not
    provided any evidence that he owned the property from which he received
    a rental income.

 4. The Appellant appealed on the grounds that she did supply the  relevant
    documentation  and  she  pointed  to  the  covering  letter  from   her
    representatives which refers to  a  large  number  of  documents  being
    produced  with  the  application  form  including  "title   information
    document".

 5. The judge said  that  it  was  regrettable  that  the  covering  letter
    submitted with the application was not more  specific  in  relation  to
    documents apparently enclosed.  It was therefore difficult to  identify
    the various documents.  She said that she did not understand why if all
    of the documents were submitted with the covering letter as claimed the
    Entry Clearance Officer would omit some of them  from  the  bundle  and
    indeed state in the refusal notice that no evidence had  been  provided
    to confirm that the Sponsor owned the property from which he received a
    rental income.  She referred to the Grounds of Appeal which referred to
    "additional documents" which in her view indicated that  they  had  not
    previously been submitted.

 6. The judge assessed the oral evidence and the documentary evidence.  She
    found that there were a number of  internal  discrepancies  within  the
    documents and said that she did not find the Sponsor's evidence  to  be
    credible and wrote as follows:

         "Mr Kahut also  submitted  that  the  ECO  had  been  satisfied  in
         relation to the rental income and had only not  been  satisfied  in
         relation to property ownership.  That is so but  given  the  appeal
         grounds and the subsequent evidence  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
         Appellant it is clear that the  requirements  of  paragraph  10  of
         Appendix FM-SE have not been  met  for  all  the  reasons  set  out
         above."

 7. The judge considered Article 8.  She referred to the Sponsor's P60  for
    the tax year to 5th April 2013 which shows that  his  income  from  his
    salaried employment with HSBC was now �16,382.39.  There  was  also  an
    HMRC letter of 2nd December 2013 in relation to the tax  code  for  the
    year 2013 to 14 referring to property income of �5,732.  This  was  the
    same figure in the rental income statement  for  the  year  ending  5th
    April 2013 prepared by the Sponsor's accountants.

 8. The judge concluded that it would appear that the Sponsor's  income  is
    (still) in excess of the minimum of �18,600 and on that basis  a  fresh
    application could be made.  She dismissed the appeal on all grounds.





The Grounds of Application

 9. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in not taking into  account  all  of  the  relevant  evidence
    namely that the Sponsor has provided sufficient documents to verify his
    rental income including his PAYE coding notice, and is in a position to
    reach the relevant financial threshold.

10. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Osborne  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds on 25th April 2014.

Submissions

11. Mr Saleem submitted that the documents before  the  judge  showed  that
    there was rental income for the  relevant  period  and  had  failed  to
    recognise that the documents had in fact been provided.

12. Mr Diwncyz submitted that the Sponsor  had  not  provided  all  of  the
    relevant evidence to the Entry Clearance Officer.  He had only provided
    bank statements for six months between April and October 2012 and there
    was nothing in those statements which could distinguish the rent within
    the cash deposits.  No schedule had been provided.  Moreover there  was
    nothing from Revenue & Customs for the relevant year.

13. By way of reply Mr Saleem submitted that it  was  not  unreasonable  to
    conclude that the Entry Clearance Officer had made  a  mistake  in  not
    recording all of the evidence which had been submitted.

Findings and Conclusions

14. It was open to the Immigration Judge to conclude on the  evidence  that
    the Appellant had not provided the specified evidence  as  set  out  in
    Appendix FM-SE.  Paragraph 10 reads as follows:

         "In respect of non-employment income all of the following evidence,
         in relation to the form of income relied upon must be provided:

         (a)  To evidence property rental income:

             (i)  Confirmation that the person  or  the  person  and  their
                  partner jointly own the  property  for  which  the  rental
                  income is received, through:

                  (1)  the title deeds of the property; or

                  (2)  a mortgage statement.

             (ii) Monthly personal bank statements  for  the  twelve  month
                  period prior to the date of application showing the rental
                  income was paid into an account in the name of the  person
                  or of the person and their partner jointly.

             (iii)    A rental agreement or contract."

15.  As  the  judge  pointed  out  the  solicitors'  reference  to   "title
    information document" does not establish  that  the  title  deeds  were
    provided since it is clear that the Entry  Clearance  Officer  believed
    that they had not been.  This was the basis of the refusal.  It was not
    irrational for the judge to consider that the reference  to  additional
    documents in the Grounds of Appeal  implied  that  they  had  not  been
    submitted previously.

16. If the specified evidence had not been submitted, then  the  judge  was
    bound to dismiss the appeal.

17. Moreover it was accepted that the rental income was not distinguishable
    as a separate payment into the bank account moreover, in a careful  and
    detailed analysis, the judge identified  clear  difficulties  with  the
    documents which had been provided.

18. So far as Article 8 was concerned the documents from the Inland Revenue
    do not establish that the  Sponsor  was  in  a  position  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules at the relevant time.  Whilst it may well  be
    that he is now in a position to do so there is no error of law  in  the
    judge declining to allow the appeal on human  rights  grounds  for  the
    reasons which she gave.

Decision

19. The judge did not err in law and her decision stands.   The  appeal  is
    dismissed.
