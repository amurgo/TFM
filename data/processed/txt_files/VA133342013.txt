For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Ren� , Counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as"the entry clearance officer" and  to
      the respondent as "the claimant".


   2. The claimant is a national of Jamaica, born on 2nd October 2012.


   3. His appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  entry  clearance  officer
      refusing his application made on 6 May 2013 for entry clearance to the
      UK as a visitor for six months to reside  with  Miss  Yvonne  Gray,  a
      British citizen and his  guardian,  was  allowed  in  a  determination
      promulgated on 19 May 2014, under the immigration rules.


   4. The Judge had regard to  the  evidence  of  Ms  Gray  and  Mrs  Rowena
      Christopher, Ms Gray's mother. They attended the hearing and gave oral
      evidence.


   5. Ms Gray is 42 years old. She is single and has no children of her own.
      Her mother is also a British citizen, aged 62.


   6. In June 2012 Ms Gray's mother was contacted  by  a  family  friend  in
      Jamaica who explained Ms Fairclough's situation and her  intention  to
      abort her baby. Mrs Christopher met Ms Fairclough and persuaded her to
      keep the baby. It was hoped that the mother would bond with the child.




   7. The claimant was born on 2 October 2012 but Ms Fairclough  decided  to
      put him up for adoption. Ms Gray  discussed  the  situation  with  her
      mother and decided to try to adopt the claimant.


   8. She contacted the Child Development Agency of Jamaica  and  began  the
      formal adoption procedure. She also contacted the relevant  department
      in the London Borough of Greenwich and  began  a  six  to  nine  month
      assessment  procedure  administered  by  the  Inter  Country  Adoption
      Agency.


   9. Ms Gray has visited the claimant regularly  in  Jamaica.  She  has  25
      days' annual leave and since October 2012 she has used  virtually  all
      the time to visit him in Jamaica. This took place  in  November  2012,
      October 2013, and March  2014.  The  extended  family,  including  the
      claimant, met for a holiday in Florida in May 2013.


  10. Ms Gray transfers �200 a month to the Williams family  in  Jamaica  to
      support the claimant.


  11. Ms Gray is hoping to adopt the claimant. She wishes to  go  about  the
      process in the correct legal  manner.  The  purpose  of  the  existing
      application is for the claimant to come and live with Ms Gray  in  the
      UK for an extended period of time, namely six months,  so  that  their
      relationship can develop further.  This  will  assist  in  the  formal
      assessment and adoption process.






  12. The Judge noted the relevant immigration rules, namely paragraph  46A.
      He found that both  Ms  Gray  and  Mrs  Christopher  were  honest  and
      credible witnesses. Ms Gray wants to become the mother  of  the  child
      and it seems that adopting the claimant constitutes her best chance of
      motherhood. She is clearly a law abiding person who has gone  to  some
      lengths and expense to follow the correct procedure. He was  satisfied
      that she would ensure that the claimant returns to Jamaica.






  13. On 12 June 2014, First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted the entry
      clearance officer's application for permission to appeal. The  grounds
      of appeal contended that the claimant had applied for entry  clearance
      to visit a person described as her legal  guardian  but  who  was  not
      otherwise related to her. In those circumstances, and by virtue of the
      Immigration Appeals  (Family  Visitor)  Regulations  2012  -'the  2012
      Regulations' - the claimant had a restricted right of appeal  confined
      to human rights or race discrimination grounds.


  14. The Judge proceeded to allow the appeal under the rules.


  15. At the hearing on  31  July  2014,  Mr  Avery  referred  to  the  2012
      Regulations. For the purpose of the regulations,  the  claimant  is  a
      member of the family of a person if the claimant is  a  spouse,  civil
      partner, father,  mother,  son,  daughter,  grandfather,  grandmother,
      grandson, granddaughter, brother or sister. In addition, the  claimant
      is a member of the family of such a person if he is the father in law,
      mother in law, brother or sister in law, son or  daughter  in  law  or
      stepfather,  stepmother,   stepson,   stepdaughter,   stepbrother   or
      stepsister of the person.


  16. Section 88A of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
      provides that a person may not appeal under s.82(1) of the Act against
      the  refusal  of  an  application  for  entry  clearance  unless   the
      application was made for the purpose of visiting a person of  a  class
      or description prescribed  by  regulations  for  the  purpose  of  the
      subsection or entering as the dependant of a person  in  circumstances
      prescribed by regulations for the purpose of this subsection.


  17. Mr Avery  thus  submitted  that  only  those  persons  visiting  their
      immediate family (or that of the spouse or partner) retain  the  right
      of appeal. The only other ground of appeal able to be  raised  in  the
      event of a refusal of such an application  is  that  the  decision  is
      unlawful under the Race Relations Act or pursuant to s.6 of the  Human
      Rights Act 1998.


  18. The limited jurisdictional point had been taken by the entry clearance
      officer, who was unrepresented at the hearing. The Judge  allowed  the
      appeal, finding that the decision appealed against was unlawful due to
      contravening immigration rules  [15]  and  [13].  The  Judge  made  no
      findings  on  the  claimant's  human  rights  or  Race  Relations  Act
      discrimination claims and the record of the proceedings does not refer
      to any submissions on those grounds.


  19. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Ren� submitted that the  sponsor  has  a
      guardianship and custody order in her favour pronounced by the  Family
      Court of Jamaica on 10 December 2012. I note however  that  the  court
      only ordered that custody of the child be granted to Ms  Yvonne  Gray.
      There is no reference to a guardianship order that was made.


  20. In any event he submitted that "for intended purposes" the sponsor  is
      the mother of the claimant and/or in the alternative holds the  "quasi
      parental responsibility" of the claimant.


  21. Mr Ren� submitted that it was 'implicit' that the grounds of appeal as
      set out at B7-11 of  the  respondent's  bundle  sought  to  include  a
      reference to Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention. He referred  to
      B9 where the sponsor stated that regarding the question of whether  it
      would be in the best interests of the claimant to  spend  a  prolonged
      time in the UK, 'it stood to reason' that as  the  person  responsible
      for his financial care and well being she would want to know  him  and
      build a relationship with him. It did not mean that her intention  was
      for him to spend the entire six months here. The application envisaged
      a shorter three months visit. It would also allow her to get  to  know
      the claimant.


  22. It cannot be reasonable to leave the  claimant  in  Jamaica  when  Mrs
      Williams and her husband visit the UK. The claimant  is  their  foster
      child. Ms  Williams  would  not  be  able  to  avail  herself  of  the
      opportunity to visit the UK unless she  can  travel  with  her  foster
      child.


  23. In her witness statement, Ms Gray stated that this is a visit for  the
      purpose of a holiday and to allow Mrs Williams  and  the  claimant  to
      spend time with her and enjoy her hospitality. The purpose of a  visit
      is simply for a holiday and not for adoption. The claimant will be  in
      the custody and care of his primary carer, Mrs  Williams,  during  the
      visit.


     Assessment


  24. It is not disputed that the claimant does not qualify as a  member  of
      the family of Ms Gray within the regulations. The regulations  do  not
      include a person who holds the "quasi parental responsibility" of  the
      person concerned.


  25. Further, insofar as the human rights claim is concerned, the  claimant
      did not seek to rely on such a claim in his appeal to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. I have had regard to the skeleton argument which only sought
      to deal with the issues on the merits of the  respondent's  assertions
      with regard to paragraph 46A of the immigration rules.


  26. Accordingly, submissions were made  that  there  was  no  evidence  to
      support the entry clearance  officer's  assertion  that  the  claimant
      would remain in the UK, alternatively, that it is "pure  speculation".
      It was further asserted that the claimant did have  the  intention  to
      leave the UK and this still remains the case. The sponsor has gone  to
      great lengths to ensure that  she  is  fully  aware  of  the  adoption
      process requirements in the UK and in  Jamaica.  This  demonstrates  a
      respect for law.






  27. Nor did the Judge direct himself so as to determine the appeal on  the
      basis that the claimant only  had  a  limited  right  of  appeal.  The
      immigration decision as set out in the reasons for  refusal  expressly
      stated that the claimant's right of appeal was limited to the  grounds
      referred to in s.84(1)(c) of the 2002 Act.


  28. Nor do I regard the grounds of appeal as implicitly raising Article 8.
       The purpose of a visit was stated to be simply for a holiday and  not
      for adoption. The argument based on 'inference' in this regard is  not
      sufficient. This is a matter of jurisdiction and the claimant must set
      out clearly the human rights case and grounds relied on.


  29. I accordingly find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      contained an error of law for the reasons set out. The Judge  was  not
      referred to the limited right of appeal. Nor  did  he  deal  with  the
      Article 8 claim which was simply not raised.  I accordingly set  aside
      the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  and  re-make  it,
      dismissing the claimant's appeal.


     Decisions


       The determination of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of
an error on     a point of law.  Having set it aside I remake it dismissing
the claimant's appeal


       I set aside the fee award.
