                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Appellant in this case is the Secretary of State  I  refer
    to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. There was no appearance at the hearing before me by on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant. I was satisfied on the basis of the papers  before  me  that
    the  notice  of  hearing  was  served  on  the   representatives,   A&M
    Immigration Solutions, who are the representatives on record since  the
    notice of appeal  was  lodged  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  was
    satisfied that it was proper to proceed under the Upper Tribunal  Rules
    and I proceeded in the absence of the Appellant in these circumstances.



 3. As this was the Secretary of State's appeal I  heard  submissions  from
    Miss Willocks-Briscoe.

 4. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant was  granted  entry
    clearance to enter the UK with  leave  to  enter  as  a  fianc�e.   She
    arrived in the UK on 21st January 2014 and her leave to  enter  expired
    on 6th July 2014.  On  4th  July  2014  she  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  UK  as  the  victim  of  domestic
    violence.   That  application  was  refused.  The  background  to  that
    application is that the Appellant claims that she was  married  to  her
    fianc� on 15th March 2014 and that after the marriage she went to  live
    with her husband and his mother,  brother  and  sister-in-law  but  was
    unhappy with the way that she was treated by the  family.   She  claims
    that her mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law  insulted  her
    and criticised her  cooking,  cleaning  and  dress  and  that  she  was
    verbally abused. It is the Appellant's account that she  contacted  her
    brother by telephone on 3rd April 2014 and told  him  how  unhappy  she
    was.  She claims that her brother contacted the priests at  the  temple
    for help and advice. They came to  speak  to  the  family  to  try  and
    resolve the issue but the family were angry with that intervention  and
    insisted that the Appellant leave and called the police.  The Appellant
    made no complaint of domestic violence  to  the  police  and  hoped  to
    return to the house and be reconciled with her husband.  She was  taken
    to London and was provided with accommodation by a member of the temple
    community.  It is the Appellant's case that her brother and mother know
    that she is separated from her husband but they have not  informed  her
    father about the situation because of concerns about his health.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the evidence.  The judge noted
    that the Appellant does not satisfy the provisions of  paragraph  DVILR
    of Appendix FM  of the Immigration  Rules  because  she  did  not  have
    limited leave to remain in the UK as a partner.  The judge then went on
    to consider whether the Appellant was entitled to leave  to  remain  in
    the UK outside of the Immigration Rules on the basis of  her  right  to
    respect for private life under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   The  judge
    considered paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  firstly,  and
    considered in particular paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) which, at the time  of
    the decision in this case, provided that the requirements to be met  by
    an application for limited leave to remain are that the applicant:
         "... is aged 18 years or above, has lived continually in the UK for
         less then  20  years  ...  but  there  would  be  very  significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to  which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK".

 6. The judge decided that it had been established by  the  Appellant  that
    there would be very significant obstacles  to  her  reintegration  into
    India and allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules.   The  judge
    went on to consider whether there were exceptional reasons for granting
    leave to remain under Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules in the
    event that he was wrong in relation to the Rules.  The judge considered
    Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and
    concluded that it was not proportionate to  require  the  Appellant  to
    return to India in the circumstances.

 7. The Secretary of State contended in her  Grounds  of  Appeal  that  the
    judge made a material error of law in the determination by  failing  to
    give adequate reasons for finding that there would be very  significant
    obstacles to the Appellant's integration in India.    It  is  contended
    that the judge reached the conclusion on the basis of  the  Appellant's
    claim that a woman separated from her husband would find  it  difficult
    to return to her home village but it is contended that  the  judge  did
    not set out reasons for accepting this claim other than vague reference
    at paragraph 12 to the 'culture of her family  and  community'.  It  is
    contended that the  judge  has  given  wholly  inadequate  reasons  for
    finding that the stringent test in paragraph 276ADE (1) (vi) is met  on
    the facts of the case.  It is contended that this is particularly  true
    given that the Appellant's mother and brother were fully supportive  of
    her and that the father had not been informed merely  because  of   his
    frail health rather than because of any expectation that  he  would  be
    unwilling to receive his daughter back into the  family  home.   It  is
    contended that there is  a  deficiency  in  the  judge's  reasoning  in
    relation to Article 8 and that the decision to allow the appeal on this
    alternative basis is equally unsustainable.

 8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert granted permission to appeal  on  the
    basis that there is an arguable error of law.

Error of Law

 9. I have considered the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Having
    considered the application in the context  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
    the judge noted the submission made  by  the  Presenting  Officer  that
    there was insufficient evidence to  support  the  assertions  that  the
    Appellant would be unable to return to her family and noting  that  the
    Appellant's mother and brother were supportive of  her  and  there  was
    nothing to say why her father would not be supportive of her if he were
    told. The judge went on to find
         "29. I am satisfied that  the  evidence  supports  the  Appellant's
             claim that she would have very significant problems  returning
             to her home village,  and  that  she  would  have  very  great
             difficulties in trying to establish an independent life of her
             own if she internally located  within India.
         30.  I am satisfied that these difficulties and problems  are  such
             as to  be  deemed  very  significant  obstacles.  I  note  the
             terminology and take into account in particular that the  test
             is not one of insurmountable obstacles, used  for  example  in
             paragraph EX1 of Appendix FM."

10. The difficulty here is that the judge has not stated  at  paragraph  29
    what evidence he considers supports  the  Appellant's  claim  that  she
    would have very significant problems returning to her home  village.  I
    have considered the evidence set out in the decision and considered  by
    the judge. I note at paragraph 12 the judge says:
         "The Appellant believes that she is unable to return  to  her  home
         village in India in her situation as a  woman  separated  from  her
         husband. Such concerns are  reasonable  and  understandable  having
         regard to the culture of her family and community. She has  nowhere
         else to go. She is educated to year 10 level  in  school.  She  has
         very little experience of life outside her family home."

11. The judge said at paragraph 16 that he found the  Appellant's  evidence
    to be plausible and credible and noted that the Appellant continued  to
    be unsure whether she wishes to return to continue with the marriage.

12. The judge had a witness statement from the Appellant along the lines of
    that set out at paragraph 12.  I note that  in  her  witness  statement
    dated 28th March 2015 the Appellant says that a   divorce  would  bring
    shame on her family and she did not know how her family would manage if
    this was revealed in India.  The Appellant said that she could not tell
    her father because he is suffering from ill health but does not specify
    what she says her father would do or how he would treat if  her  if  he
    knew the truth. At paragraph 12 of her witness statement the  Appellant
    said "I know eventually my father will come to know but I hope that  in
    some years he is in better health and able to  cope  with  everything."
    She said that if anyone in the village found out they  would  endlessly
    taunt her family.  The Appellant referred to people in her village  but
    there is no background evidence to support any claim that the Appellant
    would suffer any specific consequence or any specific danger  over  and
    above village gossip.

13. The Appellant submitted witness statements from two  priests  from  the
    temple who have supported her.  In one of the  statements  it  is  said
    that it is unimaginably difficult for the Appellant coming  from  India
    to  have  a  failed  marriage.  The  other  statement  refers  to   the
    Appellant's father not being told because of health and says  that  the
    Appellant cannot return to her village. The Appellant's brother made  a
    statement in which he also said that the  father  was  not  being  told
    because of his ill health but that if the Appellant  returned  everyone
    in the village would find out.  He  said  that  his  father  could  not
    tolerate the shame in his village. The Appellant submitted a  statement
    from the Appellant's friend and talks about the Appellant's father  not
    knowing because of his ill health and that  the  Appellant  is  worried
    because her father might not forgive her for not telling him the truth.
    She talks about the help the Appellant has had from  the  Gurdwara  and
    says that the Appellant would not be welcomed back by her family in the
    village.

14. There is no background evidence to support any of these assertions.   I
    note that all of these people have supported the Appellant and that the
    only reason the father has not been told is because of his  ill  health
    and there is no background evidence to support the assertion  that  the
    Appellant would suffer any significant or  specific  consequences  upon
    return to India.

15. In these circumstances I am not satisfied  that  the  judge  has  given
    sufficient reasons for saying at paragraph 29  that  he  was  satisfied
    that the evidence supports the Appellant's claim that  she  would  have
    very significant problems returning to her home village.  The  evidence
    is simply not there to support that conclusion.

16. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the judge made an  error  of
    law in that he has given wholly inadequate reasons for finding that the
    test in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) has been met on the facts of this case.
     I am satisfied that the findings in relation to Article  8  flow  from
    the findings in relation to 276ADE in that the judge has not  specified
    or given reasons in the Appellant's  interests  to  weigh  against  the
    public interest of the maintenance of effective  immigration  controls.
    In these circumstances I set aside the decision  in  its  entirety  and
    remake the decision.

Remaking the Decision

17. I am satisfied that the parties were served  with  standard  directions
    advising them that in the event that an error of law was found  at  the
    hearing before me I would proceed  to  remake  the  decision.   I  have
    received no further documentary evidence or submissions  on  behalf  of
    the  Appellant  in  relation  to  remaking  the  decision.    I   heard
    submissions from Miss Willocks-Briscoe  and  proceeded  to  remake  the
    decision.

18. I note that the Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the  domestic
    violence provisions of Appendix FM as she does not have leave to remain
    as a partner.

19. I remake  the  decision  under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).   I  must  be
    satisfied that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration in India upon her return.    I  note  that  the
    Appellant only came to the UK on 21 January 2014 and lived all  of  her
    life in India with her  parents  before  that  date.   The  Appellant's
    mother and brother have supported her in relation to this  application.
    Whilst the Appellant calmed to have difficulties with her  husband  and
    in particular her in-laws, I note that the Appellant stated as recorded
    in the judge's determination that she is unsure whether she  wishes  to
    continue with the marriage and the statements reflect  the  possibility
    of the Appellant reconciling with her husband.  In  fact  it  is  clear
    from  paragraph  8  of  her  statement  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    complaining to her brother about the difficulties she was having in her
    new home just to share her feelings without him doing anything about it
    and that she begged her in-laws to let  her  stay.   I  note  that  her
    brother and mother have supported her and  that  the  only  reason  her
    father has not been told is because of his ill-health.

20. There is no background information to support the  assertion  that  the
    Appellant will suffer any difficulties in India such as  to  amount  to
    very significant  obstacles  to  her  reintegration  there.   With  the
    support of her family the Appellant could go back and live  again  with
    her parents.  There is nothing in the evidence  to  suggest  that  this
    would be an honour  issue  or  that  the  Appellant  would  suffer  any
    consequences in terms of a breach of the family's honour. In  fact  the
    appellant has had the active support of her brother.  It is also  clear
    from the evidence from the two priests from the temple that  since  the
    Appellant left her husband's home she has been  the  responsibility  of
    the Gudwara and  that  she  has  been  living  with  a  member  of  the
    congregation. It is clear therefore that her  religious  community  has
    been looking after her and there  is  no  indication  as  to  why  that
    support could not be resumed if she returned to  India.   I  also  note
    that the circumstances in which the Appellant left her family home were
    at the instigation of her brother and of the priest from the temple and
    there is no reason to believe that they would not continue  to  support
    her.  It was the Appellant's brother who approached the priest  in  the
    first place and who intervened in the Appellant's domestic situation.

21. In these circumstances I do not accept that  it  has  been  shown  that
    there are insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant returning to  India
    to resume living with her family there or to resume living  there  with
    the support of the Gudwara.

22. I have considered whether there are  circumstances  in  this  case  not
    already cover by the Immigration Rules and I do not accept  that  there
    are any circumstances not already dealt with. I  consider  her  private
    life in terms of the steps set out in R v SSHD ex parte  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27.  The Appellant has been in the UK  for  a  very  short  period
    since January 2014.  There is no evidence of significant links she  has
    made in the UK.  However I accept that she has  established  a  private
    life in terms of her relationship with members of the Gudwara and  that
    she has established friendships here. I accept that her  removal  would
    interfere  with  such  private  life.   I   consider   the   issue   of
    proportionality and Section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  speaks
    English. There  is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  is  financially
    independent.  I note that there is no other evidence in relation to the
    Appellant's links in the UK. In these circumstances I am satisfied that
    the removal is proportionate and there would be no breach of Article  8
    in removing the Appellant from the UK.

Notice of  Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law and I
    set it aside.

24. I remake the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal.
