For the Appellant:     Mr Adejumobi, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  Uganda  born  on  25th  July  1995.   He
    applied for entry clearance for settlement to join a parent present and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  His application was considered  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer under paragraph 297 of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and was refused on 8th January 2013.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  His appeals were linked to those of his  sisters'
    Miss Emma Cynthia Nassozi and Miss Allen Ritah Nanteza.   Miss  Nassozi
    and Miss Nanteza are the Appellant's elder sisters.   The  appeal  came
    before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal De Haney sitting at  Manchester
    on 21st March 2014.  In a determination promulgated on 15th April  2014
    the Appellant's appeal was allowed.  The appeals  of  his  two  sisters
    were dismissed.  There had been no  attendance  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by the Appellant's legal representatives or Sponsor.

 2. On 15th April 2014 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of  Appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.  On 14th May 2014  Designated  Judge  David  Taylor
    granted permission to appeal noting that it was arguable that the judge
    had failed adequately to provide reasons  for  his  findings  on  major
    issues raised in the refusal notice and that regrettably the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's reasons were not at all clear nor explained.  No  Rule
    24 response was lodged by the Appellant.

 3. It was on that basis that the appeal first came before me to  determine
    whether there was a  material  error  of  law.   At  that  hearing  the
    Appellant was not represented.  The Secretary of State was.  Whilst the
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  indicated  that  there  was  no
    attendance on behalf of the Appellant the way in which it  was  written
    implies that may well be by way of legal representation rather than  by
    an attendance of a Sponsor for it is clear  that  Judge  De  Haney  had
    taken into account evidence given by the  Sponsor.   Having  said  that
    strong argument was put to me both in the written grounds  and  by  the
    Home Office's oral submissions that  such  findings  were  wrong.   For
    example the judge concluded at paragraph 16 that the Sponsor was forced
    to leave Uganda.  Miss Johnstone  submitted  to  me  that  that  was  a
    factual error and that the Sponsor is in fact a failed  asylum  seeker.
    Further the judge has stated that he is prepared  to  accept  that  the
    Sponsor has taken on sole  responsibility  for  the  Appellants  and  I
    agreed with the submission made by Ms Johnstone that there was no basis
    for reaching that conclusion.  Further there appeared to have  been  no
    evidence to suggest that the Appellant would be permitted to be allowed
    to live in the accommodation that was being proposed by  the  Sponsor's
    landlord and again a lack of  reasoning  and  findings  of  fact  which
    amount to more than mere disagreement appeared to be sustainable.   The
    Grounds of Appeal at paragraphs  3  to  8  were  all  sustainable.   In
    particular the judge had not made a finding on the  pivotal  matter  of
    the Appellant's age at date of application and the submissions made  by
    the Presenting Officer at the hearing.  For all the above matters there
    were material errors of law and I set aside the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 4. The Secretary of State's representative at the hearing on the error  of
    law did not press me to re-make the decision on the grounds that  there
    was agreement that the Sponsor may well not have been notified  of  the
    hearing.  In such circumstances I gave directions for the re-hearing of
    this matter reserving it to myself advising  that  there  be  leave  to
    either party to file an up-to-date bundle of evidence upon  which  they
    seek to rely at the Tribunal at least seven days pre-hearing.

 5. It is on that  basis  that  the  appeal  comes  back  before  me.   The
    Appellant is now represented by his legal representative Mr  Adejumobi.
    Also in attendance is the Sponsor Miss Grace Nizziwa.  The Secretary of
    State appeared by his Home Office Presenting Officer Mr  McVeety.   The
    bundle remains as that that was before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  save
    that there is an additional witness statement  served  by  the  Sponsor
    dated 20th January 2015.  Again for the purpose of  continuity  I  note
    that this is an appeal by the Secretary of State but the  Secretary  of
    State is referred to herein as the Respondent and Mr  Ssekimpi  as  the
    Appellant.

Evidence

 6. The evidence in  this  matter  is  that  there  were  originally  three
    Appellants all of whom sought entry clearance to the United Kingdom for
    the purpose of settlement as adult dependent relatives  under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules.  The initial  decision  was  made  on  9th
    January 2013 and on appeal the Appellant's sisters'  applications  were
    refused by Immigration Judge De Haney but that the current  Appellant's
    application was however allowed on  the  ground  that  the  Immigration
    Judge found that he was aged under 18 at the date  of  application  and
    therefore could qualify under the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Sponsor in this matter is the Appellant's mother.  She confirms and
    adopts her three witness statements in particular  her  latest  witness
    statement dated 20th January 2015.  She advises that she came to the UK
    on 29th August 2003  fleeing  political  persecution  in  Uganda.   She
    claimed asylum but her claim was not successful.  The Sponsor became an
    overstayer but her case was dealt with pursuant to the  legacy  amnesty
    granted by the Secretary of State  some  seven  years  later  when  the
    Sponsor was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and subsequent
    to that she has become a British citizen.  She advises that neither she
    nor her legal representatives were advised of the hearing on 21st March
    2014 before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  She sets  out  the  factual
    history of this matter at paragraphs 5 to 13 of her  witness  statement
    all of which I have read and  taken  into  account.   She  states  that
    whilst in the UK she maintains contact with the children  by  telephone
    as this is quicker and easier than trying to  contact  them  by  email.
    When she left Uganda she left the children in the care of  the  convent
    at Lubaga.  She advises that the Appellant was born on 25th  July  1995
    and at the time  of  his  birth  it  was  not  compulsory  to  register
    childbirth in Uganda although the nurses would write a  record  of  the
    birth if a child was born in a hospital.  She states that the Appellant
    was born in Mulago Hospital in Kampala and she remembers that after  he
    was born the nurses gave her a piece of  paper  confirming  his  birth.
    She states that she used this  paper  to  obtain  the  Appellant's  BCG
    immunisation dose given by public health nurses within the hospital.

 8. Further she states that when it was  necessary  for  the  Appellant  to
    obtain a passport in order to secure a visa it was necessary  prior  to
    making such application to have  a  birth  certificate  available.   To
    obtain the birth certificate as a minor she advises  it  was  necessary
    for an adult to sign on the child's behalf but that that adult did  not
    need to be a parent because the parent was  not  providing  information
    about the date of birth.  She  states  that  she  was  the  person  who
    provided this information so that when the signature was  required  she
    asked the children to go to one of the clan elders  as  they  would  be
    likely to know about the Appellant's father as they were members of the
    same clan or alternatively to remember when  Benjamin  was  born.   She
    advises that this is exactly what took place and someone else signed as
    if he was the father.  She merely states in her witness statement:

         "I am afraid these sort of things happen in Uganda  anyway  because
         people are willing to help orphans."

 9. The Sponsor advises that at the time of application she had  four  jobs
    and that she lives in two-bedroomed accommodation.  She produces to the
    court photographs.  These photographs are old ones and she states  that
    they depict the children when she left in 2002 and  another  photograph
    depicts them some years later.

10. Under cross-examination by Mr McVeety he refers to the  fact  that  the
    latest witness statement refers to the birth  certificate  and  to  the
    suggestion (mentioned above) that someone else  had  signed  the  birth
    certificate.  He enquires who signed it and the  Appellant  replies  it
    was an elder who signed it  as  if  he  was  the  father.   Mr  McVeety
    therefore points out to the Appellant that  the  birth  certificate  is
    false even if it is her contention that it is accepted.  The  Sponsor's
    reply is that elders do sign these  documents  on  behalf  of  children
    without their fathers and when questioned as  to  whether  the  Ugandan
    authorities are content  with  this  situation  she  advised  that  she
    believes that they are.  She further confirms that so far  as  the  two
    elder children are concerned (who are of course not the subject of this
    appeal) they too had their birth certificates  signed  for  by  a  clan
    elder and not by their natural father.

11. The Sponsor advises that she speaks regularly to her son and  the  last
    time she spoke to him was actually the day of the hearing and that  she
    last saw him in May 2014.  She advises that his  sisters  resided  with
    him in Uganda and that the children all attended school  and  that  she
    made payment towards this although she does not have receipts available
    from the school.  She states that she last saw the children's father in
    May 2002 and she does not know what had happened  to  him  since  then.
    She confirms that there would not be objection to anyone else living in
    her property with her and produces a letter from the  relevant  agency.
    She  further  confirms  that  she  sends  money  regularly  to   Uganda
    contending that she sends �1,300 a month.  When queried as to  how  she
    can afford this amount she states that her income from two current jobs
    totals approximately �2,000 per month and that the Appellant is now  at
    college studying computer studies for which the fees are some �200  per
    month and which she pays.

Submissions/Discussions

12. Mr McVeety states that he relies on the Notice of Refusal pointing  out
    that the issue in question is  that  the  Appellant  (via  his  Sponsor
    and/or legal representatives) has to demonstrate that the Appellant  is
    the age that he says he is and that the only evidence available is  the
    birth certificate which cannot be relied upon.  He submits that  it  is
    already conceded that somebody else has signed  the  birth  certificate
    purporting to be the Appellant's father and that only two scenarios can
    be construed from that namely that if the Appellant's  father  actually
    had signed it then he would be still involved in the  Appellant's  life
    and that the appeal would  fail  on  that  basis.   Alternatively  that
    somebody else has masqueraded as the Appellant's father.

13. He points out that there has been no evidence produced to the  Tribunal
    to show that the Ugandan government accepts other signatories on  birth
    certificates and no documents have been produced to show that  a  child
    can be moved from one country to another.  He  therefore  submits  that
    the Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules and that  there
    has been a clear lack of ongoing contact pointing  out  that  the  last
    photograph that was produced is one from 2008.

14. He further submits  that  there  is  a  considerable  conflict  in  the
    evidence as to who has actually brought up these children pointing  out
    that it is the Secretary of State's contention that it  may  well  have
    been their natural father and that in any event if  the  Appellant  was
    over 18 at date of application he cannot succeed.  He points  out  that
    it is not possible to rely on the birth certificate  and  that  if  the
    signatory therein was  not  the  Appellant's  father  then  it  is  not
    unreasonable  to  expect  that  an  explanation  would  not  have  been
    forthcoming at that time.

15. So far as Article 8 is  concerned  he  would  ask  me  to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's claim pointing out that he cannot succeed under or  outside
    the Immigration Rules and that in fact all that would be  taking  place
    is the maintenance of the status quo.   He  asked  me  to  dismiss  the
    appeal.

16. Mr Adejumobi asked me to look at the evidence in the round and takes me
    back to the initial witness statement signed by the Sponsor in which he
    pointed that she had had three children  and  that  that  evidence  had
    never been challenged.  He  asked  me  to  look  solely  at  the  birth
    certificate in the context that it is evidence in the round although he
    acknowledges that the birth certificate cannot specifically  be  relied
    upon.  He submits that the Appellant's date of birth is correct.

17. So far as the issues of maintenance and accommodation are concerned  he
    takes me to  the  original  tenancy  agreement  which  points  out  the
    permitted occupation for the property is three persons and  at  present
    the Sponsor is living alone and therefore there would be no breach of a
    tenancy agreement if the Appellant were to move in with  her.   Further
    he takes me to the original bundle and the contention that at the  time
    of the Appellant's  application  the  Sponsor  had  four  jobs  and  no
    dependants in the UK and he submits  that  she  meets  the  maintenance
    requirements and contends that she  has  sole  responsibility  for  him
    relying on the fact that whilst he was living at the convent a power of
    attorney was  granted  to  the  sisters  but  that  the  Sponsor  still
    maintains sole responsibility.

18. In the alternative Mr  Adejumobi  submits  that  the  Appellant  should
    succeed pursuant to Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human
    Rights but makes no further submissions on that point.

Findings

19. The Appellant's  application  is  based  under  paragraph  297  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  namely  an  application  for  entry  clearance  for
    settlement to join a parent present and settled in the United  Kingdom.
    The Appellant's application was made on 11th December 2012.  Notice  of
    Refusal was dated 8th January 2013.  It is  unfortunate  that  it  took
    some fifteen months before this matter was brought  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.  The judge acknowledged that the relevant  law  is
    now set out under the Immigration Rules under paragraph FM  (i.e.  that
    is the considering paragraph rather than the original paragraph 297  of
    the old Rules).  The judge accepted that the Appellant was 17 years old
    at the date of application and on that basis allowed  the  appeal  also
    being satisfied that the Appellant would be adequately  maintained  and
    provided with adequate accommodation having  considered  the  financial
    position of the Sponsor and her accommodation.

20. The pivotal issue is the  credibility  and  reliability  of  the  birth
    certificate produced on behalf of the  Appellant.   Evidence  has  been
    given as  to  what  is  effectively  a  system  of  practice  of  birth
    registration  in  Uganda  and  a   purported   acceptance   of   forged
    documentation in order to obtain  birth  certificates  signed  by  clan
    elders in the absence of a relative.  That evidence  is  solely  to  be
    found in the written and oral testimony of the Sponsor.   I  find  that
    birth certificate totally unreliable.  Mr Adejumobi is frank enough  to
    acknowledge that the birth certificate cannot  be  specifically  relied
    upon and merely seeks to rely upon it  "in  the  round".   I  find  the
    Sponsor's testimony on this issue not to be credible.  If  the  process
    upon which birth certificates are issued are as she says they were then
    no explanation is provided as to why such evidence was not given before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  It is only on the re-hearing of  this  matter
    that this issue is now raised and addressed.  Such failings to properly
    address the issue is the starting point of the lack of  credibility  of
    the Sponsor's testimony.  However that is not the only basis upon which
    credibility is brought into issue.  If such  a  practice  is  regularly
    adopted in Uganda then I would have expected that the Appellant  and/or
    her representatives would at  least  have  attempted  to  produce  some
    objective or corroborative evidence regarding it.  It is not as if they
    do not know that this is a key issue in this appeal.  No such  evidence
    is made available nor is any explanation provided as to why that is the
    case.  That again emphasises the finding of adverse credibility.

21. In such circumstances whilst it is for the Appellant to  discharge  the
    burden of proof even allowing that that may merely be on the balance of
    probabilities I am not satisfied that  the  Appellant  approaches  this
    threshold at all.  It is a requirement that the Appellant was under the
    age of 18 when he made his application.  The evidence  surrounding  the
    Appellant's  date  of  birth  lacks  any  sustainability  as   to   its
    credibility.  Even allowing that the burden of proof is on the  balance
    of probabilities I am not satisfied that the Appellant has  shown  that
    he was under 18 as his date of birth and therefore the Appellant cannot
    meet the provisions of the Immigration Rules.

22. That indeed remains the thrust of the Secretary of State's appeal which
    for the above reason therefore succeeds.  For the record I am satisfied
    that evidence has been produced that  if  the  appeal  had  failed  the
    Sponsor's accommodation would be adequate for the Appellant  to  reside
    in.

23. Finally I turn briefly to the issue of Article 8.  I do so because  the
    Appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  it  is
    therefore necessary to look at Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.



24. In any consideration of an Article 8 claim the starting  point  is  the
    law itself.  Article 8 states:

    (a)  everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
         his home and his correspondence;

    (b)  there should be no interference by a public body with the exercise
         of this right except such as is in accordance with the law  and  is
         necessary in a democratic  society  in  the  interest  of  national
         security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of  the  country,
         for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
         health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and  freedom
         of others.

25. The general approach to Article 8 cases is that in Nhundu  and  Chiwera
    (01/TH/00613).  In those cases the  Tribunal  said  that,  in  deciding
    claims under Article 8, there is  a  five  stage  test  which  must  be
    applied in order to determine whether a breach has occurred:

      i) does family life, private life, home or correspondence exist within
         the meaning of Article 8;

     ii) if so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with;

    iii) if so, was the interference in accordance with the law;

     iv) if so, was the interference in pursuit of  one  of  the  legitimate
         aims set out in Article 8(2); and

      v) if so, is the interference proportionate  to  the  pursuit  of  the
         legitimate aim?

    Those were essentially the five questions  endorsed  by  the  House  of
    Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

26. Thereafter there has been a plethora of authorities and the law now  is
    such that if an applicant cannot satisfy the Rules  then  there  either
    is, or is not, a further Article 8 claim.  That was the view  expressed
    in MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 982 and has found support  and  backing  in  the  decision  of
    Haleemudeen v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 558.  The Court of Appeal  held  that  where  the  Article  8  ECHR
    elements of the Immigration Rules are not met, refusal  would  normally
    be  appropriate  but  that  leave  can  be  granted  where  exceptional
    circumstances in the sense of unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the
    individual would result.

27. That cannot be the position  in  this  instant  case.   As  Mr  McVeety
    submits all that is being done is the maintenance of  the  status  quo.
    The Sponsor and the Appellant have lived apart  at  the  Sponsor's  own
    choosing (she could have returned when she was  acknowledged  to  be  a
    failed asylum seeker) at her own instigation.  The Appellant  has  been
    brought up at a convent and has lived  with  his  sisters.   They  have
    family life together.  There is nothing to stop  any  of  the  children
    visiting the Sponsor in the UK  or  through  other  means  particularly
    those of modern information technology i.e. Skype  and  email.   Public
    interest and in particular the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom
    is  now  a  primary  consideration  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control.  There  is  nothing  within  this  case  that  can
    possibly bring it within the requirements of Article 8 of the  European
    Convention of Human Rights for all the reasons set out above.  In  such
    circumstances the Appellant's appeal pursuant  to  Article  8  is  also
    dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal is dismissed both under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

No anonymity direction is made.
