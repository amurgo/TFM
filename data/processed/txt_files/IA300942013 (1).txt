Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms B Smith, instructed by AMR Solicitors

Interpreter:     Ms Nayyara Mubashira (Punjabi)


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.    I shall refer to the  parties  as  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 1st July 1952.  Her  appeal
      against the Respondent's  decision  refusing  leave  to  remain  under
      paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules was allowed by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal in  a  determination  promulgated  on  4th  March  2014.  The
      Secretary of State appealed.

2.    Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes
      on 10th April 2014 on the grounds that it was arguable that First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Coutts had misdirected himself in his approach  to  the
      evidence. No  adequate  consideration  was  given  to  the  daughter's
      circumstances in Pakistan or her  ability  to  assist  the  Appellant.
      "Cultural" considerations were referred  to  in  the  briefest  terms,
      without being adequately explored, and there was no  consideration  of
      care services from third parties that  the  sponsor  could  fund.  The
      determination made no reference to Mohamed v Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 331.

3.    At a hearing on 4th June 2014, I found that the Judge's findings  were
      insufficient to support his  overall  conclusion  that  the  Appellant
      satisfied  all  the  requirements  of  paragraph  317.  There  was  no
      consideration as to whether or not the payments by  the  Sponsor  were
      essential to  help  the  Appellant  achieve  a  reasonable  lifestyle.
      Paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules required the Appellant to  show
      the "most exceptional compassionate  circumstances."Applying  Mohamed,
      the circumstances must be extreme to satisfy the Rules. The  facts  as
      found by the Judge were compassionate, but not the  most  exceptional.
      That was not to say the  Appellant  could  not  demonstrate  the  most
      exceptional compassionate circumstances, but the evidence  before  the
      Judge was insufficient to allow him to reach that conclusion.

4.    I found  that  the  Judge's  findings  at  paragraphs  8  to  10  were
      insufficient to reach the  high  threshold  of  the  most  exceptional
      compassionate circumstances, or to conclude  that  the  Appellant  was
      financially dependant on the Sponsor in the UK. I found that the Judge
      erred in law and I set aside his decision dated 4th March  2014.  None
      of the findings of fact were preserved.

5.    At the hearing today, Ms Smith relied on  her  skeleton  argument  and
      submitted that  the  appeal  should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal because it was to be re-heard de novo and the Appellant would
      be denied an avenue of appeal if the matter was  heard  by  the  Upper
      Tribunal. I was concerned that there was little evidence on  the  face
      of the papers of the Appellant's personal and financial  circumstances
      in Pakistan. She had, however, submitted personal bank statements with
      her application. These were found on the Home Office  file,  but  were
      not in the Respondent's bundle on the  court  file.  The  copies  were
      difficult to read.

6.    Mr Walker was satisfied that there was  sufficient  evidence  to  show
      that the Appellant could satisfy  the  maintenance  and  accommodation
      requirements. It was agreed by the parties that the two issues in this
      appeal were  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  and  financial
      dependency on the Sponsor. I had allowed the  Respondent's  appeal  to
      the Upper Tribunal on the basis that there was  insufficient  evidence
      to  show  that  these  two  requirements  of  paragraph  317  of   the
      Immigration Rules were met.

7.    The Appellant is 62 years old and has  been  in  the  UK  since  April
      2012. She had visited the UK on numerous occasions from 2006 to  2012.
      She last arrived on 22nd April 2012 and  her  leave  expired  on  22nd
      October 2012. She applied for indefinite leave to remain on  5th  July
      2012.

8.    There was evidence to show that the Appellant  suffered  from  various
      medical conditions and could not look after herself. She was unable to
      self-administer  medication  because  she  failed  to  understand  the
      complex dosing schedules. Her daughter in Pakistan was able  to  visit
      her, but could not live with her, and the Appellant could not live  in
      her daughter's house because she had five children of her own  and  it
      was not culturally  acceptable.  The  Appellant's  mother  and  entire
      family lived in the UK, save for her daughter.

9.    There was evidence  to  show  that  the  Sponsor  sent  money  to  the
      Appellant from 2004 to 2006 by money transfer. There was also evidence
      that money was sent with relatives and a transfer of  ï¿½5000  was  made
      into the Appellant's bank account in Pakistan on 9th July 2010.

10.   There was insufficient evidence in the witness statements and  in  the
      documentary evidence to show that the Appellant was mainly  or  wholly
      financially dependant on the Sponsor and that she was unable to obtain
      help or move house to be near her daughter, following Mohamed.

11.   Therefore, having regard to the overriding  objective,  I  am  of  the
      view that in the interests of fairness the Appellant should  be  given
      the opportunity to present her case in the First-tier Tribunal and  to
      provide oral and documentary evidence of her  personal  and  financial
      circumstances in  Pakistan.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  would  be  the
      appropriate forum to hear substantial oral evidence and make  findings
      of fact, and the Appellant would not be denied an avenue of appeal.

12.   Accordingly, I have decided in accordance with paragraph  7.2  of  the
      Practice Statements of 25th September 2012 that the appeal  should  be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


                                 DIRECTIONS

(i)   The Tribunal is directed pursuant to section 12(3) of  the  Tribunals,
      Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 to reconsider the appeal at a  hearing
      before a First-tier Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Coutts.

(ii)  The parties to serve all further documentary material  on  which  they
      intend to rely not later than 7 days before the date  of  hearing.  In
      particular, the Respondent  to  serve  copies  of  all  the  documents
      submitted with the application and the Appellant to serve evidence  of
      the Appellant's financial and personal circumstances in Pakistan.
