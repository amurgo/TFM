                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Samimi, promulgated on 24 July 2015, allowing an  appeal
    against a decision to refuse the respondent leave to enter  the  United
    Kingdom as a partner.

Background

 2.  The  respondent's  application  was  refused  on  12  May  2014  under
    paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d), with reference to E-ECP  2.7;  S-EC.2.2(a))  E-
    ECP.3.1 and E-ECP 4.1. In essence, it was said  that  the  marriage  in
    question was not valid because the sponsor  was  not  legally  free  to
    marry; that false representations had been made regarding the sponsor's
    employment; questions were raised as to the sponsor's actual employment
    during the 2013-14 financial year on account of HMRC checks; there  had
    been a failure to supply specified evidence and  it  was  not  accepted
    that the respondent had passed an English language test at a minimum of
    level A1 of the CEF.

 3. In appealing the ECO's decision  the  respondent  stressed  she  was  a
    partner within the definition set out in GEN 1.2(iv)  of  Appendix  FM;
    that no false representations had been made; that the ECO ought to have
    used discretion under the evidential flexibility  section  of  her  own
    guidance; that there were  only  minor  evidential  problems  with  the
    sponsor's personal bank statements; that  the  ECO  was  irrational  in
    rejecting the employment documents; that the respondent  had  erred  in
    respect of the English  language  test  and  that  there  had  been  no
    consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules.

 4. It is not apparent whether an Entry Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  reviewed
    the decision to refuse entry as there was no respondent's  evidence  on
    the Tribunal case file when FTTJ Samimi decided this  matter  and  this
    remains the case.

 5. At the hearing before the FTTJ, only the  sponsor  gave  evidence.  The
    FTTJ  accepted  his  explanation  that   he   had   misunderstood   the
    significance of the Decree Nisi, which he thought was  confirmation  of
    his divorce from his first wife and accordingly  concluded  that  there
    had been no false representations made. She considered  the  respondent
    to be a fiancï¿½e rather than spouse, a  partner  nonetheless.  The  FTTJ
    also found that the sponsor had  adequately  explained  his  employment
    history as well as the reasons why his wage slips  did  not  correspond
    with the credits to his bank account and accordingly the minimum income
    threshold  was  met.  She  also  accepted  that  the  English  language
    requirement had been met. The appeal was allowed under the  Immigration
    Rules as well as under Article 8  outside  the  Rules,  with  the  FTTJ
    particularly noting the best interests of the respondent's  child  with
    the sponsor.

Error of law

 8. The grounds of application argue that the FTTJ erred  in  allowing  the
    appeal on both bases. In particular, it was said that the  FTTJ  failed
    to assess whether any of the specified evidence had  been  supplied  of
    the sponsor's salaried employment. Further, it was said that  the  FTTJ
    erred in relying on the case of Mostafa (Article 8 in entry  clearance)
    [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) which concerned a proposed  visit  rather  than
    entry as a partner. The FTTJ had failed to consider SS  (Congo)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387. Furthermore, there was said to have been no consideration
    of sections 117A and B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002.

 9. FTTJ PJM Hollingworth granted permission to appeal, stating that it was
    arguable that the FTTJ had failed provide reasons for finding there  to
    be compelling circumstances; that the criteria in section 117B had  not
    been applied to the facts and that it was arguable that  there  was  an
    error of law in relation to the specified evidence requirements.

10. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Melvin  expanded  on  the  grounds  of
    application with reference to the lack of consideration of Appendix FM-
    SE and his argument that the FTTJ did not consider  Article  8  through
    the lens of the Rules. At this stage, Mr Singer interjected to  concede
    that the FTTJ had erred regarding the first ground, in that she did not
    pose the question as to specified evidence. Mr Melvin advised  me  that
    he was in  difficulty  as  he  lacked  a  respondent's  bundle  and  no
    Presenting Officer had attended the First-tier hearing. He argued  that
    the FTTJ had treated the British citizen child of the appellant  as  if
    it was a trump card and had failed to consider the Rules. This was  the
    wrong approach. The child in question was free to come and  go  between
    the United Kingdom and Bangladesh and family life could  continue  with
    the sponsor continuing to spend a couple of weeks a year in Bangladesh.
    He invited me to find a material error of law and re-decide the appeal.

11. Mr Singer concentrated  on  the  second  ground  regarding  the  FTTJ's
    treatment of Article 8 outside the Rules. He argued that the  FTTJ  had
    raised compelling factors; she had considered the best interests of the
    child in question as well as the various  requirements  of  the  Rules,
    finding them to be met "in spirit." While the FTTJ  had  not  expressly
    referred to section 117 of the 2002 Act and had the factors included in
    section 117B been explicitly addressed, they would have  been  resolved
    in the respondent's favour.

12. At the end of the hearing, I announced that while the FTTJ had erred in
    not addressing Appendix FM-SE, she had made no error in relation to her
    decision to allow the appeal  outside  the  Rules  and  in  the  latter
    aspect, I upheld her decision. My reasons are as follows.

13. It was a matter of agreement between the representatives that the  FTTJ
    had not considered Appendix FM-SE and Mr  Singer  did  not  argue  that
    those specific requirements were met.  I  accordingly,  set  aside  the
    decision of the FTTJ to allow the appeal under the Rules and substitute
    a decision dismissing the appeal on that basis.

14. With regard to the decision to allow the appeal on Article  8  grounds,
    outside the Rules, I find that the FTTJ applied SS (Congo), in that she
    clearly identified compelling reasons before going on to consider  this
    aspect of the case. Indeed at [15] she employs the phrase,  "there  are
    compelling  factors."  The  FTTJ  rightly  identified  that  the   best
    interests of the child in question was a  primary  consideration;  that
    the child was a British citizen and that the child's best interests was
    to be cared  for  by  both  his  parents.  There  is  nothing  perverse
    regarding the FTTJ's finding that the separation of the sponsor and his
    British child for a period of three years at the time,  amounted  to  a
    compelling circumstance.

15. I find that it cannot be said that the FTTJ  undertook  a  freestanding
    consideration of Article 8  without  reference  to  the  Rules.  Before
    embarking on her Article 8 consideration,  she  had  satisfied  herself
    that there was no evidence of deception, that  the  sponsor's  earnings
    exceeded the minimum income threshold, that there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship between the parties, that the respondent  could
    be considered as a partner notwithstanding that she and the sponsor had
    married prior to his Decree  Absolute  being  announced  and  that  the
    English language requirement was met. The only aspect of the Rules  not
    met was the required specified evidence showing  the  sponsor's  income
    being credited to his bank account over  a  six-month  period.  As  the
    sponsor advised the FTTJ, noted at [11] of the decision and reasons, he
    is paid in cash and therefore he was not in a position to provide  that
    evidence.

16. It is the case that the FTTJ did not expressly refer to section 117  of
    the 2002 Act, however I find that she did not materially err  in  this.
    The only factors set out in section 117B relevant to  this  appeal  are
    the interests of immigration control, the ability of  an  applicant  to
    speak English and to be financially independent.

17. At [16] of the decision, the FTTJ considers all three of those matters;
    particularly noting that the English language requirements were met and
    the sponsor's earnings met  the  minimum  income  threshold.  The  FTTJ
    carried out a balancing exercise, but concluded that  the  interference
    with the respondent's family life is disproportionate to the  interests
    of immigration control. There was nothing perverse in this finding.

18. I accordingly allow the Secretary of State's appeal only in part.

Decision


 1) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law

 2) The decision of the FTTJ to allow  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules is set aside.

 3) I substitute a  fresh  decision  to  dismiss  the  respondent's  appeal
    against the refusal of her  application  for  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 4) The decision of the FTTJ to allow the appeal under Article  8  ECHR  is
    upheld.

    No application for anonymity was made and I could see no reason to make
    such a direction.
