                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  (Istanbul)  from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowing the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse  his  application  for  settlement  as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled here on the ground that  he  had
    previously contrived in a significant way to frustrate the intention of
    the Immigration Rules, and thus fell foul of  paragraph  320(11).   The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that the claimant requires anonymity for these proceedings  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The claimant is a national of Turkey, whose date of birth is 1  January
    1988.  He entered the  United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor,  aged  17,  and
    travelling with his mother on whom he was dependant, on or about 8 June
    2005.  He made a timely application  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Ankara Agreement in August 2005, but this was refused in November 2006.
     He lodged an appeal against the refusal, which was  unsuccessful,  and
    his appeal rights were exhausted by 22 March 2007.

 3. In July 2007  he  was  arrested  in  connection  with  an  incident  of
    dangerous driving, failing to  provide  a  specimen  for  analysis  and
    certain related motoring offences.  He was issued with a notice of  his
    liability to removal on account of his status as an overstayer.  He was
    granted temporary admission on conditions.  On  23  July  2007  he  was
    convicted of the above offences, and was  sentenced  inter  alia  to  a
    suspended term of imprisonment of twelve months.  The claimant complied
    with the requirements which were imposed upon him by the  sentence  and
    also complied with the conditions of  temporary  admission  during  the
    period while the requirements imposed by the sentence were  in  effect.
    However after the sentence was discharged,  on  or  about  22  December
    2008, the claimant absconded from immigration control.

 4. In the meantime, in or about 2006,  the  claimant,  who  is  a  Turkish
    Muslim, had met the sponsor, who is a Kurdish Alevi.  She has lived  in
    the United Kingdom since she was aged 3.  She entered the country  with
    her parents in circumstances where they felt compelled to migrate  from
    Turkey to avoid discrimination against Kurds and Alevis.   The  sponsor
    is  a  British  national.   Whereas  the  claimant  is  not  personally
    religious but is from a strict  Muslim  family,  the  sponsor  lives  a
    liberal  western  lifestyle.   They  have  differing  ethnicities   and
    religious backgrounds.  They nonetheless  became  attracted  with  each
    other, and by about May  2009  had  formed  a  relationship  of  mutual
    affection.

 5. By about 2010 the sponsor had become aware that  the  claimant  had  no
    legal status in the United Kingdom.  Nonetheless by about 2011 they had
    formed a lasting commitment to each other and wished  to  marry.   They
    planned to marry once the sponsor had completed her intended university
    education.

 6. The claimant was encountered and arrested by Immigration Authorities on
    16 October 2013.  He was found in a  raid  on  premises  where  it  was
    suspected that illegal entrants were working and  he  was  detained  on
    that suspicion.  He made an application that same month  for  leave  to
    remain in protection of his human rights.  The application was rejected
    by the Secretary of State, who decided to remove the claimant from  the
    United Kingdom.  In addition the decision was certified so as to remove
    an in-country right of  appeal.   The  claimant  did  not  contest  his
    removal, but voluntarily submitted to enforcement and left  the  United
    Kingdom at his own expense on 19 November 2013.

 7. The sponsor travelled to Turkey to marry the claimant, and the marriage
    took place in Turkey on 18 June 2014.   The  sponsor  returned  to  the
    United Kingdom and took up employment which gave her an  annual  salary
    of ï¿½20,000.

 8. On 21 November 2014, a year after his voluntary departure, the claimant
    applied for entry clearance for the purposes  of  settlement  with  the
    sponsor.

 9. On 16 January  2015  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  Istanbul  (post
    reference Istanbul\1274586) gave his reasons for refusing to grant  him
    entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Rules.   He
    referred to the claimant's immigration history.  He and the sponsor had
    chosen to enter into a marriage with a person  living  in  a  different
    country and they were both aware that  marriage  in  itself  would  not
    guarantee that he would be assured entry to the UK.  A person does  not
    have an inherent right to decide where to establish a family life.  His
    sponsor had the right to reside in Turkey but no obligation to  do  so.
    He was satisfied the modest degree of family life that had inured since
    their marriage would continue and would not be prejudiced or diminished
    by refusing him settlement.  Taking everything into account  and  given
    his past conduct, he considered it undesirable to  issue  the  claimant
    with entry clearance.  He was not prepared to  exercise  discretion  in
    his favour, and so refused his application under paragraph  EC-P.1.1(c)
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (S-EC.1.5).

10. In response to the claimant's extensive grounds  of  appeal,  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager gave her reasons for upholding the  refusal  decision
    on 20 April 2015.  The ECO had refused the  application  on  the  basis
    that the claimant's character and conduct in the UK were not  conducive
    to the public good.  While she agreed  this  was  the  case  given  his
    criminal history, it was now clear that his application could  also  be
    refused under paragraph 320(11).  She referred to the  entry  clearance
    guidance on refusal of entry clearance  under  paragraph  320(11),  and
    went on to identify what she said were the aggravating factors  in  the
    claimant's immigration history.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

11. The claimant's appeal came before Judge M J Gillespie sitting at Hatton
    Cross on 3 May 2016.  Mr Rai of  Counsel  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant, and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  represented  by  Mr
    Vaghela, a Home Office Presenting Officer.

12. As is recorded by  the  judge  in  paragraph  [14]  of  his  subsequent
    decision, Mr Vaghela did not advance the case that  the  claimant  fell
    foul of the suitability requirement in S-EC.1.5  of  Appendix  FM.   He
    submitted that the sole  issue  for  determination  by  the  judge  was
    whether Rule 320(11) applied.

13. The judge held there was only one dispute of fact  in  respect  of  the
    claimant's immigration history.  This  was  whether  the  claimant  was
    working at the place where he  was  encountered  in  2013.   The  judge
    addressed this factual issue in paragraphs [10] to [13].  He  concluded
    that it was not proven that the claimant  was  working  in  the  United
    Kingdom, but there was nevertheless good cause for  suspicion  that  he
    must have worked in order to support himself.

14. The judge addressed Rule 320(11) at paragraphs [16] to [27].  He  found
    that some of the claims made by the Entry Clearance  Manager  were  not
    made out, and he held that engaging in  employment  would  properly  be
    seen as effectively inseparable from overstaying, and not as a separate
    and distinct act undertaking in aggravation of the condition  of  being
    an overstayer.  At paragraph [23] he held that there  was  some  reason
    for concern that the conclusion of the Entry Clearance Manager that the
    aggravating factors significantly outweighed the positive factor of the
    claimant's voluntary departure "might be unsound".

15. At paragraph [24], the judge held that  the  conclusion  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager was shown to be unsound for a  further  and  decisive
    reason, which was  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  had  given  no
    consideration in the discretionary exercise to  the  sponsor's  British
    nationality and her assimilation to the life and culture in the  United
    Kingdom, including her employment and  ongoing  education.   The  judge
    held at paragraph [26]:

         "The [claimant], of course, submitted to removal,  accomplished  at
         his own expense, and thereby abided the process of the  law.   This
         act of the sponsor marrying the [claimant] from  Turkey,  far  from
         being a reckless act, undertaken knowing there was no guarantee  of
         the grant of  entry  clearance,  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
         regarded  it,  was  rather  an  act  of  deliberate  submission  to
         immigration control in the knowledge that all that could be done to
         rectify past evasion by the [claimant] had been done.  This  factor
         should have been given significant weight and not merely have  been
         the subject of dismissive confession and avoidance."

16. The judge concluded at paragraph [27] that the  invocation  of  320(11)
    was not in accordance with the law.  The Entry  Clearance  Manager  had
    failed to show that the breach of immigration law by the  claimant  was
    sufficiently  aggravated  to  justify,  in  the  face  of   all   other
    considerations in favour of the claimant, his exclusion from the United
    Kingdom.  All the other requirements for the grant of  entry  clearance
    under the chosen  route  having  been  proven,  entry  clearance  ought
    therefore to have been granted.

17. The judge addressed an  alternative  claim  under  Article  8  ECHR  at
    paragraphs  [28]  onwards.   Although  there  was   past   evasion   of
    immigration control by the claimant, he had purged this defiance,  with
    the support of the sponsor, and had rendered himself fully amenable  to
    law.  So there was  little  or  no  identifiable  or  remaining  public
    interest in his exclusion.  This view was supported by the  abandonment
    of reliance upon the provisions of S-EC.1.15 as a  ground  of  refusal.
    The claimant was suitable for the grant of entry clearance.

18. There was nothing which  justified  the  enforced  abandonment  of  the
    sponsor of her lifestyle and circumstances of this country,  where  she
    had lived since the age of 3 years, to travel to Turkey where she would
    be a member of an oppressed  minority  which  suffered  historical  and
    ongoing discrimination.  She would, in order to conform to unreasonable
    expectations in that country, be obliged to adopt  practices  that  she
    regarded as foreign, not only to herself and her upbringing, but indeed
    to her inherited cultural  and  religious  traditions.   There  was  no
    public interest, much less a proportionate public interest, arising  in
    this case that would justify one in  obliging  a  British  national  to
    submit to  such  a  radical  alteration  in  lifestyle  and  accustomed
    freedoms.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

19. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal.  Ground 1 was that the judge had circumvented the
    application of paragraph 320  by  seeking  to  minimise  and/completely
    exclude the  aggravating  factors  relied  upon  by  the  ECO  and  his
    conclusions were therefore a mistake of fact and a misdirection of law,
    should have prevented the ECO from having a fair hearing.

20. Ground 2 was that, having found the decision was not in  accordance  to
    the law, the judge could only have remitted the  appeal  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in order for a lawful decision to have been made.

21. Ground 3 was that the judge's Article 8  assessment  was  fundamentally
    flawed.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

22. On 16 December 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer granted the  Entry
    Clearance Officer permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         "As set out in the grounds, I am satisfied that it is arguable  the
         judge may have materially erred in relation  to  grounds  1  and  2
         namely the assessment  of  what  constituted  aggravating  features
         within 320(11) of the Immigration Rules, and regarding whether  the
         appeal should have been allowed outright or simply  remitted.   All
         grounds may be argued although the others may have less weight."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

23. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Singh developed the arguments advanced in the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  In reply, Mr Rai submitted that no error of  law
    was made out, for the reasons given in his skeleton argument.

Discussion

24. As Mr Singh developed ground 1, it became clear that the error  of  law
    challenged was a very narrow one.  He accepted that,  for  example,  it
    was open to the judge to treat the claimant's driving offence as  being
    a non-aggravating feature of the claimant's immigration history.  There
    was also no challenge to the judge's findings of fact that  in  certain
    material respects the Entry Clearance Manager  had  misrepresented  the
    claimant's immigration history,  by  for  example  asserting  that  the
    claimant had knowingly deceived  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  an
    Immigration Officer on entry by stating that his intentions were for  a
    short visit and then applying for leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    (under the Ankara Agreement).  This assertion by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager overlooked the fact that the claimant had entered  as  a  minor
    and in the company of his mother.  In the circumstances, as  the  judge
    held at paragraph  [18]  of  his  decision,  there  was  no  basis  for
    suggesting that there was anything misleading in the  stated  intention
    to visit.  As the judge also held in paragraph  [18],  the  application
    under the Ankara Agreement was a valid and lawful application to switch
    status which did not give rise to an inference of deception, even in an
    adult, in connection with an earlier visit visa application.

25.  The  only  objection  taken  to  the  judge's  lengthy  analysis   and
    deconstruction of the different aggravating factors relied  on  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager was the judge's finding that, if  the  claimant
    had worked illegally, it  was  not  an  aggravating  circumstance  that
    justified the invocation of Rule 320(11).

26. I consider that it was open to the judge to make this finding  for  the
    reasons which he gave.  His first reason was that working illegally was
    not listed as an aggravating circumstance.  The judge was alive to  the
    fact that the list of aggravating circumstances was expressly stated to
    be a non-exhaustive list.  But he held that it ought to be seen as  "an
    advised omission".

27. Support for this view is to be found in the  entry  clearance  guidance
    set out in paragraph 10 of ES (India) [2010] UKUT 440  (IAC)  to  which
    the judge referred  in  the  course  of  his  decision.   The  list  of
    aggravating circumstances in the guidance is more  extensive  than  the
    list given in the Rules.  One of the aggravating  circumstances  is  as
    follows:

         "Previous working in breach of visitor conditions  within  a  short
         time of arrival in the UK (i.e. premeditated intention to work)."

28. The principle of expressio unius, exclusio alterius is  in  play.   The
    fact that the Home Office has gone to the trouble of identifying a very
    specific  scenario  in  which  illegal  working   is   an   aggravating
    circumstance is strongly  indicative  that,  as  a  matter  of  policy,
    illegal working  per  se  is  not  to  be  treated  as  an  aggravating
    circumstance justifying the invocation of Rule 320(11).

29. The judge's second reason is an explanation  as  to  why  this  is  the
    policy of the Home Office.  From my recollection, his explanation is in
    line with an observation made by Lord Justice Sedley in  the  Court  of
    Appeal when considering the old fourteen year Rule  whereby  those  who
    had resided continuously in the United Kingdom for a period of fourteen
    years, despite having no right to be here, could apply  for  ILR.   The
    fact that such persons had worked illegally while  being  present  here
    unlawfully for fourteen years was not a  factor,  the  judge  observed,
    which counted against them.

30. I accept the climate has changed in recent times,  but  the  change  in
    climate with regard to illegal working is not reflected in Rule 320(11)
    or in the related IDIs which were before the Judge.

31. There is no challenge to the judge's finding that the claimant was  not
    in fact working when he  was  encountered  in  2013.  While  the  judge
    suspected that the claimant must have worked in the past, such activity
    would have largely coincided with the more tolerant attitude to illegal
    working by overstayers that used to prevail.

32. Even if the judge was wrong not to treat the claimant's suspected  (but
    unproven) illegal working in the past as an  aggravating  circumstance,
    it is clear that this was not the crucial  consideration  which  tipped
    the balance in the claimant's favour.  The judge  would  in  any  event
    have found that the invocation of Rule 320(11) was unjustified for  the
    other reasons which he gave, such as in the passage at  paragraph  [26]
    of his decision which I have cited above.

33. Mr Singh accepted that if ground 1 did not exceed, ground 3 fell  away.
    He also accepted that it was open to the  judge  to  allow  the  appeal
    outright in circumstances where he found that the  continued  exclusion
    of the claimant from the  United  Kingdom  was  disproportionate  under
    Article 8 ECHR.  Accordingly, ground 2 falls away as well.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
