Representation
For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr R Sharma of Counsel instructed by Charles  Simmons
                       Immigration Solicitors.


                         DETERMINATION: ERROR OF LAW

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Raymond promulgated on  16  June  2014,  allowing  Mr  Ludhi's  appeal
      against the Secretary of State's decision dated 14 May 2013 to  refuse
      to vary leave to remain as a spouse and to remove him from the UK.


   2. Although before me the Secretary of State  is  the  appellant  and  Mr
      Ludhi is  the  respondent,  for  the  sake  of  consistency  with  the
      proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter refer  to
      Mr  Ludhi  as  the  Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
      Respondent.


Background

   3. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 11  March  1990.  He
      entered the UK on 26 January 2010, pursuant to entry  clearance  as  a
      Tier 4 Student valid from 6 January 2010 until 28 March 2011.  He  was
      granted further leave to remain in this capacity, valid to 30  October
      2012. On 11 October 2012 the Appellant applied for variation of  leave
      to remain on the basis of his marriage to Ms Hasina Khanom, a  British
      citizen.


   4. The Appellant's application was refused  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
      'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated 14 May 2013. A  Notice  of
      Immigration Decision was issued on the same date.


   5. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


   6. The Appellant's appeal was allowed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
      reasons set out in the determination promulgated on 16 June 2014.


   7. The Respondent applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
      which was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cheales  on  10  July
      2014.


Error of Law

   8. The Respondent had not been  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the
      financial requirements of the Immigration Rules pursuant to  paragraph
      E-LTRP.3.1. The Respondent had also not been satisfied in  respect  of
      paragraph EX.1 and 276ADE.


   9. In respect of the financial requirements it is to be  noted  that  the
      Appellant had declared on his application form a combined income  with
      his wife of approximately ï¿½18,400  -  which  was  below  the  required
      level. Moreover, the supporting materials did not in all respects meet
      the requirements of Appendix FM-SE. Before me Mr Sharma does not  seek
      to dispute this. Moreover, subject to a submission on  discretion,  Mr
      Sharma did not seek to  argue  before  me  that  the  Appellant  could
      succeed in his appeal under the Rules.


  10. The submission in respect of discretion is set out at  paragraphs  6-9
      of the Skeleton Argument prepared by Mr Sharma for the hearing  before
      the Upper Tribunal. It is submitted that because the Rules  contain  a
      flexibility policy applicable where there is a  valid  reason  that  a
      specified document  cannot  be  supplied,  that  there  is  a  general
      discretion to dispense with  the  requirements  laid  out  within  the
      Rules. I do not accept that  the  inclusion  of  a  specific  flexible
      approach in respect of specified documentary material points towards a
      wider  discretion  within  the  Rules  to  disregard   the   specified
      requirements of the Rules - and more  particularly,  does  not  for  a
      moment indicate that there is a general discretion at large within the
      Rules to disregard the specified gross annual income figure, and apply
      some lower figure.


  11. In fairness, Mr Sharma did not push this submission  with  any  vigour
      and indeed recognised in his written submission that  the  flexibility
      provision on its own was "not very helpful".


  12.  Mr  Sharma's  'discretion'  submission  having  been   rejected,   he
      acknowledged that he could not support the conclusion  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge that the Appellant's appeal  succeeded  under  the
      Immigration Rules.


  13. In this context it is clear that  the  Judge's  decision  was  reached
      without any reference to the requirements of Appendix FM-SE. The Judge
      made extensive reference to, and placed reliance upon, materials  that
      were not submitted with the application, and indeed  to  circumstances
      that did not exist at the date of  the  application  with  regard,  in
      particular, to the increased earnings  of  the  Appellant.  There  are
      repeated  references  in  the  determination  to  the   provision   of
      supplementary materials in the appeal that were not submitted  to  the
      Respondent as part of the application: e.g. "The  supporting  evidence
      for these earnings, which were supplemented with  the  appeal  grounds
      with a view to the appeal hearing..." (paragraph 12); and "But for the
      appeal these [bank] statements were made available..." (paragraph 15).
      Moreover, there is no  attempt  to  relate  the  materials  that  were
      submitted  with  the   application   to   the   'specified   evidence'
      requirements of paragraph 2 of Appendix  FM-SE.  As  noted  above,  Mr
      Sharma acknowledges that those  requirements  were  not  met  in  some
      material respects.


  14. It follows that the Judge materially erred in law,  and  his  decision
      must be set aside.


  15. Because the Judge  was  satisfied  -  wrongly  -  in  respect  of  the
      financial requirements of the Rules, he did not give any consideration
      in the alternative to paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM, or yet further in
      the alternative Article 8 of the ECHR beyond the  express  wording  of
      the Rules. Indeed the Judge did not hear any oral evidence, but  dealt
      with the case on the basis of submissions in respect of the  financial
      circumstances of the Appellant and his wife. In all the  circumstances
      it was common ground that the appeal should be remitted to the  First-
      tier Tribunal, to a Judge other than Judge Raymond, for  the  decision
      in the appeal to be remade.


  16. The representatives before me were in agreement  that  the  Respondent
      had not taken issue with the suitability requirements under section S-
      LTR or the relationship requirements under paragraphs  E-LTRP.1.2-1.12
      and  E-LTRP.2.1,  and  accordingly  there  was  still  scope  for  the
      Appellant  to  succeed  under  the  Rules  pursuant  to  paragraph  R-
      LTRP.1.1(d) - which would necessitate a consideration  of  whether  or
      not there are insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant and  his  wife
      continuing family life outside the UK.


  17. That said, I do not seek to limit the scope of  the  rehearing  before
      the First-tier Tribunal, and in particular I  did  not  accede  to  Mr
      Sharma's suggestion that the findings of Judge Raymond in  respect  of
      the Appellant and his wife's earnings should be preserved. I  consider
      there is some weight to Ms Holmes' observation that there is a lack of
      clarity in respect of specific earnings at specific times, bearing  in
      mind in particular that the Appellant's wife had  a  sustained  period
      away from one of her two jobs, and where her hours were said  to  vary
      as much as between  4  and  16  hours  per  week.  Further,  where  on
      rehearing the next judge will likely  hear  oral  evidence,  it  seems
      artificial to restrict him or her to findings made without the benefit
      of such evidence. In the event, bearing in mind that under paragraph R-
      LTRP.1.1(d) there is no financial requirement  to  be  met,  the  non-
      preservation of Judge Raymond's findings may be of little consequence.
      If, nonetheless, the Appellant does wish to emphasise his  ability  to
      meet the threshold of the financial requirements under the  Rules,  it
      would be helpful if the financial information was presented in a  more
      readily accessible format - perhaps in a schedule cross-referenced  to
      supporting evidence rather than  mere  presentation  of  a  bundle  of
      disparate documents.


  18. It is otherwise not necessary  to  make  any  specific  directions  in
      respect of the rehearing: standard directions will suffice whereby any
      further materials must be filed and served within seven  days  of  the
      new hearing.


Decision

  19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  an  error  of
      law and is set aside.


  20. The decision in the appeal is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal by any judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Raymond.
