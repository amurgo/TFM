                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CHALKLEY

                                                             Between




                                GODWIN ARIKIBE

                                                                  Appellants

                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent




                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


      (The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule 17, and

    The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005, rule 17)





      1.     The appellants are a family from Nigeria.  The Second and Third
        named appellant's appeals are entirely dependant on the First named
        appellant who is the husband of  the  second  named  appellant  and
        father of the Third named appellant.


      2.    Future references to "the appellant"  are  to  the  First  named
        appellant.


      3.   The appellant, made application to the respondent on 19th  August
        2013 for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 2  Migrant
        under  the  points  based  scheme.   The  respondent  refused  that
        application and the appellant appealed to the First Tier Tribunal.


      4.    First Tier Tribunal Judge VA Osborne  refused  that  appeal  and
        First Tier Tribunal Judge Page granted leave to appeal to the Upper
        Tribunal.


      5.     At the hearing, I drew Mr Harrison's attention to the fact that
        the refusal notice appeared to refer the wrong clarification  under
        the Occupational Codes  of  Practice.   He  told  me  that  it  had
        contained a typing error and should have referred to SOC Code 3543,
        but at a higher level that the level at which  the  appellant  made
        application.


      6.    He indicated that the Secretary  of  State  would  withdraw  the
        decision and issue a further refusal letter giving a fresh right of
        appeal.


      7.      That decision operates as a withdrawal  of  the  Secretary  of
        State's case before the Upper Tribunal and the First-tier Tribunal,
        pursuant to rules 17 of the Upper Tribunal and First-tier  Tribunal
        Procedure Rules, respectively.


      8.      On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, and in my capacity as a judge
        of the First-tier Tribunal, I consent to those  withdrawals.  There
        is  therefore  no  longer  an  outstanding  appeal  before   either
        Tribunal.
