Representation:

For the Appellant:         Ms O Ukachi-Lois, of Counsel, instructed by
                    Charles Allotey & Co Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

(i)   In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on a point that has not been raised by the  parties  but
    which a judge considering such an application for permission  considers
    is arguably a Robinson obvious point or other point falling within para
    3 of the head-note in AZ (error of  law:  jurisdiction;  PTA  practice)
    Iran [2018] UKUT 00245 (IAC), the evidence necessary to  establish  the
    point in question must be apparent from the grounds of  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal (whether or not the  appellant  is  represented  at  the
    time) and/or the decision of the judge who decided  the  appeal  and/or
    the documents on  file.  The  permission  judge  should  not  make  any
    assumptions that such evidence was before the  judge  who  decided  the
    appeal. Furthermore, if permission is granted on a ground that has  not
    been raised by the parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in the
    exercise of self-restraint for the permission judge to  indicate  which
    aspect of head-note 3 of AZ applies.

(ii)  Permission should only be granted on the  basis  that  the  judge  who
    decided the appeal gave insufficient weight to a particular  aspect  of
    the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence the judge who
    decided the appeal has arguably made an  irrational  decision.  As  the
    Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ  412,
    it is necessary to guard against  the  temptation  to  characterise  as
    errors of law what are in truth no more than  disagreements  about  the
    weight to be given to different factors, particularly if the judge  who
    decided the appeal had the advantage of hearing oral evidence.

(iii) Particular care should be taken  before  granting  permission  on  the
    ground that the judge who decided  the  appeal  did  not  "sufficiently
    consider" or "sufficiently analyse" certain evidence or certain aspects
    of a case. Such complaints often turn out to be mere disagreements with
    the  reasoning  of  the  judge  who  decided  the  appeal  because  the
    implication is that the evidence or point in question was considered by
    the judge who decided the appeal but not to the extent desired  by  the
    author of the grounds or the  judge  considering  the  application  for
    permission. Permission should usually only be granted on  such  grounds
    if it is possible to state precisely how the assessment  of  the  judge
    who decided the appeal is arguably lacking and  why  this  is  arguably
    material.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on 1 September 1977, appeals,
    with permission granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  P  J  M
    Hollingworth (hereafter the "permission judge"), against a decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Clarke (hereafter the "judge",  to
    distinguish her from the permission judge)  who  dismissed  his  appeal
    against the respondent's decision of 14 November  2018  to  refuse  his
    application of 27 July 2016 for leave to remain on  the  basis  of  his
    right to his private life in the United Kingdom. The hearing before the
    judge took place on 22 January 2019.

 2. In AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018] UKUT 00245
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal (Lane J, President, and Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Blum) gave guidance on when it would be appropriate to grant permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on a ground that was  not  advanced  by
    the applicant. The decision in AZ was published on 21  September  2018.
    The permission judge signed his decision on 3 April 2019. He  therefore
    had the benefit of the guidance in AZ.

Immigration history

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2007 with leave
    as a student. He had leave as a student from 13  April  2007  until  30
    April 2011 and from 21 January 2015 until 18 February 2016. On 17 March
    2016, he made an application  for  leave  to  remain  on  compassionate
    grounds outside the Immigration Rules. The application was  refused  on
    20 July 2016 without a right of appeal. On 27 July 2016,  he  requested
    the respondent to reconsider his application on human  rights  grounds.
    This is the request that was the subject of the decision of 14 November
    2018 which gave the appellant a right of appeal.

The judge's decision

 4. An expert report from Dr Bashir, Consultant Psychiatrist, was submitted
    to the judge. The report stated that the appellant  had  suffered  from
    severe clinical  depression.  Ms  Ukachi-Lois,  who  appeared  for  the
    appellant before the judge, informed the judge that she  did  not  rely
    upon the appellant's ill-health. However, the  judge  said  ([5])  that
    some references were made to it during submissions.

 5. The judge considered the appellant's  private  life  claim  under  para
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules and concluded that  he  had  not
    shown  that  there  would  be  very  significant   obstacles   to   his
    reintegration in Nigeria. She noted that the appellant relied upon  his
    lack of family members in Nigeria, his  inability  to  accommodate  and
    maintain himself if he was returned, and that he  had  suffered  mental
    ill-health previously.

 6. In relation to the appellant's mental health,  the  judge  noted  ([7])
    that Dr Bashir stated that the appellant suffered from severe  clinical
    depression but she also noted that the  diagnosis  was  not  made  with
    reference to any criteria. She noted that the  appellant  was  referred
    back to his GP and that the medical evidence showed that  he  was  last
    prescribed setraline on 21 May 2018. In addition, she  noted  that  the
    appellant was not making a case based upon medical issues.

 7. In relation to the appellant's claim  that  he  would  experience  very
    significant obstacles to his reintegration in Nigeria because he had no
    family members in Nigeria and that he would be  unable  to  accommodate
    and maintain himself in  Nigeria,  the  judge  took  his  case  at  its
    highest, on the assumption that he had no family  members  in  Nigeria.
    She said, (at [8]-[9]):

      "8.   The Appellant left his country in 2007 and if  taking  his  case
            at its highest, and there are no family members there, and  the
            house of the great uncle is not available to him now the  uncle
            has died and the family members have locked it up, I go  on  to
            consider if he could return as a single male.

            9.   The Appellant came to the UK to study  on  [sic]  the  ACCA
            but did not complete the professional  level  because  of  ill-
            health. He told me he would like to complete his studies and  I
            see no reason why he could not return to his country and either
            continue  his  studies  there  or  make  an  out   of   country
            application to continue in the UK if this is what he so wishes.
            The aunt houses and maintains him and she said it would be  too
            costly for her to continue to maintain him if  he  returned  to
            Nigeria and lived there and for her to pay for his  studies.  I
            note the Appellant and his aunt appear not to  have  considered
            the option of him returning to his country and taking some form
            of employment to maintain himself. I was told by both witnesses
            there are no jobs but there is no objective evidence to show he
            could not obtain some work, and in the initial months the  aunt
            who has around �100,000 in savings and is drawing her  pensions
            as well as working as a nurse on around two shifts a  week  and
            earning around �2000 a  month  is  well-placed  to  assist  him
            financially when he returns to settle in his country."

            (My emphasis)

 8. The judge was asked to accept that the appellant lives with  his  aunt,
    Ms  Theresa  Chinyere  Odum,  in  the  United  Kingdom  in   a   family
    relationship. She also took this aspect of his case at its highest, and
    said, at [10]-[11]:

            "10. I was invited to accept the Appellant lives with  the  aunt
            in  a  family   relationship,   because   she   maintains   and
            accommodates him and there is more than  emotional  dependency.
            Taking the case at its highest, if there is a family  life  and
            it would be interfered with if he returns to Nigeria, the  aunt
            is from Nigeria and is now a British Citizen, but she  returned
            there in 2017 for a funeral, and it would be proportionate  for
            the Appellant to be  removed  to  Nigeria  because  they  could
            continue their relationship at a distance with her  maintaining
            and accommodating him until he settles on his own feet. She can
            also provide emotional assistance to ease  the  transition  and
            she can visit him as well.

            11.  I accept  the  Appellant  suffered  some  sort  of  nervous
            breakdown but he is now not  suffering  from  such  issues.  He
            attends a church  almost  daily,  but  there  are  churches  in
            Nigeria to attend and there is nothing to prevent him from such
            regular attendance there outside his work hours. The  community
            of a church would also ease his transition to independence."

 9. The judge then considered s.117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 and proportionality. She said, at [12]-[13]:

            "12.  The  Appellant  speaks  English  and  I  accept  has  been
            maintained by the aunt. However, he remained in  the  UK  after
            his leave to remain expired, and he was not studying, and I  do
            not accept his explanation for  so  remaining.  He  could  have
            returned to  his  country  and  made  another  out  of  country
            application if he so wished. The Appellant only had  precarious
            leave at best and has built up his private  life  when  he  had
            precarious  leave.  The  Appellant  has  made   a   number   of
            applications which were not successful since his refusal  on  2
            April 2013 with a right of appeal granted.

            13.  Therefore, drawing the strands together, the Appellant  can
            return to his country where he lived until he was 29 years old.
            He has the benefit of some financial assistance from  his  aunt
            to  ease  him  back  to  establishing  himself  before  he  can
            accommodate and maintain himself and he would not  deplete  her
            savings, and if he wishes he can  continue  to  reside  in  his
            country or make another  Tier  4  application  to  further  his
            studies in the UK if he obtains  the  necessary  offer  from  a
            suitable educational establishment. At present, he has no  such
            offer because he has no leave to remain. For these reasons,  it
            is proportionate and in the public interest for  the  Appellant
            to be removed."

The grounds and the grant of permission

10. The appellant's written grounds advanced two grounds, as follows:

    (i)     (Ground 1) The judge made findings on family life but failed to
        consider the impact of the respondent's decision on the appellant's
        aunt, contrary to Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008]  UKH  39.  Furthermore,
        she failed  to  give  reasons  or  any  adequate  reasons  for  her
        omission.

    (ii)    (Ground 2) The judge made perverse or irrational findings on  a
        material matter; specifically, her findings  that  the  appellant's
        aunt was well placed to assist the appellant  financially  when  he
        returns to settle in Nigeria and that she  would  not  deplete  her
        savings. The grounds contend that there  was  no  legal  basis  for
        these findings.

11. The grant of permission went beyond the grounds. As I will need to deal
    with the terms in which permission was granted,  I  quote  the  reasons
    given by the permission judge for granting permission:

            "At paragraph 10 of the decision the Judge has referred  to  the
             Appellant living with the aunt in a family relationship. It  is
             arguable that the Judge has attached insufficient weight to the
             strength  of  the  family  relationship  given  the  background
             referred to by the Judge at paragraph 11.  The  Judge  accepted
             that the Appellant suffered some sort of nervous breakdown  but
             was now not suffering from such issues. It is arguable that the
             concept of real support fell  to  be  considered  against  that
             background. It is arguable that  the  proportionality  exercise
             has been affected in assessing the strength of family life  and
             the  consequences  of  the  departure  of  the  Appellant.   At
             paragraph 12 the Judge accepted that  the  Appellant  had  been
             maintained by the aunt. At paragraph  9  of  the  decision  the
             Judge has referred to the aunt stating  that  it  will  be  too
             costly for her to continue to  maintain  the  Appellant  if  he
             returned to Nigeria. It was arguable that the Judge has set out
             an insufficient analysis of the ability of the Appellant's aunt
             to maintain  him  if  he  were  to  return  to  Nigeria  having
             proceeded at the conclusion of paragraph  9  to  refer  to  the
             assets and income of the Appellant's aunt  in  evaluating  that
             the Appellant's  aunt  would  be  well  placed  to  assist  the
             Appellant  financially  when  he  returned  to  settle  in  his
             country.  It  is  arguable  that  the  Judge  has  set  out  an
             insufficient analysis  given  the  lack  of  reference  to  any
             obligations  on  the  part  of  the  Appellant's  aunt  or  her
             financial commitments. At paragraph  10  of  the  decision  the
             Judge has referred to the Appellant's aunt providing  emotional
             assistance to ease the transition. It is arguable that if  such
             emotional assistance was required  to  ease  the  transition  a
             fuller  analysis  was  required  of  the  emotional  assistance
             afforded to the Appellant by his aunt in  the  context  of  the
             maintenance of family life."

            (My emphasis)

Submissions

12. At the commencement of the hearing, I asked Ms Ukachi-Lois to  draw  my
    attention to the following:

    (i)     the evidence that was before the judge to establish that family
        life was enjoyed between the appellant and his aunt;

    (ii)    the evidence that was before the judge to establish the  impact
        on the  appellant's  aunt  of  the  appellant  leaving  the  United
        Kingdom; and

    (iii)   the evidence  that  was  before  the  judge  to  establish  the
        financial commitments and obligations of the  appellant's  aunt.  I
        pointed out to Ms Ukachi-Lois that, given that the aunt had  stated
        that she had savings of �100,000, her evidence that it would be too
        costly for her to provide financial assistance to the appellant  if
        he were to return to Nigeria plainly called for an explanation.

13. Concerning (i), Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence  was  that
    the appellant and his  aunt  lived  together  and  that  the  aunt  had
    supported the appellant when he had suffered  from  depression  in  the
    past. She also referred me to the witness statement of the  appellant's
    aunt.

14. Concerning (ii) and (iii), Ms Ukachi-Lois read to me her notes  of  the
    oral evidence that the aunt gave  before  the  judge.  I  checked  this
    against the judge's manuscript record of the oral evidence of the aunt.
    As a result, it was clear (and Ms Ukachi-Lois  agreed)  that  the  oral
    evidence that the aunt  gave  concerning  the  impact  on  her  of  the
    appellant leaving the United Kingdom was as follows: She would struggle
    to afford to support the appellant  financially.  She  also  said:  "My
    savings were for many years, Not able to support.  Schools  on  strike.
    Transportation and feeding would be too stressful. I  am  only  family.
    2008, Dad died. No family in Nigeria".

15. In relation to ground 1, Ms Ukachi-Lois said that she was in difficulty
    because there was a lack of evidence before the  judge  concerning  the
    impact on the appellant's aunt of  the  appellant  leaving  the  United
    Kingdom. However, she submitted that it is only reasonable  that  there
    should be a further assessment  of  the  impact  on  the  aunt  of  the
    appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that a fair assessment  of  the
    appellant's case can be made.

16. In relation to ground 2, Ms  Ukachi-Lois  submitted  that  the  judge's
    finding that it would not deplete the aunt's savings  if  she  were  to
    assist  the  appellant  financially  if  he  returns  to  Nigeria   was
    irrational. This was because it would deplete her savings, contrary  to
    the judge's finding.

17. In response, Mr Clarke submitted that the judge had noted at [10]  that
    she had been asked to accept that the  appellant  enjoyed  family  life
    with his aunt. She took this at its highest. There  was  a  paucity  of
    evidence of any substance before the judge to show the  impact  on  the
    appellant's aunt of his departure from the United Kingdom. At [12], the
    judge accepted that the appellant had been maintained by  his  aunt  in
    the United Kingdom. She noted that there was  no  explanation  for  the
    appellant remaining in the United Kingdom once his leave  had  expired.
    At [8], the judge considered, at its  highest,  the  appellant's  claim
    that he has no family in Nigeria.

18. Mr Clarke submitted that, given the case that was advanced  before  the
    judge and the evidence that was before her,  ground  1  is  simply  not
    established.

19. Mr Clarke submitted that ground 2 was a perversity challenge. i.e. that
    no properly directed Tribunal could reach the same  conclusion  on  the
    basis of the evidence that was before the judge. It was not  the  case,
    as portrayed in the grounds, that the judge had made  her  decision  on
    the basis  that  the  appellant's  aunt  would  support  the  appellant
    indefinitely. In Mr Clarke's submission, it was clear from [9]  of  the
    judge's decision that she considered that the appellant would  be  able
    to obtain a job to maintain himself and that his aunt would  only  need
    to provide him with financial assistance in the initial months,  whilst
    he settled down. Accordingly, he submitted that  it  was  open  to  the
    judge to find that it would not deplete the savings of the  appellant's
    aunt  if  she  were  to  provide  the  appellant  with  such  financial
    assistance in the initial months. She was accommodating and maintaining
    him at present, in any event.

20. Ms Ukachi-Lois submitted that, if I  were  to  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision, the Upper Tribunal could re-make the decision on the  appeal.
    However, given the paucity of the evidence that was before  the  judge,
    she requested that the appellant be given  an  opportunity  to  provide
    further evidence about his aunt's financial circumstances.

21. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

22. Ms Ukachi-Lois informed me that the evidence that was before the  judge
    to establish that the appellant enjoyed family life with his  aunt  was
    the fact that the appellant and his aunt had lived  together  and  that
    the aunt  had  supported  the  appellant  when  he  had  suffered  from
    depression in the past. It is clear from [10] that  the  judge  decided
    the appellant's appeal taking his claim that  he  enjoyed  family  life
    with his aunt at its highest. She found that they could continue  their
    relationship with each other at a distance. That finding was fully open
    to her, given the witness statement of the appellant's aunt.  She  said
    in her witness statement that she brought the appellant to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2007, when he was 29/30 years old, so that  he  could  study
    accountancy and  achieve  an  ACCA  qualification.  Accordingly,  their
    enjoyment of their relationship with each other over many  years,  from
    his birth until he was 29/30 years old, was from a distance.

23. Ground 1, which contends  that  the  judge  had  erred  by  failing  to
    consider the impact on the appellant's aunt of  his  departure,  cannot
    succeed because it was plain at the hearing before me that  Ms  Ukachi-
    Lois was in difficulty referring me to any evidence that was before the
    judge to establish the impact on the appellant's aunt. I have  set  out
    that evidence at my  para  14  above.   It  is  plain  that  the  judge
    specifically considered, at [9], the aunt's evidence that it  would  be
    too costly for her to maintain the appellant in Nigeria and pay for his
    studies.  She  said  that  neither  the  appellant  nor  his  aunt  had
    considered the possibility of the appellant obtaining a job in  Nigeria
    and that, although both witnesses told her that there were no  jobs  in
    Nigeria, there was no objective evidence to  show  that  he  could  not
    obtain some work.

24. I stress that, apart from the evidence set out at  my  para  14  above,
    which the judge considered at [9], there was simply no evidence  before
    the judge to show the impact on the appellant's aunt of  the  appellant
    leaving the United Kingdom. The judge assessed  such  evidence  as  was
    before her.

25. Ms Ukachi-Lois was relegated to submitting that it was only  reasonable
    that there should  be  a  further  assessment  of  the  impact  on  the
    appellant's aunt of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom so that  a
    fair assessment of the appellant's case can be made. However, the judge
    has made a fair assessment of such evidence as  was  before  her.  This
    submission just ignores the fact that the judge's decision can only  be
    set aside if she has made an error on a  point  of  law  such  that  it
    should be set aside.

26. I therefore reject ground 1.

27. Ground 2 is likewise hopeless. It simply ignores the judge's reasoning,
    that there was no objective  evidence  that  the  appellant  could  not
    obtain some work in Nigeria and that, in the initial months,  the  aunt
    was well placed financially to assist him to settle in his country.

28. Furthermore, and as  I  said  at  the  hearing,  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's aunt, that it would be too costly for her to  maintain  him
    and pay for his studies, plainly called for an explanation  given  that
    she had savings of �100,000. This is a large sum of money.  Few  people
    of ordinary means have access to such savings. Since  it  was  for  the
    appellant to establish his case, it was for him to provide evidence  to
    show precisely why it would be too costly for his aunt to help  him  to
    settle down in Nigeria, whether or not he pursued  his  studies  there,
    and that the financial cost of her doing so was such that the  decision
    was disproportionate. It is clear that the aunt was not  questioned  in
    oral evidence to explain why she said it would be too costly for her to
    maintain the appellant, nor was she  asked  to  give  evidence  of  her
    liabilities and commitments.

29. In her submissions at the hearing, all that Ms Ukachi-Lois could say in
    relation to ground 2 was that  the  judge's  finding  that  the  aunt's
    savings would not be depleted was irrational because it  would  deplete
    the aunt's savings if she were  to  assist  the  appellant  financially
    after he returned to Nigeria. However, the fact is that the judge found
    that there was no reason why the appellant would not be able to  obtain
    a job in Nigeria and therefore that the aunt only needed to assist  him
    financially in the initial period whilst he settled down. It  is  plain
    that she found, implicitly, that the aunt's savings would not therefore
    reduce significantly. In reality, ground 2 amounts to no  more  than  a
    disagreement with the judge's reasoning. The judge's finding  that  the
    aunt's savings would not be depleted, cannot be said to be  irrational,
    on any legitimate view.

30. I therefore reject ground 2.

31. I turn to consider the grounds upon which permission was granted.

32. Plainly, the grant of permission went beyond the grounds.  In  summary,
    it raised three points that did not feature in the appellant's  written
    grounds, as follows:


    (i)     that the judge arguably attached  insufficient  weight  to  the
        strength of the family relationship given the  background  referred
        to by the judge at [11];


      (ii)  that the judge arguably set out an insufficient analysis of the
        aunt's financial position given the lack of reference to the aunt's
        obligations or her financial commitments; and


      (iii)  that,  if  emotional  assistance  was  required  to  ease  the
        appellant's 'transition' after his return to Nigeria, then arguably
        "a fuller  analysis  was  required"  of  the  emotional  assistance
        afforded to the appellant  by  his  aunt  in  the  context  of  the
        maintenance of family life.

33. In relation to point (i), the permission judge went on to draw from the
    facts as disclosed in the judge's decision to support his view that  it
    was arguable that the judge had attached  insufficient  weight  to  the
    strength of the family relationship, stating that it was arguable  that
    the concept  of  "real  support"  fell  to  be  construed  against  the
    background that the appellant had suffered from some  sort  of  nervous
    breakdown in the past.

34. The authorities are clear that, in an asylum or human  rights  case,  a
    Tribunal must take a Robinson obvious point in the  claimant's  favour.
    The term Robinson obvious derives from the judgment  in  R  v  SSHD  ex
    parte Robinson [1998] QB 929. A Robinson obvious point is one that  has
    a strong prospect of success.

35. In AZ, the Upper Tribunal discussed the relevant jurisprudence at [61]-
    [74] of its decision beginning with Robinson.  In  head-note  (3),  the
    Upper Tribunal said:


        "3.      Permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  should  be
             granted on a ground that was not advanced by an  applicant  for
             permission, only if:
           (a)   the judge is satisfied that  the  ground  he  or  she  has
                 identified is one which has a strong prospect of success:
                 (i)   for the original appellant; or
                 (ii)  for the Secretary of State, where the ground relates
                    to a decision which, if undisturbed,  would  breach  the
                    United Kingdom's international Treaty obligations; or
           (b)   (possibly) the ground  relates  to  an  issue  of  general
                 importance, which the Upper Tribunal needs to address."

36. However, the permission judge did not indicate that the grounds he  was
    raising came within head-note 3.(b) nor can it reasonably be  said,  on
    any legitimate view, that they did. Since the points he raised were not
    for the Secretary of State, head-note 3(a)(ii)  is  inapplicable.  This
    leaves head-note  para  3.(a)(i),  a  Robinson  obvious  point  in  the
    appellant's favour.

37. However, as the Upper Tribunal  said  in  AZ,  it  is  clear  from  the
    authorities that mere arguability is not sufficient.  A  higher  hurdle
    must be surmounted. The point in question has to  be  obvious,  in  the
    sense of being one with a strong prospect of success,  were  permission
    to be granted. Even at the permission stage, the  question  is  whether
    the point in question has a strong prospect of success and not  whether
    it is arguable that it has, as is clear from para 3(a) of the head-note
    in AZ.

38. The judge's decision did not  mention  what  evidence  was  before  her
    concerning the strength of the relationship between the  appellant  and
    his aunt. As can be seen from my para 13 above, Ms Ukachi-Lois informed
    me that the evidence was that the appellant  and  his  aunt  had  lived
    together and that the aunt had supported  the  appellant  when  he  had
    suffered from depression in the past.  However,  the  judge  was  fully
    aware of this evidence and referred to it in her decision. There was no
    reason to think that she did not have it in mind  when  she  considered
    proportionality.

39.  If  there  was  relevant  evidence  concerning  the  strength  of  the
    relationship between the appellant and his  aunt  that  the  judge  had
    overlooked, the expectation is that this would have been  mentioned  in
    the appellant's written grounds, whether or  not  he  was  represented.
    However, there was no suggestion in  the  appellant's  written  grounds
    that the judge had overlooked relevant evidence in this regard.

40. It therefore appears that, in stating that the judge may have  attached
    insufficient weight to the strength of the family relationship  and  in
    referring to the need to consider the concept of "real support" in  the
    context of the fact  that  the  appellant  had  previously  suffered  a
    nervous breakdown, the permission judge in  fact  considered  that  the
    judge ought to have given more weight to the relationship than she  did
    and to the fact  that  the  appellant's  aunt  had  provided  him  with
    emotional support in the past when he suffered a nervous breakdown.

41. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that  the  permission
    judge  was  merely  disagreeing  with  the  reasoning  of  the   judge.
    Furthermore, the authorities clearly establish  that  arguments  as  to
    weight do not ordinarily establish an  error  of  law.  Ms  Ukachi-Lois
    (correctly, in my judgment) did not pursue point (i) at the hearing. It
    is plain that point (i) discloses no error of law in  the  decision  of
    the judge.

42. Point (ii) is that it is arguable that  the  judge  had  insufficiently
    analysed the ability of the appellant's aunt to maintain him if he were
    to return  to  Nigeria  given  her  failure  to  refer  to  the  aunt's
    obligations and financial commitments.  However, it was  clear  at  the
    hearing before me, that there was simply no evidence before  the  judge
    of the financial obligations or commitments of  the  appellant's  aunt.
    Furthermore, the aunt was not asked to explain precisely why  she  said
    it would be too costly for her to provide financial assistance  to  the
    appellant in Nigeria, which plainly called for an explanation  in  view
    of the amount of her savings, as I said at the hearing.

43. Finally, point (iii) is that it is arguable that the judge  had  failed
    to give "a fuller analysis .... of the emotional assistance afforded to
    the appellant by his aunt in the context of the maintenance  of  family
    life".  This is an empty point as  exemplified  by  the  fact  that  Ms
    Ukachi-Lois did not pursue it at the hearing.

44. For all of the reasons given above, it is clear that the  three  points
    raised by the permission judge were not only hopeless, they  could  not
    on any reasonable view have been adjudged as arguable Robinson  obvious
    points, i.e. with a strong prospect of success.

45. For all of the reasons given above, the judge did not make any error of
    law.  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore
    dismissed.

46. Turning to the grant of permission  in  AZ,  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Holmes raised an issue concerning the delay  (of  about  eight
    months) between the date of the hearing  and  the  preparation  of  the
    decision. He referred to two cases on delay in his grant of permission:
    Mario [1998] Imm  AR  281  and  Sambasivam  [1999]  OATRF  1999/0419/4.
    However, the Upper Tribunal considered ([71]) that Judge Holmes had not
    correctly identified the relevant case law and that, in particular,  he
    had failed to have regard to the  more  recent  Tribunal  authority  of
    Arusha and Demushi (deprivation of citizenship - delay) [2012] UKUT  80
    (IAC) which relied upon the Court of Appeal's judgment in RK  (Algeria)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 868.  The Tribunal said this at [70]-[71]:

        "70.     The basic point to be borne in mind is that there must  be
             an extremely  sound  reason  for,  in  effect,  compelling  the
             parties to an appeal to engage with a matter  that  neither  of
             them has identified.


        71.      The present case is an object lesson in  what  can  happen
             when this principle of restraint is not respected...."

47. In AZ, the Tribunal said (at [72]) that far from it  being  a  case  in
    which the ground raised  by  Judge  Holmes  of  his  own  volition  was
    strongly arguable, it was not a ground at all.

48. This can certainly be said of point (i) raised by the permission  judge
    in the instant case, because issues going to weight rarely give rise to
    an error of law, as has been said on many occasions (for example, Blake
    J, the then President, in Green (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 254
    (IAC)). It is difficult to see what error of law the  permission  judge
    had in mind in relation to point (iii) above which was not even pursued
    by Ms Ukachi-Lois at the hearing.

49. However, the position is even worse in relation to point (ii).  This is
    because the evidence which necessarily would  have  had  to  have  been
    adduced to the judge in order to make good this point had not even been
    adduced. There was simply no evidence before the judge which could have
    enabled her to conduct any analysis of the financial commitments of the
    appellant's aunt.

50. At para 70 of AZ, the Tribunal said that there  must  be  an  extremely
    sound reason for compelling the parties to engage with  a  matter  that
    neither had identified. In the instant case, two of  the  three  points
    were not even pursued at the hearing and one could not  be  established
    because the evidence necessary to establish the point  was  simply  not
    before the judge.

51. It is important to bear in mind that a grant of permission when  it  is
    not properly warranted  wastes  the  limited  resources  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, puts the parties  to  unnecessary  expense,  delays  bringing
    finality to the case  in  question  and  contributes  to  delaying  the
    disposition of other meritorious cases. It is  therefore  necessary  to
    exercise self-restraint, as the Tribunal said in AZ.

52. The following points of general guidance emerge from the instant case:

      (i)   In reaching a decision whether to grant permission to appeal  to
        the Upper Tribunal on a point that  has  not  been  raised  by  the
        parties but which a  judge  considering  such  an  application  for
        permission considers is arguably a Robinson obvious point or  other
        point falling within para 3 of the head-note in  AZ,  the  evidence
        necessary to establish the point in question must be apparent  from
        the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  (whether  or  not  the
        appellant is represented at the time) and/or the  decision  of  the
        judge who decided the appeal and/or  the  documents  on  file.  The
        permission judge should not make any assumptions that such evidence
        was before the  judge  who  decided  the  appeal.  Furthermore,  if
        permission is granted on a ground that has not been raised  by  the
        parties, it is good practice and a useful aid in  the  exercise  of
        self-restraint for the permission judge to indicate which aspect of
        head-note 3 of AZ applies.

      (ii)  Permission should only be granted on the basis  that  the  judge
        who decided the appeal gave insufficient  weight  to  a  particular
        aspect of the case if it can properly be said that as a consequence
        the judge who decided the appeal has arguably  made  an  irrational
        decision. As the Court of Appeal said at para 18 of Herrera v  SSHD
        [2018]  EWCA  Civ  412,  it  is  necessary  to  guard  against  the
        temptation to characterise as errors of law what are  in  truth  no
        more than disagreements about the weight to be given  to  different
        factors, particularly if the judge who decided the appeal  had  the
        advantage of hearing oral evidence.

      (iii) Particular care should be taken before  granting  permission  on
        the  ground  that  the  judge  who  decided  the  appeal  did   not
        "sufficiently consider" or "sufficiently analyse" certain  evidence
        or certain aspects of a case. Such complaints often turn out to  be
        mere disagreements with the reasoning of the judge who decided  the
        appeal because the implication is that the  evidence  or  point  in
        question was considered by the judge who decided the appeal but not
        to the extent desired by the author of the  grounds  or  the  judge
        considering  the  application  for  permission.  Permission  should
        usually only be granted on such grounds if it is possible to  state
        precisely how the assessment of the judge who decided the appeal is
        arguably lacking and why this is arguably material.

      Decision

    There was no error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal S J Clarke.

      Accordingly, the decision of the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal against the respondent decision stands.
