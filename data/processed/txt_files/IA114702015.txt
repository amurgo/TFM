For the appellant:     Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands  promulgated  16.9.15,  allowing  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State, dated 9.3.15, to  refuse  leave  to
    remain and to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard  the  appeal  on
    28.7.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    28.1.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 23.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find such error of law in the making of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require the  decision  of
    Judge Rowlands to be set aside.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant asserts that he entered the UK unlawfully in 1997 as a  victim
    of trafficking, but he has never pursued an asylum claim on that basis.
    In 2010 he applied for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  10  years
    residency. The application was refused and refused  again  following  a
    request for reconsideration. In 2012 he married Omoloda Sarumi, who has
    limited leave to remain  in  the  UK  to  2018.  In  2013  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain in  the  UK  on  compassionate  grounds
    outside the Rules, refused and a request for reconsideration  rejected.
    In March 2014 his application for Judicial Review was withdrawn on  the
    Home Office agreeing to consider his application under article 8  ECHR.
    He appealed the subsequent refusal decision.

 6. Judge Rowlands allowed the appeal, finding at �19 that there  would  be
    "significant obstacles to his integration in Nigeria," relying  on  the
    finding that he has little work experience or transferable  skills;  no
    support network; no financial backup; and that his wife has  no  family
    in Nigeria, as they are all in the UK; and that she has difficulties in
    her pregnancy; and that in the  judge's  view  she  is  likely  to  get
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK should she apply for it  in  2018.
    "I  am  satisfied  that  the  totality  of  the   evidence   of   their
    circumstances are such that they amount to significant obstacles to his
    integration and that he does fulfil the paragraph 276ADE."

 7. In the alternative, the judge found it "arguable" that his private  and
    family life circumstances are so exceptional that they would merit  the
    grant of leave outside the Rules. The judge did not accept that removal
    would be proportionate.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Hollingworth noted that  it  is
    unclear to what extent the judge has attached weight to the  claimant's
    wife's discretionary leave and the speculative outcome of the grant  of
    indefinite leave. "In analysing Article 8 the judge has not set out how
    he has applied the criteria in section 117. The appeal  has  also  been
    allowed on human rights grounds in addition to being allowed under  the
    Immigration Rules."

 9. There appears to be a factual inaccuracy in the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal. At �16 the judge suggested that other than his claim  to
    have been trafficked to the UK, there was little issue with his factual
    claim and that it does not appear to be challenged that he has been  in
    the UK since 1997. His length of residence is relevant to the issue  as
    to whether there are compelling  circumstances  sufficient  to  justify
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR, but it
    is clear from �5, �24 and �30 of the refusal decision that the claim to
    have been in the UK since 1997 was not accepted,  the  claimant  having
    produced no evidence in support.   At  the  very  least,  there  is  no
    concession on the part of the Secretary of State as to  his  length  of
    residence in the UK.

10. I find that the judge's consideration of paragraph 276ADE  was  flawed.
    Although the judge appears to have been aware  of  the  test  of  "very
    significant obstacles" to  his  integration  in  Nigeria,  as  outlined
    above, at �19 the judge referred only to "significant obstacles." It is
    not clear that the judge has applied the  correct  test.  Further,  the
    reasoning justifying such a conclusion is  inadequate.  In  particular,
    the grounds of appeal highlight the absence of explanation as to why  a
    healthy 35 year old Nigeria man with no family  in  either  the  UK  or
    Nigeria would require a "support network" in Nigeria. His evidence  was
    that he has been supporting himself in the UK for  several  years.  The
    fact that his wife has discretionary leave to remain in the UK and  was
    pregnant is not relevant to a consideration of whether there  would  be
    very significant obstacles to his integration on return to Nigeria. The
    judge's speculation that his wife would be given  indefinite  leave  to
    remain was also inappropriate.

11. It is clear that the  claimant  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM for leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  family  life.  As
    Appendix FM is the Secretary of State's  balanced  response  to  family
    life claims, that the claimant does  not  meet  those  requirements  is
    highly relevant and must be brought into any article 8 assessment;  the
    Rules are not just a starting point for article 8 assessment.

12. I also find the  judge's  consideration  of  private  and  family  life
    outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR flawed and in error of
    law. The article 8 considerations are extremely brief, contained in two
    short paragraphs at the end of the  decision.  First,  pursuant  to  SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, the judge failed  to  adequately  identify
    compelling circumstances to justify granting leave  to  remain  outside
    the Rules. At �20 the judge stated only, "I believe that it is arguable
    that the circumstances behind his private and family life in the UK are
    so exceptional that they would merit the grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Immigration Rules." The judge failed to state why or in what way  those
    circumstances are exceptional. The judge simply moved on  in  the  next
    sentence to find that removal would not be proportionate  in  light  of
    the significant time he had been in the UK and  his  wife's  pregnancy.
    This too is a flawed assessment, failing to consider why the claimant's
    wife could not also return to Nigeria, she having no settled status  in
    the UK.

13.  Further,  the  judge's  assessment  of   exceptional   or   compelling
    circumstances is absence any consideration of the claimant's precarious
    immigration status and thus the known precariousness of  his  presence,
    as well as her presence, when they chose to establish  family  life  in
    the UK. In Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440, the Court of Appeal  considered
    the case of an unlawful immigrant who  formed  a  relationship  with  a
    British citizen and where there were no insurmountable obstacles  under
    Appendix FM to continuing family life outside the UK. At  �31  of  that
    decision the Court held that in a case involving precarious family life
    it  would  be  necessary  to  establish  that  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances to warrant a conclusion that article 8 required leave  to
    remain to  be  granted  outside  the  Rules.  As  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller
    submitted, the present case is even weaker than that of Agyarko, as the
    claimant's wife has no settled status,  is  Nigerian,  and  could  also
    return to Nigeria with him.

14. In the circumstances, it is not clear that the judge  was  entitled  to
    proceed to consider article 8 ECHR outside the Rules at all.

15. Even if the judge was entitled to  consider  private  and  family  life
    outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR,  having  allowed  the
    appeal on immigration grounds, the judge did not need  and  should  not
    have also allowed the appeal under article 8 ECHR outside the Rules.

16. Further, s the grounds assert and Judge Hollingworth noted,  the  judge
    failed to explain how the criteria in section 117B of the 2002 Act have
    been applied. Whilst the judge made reference to section 117A and  117B
    at �21 of the decision, I am not satisfied  that  the  relevant  public
    interest factors were addressed at all. The judge  does  no  more  than
    recite  the  requirement  for  the  Tribunal  to  have  regard  to  the
    considerations in section 117B. For example, there is no  mention  that
    immigration control is in the public interest.  Neither  is  there  any
    reference to the unlawful  and  precarious  nature  of  the  claimant's
    status in the UK.

17. Ms Asfaw sought to argue that because section  117B(4)(b)  states  that
    little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  relationship  formed  with  a
    "qualifying partner" established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious, refers only  to  'qualifying
    partner,' defined as being either a British citizen or a person settled
    in the UK, it does not apply to the claimant's  relationship  with  his
    wife, since she does not meet the definition of  'qualifying  partner.'
    In effect, Ms Asfaw was suggesting that the claimant's family life  has
    greater protection against the countervailing public  interest  because
    she has no settled status in the UK. I reject that argument as entirely
    illogical and inconsistent with established jurisprudence.  Ms  Asfaw's
    interpretation would render the application of the provision  perverse.
    If anything, that the claimant's wife is  not  a  'qualifying  partner'
    would suggest there is little or even less weight to counterbalance the
    public interest  in  removal  than  there  may  be  for  a  'qualifying
    partner.'

18. In Rajendran (s117B - family life) [2016] UKUT  138  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal cited  established  jurisprudence  that  precariousness  is  a
    criterion of relevance to family life as well as  private  life  cases.
    Whilst the 'little weight' provisions of section 117B(4)(a) and (5) are
    confined to private life, a court  or  Tribunal  should  not  disregard
    precarious family life  criteria  set  out  in  established  article  8
    jurisprudence. At �39 of that decision the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that
    given ss117A-D considerations are not exhaustive, it may be an error of
    law for a court or Tribunal  to  disregard  such  criteria.  The  Upper
    Tribunal  Tribunal  cited,  amongst  other  authorities,   Jeunesse   v
    Netherlands 12738/10 3 October 2014, where the Grand Chamber reaffirmed
    that "Another  important  consideration  is  whether  family  life  was
    created at a time  when  the  persons  involved  were  aware  that  the
    immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that
    family life within the host State would from the outset be  precarious.
    It is the Court's well-established case-law that, where  this  is   the
    case, it is likely only to be in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the
    removal of the non-national family member will constitute  a  violation
    of article 8." In the present case, the immigration status of both  the
    claimant and his wife was precarious, making it even more difficult for
    the claimant to establish exceptional or compelling circumstances.

19. I accept that the judge does not have spell out  or  address  each  and
    every section 117B factor, provided it is clear from a reading  of  the
    decision as a whole that the relevant factors have  been  brought  into
    account in  the  proportionality  assessment.  The  decision  does  not
    demonstrate that they have.

20. In all the circumstances, the decision is in error of  law  and  cannot
    stand and I thus allow the appeal of the Secretary of State.

21. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

22. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, on the basis that this is a case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive the parties of a  fair
    hearing and that the nature or extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding
    which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal  with
    cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

23. For the reasons set out above I find that the making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on  a  point
    of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be made afresh in  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal in accordance with the attached directions.

Consequential Directions

24. The appeal is to be relisted to be made afresh,  with  no  findings  of
    fact preserved, in the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House;

25. The appeal may be relisted before any First-tier Tribunal  Judge  other
    than Judge Rowlands or Judge Hollingworth;

26. The estimate length of hearing is 2 hours;

27. No interpreter is required;

28. Not later than  15  working  days  before  the  relisted  hearing,  the
    claimant must lodge with the Tribunal and serve  on  the  Secretary  of
    State a revised, single, consolidated, paginated and indexed bundle  of
    all subjective and objective materials relied on, together with  copies
    of any case authorities and skeleton argument. The  Tribunal  will  not
    accept materials submitted on the day of hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
