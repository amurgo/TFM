Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr T Hodson, of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. The appellant, a national  of  Guinea,  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
   against the decision of the respondent refusing his claim for asylum  and
   humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom. First-tier Tribunal  Judge
   R Cooper dismissed the appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated on 24
   March 2017.


2. Permission to appeal was at first refused by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   ID Boyes but subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Plimmer  in  a
   decision dated 20 September 2017 stating that that although the  decision
   is detailed and comprehensive, it is arguable for the reasons outlined in
   the grounds that there are errors of  law  in  the  credibility  findings
   including the findings regarding the summons.


3. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in  his  decision  made  the  following
   findings, which I summarise. The appellant has been largely consistent as
   to the core elements of his claim; his membership of the UFDG, his  uncle
   being shot and killed at the demonstration on 13 April 2015,  going  into
   hiding in Pita, his arrest and detention from 8  October  2015  until  21
   December 2015 and leaving Guinea by aeroplane on 26 December  2015.  This
   is also consistent with the objective evidence that the appellant  relies
   on which confirms the increase in political unrest in the period  leading
   up to the presidential elections on 11 October 2015,  demonstrations  and
   clashes between members  of  the  UFDG  and  Alpha  Conde's  party  which
   increasingly took on an ethnic dimension. However, the  fact  that  these
   core elements were consistent does not in  itself  mean  the  appellant's
   account of the extent of the appellant's involvement is true.


4. The Judge found that looking at the  totality  of  the  evidence  in  the
   round, there are discrepancies and inconsistencies in the details of  the
   appellant's account which undermined the  appellant's  credibility  which
   cannot be categorised as simply being peripheral or  unimportant  matters
   to an otherwise credible claim.


5. In respect of the summons produced by the  appellant,  it  is  reasonably
   likely that these are genuine summons issued by the police  commander  in
   2008 but found that the summons was not for the  reasons  stated  by  the
   appellant. The Judge stated that the  summons  issued  in  July  2008  is
   marked "first" and the August summons is marked "second"  from  which  it
   can be inferred that it is reasonably likely that there were two separate
   summonses in relation to the same case.  The  fact  that  there  are  two
   summonses is consistent with Article 59 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
   which indicates that  the  summons  can  be  issued  for  someone  to  be
   questioned who "may have information on [criminal]  facts  or  on  seized
   objects and documents". Therefore,  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  the
   appellant was summoned twice to give a statement about  one  incident  or
   crime that had been committed either by  him  or  another  individual  in
   2008. The Judge stated that the appellant  in  his  interview  refers  to
   being arrested about 10 times for his political activities, but sad  that
   this is at  odds  with  his  February  2016  statement,  which  makes  no
   reference to any arrests prior to 8 October 2015, and in which  she  says
   that his "ordeal began in earnest in 2010".


6. The respondent does not accept that the appellant was  a  member  of  the
   UFDG because of the inconsistencies in his interview about  the  date  he
   joined, in that whether it was 15 August or 15 May  2008.  The  appellant
   says that the date recorded in question 6 that it was 15 August must have
   been a mistake by the interviewing officer as  he  had  always  known  he
   joined in May. The appellant has been  consistent  throughout  about  the
   date except in answer to question 6 that he joined the  UFDG  on  15  May
   2008. This is inconsistent with the membership  card  he  produced  which
   records the date of issue as May 2008.


7. The original identity card is printed with a logo  of  Greentree  with  a
   yellow sun and has the membership number stamped in red. It has the  name
   "LB" which appears to be written in a different pen  from  the  remaining
   information in the membership card. Mr Hodson submitted that a  Judge  is
   not a handwriting expert and cannot examine documents  forensically.  The
   Judge stated that it is reasonably likely that the appellant was a member
   of the UFDG and that he joined in May 2008. However, the  Judge  was  not
   persuaded when looking at the totality of the evidence that the appellant
   is anything other than an ordinary member in the  local  branch  who  has
   participated in some events for the party and demonstrations.


8. It is reasonably likely that the appellant was  seeking  to  correct  the
   mistake in question 10 of the asylum interview when he was asked to  name
   some political leaders. The appellant's solicitors corrected the names of
   two political leaders on 26 July 2016 and explained that the  interviewer
   may not have been able to read the appellant's handwriting, but the Judge
   found that the name "Kalemondu Yassaneh) has no resemblance to the  name,
   "Igalwounu yousaueli" as recorded at question 10.


9. There are substantial inconsistencies  between  the  statement  which  is
   undated and unsigned before the asylum interview that the  appellant  now
   seeks to rely on which he says  that  he  wrote  in  February  2016.  The
   appellant was represented at the time of the interview and his solicitors
   corrected the interview record on 26 July 2016, but  this  statement  was
   not sent to the respondent for her consideration at the  time,  which  is
   surprising given that he has had the same solicitors throughout and  this
   affects the  weight  that  the  Judge  said  that  he  can  give  to  the
   appellant's statement.


10. The Judge considered the documents provided by the appellant to  support
   his claim that he was a prominent member of the UFDG who  was  wanted  by
   the authorities. The Judge found that the documents cannot be relied upon
   because the evidence of the appellant to the Tribunal was  that  the  May
   and June documents had been produced to attest his membership,  "to  show
   he was a member of this particular group", but it is  not  clear  why  he
   would need an attestation simply to show that he was a  member,  when  he
   already had a membership card.


11. The permanent secretary of  the  UFDG  writes  in  June  2015  that  the
   appellant "was the victim of arrests because of his political involvement
   and his ethnic origin" but provides no details of any  arrest,  only  his
   participation in the demonstration and the killing of Souleymane Soudeur.
   That same witness statement says that the appellant is  "actively  wanted
   by the....authorities and the UFDG "were asking him to remain where he is
   until the political situation in Guinea is resolved" yet the  appellant's
   evidence is that he returned to Conakry in August 2015 in breach of those
   instructions.


12. The appellant says in his witness  statement  that  his  uncle's  friend
   Alpha was given the UFDG documents from May and June 2015 when he was  in
   hiding in Pita in June 2015. No explanation was given for why his uncle's
   friend Alpha would be given these documents when he  was  not  given  the
   document from 20 November 2015. In oral evidence the appellant said  that
   his uncle's friend Alpha had his UFDG membership card  as  well,  but  no
   explanation has been provided as to why this would be the case given that
   the appellant claims to have been a member since 2008. Nor is  there  any
   evidence from his uncle's friend Alpha to explain how the  documents  and
   membership card came into his possession which evidence would  have  been
   reasonable  for  him  to  produce  especially  given  that  Alpha  is   a
   businessman and is likely to have had some means of contact,  whether  by
   telephone or email.


13. The appellant on his own evidence confirms that he contacted  Mr  MB  in
   September 2016 asking for help because the respondent did not believe his
   claim. In response the appellant claims he was  sent  documents  that  he
   claims had been produced in November 2015 but had been held  on  file  by
   the UFDG apparently replacing the documents of 28 May and 15  June  2015.
   The documents of 20 November 2015 would have been  issued  prior  to  his
   escape  from  Kalum  prison  yet  Mr  K  writes  about  the   appellant's
   imprisonment in the past tense thereby indicating that the statement  was
   in fact written after the appellant's release.


14. On the appellant's own account, he had not at  that  time  escaped  from
   prison yet the UFDG did not call for his release but simply said that the
   testimony was "issued to him in order to assert his right".  Furthermore,
   the originals of the 20 November 2015 documents were not produced to  the
   Tribunal. Only M's email  of  1  March  2017  was  produced  despite  the
   appellant confirming that they had been in contact since September  2016.
   None of their Facebook messages or other email  conversations  have  been
   produced which might have assisted in assessing the  reliability  of  the
   evidence.


15. The Judge was not persuaded by the appellant's claim  that  he  did  not
   produce the emails and messages because he could not afford to print them
   from his computer. The appellant said that the email of 1 March had  been
   forwarded to a solicitor for printing and there was  no  reason  why  the
   other emails and Facebook screenshots could not have also been  forwarded
   and printed by a  solicitor  in  the  same  way.  Furthermore,  both  the
   attestation and the letter of testimony produced are  on  a  headed  UFDG
   notepaper on 20 November 2015 bears the  same  reference  number  despite
   being different documents. The background logo of the tree appears  in  a
   different form in the  two  documents  despite  purportedly  having  been
   created on the same day. The logo and the headed notepaper format differs
   also from the documents produced in May and June 2015


16. The Judge concluded that given the evidence and the documents that  were
   produced are in response  to  the  matters  raised  in  the  respondent's
   reasons for refusal letter and particularly the  respondent's  conclusion
   that the appellant's credibility was damaged by the original  attestation
   failing to make mention of his position as a treasurer.


17. In relation to the demonstration which took place on 13 April  2015  the
   appellant stated in his witness statement and in oral  evidence  that  he
   was targeted "as a viable activist" by the  authorities  because  he  was
   holding a banner, wearing the UFDG T-shirt and waistband. He claims  that
   he was not shocked because he had managed to run  away  "helter-skelter".
   The Judge found that the appellant's claim to have been  targeted  as  an
   activist is inconsistent with this interview where he said his only  role
   at the demonstration was to be present and chant.


18. The Judge considered the newspaper articles provided  by  the  appellant
   and stated that in examination in chief the appellant confirmed that  his
   uncle's name was SB which was a name which appeared on  the  mail  online
   report of 14 April 2015 where it  was  reported  that  he  was  shot  and
   killed. It was submitted on behalf of  the  appellant  that  this  was  a
   report of the appellant's uncle's killing but the appellant had not  even
   been aware that the newspaper had reported his death. The Judge found  it
   unlikely  that  the  appellant  who  submitted  those  documents  to  the
   respondent in July 2016, shortly after his interview would not have  been
   aware that the article referred to his uncle.  The  judge  further  noted
   that the appellant does not refer to his uncle by his full name in any of
   the statements, simply referring to him as  S.  This  is  even  when  the
   appellant solicitors letter of 26 July 2016 corrects the interview record
   at question 66 to show that his uncle's name is S Rather than Sb but does
   not give his surname. It was only on the day  of  the  hearing  that  the
   appellant claims that his uncle is SB and seeks to correct the  name  and
   the UFDG's witness statement of 15 June 2015.


19. The Judge found that even  if  the  newspaper  report  does  report  the
   appellant's uncle's death, the appellant's evidence is still at odds with
   the newspaper report. The report cites an interview with the director  of
   the clinical confirm that Mr B had been shot at the  demonstration  which
   is reported to have begun at 9:30 AM but succumbed to  his  injuries  "in
   the early evening" yet in his asylum interview the  appellant  says  that
   his uncle was shot and killed by the security forces and that he saw that
   in front of his eyes.


20. The appellant's evidence was that a lot of people  died  that  day.  The
   article from Al Jazeera does refer to several  people  left  during  "two
   weeks of clashes in April between anti-government activists and  security
   forces" rather than during the one demonstration of 13 April.  The  Human
   Rights Watch report of 12 January 2017 refers to at least 10 people being
   killed by the security forces in the run-up to the election.


21. No evidence apart from the photograph of a funeral has been produced  to
   support the appellant's claim that his uncle was  an  activist  with  the
   UFDG and that he was targeted and killed because of  this.  There  is  no
   death certificate, or evidence from the hospital nor  is  there  evidence
   from the UFDG. The statement from Mr K of June 2015 makes no  mention  of
   the appellant's uncle's involvement  with  the  party  which  is  perhaps
   surprising as  the  appellant  claims  his  uncle  was  an  activist  who
   introduced him to the UFDG. This is all evidence which  would  have  been
   reasonable and possible to have obtained to substantiate the  appellant's
   claim that he has known since July 2016 that this part of his  claim  was
   not accepted. The appellant has been in contact with the party activist M
   since September 2016 and could have done so.


22. The appellant's claim is that he is a true political activist,  but  the
   Judge found that his actions with the UFDG to be inconsistent between his
   various accounts and his oral evidence such as, in his  asylum  interview
   he says he was arrested 10 times yet provided no details of these arrests
   in a statement. At his screening interview he says he was "persecuted and
   arrested for organising demonstrations, but no further details are  given
   in any of the statements. He confirmed in interviews that the April  2015
   demonstration was organised by the leaders  of  the  UFDG.  In  his  oral
   evidence the appellant confirmed he was hiding in Pita  from  April  2015
   until June 2015 but then started to campaign whereas in his interview  at
   question 69, 71 - 72 he gave no indication that he was in hiding,  simply
   that he fled there to get away from the violence of these  demonstrations
   and while in the area he openly "mobilise the youth".


23. There are also inconsistencies in his account of his imprisonment  which
   undermine his credibility. In his original interview when  asked  whether
   he was questioned as to when  he  was  detained  the  appellant  did  not
   respond directly but replied that he  was  transferred  from  the  police
   station to present. At question 97 the appellant  confirmed  he  was  not
   questioned in prison, and in his oral evidence  the  appellant  confirmed
   that he was not questioned and said, "this is not inconsistent".


24. Although Mr Hodson on the appellant 's behalf argued that the  appellant
   had an opportunity to embellish or exaggerate his  claim  he  could  have
   claimed he was tortured and questioned and submits that  the  appellant's
   evidence is consistent with objective evidence that detention was  simply
   used to  silence  the  opposition.  The  Judge  however  found  that  his
   statements that he was not questioned to be in complete contrast  to  the
   February statement which Mr Hodson expressly asks the  Tribunal  to  give
   weight  in  which  the  appellant  stated  that  he  "suffered  a   harsh
   interrogation by a commander named K". The appellant says he  was  beaten
   whilst in  prison  and  at  question  98  confirms  he  was  beaten  with
   truncheons on his shins and was hit with  a  hot  iron  on  his  arm.  He
   claimed to have marks and the interview record indicates that  he  showed
   the interviewing officer marks on his arm. However  no  medical  evidence
   has been provided regarding the injuries the  appellant  claims  that  he
   sustained over 2 � month. No medical evidence has been produced from  his
   doctor to confirm his injuries although Mr Hodson submits that a  medical
   report may have been of little  assistance  and  the  appellant  was  not
   represented earlier but it appears from the interview record  that  marks
   were visible in July 2016 more than six months after the  appellant  left
   Guinea.


25. About his escape from  prison  the  judge  found  that  the  appellant's
   various accounts to be inconsistent. In his interview the appellant  says
   he escaped with the help of a guard who  contacted  his  uncle's  friend,
   gave him a uniform of a prison guard and physically helped him to escape.
   Although this evidence is consistent with his witness statement where  he
   says he escaped dressed as a prison guard with the help of a  man  called
   G, it is however at odds with  this  February  2016  statement  where  he
   states that it was an agent  who  asked  to  dress  in  uniform  and  led
   outside,  rather  than  the  penitentiary  guard  G.   There   are   also
   discrepancies between his interview where he says he did not know whether
   there were security points and that the way he was taken was "true  there
   was one whole and it got me to pass through". In  his  witness  statement
   however, the appellant says that  they  went  through  the  kitchen  area
   rather than the  main  security  gate.  Mr  Hodson  submission  that  the
   Tribunal should find that the appellant meant  it  was  a  "hellhole"  is
   wholly unpersuasive.


26. The appellant left the airport with his own  passport  bearing  his  own
   name carrying  his  UFDG  membership  card  and  two  letters  from  them
   confirming his identity as a party member, with only minimal disguise  in
   the form of a baseball hat. Although the objective evidence  states  that
   corruption is rife in Guinea, the appellant makes no claim that  a  bribe
   was paid. All he says is that his passport  was  French.  The  Judge  was
   satisfied that it was  reasonably  likely  that  the  passport  would  be
   checked, and this indicated to him that the appellant's name  is  not  on
   any list or that he is being sought by the authorities.


27. The appellant provided evidence from Mahmudou Bah  to  demonstrate  that
   the appellant remains at risk in Guinea. The email of 1 March  2017  says
   "since you left, plain cloth police came to get you  and  threatened  the
   family. I am certain if you come back here you will be  jailed  for  life
   you will be made to vanish like so many Guinean's. For  your  own  safety
   stay away". However, the Judge found that no further  details  are  given
   and in the  absence  of  the  other  Facebook  messages  and  emails  the
   appellant was not persuaded that this is a document upon  which  reliance
   can be placed for the reasons already given.  The  Judge  further  stated
   that it is of note that Mr Bah has purportedly been in contact  with  the
   UFDG and has emailed documents it says were written in November 2015  and
   there is nothing further from the UFDG confirming that the  appellant  is
   still wanted or would be at risk on return.


28. The Judge concluded that he was not satisfied looking  at  the  evidence
   in the round that it is reasonably likely that the appellant was a member
   of the UFDG, the main opposition party in Guinea,  and  that  along  with
   many others he did participate in the demonstrations including the one on
   13 April 2015 where excessive force was used and during the run-up to the
   presidential elections won by Alpha in October 2015.


29. The Judge found that the appellant has sought to exaggerate  the  extent
   of his involvement with the UFDG and has fabricated a claim with  a  view
   to obtaining asylum in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Judge  did  not  find
   credible that the appellant  was  a  treasurer  or  held  any  particular
   position of prominence in  the  party  or  that  he  was  wanted  by  the
   authorities account of being a political  activist.  Nor  was  the  Judge
   satisfied that the appellant's uncle  was  shot  and  killed  during  the
   demonstrations on 13 April 2015 and that he had to go into hiding and was
   wanted by the authorities. The judge also did not find that the appellant
   was arrested on 8 October 2015 and was detained and beaten for 2 � months
   until December 2015 and escaped from prison  with  the  assistance  of  a
   prison guard. He was not satisfied that  the  appellant  was  of  adverse
   interest to the authorities and is still wanted by them. The Judge  noted
   that although he accepts that the appellant is a member of  the  UFDG  he
   does not find that he is a principal organiser or  activist  or  that  he
   would be at real  risk  of  persecution  on  return  on  account  of  his
   political opinion.


30. The Judge referred to the background evidence especially  the  Refugees'
   Documentation Centre report Guinea  information  on  the  UFDG  party  of
   January 2016 that confirms that despite a  dramatic  spike  in  political
   unrest in October 2015 which had taken on an ethnic dimension by December
   2015, President Alpha had pardoned 171 people  including  the  second-in-
   command of the UFDG who had been living in exile but returned two  Guinea
   from Paris in January 2016.


31. The Human Rights Watch reported an  improvement  of  the  situation  and
   said that following the elections reports of human rights violations  had
   declined. The OHCHR in January 2017 confirmed that  although  there  were
   clashes  and  demonstrations  in  2016  mainly  regarding  the  price  of
   petroleum and living and working  conditions,  the  meeting  between  the
   president and the leader of  the  UFDG  in  September  2016  "marked  the
   beginning  of  a  period  of  political  calm"  and  the  signing  of   a
   comprehensive agreement to bring the crisis  to  an  end.  The  US  State
   Department report of 2015 states that there was no estimate available  of
   the numbers of political  prisoners  or  detainees  but  that  "observers
   believe there were less than a dozen".


32. The Judge found that the appellant is not at risk of persecution  solely
   based on his ethnic origin. Although the objective evidence such  as  the
   Human Rights Watch certainly  discloses  evidence  of  racial  or  ethnic
   discrimination and some communal violence as one  of  the  three  largest
   ethnic groups in Guinea, the evidence does not indicate  persecutions  of
   those  who  are  Fula.  Therefore,  the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to
   subsidiary protection under the Qualification Regulations that  he  would
   be at risk of serious harm or  that  the  respondents  decision  breaches
   Articles 2 or 3. The  Judge  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on  all
   grounds.


33. At the hearing Mr Hodson relied on the renewed grounds of  appeal  which
   in summary set out the following.  The  Judge  has  found  it  reasonably
   likely that the appellant was a member of the UFDG, the  main  opposition
   party in Guinea and that he had joined in May 2008.  The  Judge  accepted
   that the appellant has been largely consistent as the core of his  claim.
   Notwithstanding, the Judge stated "I find there to be  discrepancies  and
   inconsistencies in the details of this appellant's account that undermine
   his credibility rather than simply being peripheral or unimportant to  an
   otherwise credible claim".

Findings on whether there is an error of law

34. I have given anxious scrutiny to the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge's decision and have taken into account the grounds  of  appeal  and
   the submissions of the parties at the error  of  law  hearing.  The  main
   complaint made against the Judge is that having found that  the  core  of
   the appellant's claim is believed and that he was a member  of  the  UFDG
   and had joined in May 2008 and having found that he had  participated  in
   demonstrations during the run up to the presidential election in  October
   2015 where excessive force was used, and accepted that the appellant  has
   been largely consistent as to the core elements of his claim then went on
   to find that the appellant was not credible on certain important  matters
   which he said were not peripheral.


35. There is no inherent contradiction in the findings  the  Judge  made  in
   having found that the core of the appellant's  claim  was  believable  in
   that  he  was  a  member  of  the  UFDG  and  had  participated  in   the
   demonstration in 2015 and at the same time finding that  the  appellant's
   activities did not amount to being, an  activist  within  the  party  who
   would be at risk on his return to Guinea. The central  question  for  the
   Judge to answer was whether the appellant  would  be  at  risk  from  the
   authorities on his return to Guinea because of his  past  involvement  in
   the opposition party.


36. The Judge found on the evidence and in  a  detailed  decision  that  the
   appellant was using his membership of an opposition  political  party  in
   Guinea and was exaggerating his political involvement to claim asylum  in
   this country. The Judge on the evidence did not find  credible  that  the
   appellant was a treasurer of the  party  or  had  held  any  position  of
   prominence in the party or that he  was  wanted  by  the  authorities  on
   account of being a political activist.


37. The Judge found many inconsistencies in  the  appellant's  evidence  and
   found that the appellant  was  not  credible  about  the  extent  of  his
   involvement with the UFDG which he claims to  put  him  at  risk  on  his
   return. The Judge set out many cogent reasons for  his  findings  in  his
   decision.


38. The Judge gave many  examples  of  inconsistencies  in  the  appellant's
   evidence in his decision. The appellant's  evidence  of  the  authorities
   past interest in him and the evidence of his arrest, detention and escape
   to be inconsistent for many reasons. He noted that at his  interview  the
   appellant's said that he escaped from prison with the help  of  a  prison
   guard who physically helped him to escape.  The  Judge  found  that  this
   evidence was consistent with his  witness  statement  where  he  says  he
   escaped dressed as a prison guard with the help of a man called  G.   The
   Judge found however that this evidence was at odds with  the  appellant's
   February 2016 statement where he states that it was an  agent  who  asked
   him to dress in  uniform  and  who  led  him  outside,  rather  than  the
   penitentiary guard G. The Judge also found discrepancies in the  evidence
   about how he escaped from prison because at his asylum interview  he  had
   said that he did not know whether there were security points and that was
   the way taken to escape and said that he was taken "though there was  one
   hole and it got me to pass  through".  The  judge  said  that  this  also
   contradicted his evidence in his witness statement in which he said  that
   they went through the kitchen area rather than the  main  security  gate.
   The Judge was entitled to find that the  discrepancies  in  the  evidence
   about his escape went to his credibility  into  the  credibility  of  his
   claim that he was arrested detained and that he escaped.


39. The Judge also found that there were inconsistencies in his  account  as
   to whether he  was  questioned  when  he  was  detained.  At  his  asylum
   interview the appellant did not respond directly to this question  as  to
   whether he was questioned but replied that he was  transferred  from  the
   police station to  prison.  The  appellant  confirmed  that  he  was  not
   questioned in prison and in his oral evidence  the  appellant  said  that
   "this is not inconsistent". The Judge however found that the  appellant's
   evidence that he was not questioned to be in  complete  contrast  to  his
   February  2016  statement  where  he  stated,  "he   suffered   a   harsh
   interrogation by a commander named K."


40. The Judge pointed out in his decision  that  the  appellant  had  stated
   that he was beaten whilst in prison and at  question  98  of  his  asylum
   interview confirmed that he was beaten with truncheons on his  shins  and
   was hit with a hot iron on his arm and stated  that  he  had  marks  from
   these beatings and also showed the interviewing officer physical marks on
   his arm as proof.


41. The Judge noted that no medical evidence  has  been  provided  regarding
   the injuries the appellant claims that he sustained even though they were
   sustained only over the 2 � period that he claims he  was  detained.  The
   Judge did not find Mr Hodson submission persuasive that a medical  report
   would  have  been  of  little  assistance  and  the  appellant  was   not
   represented earlier. The Judge however was entitled to find  that  as  at
   the date of the interview in July 2016, the physical marks  were  visible
   which was more than six months after the appellant left Guinea. The Judge
   was entitled to find that although the appellant saw his GP  to  whom  he
   told about his experiences and injuries when he was first registered,  no
   medical  evidence  was  provided.  This  also  went  to  the  appellant's
   credibility into the credibility of claim that he was  beaten  whilst  in
   detention.


42. The appellant's evidence was that he attended an illegal meeting of  the
   UFDG in 2008 which became the catalyst for the authorities'  interest  in
   him, to be vague and confused. Judge first found that there is freedom of
   assembly in Guinea and therefore the meeting could not have been illegal.
   Secondly that the appellant's answers about the reasons for  the  alleged
   meeting were not  credible.  He  set  out  the  appellant's  evidence  at
   question 7 of his asylum interview that "I held a meeting  regarding  the
   upcoming meeting in 2010. We were about to sell the  party  manifesto  to
   the party. What the party believes in and the aims and objectives of  the
   party". The appellant further confirmed that he  was  not  a  speaker  or
   chairperson. The judge was entitled to find not credible that having just
   only joined the party in May 2008, the appellant would be the one to hold
   a meeting to discuss the manifesto for the  UFDG  or  that  he  would  be
   holding a meeting about another meeting due to  be  held  in  two  years'
   time.


43. The appellant provided summons issued in 2008 to show  that  he  was  of
   interest to authorities in Guinea. The Judge found that it is  reasonably
   likely that these are genuine summons issued by the police  commander  in
   2008. The Judge however found that the summons was for reasons other than
   that stated by the appellant. The Judge noted that the July 2008  summons
   is marked "first" and the August summons is  marked  "second"  and  found
   that it can be inferred that it is reasonably likely that there were  two
   separate summonses in relation to the same case. The Judge  was  entitled
   to find that the two summonses is consistent with Article 59 of the  Code
   of Criminal Procedure which indicates that the summons can be issued  for
   someone to be questioned who "may have information on [criminal] facts or
   on seized  objects  and  documents".  He  stated  that  therefore  it  is
   reasonably likely that  the  appellant  was  summoned  twice  to  give  a
   statement about one incident or crime that had been committed  either  by
   him or another individual in 2008. The Judge's finding in this regard  is
   consistent with the  appellant's  inconsistent  evidence  at  his  asylum
   interview and in his February 2016 statement. At his Asylum interview the
   appellant refers to being arrested  about  10  times  for  his  political
   activities but this was at odds with his February 2016  statement,  which
   makes no reference to any arrests prior to 8 October 2015, and  in  which
   she says that his "ordeal began in earnest in 2010". Therefore, the Judge
   was entitled not to place any reliance on the summons issued in  2008  to
   prove that the authorities have an interest in him.


44. The Judge found that the originals of the  20  November  2015  documents
   were not produced to the Tribunal.  He  was  entitled  to  find  that  no
   credible reason had been given for why these were not forwarded before  1
   March 2017 even though the appellant had confirmed that he  had  been  in
   contact with Mr MB since September 2016 and therefore the originals could
   also have been sent by Mr MB. The Judge was entitled to find not credible
   that none of the Facebook and other email conversations  with  Mr  B  had
   been produced which might have assisted in assessing the  reliability  of
   the evidence. The Judge did not find credible the appellant's explanation
   for not printing them which was that that he could not  afford  to  print
   them. The Judge noted that the appellant had forwarded other material  to
   the solicitor who had printed it for him.


45. The Judge also  did  not  find  credible  the  appellant's  evidence  in
   relation to the demonstration which took place on 13 April 2015. He noted
   that the appellant had stated in his witness statement and  in  his  oral
   evidence that he was targeted "as a viable activist" by  the  authorities
   because he was holding a banner, wearing the UFDG T-shirt and  waistband.
   He claims that he had managed to run away "helter-skelter". The Judge was
   entitled to find that the appellant's claim to have been targeted  as  an
   activist to me inconsistent with what he said  at  his  asylum  interview
   that his only role at the demonstration was  to  be  present  and  chant.
   Therefore, the Judge was entitled to find not credible the appellant that
   he was targeted as an activist that he was exaggerating his involvement.


46. The Judge also  did  not  find  credible  the  appellant's  evidence  in
   respect of his uncle's killing on the day of  the  demonstration.  First,
   the Judge did not believe that the person named in the  newspaper  report
   was the appellant's uncle because of the inconsistent evidence as to  his
   uncle's name. Next, the Judge found that even if he was his uncle in  the
   newspaper report, the appellant's evidence about  his  uncle's  death  is
   still at odds with the newspaper report provided. This  was  because  the
   newspaper report cites an interview with the Director of the  clinic  two
   confirmed that his uncle had been shot  at  the  demonstration  which  is
   reported to have begun at 9:30 AM but succumbed to his injuries  "in  the
   early evening." The appellant's evidence at question  67  of  his  asylum
   interview was inconsistent when he said  that  his  uncle  was  shot  and
   killed by the security forces  in  front  of  his  eyes.  This  was  also
   inconsistent with the appellant's oral evidence before the Tribunal  that
   his uncle was standing right next to him when his  uncle  was  shot,  and
   that the appellant managed to escape "helter-skelter". This  evidence  is
   also inconsistent in the appellant's February 2016 statement in which  he
   states that his uncle was shot dead by Gendarmes right  before  him.  The
   Judge was entitled to find that this impacts the appellant's  credibility
   and the credibility of his claim.


47. The Judge noted that the appellant's statement made no reference to  any
   arrest before October 2015 yet in his oral evidence  the  appellant  said
   that he was arrested 10 times. The Judge also  found  that  the  February
   2016 statement provided a great deal of detail in  his  involvement  with
   the UFDG including why he joined, his role in organising  the  youth  and
   fundraising events, the difficulties in the 2010 and 2013 elections,  the
   deaths of his comrades and so on. The Judge was  entitled  to  find  that
   this was in stark contrast with the appellant's  answers  at  his  asylum
   interview which were generalised  and  at  times  vague.  The  Judge  was
   entitled to find that this subsequent statement was intended to bolster a
   claim that was not true about his role in the opposition party.


48. The Judge found that  the  appellant  left  the  airport  with  his  own
   passport bearing his own name carrying his UFDG membership card  and  two
   letters from them confirming his identity as a party  member,  with  only
   minimal disguise in the form of a baseball hat.  Although  the  objective
   evidence states that corruption is rife in Guinea, the appellant makes no
   claim that a bribe was paid. All he says is that his passport was French.
   The Judge was satisfied that it was reasonably likely that  the  passport
   would be checked, and this indicated to him that the appellant's name  is
   not on any list or that he is being sought by the authorities. The  Judge
   was entitled to find that the appellant left the country without incident
   and therefore no one had any interest in him.


49. The Judge considered the background evidence and stated that  the  Human
   Rights Watch reported an improvement  of  the  situation  and  said  that
   following the elections reports of human rights violations had  declined.
   The OHCHR in January 2017 confirmed that although there were clashes  and
   demonstrations in 2016 mainly regarding the price of petroleum and living
   and working conditions, the meeting between the president and the  leader
   of the UFDG in September 2016  "marked  the  beginning  of  a  period  of
   political calm" and the signing of a comprehensive agreement to bring the
   crisis to an end. The US State Department  report  of  2015  states  that
   there was no estimate available of the numbers of political prisoners  or
   detainees but that "observers believe there were less than a dozen".


50. The Judge found that the appellant is not at risk of persecution  solely
   based on his ethnic origin. Although the objective evidence such  as  the
   Human Rights Watch certainly  discloses  evidence  of  racial  or  ethnic
   discrimination and some communal violence as one  of  the  three  largest
   ethnic groups in Guinea, the evidence does not indicate  persecutions  of
   those who are Fula. This is a sustainable conclusion.

51. It is completely evident on the reading of  the  entire  decision,  that
   the Judge took into account all the evidence in the appeal and came to  a
   sustainable conclusion. I find that the Judge was entitled  and  required
   to reach his conclusions based on his consideration and evaluation of the
   evidence, including the background evidence. There is  no  perversity  to
   the conclusions reached  by  the  Judge.  I  find  no  other  differently
   constituted Tribunal would come to a different conclusion on the evidence
   in this appeal.

52. In R (Iran) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2005]  EWCA
   Civ 982 Brooke LJ commented on that analysis as follows:

       15. It will be noticed that the Master of the Rolls used  the  words
       "vital" and "critical" as synonyms of the word "material"  which  we
       have used above. The  whole  of  his  judgment  warrants  attention,
       because it reveals the anxiety of an appellate court not to overturn
       a judgment at first instance unless it really cannot understand  the
       original judge's thought processes when he/she was  making  material
       findings.
53. I find that I have no difficulty in understanding the reasoning  in  the
   Judge's decision for why he reached his conclusions and I find  that  the
   grounds of appeal and no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the  Judge's
   findings of fact and the conclusions that he drew from such findings.

54. I find that no material error of law has been established in  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge's decision. I find that the Judge was entitled to conclude
   that the appellant is not entitled to be recognised as a refugee or to be
   granted humanitarian protection in this country. I uphold his decision.
