Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Thomas promulgated on 24  September  2018,  in  which  the  Appellants'
    appeal against the  decision  to  refuse  their  applications  for  EEA
    registration certificates dated 3 October 2017 were dismissed.

 2. The First appellant is an Italian national, born on 1 August  1966  and
    the other Appellants are his wife and four children, all  of  whom  are
    Pakistani nationals.  The Appellants made applications on 10  May  2017
    for registration certificates confirming that the First Appellant is an
    EEA national exercising treaty rights in the United  Kingdom  and  that
    the other  Appellants  are  the  family  members  of  an  EEA  national
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  The  Second  to  Sixth
    Appellants' applications and appeals  are  entirely  dependent  on  the
    outcome of the First Appellant's application/appeal.

 3. The Respondent refused the applications the basis that he had not  been
    able to verify the First Appellant's employment, having not  been  able
    to contact them by phone or locate them on the Internet, such  that  it
    was not accepted that they were a genuine employer.   Further,  it  was
    not accepted that the Sixth Appellant was related  as  claimed  to  the
    First Appellant.

 4. Judge Thomas dismissed the appeals in  a  decision  promulgated  on  24
    September 2018 on the basis that the First Appellant's  employment  had
    not been proven and in any event, even if it was, it was not  found  to
    be genuine employment but only marginal and  ancillary  to  the  income
    received by the Appellants from public funds.  There  was  unchallenged
    evidence of the parental  relationship  between  the  First  the  Sixth
    Appellants before the First-tier Tribunal and this reason  for  refusal
    therefore fell away.

The appeal

 5. The Appellants appeal on four grounds  as  follows.   First,  that  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal  in  relation  to  employment  were
    irrational given that the range of evidence before it  that  the  First
    Appellant was working  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Secondly,  that  the
    findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  even  if  genuine,  such
    employment was only marginal and ancillary and therefore not sufficient
    to show the exercise of treaty rights was irrational in  light  of  the
    level of earnings.  Thirdly, that the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
    make adequate  credibility  findings.   Finally,  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to consider the evidence before it cumulatively and  in
    the round.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Kamara on 1 March 2019 on all
    grounds.

 7. At the oral hearing, Mr Karim relied on the written grounds  of  appeal
    and expanded on those in oral submissions by reference to  the  context
    of  the  refusal  decision  and  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Firstly, it was reiterated that the sole reason for  refusal
    remaining before the First-tier Tribunal was that the Respondent  could
    not verify the First Appellant's employment and at that stage there was
    no suggestion that employment was not genuine and effective.

 8. Secondly, there was a range of consistent evidence  before  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  about  the  First  Appellant's  employment,   including
    payslips, P60's, documents from HMRC (including statement  of  earnings
    and tax credits calculations referring to employment), a  letter  about
    pensions  enrolment,  letter  and  statement  from  the  employer   and
    Companies House documents in relation to the employer's business.   The
    First-tier Tribunal concluded that there was insufficient  evidence  of
    employment, partly by rejecting the HMRC evidence as not valid  because
    it was based on information given only by the employer.  However,  that
    would  be  the  case  for  any  evidence  of  employment,  which  would
    necessarily come from  the  employer  and/or  employee.   Further,  the
    pensions enrolment letter was rejected on the basis that there  was  no
    evidence that the First Appellant had been enrolled  in  a  pension  or
    deductions made on his payslips for that purpose.  However, the  letter
    shows evidence of employment and even if the employer had not  complied
    with the pensions requirement, that is not material to the question  of
    whether the First Appellant is in fact working in genuine employment in
    the United Kingdom.

 9. Thirdly, the First-tier Tribunal's rejection of  individual  pieces  of
    evidence fails to consider the  material  in  around,  with  consistent
    evidence of employment across a variety  of  pieces  of  evidence  from
    different sources.

10. Fourthly, a Tribunal could not on any legitimate  basis  could  include
    that the First Appellant's permanent employment, with earnings of �8640
    per annum, working 24 hours per week was not genuine and effective  but
    merely marginal or ancillary,  particularly  in  the  context  of  this
    family environment.  The earnings are  significantly  above  the  lower
    earnings limit  set  by  HMRC  by  which  the  Respondent  usually  has
    reference when considering whether employment is genuine and effective.

11. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Isherwood submitted that there  was  no
    material error of law in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    the fact that the employer could not be verified is the correct context
    in which the other evidence must be assessed.  The main findings of the
    First-tier Tribunal are set  out  in  paragraph  11  of  the  decision,
    highlighting that there was a  lack  of  evidence  of  employment,  the
    employer had not attended the hearing, there was no contract employment
    and no further evidence of the business.   The  payslips  submitted  on
    behalf of the First Appellant did not show  any  pensions  payments  or
    contributions and no holiday entitlement, further there was no evidence
    of the First Appellant actually being paid.

Findings and reasons

 1. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal are set out  primarily  in  the
    following two paragraphs:

         "11. The Appellant claims to be employed as a  shop  assistant  for
         [~] Foods Ltd.  he has produced two letters from his employer [MR],
         the director of the company,  confirming  the  Appellant  works  24
         hours each week on a permanent basis as a  shop  assistant  for  an
         annual salary of �8640.   He  does  not  describe  the  Appellant's
         duties in detail  and  gives  no  information  on  the  Appellant's
         economic value to the company.  Mr [R] did not attend the  hearing,
         so was not available  to  give  this  information.   The  Appellant
         himself gives no information in respect of the nature of  his  job,
         duties  or  responsibilities.   The  fact  that  the  Appellant  is
         recorded by HMRC as having employment working 24 hours does not  in
         itself prove the employment  as  these  assessments  are  based  on
         information provided by the Appellant and his employer.   There  is
         no contract of employment.  I accept there is company  registration
         for the employer but there is no evidence of  the  actual  business
         premises, retail licenses or employer's insurance.  The  letter  of
         enrolment in the Smart Pension is a notice of requirement to  enrol
         in a pension scheme.  It does not evidence actual enrolment by  the
         Appellant and  pension  contributions  are  not  reflected  in  the
         payslips.  I note also that the payslips, which range from  January
         2017 to July 2018,  show  no  holiday  entitlement,  which  without
         explanation appears contrary to statutory requirements.  Taking the
         evidence at its highest, I find the Appellant  has  not  discharged
         the burden of proof that the claimed duties and  work  relationship
         constitute effective and genuine employment  activity  that  is  of
         economic value to the employer.

         12.  The Appellant's monthly  claimed  income  from  employment  is
         �745.56 at present.  His bank statements reflect income from  child
         tax credits, child benefits and council tax payments, which make up
         most, and at times, all his monthly income.  He lives within  those
         means  generally,  and  the  bank  statements  also  reflect   food
         purchases.  Whilst he claims to have  an  income  from  employment,
         this is in no way reflected in his bank statements  because  he  is
         paid in cash.  There is therefore no independent evidence to  prove
         he actually receives the salary claimed.  In these circumstances, I
         find that the Appellant's employment activities and salary are  not
         proven, and if they exist, they are marginal and ancillary  to  his
         income from public funds."

 2. In relation to the issue of whether there is  genuine  employment,  the
    First-tier Tribunal appear to  be  requiring  a  significant  range  of
    evidence from the Appellant without explaining why this is needed  over
    and above the evidence  already  submitted,  which  included  payslips,
    P60's,  confirmation  of  employment  from  HMRC  via  different  means
    (through tax credits as well as confirmation of earnings), the  written
    and oral evidence of both the First and Second Appellants, as  well  as
    the written evidence of the employer,  together  with  Companies  House
    documents showing the existence of the business.

 3. The reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal for finding that the First
    Appellant had not  established  genuine  employment  do  not  withstand
    scrutiny.  First, a lack of detailed evidence about the nature  of  the
    First Appellant's employment from either  the  employer  or  the  First
    Appellant is relied  upon.   However,  it  does  not  appear  that  any
    detailed questions about the nature of employment were put to the First
    Appellant at the hearing, nor any concerns  raised  by  the  Respondent
    before or during the hearing  in  this  regard.   The  First  Appellant
    identified  his  role  as  a  shop   assistant   (for   which   duties,
    responsibilities and the  value  to  the  employer  can  reasonably  be
    inferred), his working days and hours, his salary and a start  date  of
    employment.  This was consistent with and supported by the  documentary
    evidence, as well as being consistent with the oral evidence  from  the
    Second Appellant and written evidence from the employer  himself.   The
    lack of further detail, not asked of any of  the  witnesses,  does  not
    support a finding that employment was not genuine.

 4. Secondly, the documentation from  HMRC  would  normally  be  considered
    reliable and sufficient evidence of employment and in any event,  would
    always be based on information submitted by an employer and/or employee
    and cannot rationally be discredited for that reason alone.

 5. Thirdly, the First-tier Tribunal placed weight on the lack of  evidence
    of business premises, retail licenses or employer's insurance;  however
    it is not apparent that any of this information has ever been requested
    and in circumstances where there is  no  doubt  from  information  from
    Companies House that this is an active registered company, there is  no
    apparent basis upon which such further evidence would be  necessary  to
    assist the Appellant in establishing genuine employment.

 6. In the absence of any express adverse credibility findings against  the
    Appellants and no sustainable  reason  to  discount  or  discredit  the
    totality  of  the  evidence  submitted   by   the   Appellants,   which
    consistently shows the First Appellant working 24 hours per week  on  a
    permanent basis for a named employer at a salary of �8640 per annum, it
    is entirely  unclear  why  the  First-tier  Tribunal  required  further
    evidence to establish employment on the balance  of  probabilities.   I
    find that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law in failing to
    consider the  totality  of  the  evidence  before  it  in  relation  to
    employment and reached a conclusion that was not rationally open to  it
    on the basis of that evidence.

 7.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings  in  relation  to  whether   the
    employment was genuine and effective rather than  merely  marginal  and
    ancillary are contained only in paragraph 12 of the decision, following
    relatively brief reference in  paragraph  10  to  a  person  not  being
    regarded as a worker if they  do  "not  pursue  effective  and  genuine
    activities, or pursue activities  on  such  a  small  scale  as  to  be
    regarded as purely marginal and ancillary or  which  have  no  economic
    value to an employer".  The conclusion appears to have been reached  on
    the basis that there is lack of evidence of receipt of the salary  from
    claimed employment and that the majority  of  the  Appellant's  monthly
    income is from public funds.  Although given as an  alternative  reason
    for refusal, the First-tier Tribunal again rely  on  employment  itself
    not having been established.

 8. For the purposes of whether employment is genuine and effective  rather
    than marginal and ancillary, there is no consideration  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal of the hours worked by the First Appellant, or the salary
    received, or any detailed consideration of  any  of  the  authority  on
    genuine and effective employment.  On the facts of this  case,  it  not
    legitimately open to the First-tier Tribunal to  find  that  employment
    consisting of 24 hours work per week, even  at  minimum  wage,  earning
    �8640 per annum was not genuine and effective and merely  marginal  and
    ancillary.  This is not arguably a case in which work is at such a  low
    level or at such low earnings that it could fall within this  category.
    The earnings were above the lower earnings limit set by HMRC used as  a
    benchmark  by  the  Respondent  to  determine  genuine  and   effective
    employment in the first instance.  The findings are not  in  accordance
    with the  established  principles  upon  which  genuine  and  effective
    employment are assessed and contain  a  material  error  of  law.   The
    finding made was not rationally open to the First-tier Tribunal on  the
    evidence before it.

 9. At the oral hearing, the parties were agreed that if errors of law were
    found in the First-tier Tribunal as to whether the First Appellant  was
    in genuine employment and  whether  that  employment  was  genuine  and
    effective rather than merely marginal and ancillary, that  the  appeals
    should be remade in the Appellants' favour.

10. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of material errors of  law  in  both  of  the  key  findings  in
    relation to the First Appellant's employment in the United Kingdom  and
    as such it is necessary to set aside the  decision.   For  the  reasons
    already given above, the appeals are remade and allowed.  In summary, I
    find that the First Appellant has  established  genuine  and  effective
    employment in the United Kingdom such that he satisfies the requirement
    of being  a  worker  and  therefore  a  qualified  person  pursuant  to
    Regulation 6 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016, such that he satisfies the requirements of Regulation 17  of  the
    same, to be issued with a registration certificate; as do his dependent
    family members.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

The appeals are re-made as follows:

    the appeals are allowed under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016.

No anonymity direction is made.
