Representation

For the Appellant:             Mr S Vokes, instructed by Dalsun Solicitors
             Ltd
For the Respondent:            Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting
             Officer


                                  DECISION



The First-tier Tribunal judge found in her decision promulgated on 12th
October 2018 that the 2016 Regulations did not define an EEA decision as
one which included the refusal to issue a family permit to an extended
family member ([3] of the decision) and thus concluded that there was no
appeal and no jurisdiction to hear the appeal under the Immigration
(European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.


The appellant appealed that decision on the basis that the restriction
imposed by regulation 2 of the extended family members

           (i) was ultra vires the Directive EC/2004/38
           (ii) denied the appellant an effective remedy contrary to C-
           89/17 Banger v United Kingdom (July 2018)
           (iii) misunderstood the correct interpretation of extended
           family member rights which was to be found in the Immigration
           (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.


    Consequently, the refusal of jurisdiction was contrary to European law
    and not sustainable.


Permission to appeal was granted on 19th November 2018.


At the hearing before me, Mr Vokes argued that that the judge may have
thought that was the correct interpretation of the Immigration (European
Economic Area) Regulations 2016 at the time, but it was now accepted that
the omission of an appeal right for extended family members was an
incorrect interpretation of Directive 2004/38/EC and indeed the 2016
Regulations had now been amended.


Mr Tufan noted that the amending regulations would not have retrospective
effect.

 1. In conclusion I agree that  the  amended  regulations  would  not  have
    retrospective effect,  but on 12th July 2018 the CJEU gave a ruling  on
    the interpretation of the Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens
    of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely  within
    the territory of the Member States, Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v Banger (Citizenship of the European Union - Right of Union
    citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the European
    Union - Judgment) [2018] EUECJ C-89/17 (12 July 2018).



 2. With respect to the 2006 Regulations Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1755
    confirmed the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) had  jurisdiction  to  hear  an
    appeal from a refusal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department
    to exercise her discretion to  grant  a  Residence  Card  to  a  person
    claiming to be an extended family member.  Khan, however,  was  decided
    in relation to the 2006 EEA Regulations only, but  prior  to  the  CJEU
    ruling.  In this  instance,  the  decision  refusing  the  appellant  a
    residence card as  an  extended  family  member  of  a  qualifying  EEA
    national was made on 9th February 2017 under the 2016 Regulations which
    specifically excluded a right of appeal for extended family members.


 3. As a consequence of the CJEU Banger  ruling,  the  Secretary  of  State
    amended the  2016  Regulations.   The  amendments  to  the  legislative
    framework came into force on 28th March 2019 and were a  direct  result
    of the CJEU judgment.  Regulation  36  of  the  2016  EEA  regulations,
    entitled 'Appeal Rights' now includes a reference at  regulation  36(6)
    to extended family members.  These amended provisions  overall  reflect
    the judgment of the CJEU and grant a right of appeal to extended family
    members to the First-tier Tribunal from relevant refusal decisions.


 4. The EEA (EU Exit) Regulations 2019  amended  the  legislation  but  not
    retrospectively.  The explanatory note confirms the amendments are  'to
    give effect to the case of C-89/17 Banger and  amend  the  legislation,
    inter alia, to

    'introduce a right of appeal against  a  decision  to  refuse  extended
    family members residence documentation under regulations 12(4)'.


One of the questions referred to the CJEU in Banger was

    'Is a rule of national law which precludes an appeal to a court or
    tribunal against a decision of the executive refusing to issue a
    residence card to a person claiming to be an extended family member
    compatible with the Directive'

 5. At [52] the Court held


    'In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth
    question is that Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted
    as meaning that the third-country nationals envisaged in that provision
    must have available to them a redress procedure in order to challenge a
    decision to  refuse  a  residence  authorisation  taken  against  them,
    following which the national court must be able  to  ascertain  whether
    the refusal decision is based on a sufficiently solid factual basis and
    whether the procedural safeguards were complied with. Those  safeguards
    include the  obligation  for  the  competent  national  authorities  to
    undertake  an  extensive  examination  of  the   applicant's   personal
    circumstances and to justify any denial of entry or residence'


 6. Owing to the nature of the wording of the CJEU response, I  conclude  a
    statutory appeal is envisaged.


 7.  Although  Mr  Tufan  did  not  expressly  concede  the   position   he
    acknowledged that the CJEU ruling would be  capable  of  having  direct
    effect in these circumstances.


 8. There are three principal routes through which effect is  given  to  EU
    law in member states.  First direct enactment  through  legislation  by
    domestic laws, secondly the duty to interpret  general  legislation  to
    conform with EU obligations and thirdly the doctrine of direct  effect,
    where citizens can rely on EU law as being directly  applicable  albeit
    that  law  is  not  specifically  enacted.  In   accordance   with   EU
    jurisprudence UK courts should apply the 'teleological approach' in the
    interpretation of EU law,  that  is  the  courts  should  interpret  EU
    legislative provisions in the light  of  the  purpose,  values,  legal,
    social and economic goals these provisions aim to achieve.   There  is
    also the doctrine of direct effect such that  where  an  obligation  is
    sufficiently clear, precise, and unconditional it is capable of  direct
    enforcement under the 'vertical direct effect'.  Individuals  who  have
    free movement rights or other rights under EU  law  which  the  UK  has
    failed to implement may invoke the measure with direct applicability.

 9. As set out in Dieter Kraus v Land  Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  [1993]  EUECJ  C-
    19/92 and with respect to Articles 48 and 52 of the EEC Treaty (as they
    then were).


    '31. Furthermore,  Member  States  are  required,  in  conformity  with
    Article 5 of the Treaty [now article 5 CFEU], to take  all  appropriate
    measures, whether general or particular, to ensure  fulfilment  of  the
    obligations arising out of the Treaty and to abstain from any  measures
    which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty'.


10. I consider that the CJEU ruling has direct effect and the fact that the
    2006 regulations interpreted  the  right  of  appeal  as  extending  to
    extended family members and the  response  to  the  ruling  by  way  of
    amendments, lead me to conclude that the proper interpretation  of  the
    Directive allows the First-tier Tribunal  to  hear  an  appeal  from  a
    refusal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  to  exercise
    her  discretion  to  grant  a  residence  card.    The   reference   to
    'sufficiently solid factual basis' in the CJEU decision makes reference
    in my view to a full merits appeal.


11. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
