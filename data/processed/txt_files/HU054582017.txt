Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Gilani, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Gambia and claimed to  have  arrived  in
    the United Kingdom on  October  30,  1992.  On  October  4,  2014,  the
    appellant applied to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules on compassionate grounds, but  this  was  refused  on
    December 24, 2014 with no  right  of  appeal  and  an  application  for
    reconsideration of that decision was rejected on June 4, 2015.

 2. On August 7, 2015, the respondent served the appellant with a notice of
    liability for removal and placed  him  on  reporting  restrictions.  He
    lodged an application for asylum on June 1, 2016 but this  was  treated
    as withdrawn on January 11, 2017  as  he  failed  to  comply  with  the
    processing of his claim. He was subsequently detained  on  February  8,
    2017 and applied to remain on human  rights  grounds  on  February  19,
    2017.

 3. The respondent refused that application on February  27,  2017  on  the
    grounds:

      a) He had failed to identify  any  claim  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

      b) In rejecting his claim under paragraph 276ADE HC 395 the respondent
         rejected his claim to have been in the United  Kingdom  since  1992
         and found  there  were  no  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  his
         reintegration into life in the Gambia.

      c) The respondent considered his claim under paragraphs  276A-276D  HC
         395 but concluded that as the respondent only accepted, he had been
         in this country since October 2014 he failed to  meet  the  10-year
         continuous lawful residence role set out in paragraph 276B HC 395.

 4. The appellant left the United Kingdom on March 8, 2017.

 5. The appellant lodged an appeal of March 31, 2017  under  section  82(1)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and his appeal came before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Robertson on May 10,  2018  who  in  a
    decision promulgated on July 2, 2018 dismissed his appeal.

 6. Permission to appeal was sought on July  13,  2018  and  permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Simpson  on
    August 8, 2018. The matter came before me on January  7,  2019  for  an
    error of law hearing and after hearing submissions  from  Ms  Gilani  I
    concluded there had been an error in law.

 7. I adjourned the matter and  directed  the  appellant's  representatives
    should make enquiries with HMRC and the appellant's bank, if  possible,
    to verify what he  was  claiming  about  both  his  National  Insurance
    numbers and what evidence, if any, was used  to  open  the  account.  I
    stressed the failure to obtain such evidence would not be fatal to  his
    appeal, but it could assist him.

 8. I also indicated that if the appellant could demonstrate he had been in
    this country since 1997 then unless Sections L-LTR 1.1 to 2.2 and S-LTR
    3.1 and 4.5 of Appendix FM applied then  the  appellant  would  satisfy
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) HC 395.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

10. Ms Gilani indicated to me that neither she nor her client had contacted
    either HMRC or the bank to clarify the issues raised following the last
    hearing. Ms Gilani stated she intended to argue that if the  respondent
    alleged the documents were false then he bore the burden of proof.

11. I pointed out to Ms Gilani that the respondent  was  not  arguing  they
    were forgeries but was inviting the Tribunal to consider  the  same  in
    the round which was different to alleging they were forgeries.

12. Mr Howells confirmed that no reliance was placed on Sections L-LTR  1.1
    to 2.2 and S-LTR 31.1 and 4.5 of Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules
    but submitted the respondent did not accept the appellant had been here
    since February 20, 1997 and therefore the appellant could  not  succeed
    under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) HC 395.

    SUBMISSIONS

13. Mr Howells relied on the decision letter and  submitted  the  appellant
    had failed to demonstrate he had accrued 20 years continuous  residence
    prior to the date of his application. Whilst he claimed to have entered
    the United Kingdom in 1992, he had made no  application  to  regularise
    his status until 2014. Whilst there was  evidence  of  him  being  here
    since 2004 there was insufficient evidence to support his claim he  had
    been residing here continuously prior to that date  and  in  particular
    between 1997 and 2004.

14. The FTT Judge had given little weight to the evidence  of  the  witness
    and the adverse finding on the witness evidence (see paragraph 8 of the
    FTT Judge's decision) had not been challenged.

15. This Tribunal had to consider today's appeal on  the  documents  before
    it. Whilst there were almost  500  pages  of  evidence  most  of  those
    documents were from 2003 onwards and there were only a small number  of
    documents (at pages 36-44a) from prior to 2003 and they took  the  form
    of sporadic wage slips and envelopes.

16. The appellant claimed these documents were provided by his friends, but
    he had adduced no reliable evidence to support this claim especially as
    the FTT Judge had rejected the witness evidence at the FTT hearing.

17. The wage slips he  had  provided  contained  three  different  national
    insurance numbers and whilst he claimed he had been given  a  temporary
    national insurance number between 1997 and 2004, many (between 1997 and
    2003) were not compatible with a  policy  document  relied  on  by  the
    appellant because they had too many numbers (8 instead of  6).  He  now
    blamed the employer for putting  too  many  numbers  in  the  temporary
    number but had adduced no evidence to support his claim  these  numbers
    were attributable  to  him.  As  there  was  no  reliable  evidence  of
    residence prior to 2003 he could not satisfy  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)
    HC 395.

18. Mr Howells further argued that he could  not  succeed  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) HC 395. At paragraph 37 in the decision of Treebhawon and
    others (NIAA 2002 Part 5A-compelling circumstances test) [2017] UKUT 12
    (IAC) the Tribunal looked at paragraph 276ADE(1(vi) HC 395.  The  Upper
    Tribunal made clear there was an  elevated  threshold  and  Mr  Howells
    submitted there was no evidence he satisfied this elevated threshold or
    that he would be unable to return to Gambia (he was now living there).

19. Finally, if the  appellant's  appeal  was  considered  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules he argued Section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act must  apply
    as he was here unlawfully and this outweighed his claim  that  refusing
    him entry was disproportionate.

20. Ms Gilani invited me to allow his appeal. In response  to  Mr  Howell's
    submission on the wage slip on page 36 she submitted the  employer  had
    simply used his full date of birth, which the document  she  relied  on
    suggested was acceptable. If there was an error, it had  been  made  by
    the employer.

21. The appellant had been unable to forward the papers himself because  he
    was not allowed to appeal in-country and he had asked  his  friends  to
    contact the landlord. His friend had given evidence in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and this should be considered when  assessing  the  weight  to
    attach to the documents. Banking practices had changed from  what  they
    were 20 years ago.

22. If forgery was alleged, she submitted the respondent bore the burden of
    proof and relied on RP (proof of forgery) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00086 in
    which the Tribunal said that an  allegation  of  forgery  needs  to  be
    proved by evidence and by the person making it.  A bare  allegation  of
    forgery, or an assertion by an Entry Clearance Officer that he believed
    the document to be forged can in these circumstances carry  no  weight.
    The respondent had not obtained a DVR report and had not satisfied  the
    burden of proof placed on him.

23. Alternatively, she submitted he had nowhere to  go  in  Gambia  and  no
    source of income and was living a life  of  poverty  in  Gambia  albeit
    there was no up to date statement or evidence from him.

    FINDINGS

24. I indicated during the hearing that the appellant's strongest  argument
    was under paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) HC  395  because  he  had  now  been
    living in the Gambia since March 2017 and had  failed  to  provide  any
    evidence that  there  were  "very  significant  obstacles"  capable  of
    engaging paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) HC 395.

25. The only written evidence provided by the appellant  was  contained  in
    two statements-one contained in Appendix A on page 1 (dated  April  30,
    2018) and the other attached to  the  Rule  15  application  and  dated
    December 16, 2018). Neither statement addressed his  situation  in  the
    Gambia or how he was supporting  himself.  Following  the  decision  in
    Treebhawon  I  was  not  persuaded  by   Ms   Gilani   that   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) HC 395 would be engaged.

26. The key issue was whether the appellant had demonstrated  he  had  been
    living here since 1992 and more importantly had  he  been  living  here
    continuously since 1997. He had  to  demonstrate  20  years  continuous
    residence in this country before the  date  he  submitted  his  current
    application. The respondent did not dispute he had adduced evidence  of
    working (he had not leave at the time) post 2003/2004 but argued  there
    was no reliable evidence of him being here continuously prior  to  that
    date.

27. Having earlier found an error in law in  the  way  the  FTT  Judge  had
    addressed this issue, I had adjourned this case for further evidence.

28. The respondent did not accept, the pay slips, contained on pages 36-44a
    of the appellant's bundle, were reliable. Ms  Gilani  argued  that  the
    respondent had to prove the pay slips were forgeries, but  I  disagreed
    with that submission because that was not the respondent's case.

29. Mr Howell's case  was  that  no  weight  could  be  attached  to  these
    documents because they were inconsistent with the evidence of what  was
    required which was not the same as saying they were forgeries.  It  had
    been open to the appellant's solicitors to contact the HMRC to  clarify
    the payslips or information. An answer from them may have assisted  the
    appellant.

30. I have looked at the relevant  payslips  which  are  contained  between
    pages 36 and 44a. They can be summarised as follows (date order):



|Page    |Date        |Amount showed                                         |

|41      |29/08/1997  |He was paid �1450 gross with no additional cumulative |
|        |            |totals apart from �1450. The payslip had M48 as week  |
|        |            |for payment and tax code 810L. The National insurance |

|        |            |E6]                                                   |
|40      |31/05/1998  |He was paid �1800 gross with no additional cumulative |

|39      |20/01/1999  |He was paid �1800 gross with no additional cumulative |
|        |            |totals apart from �1800. The payslip had M13 as week  |
|        |            |for payment and tax code 810L. The National insurance |
|        |            |number was [TN~B]. It was sent to him at [Flat # 41 ~ |
|        |            |London E7]                                            |
|38      |30/06/2000  |He was paid �1800 gross with no additional cumulative |

|        |            |number was [TN~B]. It was sent to him at [Flat # 41 ~ |
|        |            |London E7]                                            |
|37      |30/03/2001  |He was paid �1800 gross with no additional cumulative |
|        |            |totals apart from �1800. The payslip had M30 as week  |
|        |            |for payment and tax code 810L. The National insurance |
|        |            |number was [TN~B]. It was sent to him at [Flat # 41 ~ |
|        |            |London E7]                                            |
|36      |29/11/2002  |He was paid �1800 gross with no additional cumulative |
|        |            |totals apart from �1800. The payslip had M59 as week  |
|        |            |for payment and tax code 810L. The National insurance |
|        |            |number was [TN~B]. It was sent to him at [Flat # 41 ~ |
|        |            |London E7]                                            |


31. In assessing how much weight can be attached to these documents I  make
    the following findings:

      a) There is only one wage slip for each year between  1994  and  2002.
         These cannot show continuous residence.

      b) The wage slips suggested he earned only the sum stated on  them  up
         to and including  the  date  on  the  wage  slips.  There  were  no
         cumulative totals on any of those wage slips. There was nothing  to
         suggest he earned anything more in those years.

      c) The tax codes were all the same between 1997 and 2002 namely  810L.
         I found this surprising because  tax  codes  change  in  line  with
         increases in taxable allowances issued by the government.  Such  an
         alteration in code did not appear on any of the aforementioned wage
         slips despite them spanning a seven year period.

      d) The code for payment week/month bore no relevance to when the  date
         of payment, for example, the payment week for 25/2/1994 was M14.

32. The FTT Judge had rejected the witness evidence as unreliable  and  the
    NI numbers did not match the information in the guidance which suggests
    they should have six numbers and not 8 that most of  these  did.  There
    were also multiple NI numbers issued to him albeit I  accept  that  two
    such numbers reflected his date of birth.

33. The issue was whether weight could be attached to  the  above  payments
    and I find in the absence of additional evidence from HMRC  and  taking
    into account the issues raised above I am satisfied the respondent  was
    entitled to raise concerns about these documents.

34. As  I  am  not  satisfied  the  appellant  has  been  in  this  country
    continuously from February 20, 1997 (working or  otherwise)  he  cannot
    demonstrate he meets paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) HC 395. He does not  meet
    the Immigration Rules.

35. The  remaining  issue  concerned  whether  there  were  exceptional  or
    compelling circumstances justifying a grant under article  8  ECHR.  He
    had been in this country unlawfully all his life. Any private life  was
    created whilst here unlawfully. Section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act applies
    and little weight can be attached to this private life.

36. He has no other private life of any nature but  does  have  a  life  in
    Gambia as evidenced by the fact he  has  re-established  himself  since
    returning in March 2017.

37. I do not find it would be disproportionate to refuse him entry or leave
    to re-enter and remain here.

    DECISION

38. Although I previously found an error of law and I set aside the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision, I have remade the decision and I dismiss  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.
