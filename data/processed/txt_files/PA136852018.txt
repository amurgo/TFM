Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms G Brown of Counsel instructed by Sutovic &
Hartigan


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Aziz promulgated on 21 February 2019 in which the appeal of Mr  Qaraman
    [Q] against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department dated 22 November 2018 was allowed on protection grounds.

2.   Although before me the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is
    the appellant and Mr [Q] is the respondent, for the sake of consistency
    with the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I  shall  refer  to
    the Secretary of State as the Respondent and Mr [Q] as the Appellant.

3.   The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq whose date of birth is  given  as  1
    January 1983.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2008  and
    claimed asylum.  His application was refused and  a  subsequent  appeal
    dismissed by Immigration Judge Ford in a decision given on 16  November
    2009 (ref. AA/11780/2009).  Thereafter the Appellant made a  series  of
    further representations to the Secretary of State  in  respect  of  his
    protection claim.  The most recent set of further submissions were made
    in December 2014.  The rejection of those submissions led  to  judicial
    review proceedings which were settled on the basis that the  Respondent
    would  give  further  consideration  to   the   Appellant's   position.
    Supplementary submissions were presented to the Respondent  by  way  of
    letter dated 20 September 2018.

4.   The Respondent refused the representations by way  of  a  'reasons  for
    refusal' letter ('RFRL')  dated  22  November  2018,  although  it  was
    acknowledged that the Appellant's representations amounted to a  'fresh
    claim' for asylum and accordingly the  refusal  attracted  a  right  of
    appeal.

5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

6.   The appeal was allowed  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds  for  the
    reasons set  out  in  the  decision  of  Judge  Aziz,  with  particular
    reference to Article 15(c)  of  Council  Directive  2004/83/EC  -  'the
    Qualification Directive'.

7.   The Respondent sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro on 29 March 2019.

8.   A substantial part of the grounds in support  of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal  focused  upon  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision not to depart from 'country guidance' cases notwithstanding  a
    submission made by the Respondent's Presenting Officer  that  departure
    was justified pursuant to  particular  passages  in  a  Country  Policy
    Information Note and observations made in judicial  review  proceedings
    in a case called Amin [2017] EWHC 2417.

9.   However, before me Ms Cunha does  not  seek  to  pursue  that  line  of
    challenge.  Materials have been placed before me to indicate  that  the
    decision in Amin was itself subject to appeal, and the  appeal  settled
    before the Court of Appeal by way of consent.

10.  Ms Cunha also helpfully and appropriately  indicated  that  there  were
    other aspects of the grounds of appeal upon which she did not  seek  to
    rely.  In particular, it had been pleaded that the Judge had failed  to
    identify a 'Refugee Convention reason' for risk, but  in  circumstances
    where  the  case  essentially  turned  on  the  issue  of  humanitarian
    protection - and  in  particular  generalised  risk  -  it  was  not  a
    requirement to identify a specific 'Convention reason'.

11.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge in a decision  which,  in  my  judgement,
    has an attractive and coherent flow, made primary findings of  fact  in
    respect of the Appellant's circumstances, first  by  reference  to  the
    findings of Judge Ford from the previous appeal (see decision of  Judge
    Aziz at paragraph 69), and thereafter by reference  to  the  particular
    evidence that was  before  Judge  Aziz.   Those  further  findings  are
    summarised at paragraph 74 in the following terms:

         "Having heard from both the appellant and his brother, I  make  the
         following additional findings in respect of the evidence  heard  at
         this appeal hearing:


         (i)  The appellant's mother and sister  continue  to  live  in  the
             family home of his paternal uncle in Kirkuk.  They live at the
             property with his paternal uncle's wife and two children.


         (ii) The appellant has no other family members in Iraq with whom he
             (or his brother) are in contact with.


         (iii)    The appellant's mother and sister  are  supported  by  the
             appellant's brother from the United Kingdom.  The  appellant's
             maternal uncle's  wife  and  her  children  are  supported  by
             members of her family.


         (iv) The appellant's mother and sister largely remain  indoors  due
             to the security situation in their area.


         (v)  The appellant's brother visited Iraq last year.  He  travelled
             to Sulaymaniya with his British national  wife.   He  arranged
             for his  mother  and  sister  to  come  and  see  them.   They
             travelled by taxi and were taken by a taxi driver known to the
             family.  The reasons  why  the  appellant's  brother  did  not
             travel directly to Kirkuk was because he was still in fear  of
             members of the Jaff tribe.  However, I also accept that one of
             the other reasons why he did not go back to Kirkuk was because
             of the security situation there and in particular, the  ethnic
             conflict between Sunnis and Shi'ites."

12.  I pause to note that the  references  at  74(i)  to  a  paternal  uncle
    appear to be in error.  The Appellant's mother and sister had moved  in
    with the Appellant's maternal uncle, that is to say the brother of  the
    Appellant's mother,  in  2003.   The  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal indicated that the  uncle  had  died  in  2010  but  that  the
    Appellant's mother and sister continued to live in the household of the
    uncle's family - i.e. the Appellant's maternal  uncle's  wife  and  her
    children as referenced at 74(iii).

13.  Having  made  those  findings,  the  Judge  went  on  to  consider  the
    submission made by the Respondent's Presenting Officer to  depart  from
    the country guidance (paragraphs 76-83).  As I have already  indicated,
    that is no longer a live issue before me, and  accordingly  it  is  not
    presently  disputed  that  the   Judge   appropriately   followed   the
    established country guidance cases referred  to  in  the  body  of  his
    Decision.

14.  Pursuant to the 'country guidance', the Judge made the  first  critical
    finding in respect of the appeal at paragraph  84.   At  paragraph  83,
    with reference to AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT  00544  (IAC),
    the Judge noted  the  'starting  point'  for  assessing  the  issue  of
    humanitarian protection, and then concluded at paragraph  84  that  the
    areas in which the  Appellant  was  born  and  his  family  lived  were
    contested areas identified in AA as being areas where there was a  risk
    of Article 15(c) harm.

15.  The Judge then noted the Respondent's alternative submission - that  if
    there was an Article 15(c) risk in the Appellant's home area,  internal
    relocation to the IKR was viable (paragraph 85).  In  this  regard  the
    Judge gave consideration to  the  question  of  possession  of  a  CSID
    document.  The Judge accepted that the Appellant did not have  a  CSID,
    and found that he would face a difficulty in obtaining one because both
    his place of birth and the place of his family's residence  since  2003
    were  in  contested  areas  where  there  was  an  Article  15(c)  risk
    (paragraph 86).  The Judge considered the discussions  in  the  various
    country guidance cases in respect of  the  availability  of  a  central
    archive in Baghdad, but it was noted in this regard  that  the  precise
    operation  of  the  national  status  court  in  Baghdad  was   unclear
    (paragraph 88).  This led the Judge to the following conclusion:

         "The appellant will therefore find himself in a position  where  he
         is an undocumented IDP of Kurdish  background  in  Baghdad  and  is
         unable to obtain a CSID in  his  home  area  because  it  is  in  a
         contested region." (paragraph 89)

16.  The  Judge  noted  the  competing  submissions  that  arose  from  such
    circumstances with regard to the extent to which the Appellant might be
    able to obtain assistance from family in Iraq.  The discussion  in  the
    Decision goes on to consider potential assistance, both in the  context
    of  obtaining  a  CSID  and  more  generally  in  the  context  of  the
    reasonableness  or  otherwise  of  Baghdad  as  a  place  of   internal
    relocation.  I note that the Respondent's representative is recorded as
    having made the submission that once the Appellant obtained a CSID card
    he would be able to relocate to the IKR (see paragraph 90).

17.  The Judge -  again  with  careful  and  seemingly  full  reference  and
    recital of pertinent passages from 'country guidance' - noted that  the
    acquisition of a CSID in the particular circumstances of the Appellant,
    where he could not  readily  go  to  his  home  area,  was  essentially
    premised on the availability of a male family member willing to  attend
    the  civil registry with the Appellant.  Necessarily  in  circumstances
    where the Judge had found that the only family members  still  in  Iraq
    were the Appellant's mother and sister  it  was  concluded  that  there
    would not be any such male  family  member  available  (paragraph  93).
    Consequentially the Judge concluded "Internal relocation to the IKR  is
    not a viable option" (paragraph 93).

18.  In the sequential analysis of the Decision this  then  meant  that  the
    only remaining question was that of  internal  relocation  to  Baghdad.
    The Judge addressed this at paragraph 94:

         "The appellant will be an undocumented Kurd  in  Baghdad.   A  city
         with which he has no family, no connections and no support  system.
         I find that there is a  real  risk  of  destitution,  amounting  to
         serious harm.  The country guidance case-law is clear that  a  CSID
         is generally required in order for an  Iraqi  to  access  financial
         assistance from the authorities;  employment;  education;  housing;
         and medical treatment.  If an appellant shows  that  there  are  no
         family or other members likely to  be  able  to  provide  means  of
         support (as is the case here), he is likely to face a real risk  of
         destitution, amounting to serious harm, if, by the time  any  funds
         provided to the appellant by the Secretary of State or  her  agents
         to assist  the  appellant's  return  have  been  exhausted,  it  is
         reasonably likely that the appellant will still have no CSID."

    (I pause to note that the form of  paragraph  94  closely  follows  and
    replicates the considerations set out at paragraph  9  of  the  country
    guidance annexed to the case of AA (Iraq) v Secretary of State for  the
    Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 944.)

19.  Accordingly the Judge concluded that  internal  relocation  was  not  a
    viable option in the particular circumstances  of  the  case,  and  the
    Appellant's protection appeal succeeded.

20.  Paragraph 2 of the Respondent's grounds of appeal plead that the  Judge
    wrongly conflated his assessment of risk of destitution  with  that  of
    serious harm - "there is a  real  risk  of  destitution,  amounting  to
    serious harm" (paragraph 94).   It  was  suggested  in  the  course  of
    submissions that this was to confuse the Article 15(c)  'serious  harm'
    with the notion of destitution.

22.  In abstract principle  there  is  merit  in  such  a  submission:   the
    concept of 'serious harm' under Article 15(c), which  requires  a  risk
    from indiscriminate violence, is not to be  equated  with  destitution.
    However, it seems to me that that is not the meaning at paragraph 94  -
    which in any event is a direct adaptation of the words in  the  country
    guidance appended to the Court of Appeal decision in AA.  The Judge was
    considering internal relocation to Baghdad, the Article 15(c)  risk  of
    'serious harm' arising elsewhere. In the context of internal relocation
    it was not necessary for the Appellant to establish that he would be at
    risk of 'serious harm' within the meaning of Article 15(c) in the place
    of internal relocation. It  seems  to  me  that  the  country  guidance
    adopted by the Judge means no more  than  that  destitution  can  cause
    serious harm in the normal meaning of such a  phrase  -  and  not  with
    reference to any 'specialised' defined meaning under  Article  15.   To
    that extent I  am  not  persuaded  that  any  potential  conflation  of
    destitution and Article 15(c) risk is either made out on the particular
    facts of this case, or in any event would be  material  to  an  overall
    consideration of the issues and decision in the appeal.

23.  Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the grounds of appeal - I have leapt  to  those
    paragraphs bearing in mind the various concessions that have been  made
    by the Respondent in respect of the grounds of appeal - seek  to  argue
    that the Judge was in error in consideration of  the  country  guidance
    cases with regard to obtaining a CSID.

24.  However, it seems  to  me  that  nothing  is  readily  identifiable  as
    indicative of a departure from the principles of the country  guidance.
    Indeed, in fairness to Ms Cunha, the point was  not  amplified  in  any
    particular detail before me.  Rather, the  focus  of  the  Respondent's
    submissions was the extent to which the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had
    adequately factored in to the evaluation  of  Baghdad  as  a  place  of
    internal relocation the potential support that might be available  from
    family members.

25.  The family members who were potential providers  of  support  consisted
    of no more than the Appellant's mother and sister  resident  in  Kirkuk
    and the Appellant's brother - who had been granted  refugee  status  in
    the United Kingdom and was now living in the United Kingdom married  to
    a British citizen.

26.  It seems to me clear enough from the wording of  paragraph  94  (quoted
    above), and in particular the words in parenthesis - "as  is  the  case
    here"  -  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  concluded  that   any
    meaningful support was not available to the Appellant from  his  family
    members.  Accordingly the real  issue  becomes  the  adequacy  of  that
    finding, both in substance and reasoning.

27.  So far as the Appellant's mother and sister  are  concerned,  I  recall
    what was said at paragraph 74(iv) by way of a primary finding of  fact:
    although there was evidence considered and discussed before the  First-
    tier Tribunal of a single trip  having  been  made  to  the  relatively
    proximate town of Sulaymaniya at the time of the Appellant's  brother's
    visit to Iraq, it was found that they "largely remain  indoors  due  to
    the security situation in their  area".   The  Respondent's  Presenting
    Officer made a submission that a similar journey might be undertaken to
    Baghdad by  the  Appellant's  female  relatives  (paragraph  90).   The
    submission was made in particular  in  the  context  of  assisting  the
    Appellant to obtain a CSID card - although necessarily on the basis  of
    the  Judge's  findings  the  presence  of  female  relatives  was   not
    considered to be likely  to  assist  in  this  regard  irrespective  of
    whether the journey could reasonably and safely  be  made.   Given  the
    primary finding of fact at paragraph 74(iv), it  seems  to  me  readily
    understandable  why  the  Judge  concluded  at  paragraph  94  that  in
    practical terms the Appellant would not be able to avail himself of the
    support of his mother and sister  in  Baghdad.   They  themselves  were
    essentially dependent upon others for the provision of accommodation in
    that they were living in the  household  of  the  Appellant's  deceased
    uncle, and were also reliant to some extent on financial  support  from
    the Appellant's brother.  In those circumstances it seems  to  me  that
    the judge has indicated adequately the conclusion that  he  reached  in
    this regard, and the reasons for such a conclusion.

28.  It is  to  be  acknowledged  that  paragraph  94  contains  no  express
    reference to any potential 'means of support' that might be provided by
    the Appellant's brother.  However, my attention has  been  directed  to
    elements of the materials that were before the First-tier Tribunal,  in
    particular the witness statements of the Appellant and his brother.  In
    his own  witness  statement,  dated  24  January  2019,  the  Appellant
    referred to having been  supported  in  the  United  Kingdom  primarily
    through the system of Asylum Support, although there had been occasions
    where he had been supported by his brother. In this regard I note  that
    the ordinary practice would have been that upon the Appellant  becoming
    'appeal rights exhausted' in or about late 2009, any  support  that  he
    had been receiving through Asylum Support would have ceased; thereafter
    he would only likely have been able to access further  support  on  the
    basis of being destitute and by reason of  having  outstanding  further
    submissions and/or in due course a  further  appeal.   In  his  witness
    statement the Appellant relates that he lived with his  brother  for  a
    time:

         "[He let] me stay with him in the living room and eat the  food  he
         cooked.  He gave me a little bit of  money  if  I  needed  it,  for
         instance to travel.  In fact he was  not  able  to  support  me  at
         various times which is why I had to get NASS again.   He  does  not
         have enough money to support me to live in Iraq.  He has enough for
         his life and to send my mother some". (paragraph 25)

29.  The Appellant's brother's witness  statement,  also  dated  24  January
    2019, touched on this matter at paragraph 15:

         "If Qaraman was sent back I would not be able to  support  him  out
         there.  I do not earn a lot of money.  I am  married  and  have  to
         support my wife as she is not working.  I would try and do  what  I
         could but I do not have a lot of money".

30.  Further to this, the Judge recorded in  the  Decision  the  Appellant's
    brother's oral testimony with regard to the support that he extended to
    his mother and sister in these terms:

         "The amount of money which  he  sends  to  his  mother  and  sister
         depends on their needs.  Last  year  he  sent  money  on  two-three
         separate occasions.  On each occasion he  sent  around  �200-�300."
         (paragraph 46)

31.  It is to be acknowledged that that passage does not in terms  make  any
    reference to the brother's ability to send money, it being said that he
    sends such monies according to the needs of the recipients rather  than
    his ability so to do.  Also,  as  I  already  indicated  there  are  no
    express findings in this regard, and nor  are  the  brother's  possible
    means expressly referenced at paragraph 94, or otherwise in the context
    of the matters considered at paragraph 94.

32.   However,  again  I  remind  myself  that  the  Judge  states  a  clear
    conclusion that "the case here" is that the Appellant has shown  "there
    are no family or other members likely to be able to  provide  means  of
    support".  It seems  to  me  unlikely  that  in  what  is  otherwise  a
    thorough, detailed, and well-structured Decision, the Judge  overlooked
    the substance of the matters that were put before him during the course
    of the evidence.

33.  In any event, and more pertinently, the real issue in  respect  of  the
    viability of Baghdad as a location of return was a combination  of  the
    facts that the Appellant was an ethnic Kurd and that he  would  not  be
    able to obtain a CSID.  The importance  of  the  CSID  in  establishing
    oneself in Baghdad, or indeed anywhere else in Iraq, was reiterated not
    only in the country guidance but  in  the  Decision's  paragraph  94  -
    including  particular  reference  to  its  significance  in   accessing
    financial assistance, employment, housing and  medical  treatment.   On
    that basis I am not persuaded  that  the  lack  of  any  more  detailed
    analysis or findings in respect of the brother's means is  such  as  to
    render the analysis at  paragraph  94,  or  indeed  the  analysis  more
    generally in the appeal, materially deficient.   I  am  satisfied  that
    the Judge reached a  sustainable  conclusion  in  respect  of  internal
    relocation to Baghdad without material error of law.

Notice of Decision

34.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no material error  of
    law and stands.

35.  The Appellant's appeal remains allowed.

36.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.
