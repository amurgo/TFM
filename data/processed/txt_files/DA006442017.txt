Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Nishan Paramjorthy, Counsel instructed by
Sriharans solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr Chris Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
                     Amended pursuant to Rule 43 of the
       The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 [as amended]

 1. The appellant has permission to appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against automatic deportation
    to Algeria, his country of nationality, pursuant to  Regulation  27  of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.  This appeal
    came before me on 16 November 2018 for an error of law hearing.

 2. The appellant is an Algerian citizen married to a French  national  who
    exercised Treaty rights in the United Kingdom for over  5  years,  such
    that the appellant and his wife both  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence.

 3. When convicted on 20 May 2016, the appellant had been  married  to  his
    wife for only 6� years.  He could  not  show  10  years'  residence  in
    accordance with the Rules preceding his imprisonment  and  is  entitled
    only to the 'medium' level of protection provided by  Regulation  27(3)
    of the 2016 Regulations, that is to  say,  whether  there  are  serious
    grounds of public policy and public  security  requiring  his  removal,
    having regard to the matters set out at Regulation 27(5) and  27(6)  of
    those Regulations, with reference to Regulation  27(8)  which  requires
    the Tribunal to have regard to the considerations contained in Schedule
    1 of those Regulations.

Background

 4. The appellant remains married to his French wife. It is  not  suggested
    that the parties' marriage is one of convenience, but  they  have  been
    estranged  for  some  time,  although  the  appellant  hopes  that   is
    temporary.  The couple have no children and the appellant  was  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully when the relationship began,  and  when  they
    married on  27  November  2009.   While  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
    appellant has not worked.  He has been financially dependent  first  on
    his wife, and after their estrangement, on others.

 5. The appellant has four convictions for  theft  between  2005  and  2014
    which precede the index offence: on  17  January  2005  he  received  a
    conditional discharge for shoplifting; on 6 March  2007  he  was  fined
    (unpaid) for theft by shoplifting; and on 2 October 2013, he was  fined
    for the offence of theft from a person. On 20 May 2016 he was sentenced
    to 15 months' imprisonment concurrent on offences of fraud and handling
    stolen goods.   The appellant served half his sentence and was released
    on licence in January 2017.  He undertook no education  in  prison;  he
    says that OASys and his probation team  did  not  consider  him  to  be
    suitable for any courses.  After  his  release  in  January  2017,  the
    appellant was moved into immigration detention but released on bail  in
    March 2017.  His licence expired on 20 August 2017.

 6. The appellant has complied with his bail obligations since his release.
     In January 2018, he was discharged by the Probation Service.   He  has
    committed no further offences since then, although he no longer has the
    financial support previously provided by his wife.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. First-tier Judge Shaerf noted in his decision  that  the  international
    protection element of the appeal was withdrawn by Mr Paramjorthy at the
    hearing.  The sentencing Judge in 2016 had considered the appellant  to
    be a persistent offender:

         "You have been criminally dishonest, thieving in 2004, 2007,  2013,
         thefts from the person 2014 again.  You have been warned again  and
         again and you have avoided prison so far.  That background does not
         help you ... [The] overall  harm  associated  with  the  underlying
         offence is very great in my judgment.  It is not right and  not  in
         the interests of justice in my judgment simply to say that this  is
         a fraud which involved less than �600. ..."

 8.  The  appellant  did  not  challenge  his  offending  history,  but  Mr
    Paramjorthy argued on his behalf that he had not been in trouble  since
    his release and no longer presented a threat  to  the  United  Kingdom.
    For the respondent, Ms  Olalade  accepted  that  the  OASys  assessment
    indicated that the appellant was not a continuing threat.

 9. In a reserved decision, the First-tier Judge noted that  there  was  no
    evidence of support for his appeal from friends and the support from is
    wife was limited to a brief letter.  The evidence of the extent of  any
    reconciliation was contradictory.  The appellant had not worked in  the
    United Kingdom and was still under 40.  He had no health issues, and no
    family members in the United Kingdom other than his estranged wife. The
    appellant had family in Algeria, 'who enjoy a good life, of  which  the
    appellant is jealous, as he stated at interview'.

10. The Judge applied the considerations of public policy, public  security
    and the fundamental interests of society which are set out in  Schedule
    1 to the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016.   He
    noted that the OASys report found that the  appellant's  offending  was
    financially motivated and that the  appellant  'does  not  fully  think
    about the consequences to the public, which may reflect  an  ambivalent
    attitude towards the community' and  further,  that  the  OASys  report
    indicated that without his  wife's  support,  the  appellant  was  more
    likely to return to crime. The First-tier Judge found as  a  fact  that
    the appellant had not demonstrated that he had substantial ties to  the
    community.

11. The Judge found that given the lack of evidence of integration into the
    United Kingdom, on  balance  he  represented  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society  as
    set out in Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations and dismissed the appeal.

Permission to appeal

12. Permission was granted on the basis that arguably the appellant is  not
    a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society and/or that the  Judge's  decision  on
    that  question  was  insufficiently  reasoned.    In   particular,   Mr
    Paramjorthy asserted that the Judge had given the  appellant's  Counsel
    the following indication orally at the hearing:

         "Mr Paramjorthy, you will no doubt explain to your client  that  my
         decision is reserved, but in light of  your  submissions,  and  the
         very high threshold that needs to be met by the respondent, and the
         lack of re-offending since 2015 by the appellant, you  can  provide
         your client with an indication as to where I am with this appeal."

    The appellant contended that it was, therefore, unclear to him why  the
    appeal had subsequently been dismissed.



Rule 24 Reply

13. In a Rule 24 Reply, the respondent contended, so far as  now  relevant,
    that the challenge  to  the  rationality  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision was not well-founded, having regard to the demanding  test  to
    be met if the Upper Tribunal were to set aside a  decision  on  reasons
    grounds.

14. He argued that the Judge had  given  sufficient  consideration  to  the
    OASys report, which at pages 15, 19 and 20 showed that there remained a
    risk because of his tendency not to consider fully the consequences  of
    his actions and the risk of his  being  tempted  by  financial  motives
    given his current difficult financial circumstances.  While the risk of
    re-offending was low, the serious harm which would  be  caused  if  the
    appellant were  to  reoffend  was  such  that  it  was  not  considered
    reasonable to leave the public vulnerable to the effects  of  such  re-
    offending, were it to occur.

15. The respondent further contended that the appellant should be given  no
    credit for his failure to offend since 2015, given that  the  appellant
    had been in prison or in immigration detention until  3  January  2017,
    and had been involved in challenging his deportation since  then.   The
    expectation in society was that members of the public  should  be  law-
    abiding. He contended that the 19% risk of re-offending in year  1  and
    32% in year 2 in the OASys report should be given  significant  weight.



Upper Tribunal hearing

16. The Upper Tribunal hearing on 16 October 2018 was adjourned for lack of
    court time, but Mr Paramjorthy said that the appellant  was  now  in  a
    position to provide evidence of his wife's exercise of  Treaty  rights.
    Mr Avery for the respondent considered the evidence  and  confirmed  in
    writing later that the respondent accepted that the appellant  and  his
    wife had acquired a permanent right of residence.

17. I then gave directions for the future conduct of this appeal, requiring
    each party to serve and  file  written  submissions,  setting  out  all
    arguments and issues on which they relied, to an agreed timetable.  The
    appellant had one month to file his submissions, and the  respondent  a
    further 15 days.

18. I ordered that after receipt of the  submissions  of  each  party,  the
    Upper Tribunal would  decide  whether  the  appeal  could  be  properly
    determined on the basis of the  papers  and  submissions  received,  or
    whether a further oral hearing  is  necessary.  There  was  liberty  to
    apply.

19. If the appeal were to be relisted, the Upper Tribunal  would  endeavour
    to accommodate Mr Paramjorthy and Mr Avery's diaries.

Written submissions

20. Following the hearing, and having regard to evidence  provided  by  the
    appellant through his solicitors, on 26 October 2018 Mr Avery  for  the
    respondent submitted a brief note, confirming  that  the  Secretary  of
    State no longer wished to challenge the First-tier  Tribunal's  finding
    that the appellant's EEA spouse had  a  permanent  right  of  residence
    following 5 years' residence in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with
    the Regulations, and that accordingly, he also had a permanent right of
    residence.

21. For the applicant, Mr Paramjorthy in his written  submissions  set  out
    the offending history.  Mr  Paramjorthy  argued  that  the  appellant's
    appeal must be allowed since the  respondent  had  not  discharged  the
    burden of showing that he represents a genuine, present and  sufficient
    threat to society.  Mr Paramjorthy's submissions did not seek a further
    oral hearing.

Rule 43 decision

22.  On  4  January  2019,  the  Upper  Tribunal  promulgated  my  decision
    dismissing the appeal, in which I approached the appeal  on  the  basis
    that the parties  had  not  complied  with  my  direction  for  written
    submissions.

23. In his application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal,  Mr
    Paramjorthy noted that 'both  the  appellant  and  the  respondent  had
    refreshingly  complied  with  the  learned   Upper   Tribunal   Judge's
    directions', relying on the respondent's email of 26 October 2018,  and
    his own submissions of 16 November 2018.  The respondent  had  made  no
    formal further submissions apart from the 26 October 2018 email.

24. In grounds of appeal to the Court of Appeal, Mr  Paramjorthy  contended
    that in the 16 November  2018  submissions  he  had  'arguably  posited
    sustainable challenges to the determination of the Judge at the  First-
    tier Tribunal' and that there were, therefore, arguable material errors
    of law in the decision.  That is a misunderstanding of the  purpose  of
    an error of law hearing: the grant of permission identifies an arguable
    error of law and the question for the Upper Tribunal at  the  error  of
    law hearing is whether there is such an error, and if so, whether it is
    material to the outcome of the appeal.

25. In his Court of Appeal application, Mr Paramjorthy asked, that I should
    reconsider my decision and provide the appellant with an oral  hearing;
    and stated that permission  to  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  'is
    naturally sought'.  Mr Paramjorthy's submissions are thus a mixture  of
    an application under rule 43 and an application to the Court of Appeal.
     As he has succeeded under rule 43, the application  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal falls away.

26. I have considered Mr Paramjorthy's 16 November 2018 submissions.   They
    do not seek a further oral hearing and I do not consider  that  one  is
    necessary.  I am, however, satisfied that there has been  a  procedural
    irregularity (paragraph 43(2)(d)) and that it is in  the  interests  of
    justice  to  reopen  and  remake  the  decision  (paragraph  43(1)).  I
    therefore set aside the decision of 4 January 2019. I  now  proceed  to
    remake that decision, on  the  documents  and  submissions  before  me,
    taking account of Mr Paramjorthy's written submissions.



Analysis

27. I deal first with the Judge's alleged indication at  the  hearing.   If
    the Judge gave the indication that Mr Paramjorthy asserts that he gave,
    it was qualified by the clear statement that the decision was reserved.
     Even if the Judge had  given  a  misleading  indication,  I  have  now
    received further written submissions which  do  not  take  matters  any
    further, for the reasons below.

28. Mr Paramjorthy's submissions do not engage with Schedule 1 to the  2016
    Regulations nor with the integration point, on which  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal turned. The Judge was  required  by  Regulation
    27(8)  to  have  regard  to  the  considerations  in  Schedule  1  when
    considering the proportionality of removal, which he  did.   The  Judge
    was also entitled to have regard to all  of  the  observations  in  the
    OASys report, positive and negative, and in particular to the 32%  risk
    of reoffending in the second year,  the  appellant's  tendency  not  to
    consider fully the consequences of his actions, and  the  risk  of  his
    being tempted by financial motives.  To that I add the history of theft
    by shoplifting and theft  from  the  person,  over  a  relatively  long
    period, to which the sentencing judge had regard.   All  of  these  are
    matters relevant to the Schedule 1 considerations, but Mr Paramjorthy's
    submissions do not engage with that.

29. There is no want of reasoning in this decision and the  matters  relied
    upon by the appellant do not come  close  to  the  R  (Iran)  level  of
    perversity or irrationality.  On the contrary, the  First-tier  Judge's
    decision  is  robustly  but  carefully  and  adequately  reasoned,   in
    particular at [33]-[39] of the decision.

30. I find no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,
    which I uphold.  This appeal is dismissed.
