Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Garrod, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1.   The appellant was born on 23 July 1981 and is a citizen of Pakistan.
      He appealed a decision of the respondent refusing him entry  clearance
      to enable him to make a family visit to the UK for six weeks. The date
      of decision was 14 May 2013. His application was refused by  reference
      to paragraphs 41(i), (ii) and (vii) of the Immigration  Rules,  HC395.
      The respondent did not accept  the  appellant  had  provided  accurate
      information about himself.

   2.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was  heard  by  Judge  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Britton on 28 October 2013. The  judge  noted  the
      appellant was single with a brother and two sisters  in  the  UK.  The
      judge was not satisfied the appellant was in the financial position he
      said he was in. He did not accept the appellant intended to leave  the
      UK at the end of his visit because, in a previous application, he used
      an uncle as sponsor who had never met the appellant and who knew  very
      little about him.


   3.   The appellant appealed against Judge  Britton's  decision  with  the
      permission of the First-tier Tribunal. After a hearing on  6  February
      2014, Judge Britton's decision dismissing the appellant's  appeal  was
      set aside by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey. He found the  decision
      contained a material error of law because the reasons provided by  the
      judge did not show there had been  proper  consideration  of  all  the
      evidence. He directed that  the  decision  be  re-made  by  the  Upper
      Tribunal.


   4.   I re-make  the  decision  allowing  the  appeal  for  the  following
      reasons.

   5.   Paragraph 41 of the rules reads as follows:
         "41. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         the United Kingdom as a general visitor are that he:
         (i) is genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a limited
         period as stated by him, not exceeding 6 months; and
         (ii) intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period
         of the visit as stated by him; and
         (iii) does not intend to take employment in the United Kingdom; and


         (iv) does not intend to produce goods or provide services within
         the United Kingdom, including the selling of goods or services
         direct to members of the public; and
         (v) does not intend to undertake a course of study; and
         (vi) will maintain and accommodate himself and any dependants
         adequately out of resources available to him without recourse to
         public funds or taking employment; or will, with any dependants, be
         maintained and accommodated adequately by relatives or friends; and
         (vii) can meet the cost of the return or onward journey. and
         (viii) is not a child under the age of 18.
         (ix) does not intend to do any of the activities provided for in
         paragraphs 46G (iii), 46M (iii) or 46S (iii);
         and
         (x) does not, during his visit, intend to marry or form a civil
         partnership, or to give notice of marriage or civil partnership;
         and
         (xi) does not intend to receive private medical treatment during
         his visit; and
         (xii) is not in transit to a country  outside  the  common  travel
   area. "


   6. The burden of proof is on the appellant and the standard of  proof  is
      the ordinary civil standard of a  balance  of  probabilities.   I  may
      consider only the  circumstances  appertaining  at  the  date  of  the
      decision.


   7.   The appellant stated in his visa application form that  he  intended
      to make a six-week family visit.  He  described  himself  as  a  self-
      employed agriculturalist. He said  his  income  was  PKR  110,000  per
      season. He said he would stay with  his  brother-in-law,  Mr  Mohammed
      Imran Mehrban ("the sponsor"),  and  his  sister  at  their  house  in
      Reading.


   8.   The respondent's reasons for refusal can be summarised as follows:


         (1)  The  ECO  was  satisfied  the  sponsor  could   maintain   and
         accommodate the appellant during his stay in the  UK  but  the  ECO
         needed to be satisfied about the appellant's own  circumstances  in
         Pakistan;
         (2) When he was refused entry  clearance  in  2010,  the  appellant
         declared he was going to visit an uncle but he did not  mention  he
         had a brother-in-law at the time;
         (3) The appellant had shown documents evidencing ownership of  land
         but the documents did not show he derived any income from it;
         (4)  The appellant's declared income was not reflected in the  bank
         statements;
         (5) The appellant had no dependent family members in Pakistan  and,
         given the doubts about his employment, the ECO  was  not  satisfied
         the  appellant  had  shown  significant  ties  which  would  be  an
         incentive for him to return to Pakistan after the visit;
         (6) The appellant had not stated how much money  he  had  available
         for his trip and his UBL  bank  statements  showed  large  deposits
         which exceeded his monthly income; and
         (7) The appellant provided an affidavit from Noor  Hussain  stating
         he had returned money he had borrowed from the  appellant  but  the
         appellant's statements did not show any outgoing transaction.


   9.    The appellant submitted a detailed letter from the sponsor with his
      notice of appeal. This letter responded to the reasons for refusal. It
      stated  that,  when  the  appellant  previously  applied   for   entry
      clearance, he did not intend  to  visit  the  sponsor.  In  fact,  the
      sponsor was due to visit Pakistan. In Pakistan it is common  for  many
      transactions to be conducted in cash  and  the  appellant,  like  many
      farmers, keeps his money in  the  form  of  cash.  The  appellant  had
      provided evidence of the ownership of land and of a tractor. He  works
      with his brothers, Mr Saqlain Ishaq and Mr Asfane Ishaq, in the family
      business. Their resources are pooled so it is difficult to provide  an
      accurate figure for income. The appellant's bank balance was more than
      sufficient to cover his air fare. The loan made to Mr Noor Hussain was
      made in cash. The sponsor explained that he and his wife were keen  to
      return the favour shown to them by the  appellant  when  they  visited
      Pakistan and he had gone out of his way to show them  around.  A  less
      detailed statement was made  by  the  appellant  which  broadly  makes
      similar points to that of the sponsor's.


  10. The decision was reviewed by the entry clearance manager on receipt of
      the notice of appeal and maintained because no new evidence  had  been
      submitted to address the reasons for refusal.


  11.  In  addition  to  the  respondent's  bundle,  I  have  received   the
      appellant's revised bundle running to 104 pages. The sponsor  attended
      the hearing and gave evidence in English. I shall set out the evidence
      only as necessary  to  give  reasons  for  my  findings  of  fact  and
      conclusions.


  12. Having considered the oral and documentary evidence  in  the  round  I
      find  as  follows.  The  appellant  has  described  his  circumstances
      accurately in his application form and in the grounds of  appeal  with
      the consequence that the respondent's concerns largely fall away.  The
      sponsor was  the  subject  of  cross-examination  by  Mr  Melvin.  His
      evidence was consistent with his statement and the various letters  he
      has written in support of the appellant's  application.  His  evidence
      was also  consistent  with  the  appellant's  account.  The  sponsor's
      evidence was not materially undermined by cross-examination.  I  found
      the sponsor to be an entirely straightforward and reliable witness and
      I accept his oral evidence.


  13. As a result of hearing the sponsor's evidence, I find as fact that the
      appellant is a farmer, working with his two brothers in a joint family
      business. He is primarily concerned with the production of  wheat  and
      millet, whilst his brothers concentrate on the meat and dairy arms  of
      the business. I was shown crop  receipts  for  the  wheat  and  millet
      harvests in 2012 and the wheat harvest in 2013. I find  the  appellant
      has numerous  close  relatives  in  Pakistan,  including  his  mother,
      grandparents, two brothers and three sisters, as well  as  uncles  and
      aunts. The appellant is single but, as Mr Garrod said, that  does  not
      exclude him from being  a  genuine  family  visitor.  In  the  UK  the
      appellant has two sisters and a brother. I give  some  weight  to  the
      fact the appellant's elder  brother  has  twice  visited  the  UK  and
      complied with the terms of his visa, although I was told that  brother
      is married with children.  I  regard  the  fact  the  appellant  is  a
      landowner, with a share in the family business, with  close  relatives
      in Pakistan to be considerable incentives to return after his visit.


  14. As for the deposit in the bank account, I assume this  refers  to  the
      PKR 134,000 deposited on 10 April 2013. An explanation  for  this  has
      been provided in the form of Mr  Hussain's  affidavit.  However,  more
      significantly, I note that the appellant has provided  his  statements
      up to the date of decision and beyond, showing  that  he  maintains  a
      healthy balance. There has not been an unexplained withdrawal  of  PKR
      134,000 and there is no evidential reason to believe the appellant has
      artificially inflated his balance in  order  to  create  a  misleading
      impression.


  15. I clarified the sponsor's evidence about the previous  sponsorship  by
      Mr Tai. He told me that, notwithstanding the fact he  spent  the  best
      part of four weeks in his company, the appellant did not  mention  the
      fact he had applied for a UK visa in order to visit Mr Tai. This seems
      curious, particularly given the sponsor's evidence that the reason for
      the current visit was to return the favour. The  sponsor  thought  the
      appellant had wanted it to be a surprise  when  he  came  to  the  UK.
      Whilst curious, I find there is no evidential reason to disbelieve the
      evidence. To put it another way, the fact the appellant did  not  tell
      the sponsor about his plans is not sufficient reason to disbelieve him
      regarding his intentions on this  occasion.  Equally,  the  change  of
      sponsor has been adequately explained by the sponsor in terms  of  the
      appellant's family and Mr Tai falling into dispute over  an  issue  of
      inheritance.


  16. I find the requirements of paragraph 41 of the rules were  met  as  at
      the date of decision and I allow the appeal.

DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made an error of  law  and  I  re-
    make the decision in the following terms:

     The appeal is allowed.

                               Signed                 Date 21 July 2014

                               Upper Tribunal


     Fee Award        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007).


    I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note:  Fee  Awards
    in Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


    I make a fee award of �140.


    Reasons:      The appeal has been allowed.

                               Signed                 Date 21 July 2014
