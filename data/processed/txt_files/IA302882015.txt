Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Nicholson, instructed by BMAP
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Lebanon born on 21st February  1984.   He
    appeals against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Abebrese,
    promulgated on 26th September 2016, dismissing his appeal  against  the
    refusal of a residence card, as confirmation of a right  of  residence,
    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

2.   The Appellant appealed on four grounds:
    (i)  The refusal to adjourn the hearing was unfair;
    (ii)     The Respondent had failed to discharge the burden of proof  in
         showing that the marriage was one of convenience;
    (iii)    There were errors in assessing  the  Appellant's  credibility:
         and
    (iv) The judge had incorrectly stated the standard of proof.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth on 7th April 2017 for the following reasons:
         "The judge was arguably wrong to  refuse  the  application  for  an
         adjournment in the overall circumstances. It is arguable  that  the
         Appellant was denied a fair hearing. It is arguable that the  judge
         took  into  account  evidence  in  relation  to  Ms  Zampirolo,  in
         circumstances which prevented the Appellant, since the hearing  was
         proceeding, from dealing with matters raised in  relation  to  that
         evidence. It is arguable therefore that leaving aside the  arguably
         wrong decision  to  refuse  the  adjournment  application  that  an
         arguably wrong  approach  has  been  adopted  in  relation  to  the
         reception and consideration of  the  evidence  in  relation  to  Ms
         Zampirolo. It is arguable in these circumstances that  the  judge's
         reasoning has been vitiated. It  is  arguable  that  the  necessary
         conditions for the reception  into  evidence  of  the  material  in
         relation to Ms Zampirolo were not met.  It  is  arguable  that  the
         judge has applied the standard of proof incorrectly.  At  paragraph
         22 of the decision the judge has referred to it being  likely  that
         the Appellant and the Sponsor did enter into a sham marriage on the
         evidence before the judge."


Submissions

4.   Mr Nicholson submitted that the Appellant was  expecting  his  wife  to
    come to the appeal hearing to give evidence.  However, on  the  day  of
    the hearing the Respondent served a  Home  Office  minute  sheet  which
    showed that the Appellant's wife, Ms Zampirolo, had been interviewed at
    Stansted Airport and had been prevented from entering the  UK  on  31st
    August 2016.

5.   The minute sheet stated: "She confirmed that she  had  previously  been
    involved in a sham marriage in the UK for financial gain of �2,500. She
    confirmed that she was served on 23/06/16 with IS151A as  an  abuse  of
    treaty rights (Sham marriage related). She said that she was  a  victim
    of a gang in becoming hooked on crack cocaine whilst she was in  London
    between 2012 and 2015. She stated that since she left the UK in 2015 to
    Italy, she managed to stay clean from taking any drugs. She added  that
    she was now settled in Italy with her boyfriend. They both  work,  live
    together and share everything as a couple.  She stated  that  her  only
    intention was to visit a close ITA friend for four days and return back
    to Italy."

6.   The Respondent submitted the minute sheet and intended to  rely  on  it
    at the appeal hearing. Mr Nicholson applied for an adjournment  on  the
    basis that the Appellant's wife was unable to come  and  give  evidence
    and she was also unable to comment on what was set out  in  the  minute
    sheet.

7.   The judge refused the adjournment for the following reasons:
         "7.  There was an application for an adjournment by the Appellant's
             representative Mr Nicholson on the basis that the  information
             which had thus far been provided to them had not been properly
             contested  by  the  Appellant  and  they  had  not   had   the
             opportunity to take a statement from the Sponsor  as  she  had
             been out of the country. It was submitted by Mr Nicholson that
             the Appellant gave his statement to those instructing  him  on
             22nd August 2016 and that he was aware that  the  Sponsor  was
             due to arrive back into the  United  Kingdom  on  31st  August
             2016.  The basis of the adjournment is that she  ought  to  be
             given the opportunity to re-enter the country in order  for  a
             statement to be taken in preparation and defence of  what  had
             been alleged by the Respondents. He submitted that it  was  in
             the interests of justice for the Appellant to be  allowed  the
             opportunity to properly prepare his appeal and that  his  wife
             and Sponsor was keen and anxious to support him. Mr Alagh  for
             the Respondent opposed the application on the basis  that  the
             information that was before the Tribunal  was  sufficient  for
             the hearing to proceed as the Appellant  himself  was  present
             and  that  in  the  case  of  his  Sponsor  she  had  provided
             information  to  the  Respondents   to   indicate   that   the
             transaction was a sham marriage and therefore she ought not be
             to permitted the opportunity to re-enter the United Kingdom in
             order to prepare  a  witness  statement  for  the  Appellant's
             appeal.
         8.   I was also mindful in refusing the adjournment that I did  not
             see any correspondence from  the  Appellant's  representatives
             supporting the submissions which had been made by Mr Nicholson
             in relation to the position of the Sponsor in  supporting  the
             appeal even though she had been out of the country it ought to
             have been possible to have made some kind of contact with  her
             formally asking her to take part in  the  preparation  of  the
             appeal. There was nothing to support what was being said by Mr
             Nicholson  in  relation  to  the  Sponsor's  eagerness  to  be
             proactive in this appeal."

8.   The judge then went on to admit the summary of the interview  conducted
    with the Sponsor when she sought to re-enter the UK on 31st August 2016
    and the judge relied on the Home Office minute sheet in his findings.

9.   Mr Nicholson submitted that the minute sheet was  not  a  record  of  a
    comprehensive interview. The  Respondent  in  her  refusal  letter  had
    relied on an interview in August 2015 conducted by Leanne Evenson  when
    she visited Flat 3, 54 Sinclair Road, West London. There was no  record
    of that interview served on the  Appellant  or  on  the  Tribunal.  The
    allegation had been made that the Appellant's wife  had  admitted  that
    she had entered into a sham marriage on payment of �2,500.


10.  The evidence before the Tribunal was the Home Office  minute  sheet  of
    31st   August   2016   and   the   notes   of   interviews   with    IO
    Pooranaswaminathan,  IO Symss  [sic]  and  IO  Muir,  which  the  judge
    referred to at paragraph 9. Mr Nicholson submitted that  the  Appellant
    did not know what his wife had said in these interviews and he had been
    denied the opportunity of getting a statement from  her.   The  hearing
    could not be a fair one.

11.   Ms  Ahmad  submitted  that  the  judge's  reasons  for  refusing   the
    adjournment  were  reasonable  given  that  the  Appellant's  wife  had
    admitted on two occasions that she had entered into  a  sham  marriage.
    It was unlikely that she was going to return to the UK to give evidence
    at the appeal. There as no documentation in the Appellant's  bundle  to
    show that she was going to be called as a  witness,  no  statement  had
    been prepared and there was no evidence before  me  today  to  indicate
    that the Appellant was able to obtain her evidence and  that  it  would
    assist him in proceeding with his appeal.  Therefore,  the  refusal  of
    the adjournment was not unfair because the position would not have been
    any different had the Appellant been granted the adjournment. The judge
    would have had to make the decision on  the  same  evidence  which  was
    before him.


Discussion and conclusions

12.  Having heard submissions by  the  parties,  I  find  that  the  judge's
    decision to  refuse  the  adjournment  was  unfair  for  the  following
    reasons. The Home Office minute sheet was served on the morning of  the
    hearing. The Appellant was given no  opportunity  to  respond  to  this
    document and he was unable to contact his wife in  order  to  ascertain
    what had happened when she sought to re-enter the country  a  few  days
    before the hearing. The Appellant was also prevented from  calling  her
    as a witness at the hearing.

13.  Further, the Respondent has made a very serious  allegation  and  there
    is no evidence in the form of interview  transcripts  to  support  that
    allegation. The Home Office minute sheet dated 31st August 2016 did not
    actually refer to the name of the person who conducted the interview at
    16.15. It would appear from the Home Office minute sheet timed at 13.35
    that BFAO S McCabe was on duty  and  attended  the  interview  room  at
    Stansted Airport with the BFO D Joel. She carried out a short interview
    and searched the Sponsor's bag. She fingerprinted the Sponsor at  13.03
    and she returned the passenger to the interview room  at  13.20.  Given
    the serious nature of the allegation it was incumbent on the  judge  to
    give the Appellant an opportunity to respond. The judge  failed  to  do
    so. He then admitted the Respondent's evidence, submitted on the day of
    the hearing, and in relied on it in his findings. The  refusal  of  the
    adjournment was unfair.



14.  The burden is on the Respondent to provide sufficient evidence to  show
    that the marriage was one of convenience.  The Respondent has failed to
    submit  a  record  of  interview  or  indeed  any  notes   from   those
    interviewing the Appellant's wife on two occasions.  The  minute  sheet
    was  not  a  contemporaneous  note  and   was   insufficient   in   the
    circumstances to discharge the burden of proof.

15.   Accordingly,  I  find  that  the  judge's  decision  to   refuse   the
    adjournment was unfair His decision to admit and rely on  the  evidence
    submitted on the day of the hearing was also unfair. The judge erred in
    law in relying on assertions made by  the  Respondent  when  there  was
    insufficient evidence to support them.

16.  I set aside the judge's decision promulgated  on  26th  September  2016
    and I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal  in  accordance  with
    paragraph 7.2 of the Practice Statements of 25th September  2012.  None
    of the judge's findings are preserved.
