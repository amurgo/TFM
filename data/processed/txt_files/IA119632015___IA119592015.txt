For the Appellant: Ms C Robinson (counsel) instructed by Wilsons Solicitors

For the Respondent: Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



DECISION AND REASONS

1. I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of  any  information  regarding
the proceedings which would be likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
identify the appellants or their daughter because this  appeal  turns  to  a
large extent on the welfare of the appellants' minor child.

2. These are appeals by both Appellant against the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Abebrese promulgated on 23  December  2015,  which  dismissed
the Appellants' appeals on all grounds.

Background


3. The  First  Appellant  is  the  second  appellant's  husband.  The  first
appellant was born on 24 April 1982. The second appellant  was  born  on  21
February  1984.  Both  appellants  are  Mongolian  nationals.    The   first
appellant has lived in the UK since 2008, the second appellant has lived  in
the UK since 2009. The appellants' have one daughter, who was  born  in  the
UK on [ ] 2011.

4. On 23 January 2015 both appellants  submitted  applications  for  further
leave to remain in the UK on article 8 ECHR grounds. The respondent  refused
their applications on 16 March 2016.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Abebrese ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
decision.


6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and  on  24  May  2016  Judge  Heynes  gave
permission to appeal stating inter alia

      "3. The grounds of appeal complain that the Judge failed to  determine
      a ground specifically lodged; that the decision was not in  accordance
      with the law, applied the wrong test (in referring  to  insurmountable
      obstacles), gave inadequate reasons, misapplied Razgar and  failed  to
      address a submission that a short period of discretionary leave should
      be granted.


      4. It is arguable that the Judge applied the wrong test."

The Hearing

7. (a) Ms Robinson,  counsel  for  the  appellants,  moved  the  grounds  of
appeal. She told me that the Judge failed to deal with a  ground  of  appeal
which was competently before him. She told me  that  both  in  the  skeleton
argument produced to the First-tier and  in  counsel's  submissions  it  had
been argued that the respondent's decision is not  in  accordance  with  the
law. At [30] the Judge makes passing reference to  that  ground  of  appeal,
but does not deal with that ground of appeal anywhere else in the decision.

(b) Ms Robinson move to the second ground of appeal and  told  me  that  the
Judge had applied the  wrong  test  when  considering  whether  or  not  the
appellants fulfil the  requirements  of  paragraph  276  ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
immigration rules. She reminded me that the  appellants  concede  that  they
cannot fulfil the requirements of  appendix  FM  and  that  the  test  under
paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi) is consideration of whether or not there  are  very
significant obstacles to integration. She told me that eight  times  in  the
decision, between [30] and [38], the Judge refers to a test  of  whether  or
not there are insurmountable obstacles to return, which  is,  of  course,  a
completely separate test.

(c) In moving the third ground of appeal, Ms Robinson was  critical  of  the
Judge for failing to deal with part of the case pled by the  appellants  and
ignoring the appellants' positive contribution to society  in  the  UK.  She
argued that the Judge had  failed  to  take  account  of  the  dicta  in  UE
(Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 975. She argued that adequate evidence was  placed
before the Judge  to  counterbalance  the  public  interest  in  immigration
control.

(d) The fourth ground of appeal is that, although the Judge  refers  to  the
five stage test set out in Razgar at [41] of the  decision,  (it  is  argued
that) the Judge considered only the right to respect  for  family  life  and
did not give adequate consideration to  the  private  life  created  by  the
appellants in the UK, so that the proportionality assessment carried out  by
the Judge was inadequate.

(e) Ms Robinson told me that, at the First tier, counsel for the  appellants
had  argued  an  alternative  case  on  article  8  ECHR  grounds   -   that
discretionary leave should be granted until further investigations into  the
needs of the appellants' daughter could  be  brought  to  a  conclusion.  Ms
Robinson argued that neither the evidence to  support  that  submission  nor
that submission are  recorded,  discussed,  or  considered  in  the  Judge's
decision. She told me that the decision contains material errors of law  and
urged me to set the decision aside and to remit the case to  the  First-tier
to be considered of new, because the case turns on questions of the  welfare
of young child; time has moved on and further evidence is available.

8. For the respondent, Mr Walker adopted the terms of the respondent's  rule
24 response dated 20 June 2016, but told me  that  there  is  force  in  the
appellant's argument that  the  wrong  test  was  applied  when  considering
paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules.  "Insurmountable  obstacles"  is
referred to eight times by  the  Judge  and,  he  conceded,  "Insurmountable
obstacles" are irrelevant in this case. Mr Walker told me that the  argument
that the decision is not in accordance with the law  is  an  argument  which
was placed before the Judge and has not been dealt with  by  the  Judge.  He
did not concede the appeal, but he told me that the use of  the  wrong  test
in law and a failure to engage with one of argued  grounds  of  appeal  were
factors which materially affect the Judges findings.

Analysis

9.  Although  the  argument  that  the  respondent's  decision  is  not   in
accordance with the law does not feature in  the  grounds  of  appeal  which
supported the notice of appeal against  the  respondent's  decision,  it  is
conceded that it features in the skeleton argument placed before the  First-
tier tribunal, and counsel for the appellants made submissions to the  Judge
that the respondent's decision is not in accordance with the law.

10.  That ground of appeal is only briefly referred to by the Judge at  [30]
of the  decision.  Having  recorded  that  the  appellant  argues  that  the
respondent's decision is not in accordance with the law, the Judge does  not
make findings of fact about the legality  of  this  decision  nor  does  the
Judge reaches a conclusion in relation to that ground of appeal.  In  short,
the Judge acknowledges that one of the matters before him  was  an  argument
that the respondent's decision is not in accordance with the  law,  but  the
Judge does not specifically deal with that aspect of  the  appellant's  case
at all.

11.  At  [30]  the  Judge  finds  that  the  appellants  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of appendix FM, and moves on to consider paragraph 276  ADE  of
the rules. It is easy to see that, because of the  ages  of  the  appellants
and the length of time they have been in the  UK,  they  cannot  fulfil  the
requirements of paragraph 276 ADE(1)(i) to (v) of the  rules.  It  is  clear
that between [30]  and  [38]  of  the  decision  the  Judge  is  considering
paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi) of the rules.

12.  In order to  meet  the  requirements  of  Paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  the
appellant must meet the following requirement,

       (vi) subject to paragraph 276ADE(2), is aged 18 years or  above,  has
      lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years  (discounting  any
      period of imprisonment) but there would be very significant  obstacles
      to the applicant's integration into the country to which he would have
      to go if required to leave the UK.

13. Parties are agreed that between [30] and [38] the  Judge  repeats  eight
times the test he applies when considering paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
rules involves  a  search  for  insurmountable  obstacles.  Nowhere  in  the
decision does the judge asked whether or not

      there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   the   applicant's
      integration into the country to which he would have to go if  required
      to leave the United Kingdom.

14. At [38] the Judge reaches his conclusion and records

      "Therefore  the  tribunal  makes  a  finding   that   there   are   no
      insurmountable obstacles preventing the  appellants  and  their  child
      being removed to Mongolia as a family unit for the  reasons  expressed
      above."

15. The Judge manifestly applied the wrong test in  law  to  the  facts  and
circumstances of the appellant's case.

16. I find that these errors are material  errors  in  law  because  of  the
Judge did not engage with every  ground  of  appeal  and  then  applied  the
incorrect test, the  outcome  to  the  appellants'  appeals  may  have  been
different. As the Judge's decision contains material errors of law,  I  must
set it aside.

17. The determinative issues in this case relates to a child born  in  2011.
She is now approaching her fifth birthday. At the date of  the  respondent's
decision she was only 3� years old. At the date  of  the  Judge's  decision,
she was just  over  four  years  of  age.  In  the  intervening  period  her
circumstances have changed. I am told that fresh evidence is now  available.
They are matters on which the  appellant  should  have  the  opportunity  of
leading up-to-date evidence.

Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

18. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal  Practice  Statement
of the 25th of September 2012 a case may  be  remitted  to  the  First  Tier
Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:



   (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the First-
   tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that party's
   case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

   (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary
   in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that,
   having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to
   remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

19.  In this case I  have  determined  that  the  case  should  be  remitted
because of the nature and extent of the fact finding exercise  necessary  to
reach a just decision in this appeal. None of the findings of  fact  are  to
stand. A complete re-hearing is necessary.

20. I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal sitting  at  Taylor  House
to be heard before any First-tier Judge other than Judge Abebresse.

CONCLUSION

Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is tainted  by  material  errors
of law.

22. I set the decision aside. The appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First  Tier
Tribunal to be determined of new.


Signed                                                              Date 18
