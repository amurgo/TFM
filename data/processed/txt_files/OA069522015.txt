Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Muhammad Ishaq (the Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant, a citizen of Pakistan  born  on  25
    March 1997 against the respondent's decision of 3 March  2015  refusing
    him entry clearance as a dependent child of his father, the sponsor.

2.   The appellant was represented by counsel  at  the  hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal but his representatives wrote to the Tribunal on 14
    December 2016 advising that they were unable to attend the hearing  and
    enclosing written submissions in support of the appeal.   However,  the
    sponsor has attended the hearing.

Background

3.   The appellant lived with his father and mother  and  a  younger  sister
    born on 15 November 2005.  However, the marriage broke  down  in  about
    2007 and following their divorce his  sister  went  to  live  with  his
    mother and he stayed with his father.  This had been a  decision  taken
    between his father and mother and the village elders  had  decided  it.
    His mother had not had any contact with the appellant since 2007 and he
    had no contact with his daughter.  His mother  had  now  remarried  and
    lived in a separate household with her husband and the appellant  could
    not visit but he had visited his maternal grandparents and may have met
    his mother there.

4.   Later, the sponsor remarried and obtained entry clearance  to  come  to
    the UK in 2012.  At that stage he did not attempt to obtain  settlement
    for the appellant.  He said it was because he wanted the  appellant  to
    complete his matriculation and he needed to find a job and get  settled
    in the UK.  The sponsor now has two daughters from his present marriage
    born on 10 June 2013 and 3 February 2016 respectively.

5.   After the sponsor came to the UK the appellant  has  been  living  with
    and been looked after  by  his  paternal  grandfather.   The  appellant
    applied for entry clearance in early 2015 but the  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant was able to show that his sponsor had  had
    sole responsibility for his upbringing.  The appellant appealed against
    this decision, which was maintained on review by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager in a decision dated 15 July 2015.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

6.   The judge  accepted  that  since  his  parents  divorced  in  2007  the
    appellant had remained with his father and had had little contact  with
    his mother.  Although there was some confusion in  the  evidence  about
    whether this was simply an agreement between the father and the  mother
    and whether the village elders were involved or whether it was the wish
    of the appellant alone, the judge was satisfied that  the  sponsor  had
    had custody of the  appellant  following  his  divorce.   He  was  also
    satisfied that the appellant's mother played no controlling part in his
    life and identified the issue before him as  whether  the  sponsor  had
    sole responsibility or whether in the circumstances the grandfather was
    the controlling influence over the appellant or  shared  responsibility
    with the sponsor [26].

7.   The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor  and  his  wife.   There
    were also  witness  statements  and  affidavits  from  the  appellant's
    grandfather and the sponsor's former wife.  He also  had  letters  from
    the Deputy Registrar of the  university  the  appellant  was  currently
    attending attesting to the fact that the sponsor funded his studies and
    his grandfather was noted as the primary emergency contact.

8.   There was also a letter from Vision College stating  that  the  sponsor
    was the main point of contact between 2007 and 2012 and a  letter  from
    Jinnah Model School saying much the same for the period  2007  to  2010
    but as the judge commented neither letter was  relevant  to  the  issue
    given the dates involved.  There  was  a  letter  from  Punjab  College
    Mirpur in respect of the period  of  2012  to  2014  referring  to  the
    grandfather attending teachers' meetings but  said  nothing  about  the
    sponsor.  A further letter from the appellant's doctor  talked  of  the
    father attending with the appellant and that when the father  moved  to
    the UK the appellant attended with his grandfather, who paid the fees.

9.   Finally, there was a letter from the appellant's dentist  referring  to
    fees for dental work being paid up to 2012 by the father and after that
    by the appellant attending the surgery with his grandfather.  The judge
    noted that he had emails from the appellant and the sponsor  but  these
    postdated the date of decision and evidence of money transfer but  only
    one was before the decision date.   There  was  evidence  of  telephone
    calls though only the first  two  pages  from  1  January  2015  to  22
    February 2015 were prior to the decision.

10.  The judge noted that the sponsor came to the UK in  2012  but  did  not
    endeavour to obtain settlement for the appellant until  2015.   He  had
    said that this was because he wanted  the  appellant  to  complete  his
    matriculation and he needed to find a job and to get settled  down  but
    the Presenting Officer pointed out that these  considerations  had  not
    prevented the appellant from having a child in  2013  and  pointed  out
    that the application had been made just  before  the  appellant's  18th
    birthday.

11.  The judge accepted that whilst the sponsor was living  in  Pakistan  he
    had had sole responsibility but the issue was whether he had  continued
    to exercise that responsibility.   Having  reviewed  the  evidence  the
    judge set out his conclusions as follows:

         "41. My overall impression is that the  sponsor  relinquished  some
             degree of control over the appellant when he left for  the  UK
             in 2012.  I accept he has returned to  Pakistan  between  2012
             and 2015 and there has been some modest financial support over
             the period of his being in the  UK.   I  cannot  find  on  the
             evidence  that  the  sponsor  alone  has   been   making   the
             significant decisions about the appellant's upbringing.


         42.  I appreciate that the test is not whether the grandfather  has
             day-to-day responsibility (he plainly has) but  having  regard
             to the documentary evidence I am satisfied that the  appellant
             has not  established  that  the  sponsor  is  making  all  the
             important decisions.  His grandfather  is  attending  parents'
             meetings, medical appointments, and  dental  appointments  and
             making sure the fees are  paid.   At  the  very  least  he  is
             sharing parental responsibility with the sponsor.


         43.  I am satisfied on  the  evidence  that  the  sponsor  has  not
             demonstrated he has sole responsibility for the appellant  and
             accordingly para 297(i)(e) of the  Immigration  Rules  is  not
             met."



The Grounds and Submissions

12.  In the grounds it is argued that the judge erred in law by  considering
    the position of the grandfather when the decision letter was focused on
    the issue of whether the appellant's mother or his father had had  sole
    responsibility for him.  It is further argued that the judge failed  to
    consider the best interests of  the  appellant,  who  at  the  time  of
    decision was under 18.  He had provided a detailed affidavit in support
    of the appeal and had  expressed  his  views.   The  grounds  refer  to
    Mundeba (s.55 and para 297(i)(f)) DRC [2013] UKUT 88 and argue that the
    case law has moved on from a simple testing  of  a  parent's  level  of
    engagement with the major decisions in a child's life and the judge was
    required to consider the best interests of the child from  the  child's
    perspective.

13.  The grounds then argue that the judge failed properly to  consider  the
    evidence and erred by inferring from the documents referred to in  [28]
    - [33] of the decision that the  appellant's  grandfather  was  sharing
    parental responsibility with the sponsor.  It is also argued  that  the
    judge failed to take proper account of the  evidence  of  communication
    with the sponsor and his visits to Pakistan.  He further failed, so  it
    is argued, to make a  finding  on  the  affidavit  of  the  appellant's
    grandfather stating that he was 72 and  could  not  take  care  of  the
    appellant.  The judge had been unfairly influenced by the date when the
    appellant made his visa application and  had  erred  in  fact  when  he
    wrongly said that the costs of the appellant's studies  were  ï¿½500  and
    the support from the sponsor was modest.

14.  Permission to  appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis  that  the  judge  may  have
    erred for the reasons stated in the grounds  in  his  consideration  of
    whether the grandfather had more than day-to-day care of the  appellant
    and whether he shared responsibility for  the  child's  upbringing  and
    that it was arguable that the lack of reference to the appellant's best
    interests might be material.

15.  At the hearing before me the sponsor explained that his father was  now
    75 and was a heart patient.  When he had come  to  the  UK  he  had  no
    option but to ask his father to look after the appellant.   Every  year
    he tried to go back to see his son and look after his studies.  He said
    that it had not been proved that anyone else but  him  was  responsible
    for the appellant.  He had  been  in  contact  with  the  appellant  by
    telephone. At one stage, he was living with his brother  but  had  used
    his phone.  He was settled with his wife and daughters.  He wanted  the
    appellant to join them here.  He had no contact  with  the  appellant's
    mother in Pakistan.

16.  Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the judge had  reached  a  decision
    properly open to  him  on  the  evidence.   She  adopted  the  rule  24
    statement submitted by the respondent that the overall picture  painted
    by the evidence was that since coming to the UK  significant  decisions
    about the appellant's upbringing had not been made by the sponsor alone
    but he had surrendered much of the responsibility to  his  own  father.
    The judge had to make his decision on the basis of the evidence  before
    him and it was for him to assess  what  inferences  could  properly  be
    drawn from the delay in submitting the application.  In  substance  the
    grounds amounted to a disagreement with the judge's findings.

17.  In the written submissions from by the  appellant's  representative  it
    is argued that the appeal is more than a  mere  disagreement  with  the
    decision.  Whilst all  the  grounds  are  argued,  the  representatives
    wished to emphasise in particular the fact that the judge had failed to
    consider the affidavit of the appellant's grandfather when  making  the
    assessment of whether he had day-to-day responsibility  and  failed  to
    consider the best interests of the appellant. Given  the  grandfather's
    age and health, he would not be best placed to take care of him.

Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in Law

18.  I must assess whether the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in  law  such
    that the  decision  should  be  set  aside.   As  the  judge  correctly
    identified the only issue before him in  the  appeal  was  whether  the
    appellant could meet the provisions of para 297(i)(e)  of  HC  395  (as
    amended).  The onus is on  the  appellant  to  show  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that he:
         "(i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent ... in
             one of the following circumstances: ...
             (e)  one parent ... is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom ...  and  has  had  sole  responsibility  for  the
                  child's upbringing.  ..."
19.  The issue of sole responsibility has been the subject of  a  number  of
    Tribunal determinations and the most recent and  comprehensive  summary
    is set out in TD (Paragraph  297(i)(e):  "sole  responsibility")  Yemen
    [2006] UKAIT 00049 at para 52.  Although the case is not cited  in  the
    decision, it is clear that the judge was familiar with it in the  light
    of the phraseology he used in [22], [26] and [42].

20.  Whether the sponsor had  had  sole  responsibility  was  essentially  a
    question of fact for the judge to assess in the light of  the  evidence
    as a whole.  The judge noted that the appellant's grandfather  was  the
    primary  emergency  contact  for  the  university  the  appellant   was
    currently attending, that he had attended  teachers'  meetings  at  the
    Punjab College, Mirpur and since 2012 had been with  the  appellant  to
    appointments with both the doctor and the dentist.  The judge also took
    into account the evidence of the telephone calls, the transfer of money
    from the sponsor to the appellant and  the  date  of  the  application.
    None of these issues were determinative but they all formed part of the
    picture and it was for the judge to assess whether  the  appellant  had
    established that his father had had sole responsibility.

21.  It is argued that  the  judge  did  not  take  proper  account  of  the
    affidavit from the appellant's grandfather but there is  no  reason  to
    believe that this is the case.  The judge refers to  the  grandfather's
    affidavit [27] and was clearly alive to the issue of his  grandfather's
    involvement in the appellant's life.  There is  no  reason  to  believe
    that the affidavit was not properly taken into account.

22.  The grounds also argue that it was not open to the  judge  to  consider
    the grandfather's role in the light  of  the  fact  that  the  decision
    letter dealt  primarily  with  the  role  of  the  appellant's  mother.
    However, I agree with the judge's comment  in  [26]  that  the  refusal
    letter plainly stated that the appellant was currently living with  his
    grandfather in Pakistan and that accordingly he could properly  address
    that issue and, in any event, the  fact  that  the  grounds  of  appeal
    referred to the affidavit from the appellant's grandfather as does  the
    Entry Clearance Manager's review clearly indicates that the role played
    by the grandfather was an important issue which the judge was  entitled
    to consider.

23.  It is further argued that the judge failed to take the  best  interests
    of the appellant into account but I  am  not  satisfied  there  is  any
    substance in this assertion.  Strictly s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship
    and Immigration Act does not apply to entry clearance applications  but
    nonetheless, as the Entry  Clearance  Manager  acknowledged,  the  best
    interests of the child is clearly a matter that needs to be considered.
     However, that consideration must take place  in  the  context  of  the
    provision of the Rules.

24.  The issue for the judge was whether the  appellant  was  able  to  show
    that his sponsor had had sole responsibility.  There was no reliance on
    s.297(i)(f)  and  it  was  not  argued  that  there  were  serious  and
    compelling  family  or  other  considerations  making  the  appellant's
    exclusion undesirable and there was no sufficient basis in the evidence
    to suggest that this was an issue the  judge  should  have  raised  and
    considered for himself.  I am therefore not satisfied  that  the  judge
    erred by failing expressly  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant, a factor more obviously relevant to applications relying  on
    para 297(i)(f).

25.  In summary, I am satisfied that the judge reached  a  finding  of  fact
    properly open to him on the evidence for the reasons he gave.  I am not
    satisfied that any relevant matters were left out of account  and  when
    the decision is read as a whole, the judge's reasons are clear.

26.  For these reasons, the grounds do not satisfy me that the  judge  erred
    in law and it follows that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    stands.

Decision

27.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  and  the  appeal  is
     dismissed. No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
