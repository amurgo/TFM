For the Respondent:    Mr A Slatter of Counsel instructed by Chris Raja
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Rothwell promulgated on 13 November 2017 in  which  the  appeal  of  Ms
    Mylene [M] against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 16  March
    2017 to refuse leave to remain in the UK, was allowed on  human  rights
    grounds.


2.   Although before me the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  is
    the appellant and Ms [M] is the respondent, for the sake of consistency
    with the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I  shall  hereafter
    refer to Ms [M] as the Appellant and the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    Respondent.


3.   The Appellant is a citizen the Philippines born on  10  February  1987.
    She entered the United Kingdom on 6 August 2010 as  a  Tier  4  migrant
    with leave until 29 October 2012.  She was granted a further periods of
    leave until 30  November  2013.   On  26  November  2013  she  made  an
    application for an EEA  residence  permit,  which  was  refused  on  25
    February 2014.


4.   A further application for leave to  remain  was  made  on  17  November
    2015, based on Article 8  private  life,  in  part  pleading  5  years'
    residence in the UK. The Appellant also  pleaded  that  she  wished  to
    remain to care for her employer, Ms PD. In  her  application  form  the
    Appellant indicated that she worked as a carer, lived in  accommodation
    provided by her employer, and was paid ï¿½800 net per month.  By  way  of
    supporting evidence, amongst other  things,  she  provided  information
    relating to her employer's medical  condition  and  supporting  letters
    from her employer's daughter.


5.   The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for reasons set  out
    in a 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated  16  March  2016.  The
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant met the requirements of
    paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules, and moreover  that  there
    were not exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  the  grant  of  leave
    outside the Rules by reference to Article 8 of the ECHR or otherwise.


6.   In this  latter  regard  the  decision-maker  noted  in  the  RFRL  the
    supporting evidence in respect of the medical circumstances of PD,  and
    the Appellant's claim of the  development  of  mutual  emotional  ties.
    However, the Respondent decided that the evidence "does not establish a
    need for any additional care other than that which can be  provided  by
    the NHS, Social Services and family resident in  the  UK  who  are  not
    subject to immigration control". Concerns expressed in the  application
    in respect of the inconsistency of other carers were noted: however the
    Respondent commented  "no  evidence  of  this  inconsistency  has  been
    provided", and determined that the Appellant had "not demonstrated  why
    [PD] specifically has to be cared for by yourself, instead  of  someone
    who is not subject  to  immigration  control".  It  was  asserted  that
    subsequent to the Appellant's departure from the UK her employer  "will
    still be able to access qualified health  carers".  The  decision-maker
    added: "Although [PD] may experience a degree  of  unhappiness  if  you
    were to depart the United Kingdom, she can rely on the support  of  her
    friends and family in the UK"; it was  also  noted  that  it  would  be
    possible to remain in contact "via modern  methods  of  communication",
    and that the Appellant could apply for entry clearance as a visitor  or
    a carer if she wished to return to the UK.


7.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


8.   It became apparent before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  during  the
    period  between  the  Appellant's  application  and  the   Respondent's
    decision circumstances had changed. PD had died. In late  January  2016
    the Appellant began to work for SC - by  then  approximately  86  years
    old, suffering from dementia and recurrent  urinary  tract  infections.
    The Appellant had become her main carer. The  Appellant's  relationship
    with SC became the core element relied upon by the Appellant in respect
    of her human rights appeal.


9.   Because of the death of PD, and the change of circumstances  since  the
    Appellant's application, necessarily the factual  matters  relied  upon
    before the First-tier Tribunal were not those  expressly  addressed  in
    the RFRL. Nonetheless they were  similar.  The  basis  upon  which  the
    Respondent put his case before the First-tier Tribunal is apparent from
    paragraphs 26 and 27 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  where
    the submissions of the Home Office Presenting Officer  are  summarised.
    The Respondent continued to rely upon the RFRL,  and  argued  that  the
    Appellant's current  employment  was  essentially  unlawful,  that  the
    Appellant was  "not  unique  in  her  care",  that  the  Appellant  was
    essentially an economic migrant, but that she could return to  her  own
    country with qualifications, experience and references with there being
    no adverse issue in respect of job prospects in the Philippines shown.


10.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Rothwell allowed the  Appellant's  appeal  on
    human  rights  grounds  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the   decision
    promulgated on 13 November 2017.


11.  The Respondent applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    The grounds of challenge are in these terms:

         "1.  The Judge has found at [47] that little weight can  be  placed
         on this appellant's private life in the UK due  to  her  precarious
         immigration status and illegal working. At [49] the FTT  has  found
         that the appellant's role as a carer could be replaced by  another.
         The FTT then found that  the  appellant's  employer  has  emotional
         reliance on the appellant which amounts to a  compelling  situation
         and allows the appeal on that basis.


         2.   It is unclear why the FTT has made that finding when they have
         acknowledged that as  a  carer  for  a  woman  with  dementia  this
         appellant  could  be  replaced.  This  appellant  has  worked   and
         continues to work illegally in the UK. In addition the employer  is
         in breach of minimum wage legislation and is employing  an  illegal
         immigrant.


         3.   It is unclear why the FTT  has  therefore  made  a  compelling
         situation finding and allowed this appeal."


12.  Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on 12  April
    2018.


13.  Under cover of letter dated 23 May 2018,  the  Appellant  has  filed  a
    'Rule 24 response' in the appeal. In essence it is pleaded  that  Judge
    Rothwell  "provided  full  and  detailed  reasons  for   reaching   her
    conclusions and whilst the [Secretary of State] may disagree  with  the
    conclusions reached [no errors of law have]  been  identified".  It  is
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge drew a careful distinction
    between the potential replaceability of the Appellant in a practical or
    physical sense,  and  the  emotional  bond  that  existed  between  the
    Appellant and her employer.


14.   In  his  submissions  Mr  Bramble  confirmed  that  the   Respondent's
    challenge was essentially a 'reasons challenge', and in this context it
    was not contended that the decision was  'perverse'  or  otherwise  one
    that no reasonable Tribunal Judge could have made.


15.  Mr Slatter in his submissions - in echo and amplification of  the  Rule
    24 response - essentially argued with reference to Budhathoki  (reasons
    for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC) at  paragraph  7  (""Transparency
    should be the watchword." Parties should be in no doubt why  they  have
    won or lost."), and Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set  aside)  [2013]
    UKUT 00085 (IAC) at paragraph 10 ("reasons need not be extensive if the
    decision as a whole  makes  sense"),  that  the  Judge's  reasons  were
    adequate in the sense that there was transparency - it was  clear  from
    the Decision why the Judge had found in the Appellant's favour.


16.  In my judgement the basis of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision
    is clear. Indeed it seems to me that the grounds of appeal are  drafted
    in such a way that this is adequately apparent to the Respondent. It is
    implicit in the grounds that it is recognised by the drafter  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the
    emotional dependency between the Appellant and SC. Further, it seems to
    me that what the grounds of challenge are really seeking to  do  is  to
    argue that that was not an adequate basis for the decision -  not  that
    the decision was not adequately clear. That is essentially  to  express
    disagreement  with  the  outcome,  and  disagreement  with  the  weight
    attached by the Judge to this feature: it is not to identify  an  error
    of law as such. To this extent I agree with the Rule  24  response  and
    the submissions of Mr Slatter.


17.  It seems to me that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is  a
    manifestly  careful  decision  that  seeks  to  traverse  all  relevant
    evidence and factors. The Judge noted  that  there  "were  no  specific
    challenges to the factual matrix of the appellant's case", save in  one
    respect (paragraph 31), where the Judge found "that the appellant  must
    have been aware that she did not have permission to work in the  United
    Kingdom" when she started her current employment  (paragraph  32).  The
    Judge also addressed and took into account the unlawful nature  of  the
    Appellant's employment (paragraphs 34 and 35) - matters  upon  which  I
    make further observations below. However, notwithstanding these adverse
    features, it is clear that the  Judge  had  particular  regard  to  the
    nature of the relationship between the Appellant and SC and the  impact
    on SC's health and well-being (paragraph 36 et seq.).  Moreover  in  so
    doing it is also clear that the Judge drew a  distinction  between  the
    physical and practical care that the Appellant provided (which might be
    replicated by any  other  competent  carer),  and  the  emotional  bond
    between the Appellant  and  SC,  which  was  necessarily  personal  and
    specific in nature. For example: "a close relationship" (paragraph 36);
    confirmation of "the close relationship" by a  consultant  in  old  age
    psychiatry (paragraph 37), and the opinion of  the  psychiatrist  "that
    [SC] would suffer from acute emotional distress if the  appellant  were
    to leave and would lead to a more dramatic and rapid cognitive decline"
    with a potential for becoming institutionalised (paragraph 38);  "I  do
    not find that the appellant is irreplaceable in a physical sense... But
    I do take into account the emotional bond  between  the  appellant  and
    [SC]" (paragraph 49).


18.  Indeed, in my judgement, it is transparent from the closing  paragraphs
    of the decision that the Judge placed very particular reliance upon the
    emotional bond, emphasising "the  extent  of  the  emotional  reliance"
    pursuant  to  the  psychiatrist's  report,  and  the  significance   of
    continuity of care to ensure stability of SC's  mental  state  and  the
    likely deterioration were the Appellant forced  to  leave  SC's  employ
    (paragraph 49), and the Appellant's ability to  manage  SC  because  of
    SC's trust in the Appellant (paragraph 50). The 'weight' to be accorded
    any particular factor was essentially a matter of  evaluation  for  the
    Judge. This led to the conclusion stated at paragraph 51:

         "In summary the appellant entered with leave to enter and tried  to
         regularise her status at the end of her student visa. She did  have
         a period of overstaying when  she  began  her  care  for  [SC]  and
         therefore worked illegally without informing [the C family]. In the
         circumstances the public interest is clearly against her. However I
         have to balance all the facts in  this  case  and  I  consider  the
         compelling evidence of the relationship and emotional  reliance  by
         [SC] on the appellant. These cases are always fact sensitive and  I
         find that this unique and compelling situation outweighs the public
         interest  in   this   case.   I   find   that   the   decision   is
         disproportionate."


19.  This concluding paragraph - even in isolation,  but  more  particularly
    in the overall context of the rest of the decision - makes the basis of
    the Respondent's decision to allow the appeal adequately clear.


20.  In the circumstances I do not accept  the  basis  of  the  Respondent's
    challenge. The challenge is dismissed and the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal therefore stands.


21.  As intimated above it seems to me that the  Respondent's  challenge  is
    really in substance an expression of a disagreement with the outcome in
    the appeal. For my own  part  I  consider  it  appropriate  to  express
    reservations about the outcome also.


22.  The Judge plainly had regard to the public interest in general terms  -
    including maintaining effective immigration  control  -  and  also  had
    regard to the irregular nature of the Appellant's employment.  To  this
    extent I do not suggest that  anything  has  been  articulated  in  the
    grounds of challenge that might amount to a pleading of error of law in
    respect  of  the  balancing  exercise  necessary  in  the   Article   8
    proportionality assessment. Whilst, absent an error of law, it  is  not
    for the Upper Tribunal to interfere with the weight accorded by a first
    instance judicial decision-maker to any particular factor in an appeal,
    my reservations in this regard are such that I consider it  appropriate
    for future reference to make the following brief observations.


23.  Notwithstanding the recognition of the very particular  nature  of  the
    personal relationship that has developed between the Appellant and  SC,
    that relationship had only developed by reason of the Appellant  taking
    unlawful employment. Moreover, as the Judge recognised such  employment
    involve the payment of no tax or National Insurance. Inherent  in  this
    was that the Appellant was employed at less cost to her  employer  than
    would be the rate for a lawful worker. This strikes at the core of some
    of the fundamental purposes of immigration control  -  to  protect  the
    domestic  employment   market,   to   protect   the   vulnerable   from
    exploitation, and also, perhaps to a  lesser  extent,  to  ensure  that
    service users (including employers) are  provided  services  (including
    paid work) by those suitably authorised and qualified. It is also to be
    noted that the nature of the dependency is not equal: the  emphasis  is
    on the impact on the patient rather than the carer.  In  any  situation
    involving sustained, close, intimate caregiving on  a  near  round-the-
    clock basis, there may arise considerable emotional dependency  of  the
    patient upon the caregiver; absent the  immigration  context  it  would
    never be suggested that the relationship should continue  just  because
    one or other party wished it, if that was not a  mutual  agreement.  In
    real-world situations patients will often  lose  employed  carers  upon
    whom they have  become  emotionally  dependent  to  be  replaced  by  a
    different paid carer upon whom they may or may not  develop  a  similar
    relationship. It is difficult to see why the patient herein  should  be
    considered in a different light from  any  other  patient  who  may  be
    receiving paid-for care and who always faces the possibility  that  her
    employed carer  will  leave.  The  fact  that  her  carer  is  employed
    unlawfully cannot  be  a  foundation  for  improving  her  prospect  of
    achieving a continuity of care.  Indeed, once the Appellant is  granted
    leave to remain pursuant to the successful outcome in her appeal, there
    is nothing to compel her to  continue  in  her  current  job.  In  this
    context the significance of the impact on the Appellant's private  life
    of the loss of her relationship  with  SC  was  not  accorded  anything
    approaching the significance of the impact on SC.; the  extent  of  the
    interference with the Appellant' private life is  less  clear.  In  all
    such circumstances, and notwithstanding the emotional dependency  here,
    where  a  relationship  is  essentially  based  upon  one  of  unlawful
    employment, it seems to me that a decision-maker has to be particularly
    circumspect in determining that the consequential emotional  aspect  of
    the relationship is such as to outweigh  concerns  in  respect  of  the
    public interest in maintaining effective immigration control.


24.  Be that as it  may,  such  matters  did  not  form  the  basis  of  the
    Respondent's challenge, and in any event do not necessarily  amount  to
    identification of errors of law so  much  as  identifying  a  different
    emphasis that might be taken to the public interest  considerations  in
    such appeals. For the reasons already given, the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal stands.


Notice of Decision

25.  The decision of the fist-tier Tribunal contained no material  error  of
