For the Appellant:     Ms Johnstone, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Daniel Czaczkowski, was born on 30 June 1973 and  is  a
    male citizen of Poland.  I shall hereafter refer to the  respondent  as
    "the appellant" and to the Secretary of State as the  "respondent"  (as
    they were respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).  The  appellant
    was sentenced to a total of twelve months' imprisonment having  pleaded
    guilty on 10 May 2013 to two counts of being knowingly concerned in the
    importation of restricted goods on which a duty was payable  (tobacco).
    A decision was taken on 7 November 2013 to deport the  appellant.   The
    appellant appealed against that decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge  Chambers;  Mrs  SA  Hussain  JP)  which,  in  a   determination
    promulgated on 21 February 2014, allowed the appeal.  The Secretary  of
    State now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The grant of permission rejected a number of the grounds  submitted  by
    the Secretary of State.   First,  the  respondent  had  challenged  the
    Tribunal's finding of fact that the  appellant  had  been  continuously
    living in the United Kingdom for a period of five years [21-23].  Judge
    Bird, who granted permission on 12 March 2014, observed  [3]  that  the
    Tribunal had given reasons  and  had  been  entitled  to  conclude  the
    appellant had spent five years continuously in the United Kingdom;  she
    refers to the evidence which the Tribunal had accepted as proving  that
    fact.   Secondly,  the  respondent  challenged  the  adequacy  of   the
    reasoning  given  by  the  Tribunal  for  finding  the  appellant   had
    established both family and private life in the United Kingdom.   Judge
    Bird noted [5] that the Tribunal had given reasons for finding that the
    appellant enjoyed family life in the United Kingdom,  she  found  that,
    "the panel was entitled to this conclusion on  the  evidence  that  had
    been provided.  Nothing however turns n this point and the respondent's
    grounds seeking permission on  this  issue  are  therefore  unfounded."
    Judge Bird granted permission in the following terms:

         It is arguable that in considering the  appellant's  offences  from
         paragraph 27 and the risk assessment from paragraphs 28 to  33  the
         panel has made an arguable error of  law  in  failing  to  consider
         whether there are serious grounds of  public  policy  that  require
         that the appellant be deported particularly as  the  appellant  had
         been involved in  importation  of  cigarettes  without  paying  the
         relevant excise duty which had amounted to just short  of  �300,000
         (see paragraphs 26 and 27).  In this it is arguable that the  panel
         failed  properly  to  consider  whether  or  not  the   appellant's
         deportation is required  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy.   An
         arguable error of law has arisen.

 3. Ms Johnstone, in her oral submissions, drew attention to  [31]  of  the
    determination:

         We take account of what the sentencing judge said  about  loss  and
         danger.  The loss of revenue to the UK  is  described  as  being  a
         serious loss.  Many crimes cause economic loss.  We do not consider
         the basis of the offence as an offence  solely  of  dishonesty  but
         serious grounds of public policy or public security are made out in
         the appellant's case.  For the offence he received  a  sentence  in
         totality of twelve months' imprisonment of which  he  served  half,
         six months before being released.  Not  long  after  beginning  his
         sentence he was transferred to an open prison.  The judge described
         the possible danger to the public who smoke contaminated  products.
         Science and common sense show  that  cigarettes  are  dangerous  to
         health.  But on behalf of the respondent Mr Ogbewe  submitted  that
         the sentencing judge identified a possible danger to the public who
         smoke contaminated products and greater health risks resulting from
         the type of trade in which the  appellant  was  engaged.   When  an
         offender knowingly supplies contaminated products which  may  cause
         serious harm it could,  potentially,  give  rise  to  the  sort  of
         serious grounds of public  policy  or  public  security  Mr  Ogbewe
         contends for.  But we do not find that was shown to be  present  in
         the offence.

 4. At [32] the Tribunal went on to find  that  the  sentencing  judge  had
    spoken only "in general and non-specific terms" of the possible  danger
    to the public who smoke contaminated products.  He  had  not  sentenced
    the appellant on the basis that his activities were  a  danger  to  the
    public.   The  Tribunal  did  not  consider  it  appropriate  that  the
    appellant, who had not  been  charged  and  sentenced  in  relation  to
    specific health risks to the public, should now in effect  be  punished
    for such alleged misdemeanours in the deportation proceedings.

 5. Ms Johnstone submitted that the Tribunal  at  [31]  had  not  paid  any
    proper attention to the appellant's previous offending  in  Poland.   I
    reject that submission.  It was clear that the  Tribunal  at  [31]  was
    attempting to deal with the Presenting Officer's  submission  that  the
    possibility that the appellant had supplied contaminated products which
    were a danger to public  health  had  pushed  his  offending  over  the
    threshold of public policy and public security.  The Presenting Officer
    does not appear to have made any specific submissions about the  Polish
    offences of which the Tribunal were well aware since they refer to them
    (quoting  the  sentencing  judge's  remarks)  at  [26].   In  the  same
    paragraph, the Tribunal noted that the sentencing judge had  identified
    as an aggravating feature the appellant's  previous  offences  and  his
    membership in 2004 of what is described as "an organised crime  group."
    I find that the Tribunal has made the  assessment  as  to  whether  the
    appellant had crossed the public policy/public  security  threshold  in
    full knowledge of all the relevant facts.  There is  no  evidence  that
    they have ignored relevant evidence or had taken into account  evidence
    which was not relevant.  Judge Bird was clearly concerned regarding the
    economic consequences of the offending but the Tribunal  referred  more
    than once to the fact that the appellant had attempted to evade  excise
    duty of about �300,000.  I  find  that  the  Tribunal  has  reached  an
    outcome in this appeal which was  available  to  it  on  the  evidence;
    whether issues of public policy or public security are engaged needs to
    be determined  on  the  particular  facts  of  each  and  every  appeal
    concerning the deportation of a EEA national.  I do not find  that  the
    Tribunal has downplayed the appellant's offending or that its reasoning
    is inadequate.  I find that the Tribunal has not erred in law such that
    its determination falls to be set aside.

DECISION

 6. This appeal is dismissed.
