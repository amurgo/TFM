                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Bedford, instructed by Genesis Law Associates



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Grimmett and Mr Getlevog promulgated on 22 December 2014 which  allowed
    the respondent's appeal against deportation on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 2. The Secretary of State is the appellant here as she  has  appealed  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, permission being granted by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holmes in a decision dated 13 January 2015.

 3. JMI has also  cross-appealed,  however,  permission  being  granted  by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain in  a  decision  dated  9  June
    2015.

 4. Both parties are appellants before  me,  therefore,  and  for  ease  of
    reference for the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of
    State as the respondent and to JMI as the appellant,  reflecting  their
    positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the  appellant  from  the  contents  of  his
    protection claim.

Background

 6. JMI is a citizen of Somalia and was born in 1982.

 7. His history is set out in detail in [1] of the determination  of  Judge
    Grimmett and I do not repeat it in full here. The applicant came to the
    UK in 1994 and his offending began in 1999 when  he  was  convicted  of
    possessing a bladed article  in  public  and  common  assault.  He  has
    accrued at least 18 further offences since then, the most recent  being
    21 March 2013. The most serious is a robbery for which he was sentenced
    for 2ï¿½ years in July 2001. He also went to prison on a  sentence  of  6
    months in 2011 in connection with an  earlier  suspended  sentence  for
    possession  of  an  offensive  weapon.  He  has  committed  6  offences
    involving weapons, the last being in 2010.

 8. Meanwhile, the respondent granted the  appellant  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on 19 March 2001. He was granted a travel document  on  16  June
    2003. He married a Somali national in Ethiopia  in  2005  and  she  was
    granted entry clearance in October  2007.  The  couple  now  have  four
    children, the oldest child, a Somali national, being born  in  Ethiopia
    in 2005 and the other three children, all British,  being born  in  the
    UK after the wife came here in 2007.

 9. It will be  obvious  even  from  the  limited  summary  above  why  the
    respondent wishes to deport the appellant and that  he  relies  on  his
    family and private life to defeat deportation.

The Respondent's Grounds of Appeal - Article 8 ECHR

10. Judge Grimmett and Mr Getlevog did not find that  the  requirements  of
    paragraphs 399 and 399A were met; see  [5].  They  found  that  it  was
    reasonable for the children to go to Somalia  where  their  mother  was
    Somali and her family were still there.

11. I mention in passing that  the  references  to  reasonableness  at  [5]
    indicate that the panel applied the wrong test under paragraphs 399 and
    399A, the version in force applying the "unduly  harsh"  test  for  the
    children  under  399  and  a  "very  significant   obstacles   to   his
    integration" test under 399A. There was also no assessment  of  whether
    it was "unduly harsh" (or reasonable) for the children to remain in the
    UK without the appellant. Those  were  not  points  raised  before  me,
    however, the parties appearing to agree that they were not material  as
    the appellant could not meet the correct provisions of the  Immigration
    Rules.

12. At [7] the panel proceeded to consider whether there were "exceptional"
    circumstances that could defeat deportation, finding that  there  were.
    For what it is worth, the correct test  from  paragraph  398  that  the
    panel should have applied is "very compelling  circumstances";  nothing
    material arose before me on that point.

13. In any event, there is no reference  at  all  in  the  "exceptionality"
    consideration to the mandatory requirements of sections 117A-C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Weight had to be given to
    the public interest in deportation under  paragraph  117C  and  to  the
    public interest in effective immigration control under paragraph  117B.
    The panel at [7],  [9],  [11]  and  [12]  appears  to  undermine  these
    provisions by finding the failure to take  deportation  action  earlier
    meant that the respondent "has not shown why  there  is  now  a  public
    interest" in deporting the appellant. Consideration had to be given  to
    the finances of the family under s.117B. The appellant's  private  life
    can rightly be characterised as precarious given  his  offending  since
    1999, notwithstanding his indefinite leave;  see  AM  (S  117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC). There  is  no  reference  to  this  or  to  the
    family's finances in the determination.

14. The failure to apply sections 117A-C, in my view, was a material  error
    on a point of law such that the decision has to be set aside to be  re-
    made.

15. Further, there is no reference to the undisputed failure  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules and need to look for something very compelling beyond
    those provisions. That was not in accordance with the guidance of Court
    of Appeal  on  the  need  to  approach  the  exceptionality  assessment
    "through the lens of the new rules" as in SSHD  v  AJ  (Angola)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 1636 at [39] and [40]. The assessment  had  to  identify  very
    compelling matters beyond those already provided for by paragraphs  399
    and 399A.

16. The failure to approach the "very compelling circumstances"  assessment
    correctly was also a material error on a point of  law  such  that  the
    decision had to be set aside to be re-made.

The Appellant's Grounds of Appeal - the Refugee Convention

17. The appellant raised asylum and Article 3 ECHR grounds before the First-
    tier Tribunal in his appeal form at boxes 1 and 2. He maintained  those
    grounds in his witness statement at [30] and it was put to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in the skeleton argument at [16] to [18]. The  First-tier
    Tribunal decision does not show any consideration or decision on  those
    matters. Mr Smart did not concede the ground but indicated that it  was
    a difficult one to defend. In my judgement it is a clear error  of  law
    requiring set aside and re-making of the asylum and Article 3 claims.

Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside and will be remade de novo on all grounds.

19. Following paragraph 7.2  (b)  of  Part  3  of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012, that the nature of the fact
    finding that will have to take place if an error of  law  is  found  is
    such that it is appropriate to  remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be re-made.
