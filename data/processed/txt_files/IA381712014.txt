                             mR mALIK-ASIF iQBAL
                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but for the purposes of  this  decision  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as they were described before the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the Pakistan born on 20th May 1982 and on
    30th July 2014 he applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant under the points-based system but his  application  was
    refused on 10th September 2014 and a decision to remove him further  to
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  was
    made.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the application under paragraph 245ZX(d)
    with reference to paragraph 1(A)(c) of Appendix C  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The appellant needed to show that he had the required funds  of
    �7,880 and yet his account showed only a balance of �1,000.03  on  30th
    July 2014.  He therefore did not have  the  level  of  funds  over  the
    specified 28 day period to be granted leave.

 4. The appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge  Butler  who  allowed
    the appeal with reference to paragraph A34 (c). The judge accepted that
    evidence of the funds had not been established as at 30th July 2014 but
    found that paragraph 34(C)(b) provided an opportunity for the  decision
    maker to correct any omission or  error  and  the  respondent  did  not
    exercise a discretion to request evidence of other funds.

 5. An application for permission to appeal was made by the  respondent  on
    the basis that A34C referred to the validity of an application  and  no
    such challenge was made  by  the  Secretary  of  State.    The  judge's
    reference was not relevant and the paragraph cited offered  no  support
    for the judge's conclusions.  Permission  was  granted  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Brunnen.

Conclusions

 6. It is not entirely clear to which rule the judge was referring.  I note
    that A34(iii)(c) referred to further documents being supplied within 15
    days.  Paragraph 34 C refers to an invalid application which  will  not
    be considered.  However, further to Sections 85(A)(3) and  (4)  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  the  Tribunal  may  only
    consider evidence which was submitted in support of and at the time  of
    making the application to which the immigration decision related.

 7. The question is whether evidence of the funds was required at the  date
    of the application or could he show evidence of those  funds  prior  to
    the making of the decision?

 8. Further to Paragraph 245ZX(d) the appellant must have a minimum  of  10
    points under paragraphs 10 to 14 of Appendix C.

 9. Paragraph 1A(a) of Appendix C of the Immigration  Rules  requires  that
    'the applicant must have the funds specified in the  relevant  part  of
    Appendix C at the date of the application'.

10. Paragraph 1A(c) of Appendix C of the Immigration  Rules  requires  that
    'if the applicant is applying as a Tier 4 Migrant  the  applicant  must
    have had the funds referred to in (a) above for a  consecutive  28  day
    period of time'.

11. Paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules states:

         "the end date of the 90 day and 28 periods... will be taken as  the
         date of the closing balance on the most  recent  of  the  specified
         documents, and must be no earlier than 31 days before the  date  of
         the application".

12. Further to Appendix C points would only be awarded if the  funds  shown
    in the relevant  table  were  available  in  the  manner  specified  in
    Appendix C.

13. I repeat that Paragraph 1A(a) of Appendix C of  the  Immigration  Rules
    explicitly requires that 'the applicant must have the  funds  specified
    in the relevant part of Appendix C at the  date  of  the  application'.
    The appellant supplied a CAS which post dated this application but  his
    application could not be later than 30th July 2014 because that is  the
    date that he told me his leave expired.  The appellant could only  show
    that he had the relevant funds for the 28 day period after the date  of
    the application and thus he could not succeed under the Rules.

14. I heard from the appellant at the hearing, as  indeed  did  the  judge,
    that there had been an incident in his family home preventing  evidence
    being adduced but this unfortunately does not assist him.

15. SSHD v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ  2  confirmed  the  proposition  that
    'there is no unfairness in the requirement in the PBS that an applicant
    must submit with his application  all  of  the  evidence  necessary  to
    demonstrate compliance with the  rule  under  which  he  seeks  leave'.
    Paragraph 92  confirmed  'Taken  overall,  the  Evidential  Flexibility
    process instruction is demonstrably not designed to give  an  applicant
    the opportunity first  to  remedy  any  defect  or  inadequacy  in  the
    application or supporting documentation so as to save  the  application
    from  refusal  after  substantive   consideration'.     There   is   no
    requirement that the Secretary of State should search out  for  further
    documentation in this case.

16. The Judge erred in law materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set
    aside the decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE  2007)  and  remake  the  decision  under
    section 12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007 and for the reasons given  above
    dismiss the appeal.

Order

The appeal of Mr Malik-Asif Iqbal is dismissed.

No anonymity order has been made.
