Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Saunders, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms Revill, instructed by Kings Court Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondents, Michael Shawnon Whitby (date of birth 20 August 1968),
    Storm Free Whitby (date of  birth  27  February  2003),  Shawn  Michael
    Whitby (date of birth 17 March 2005) and Thor Wesley  Whitby  (date  of
    birth 6 September 1999) are citizens of the United States  of  America.
    We shall hereafter refer to the respondents as the  appellants  and  to
    the appellants as the respondents (as they appeared respectively before
    the First-tier  Tribunal).   Further,  we  shall  refer  to  the  first
    appellant as "the appellant".  The second, third and fourth  appellants
    are  dependants  upon  the  first  appellant's  application  for  entry
    clearance.  The appellant applied for entry clearance for settlement in
    the United Kingdom as the spouse of  a  British  citizen  (Lisa  Whitby
    Flack - hereafter referred to as "the sponsor").  The applications were
    refused by a decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO).   The
    refusal notice dated 9 April 2013, reads as follows:

         You have sought entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a  partner
         under Appendix FM.  However, on 22 April 2005 you were convicted of
         an offence for which you were sentenced to a period of imprisonment
         of four years.  Also on 19  May  2008  you  were  convicted  of  an
         offence for which you were sentenced to a period of imprisonment of
         sixteen months.  Consideration has been given to whether there  are
         compelling factors as to why you  should  nevertheless  be  allowed
         entry to the UK.  However, the circumstances you have  put  forward
         are not considered to amount to exceptional circumstances.  I  have
         also considered your application  under  Article  8  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1998 and I am satisfied that the decision  is  justified
         and  proportionate  it  is  such  that  the  public   interest   in
         maintaining a refusal is outweighed.  I am therefore refusing  your
         application under paragraph S-EC.1.4(a and b) and  S-EC1.5  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lingam) which,
    in a determination promulgated on 4 March 2014,  dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed it under Article 8  ECHR.   The
    ECO now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

Late Application for Permission to Appeal

 3. Mr John McGirr on behalf of the ECO  submitted  a  First-tier  Tribunal
    application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 19  March
    2014.  The application contains the following statement:

         This allowed appeal was, apparently, served on 4.3.14.  However, it
         was not received in the Home Office until 12.3.14.  It is not  know
         why there was this delay.  However, it  is  respectfully  submitted
         that  this  therefore  makes  today  the  last  day  to  lodge   an
         application in-time.

 4. Granting permission, Judge Heynes wrote:

         The respondent seeks permission to appeal,  in  time,  against  the
         decision  of  First-tier  Judge  Lingam  who,  in  a  determination
         promulgated on 4 March 2014, allowed the appeal  of  the  appellant
         against the refusal of his application for  entry  clearance  as  a
         spouse and thus of his children.

         The grounds of appeal complain that the judge  failed  to  approach
         Article 8 correctly.

         Though Gulshan (Article 8-new rules-correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) was quoted in the determination the guidance contained in
         it does not appear to have been followed in the assessment  of  the
         human rights appeal.

         An arguable error of law is thus disclosed by the application.

 5. Ms Revill, for the appellant, submitted that a  mere  assertion  by  Mr
    McGirr that the First-tier Tribunal  determination  had  been  received
    late, was, without further evidence, insufficient.

 6. Even assuming (which we do not) that we have any jurisdiction to review
    the judge's decision to grant permission, we find that it is clear from
    that decision and his use of the expression "in time" that he  accepted
    Mr McGirr's assertion that the determination had not reached  the  Home
    Office until 12 March 2014 and that  the  application  had,  therefore,
    been made in time.  It was clear that he was satisfied with Mr McGirr's
    statement as evidence of the date of  service  and  we  could  find  no
    reason to interfere with his decision.

Ground 1: failure to identify compelling circumstances

 7. Ground 1 reads as follows:

         The judge erred in law by failing to  identify  'an  arguable  case
         that there may be good grounds for granting leave outside the Rules
         by reference to Article  8'  or  to  'consider  whether  there  are
         compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
         Rules to require the grant of such leave' per Nagre [2013] EWHC 720
         (Admin).

 8. The appellant's application fell to be considered under S-EC1.4.   This
    provision had been amended  from  13  December  2012  by  Statement  of
    Changes (HC 760).  It provides as follows:

         S-EC.1.4. The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive
         to the public good because they have:
         (a) been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years; or

         (b) been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months but less than 4
         years, unless a period of 10 years has passed since the end of the
         sentence; or

         (c) been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
         to a period of imprisonment of less than 12 months, unless a period
         of 5 years has passed since the end of the sentence.


    Where this paragraph applies, unless refusal would be contrary  to  the
    Human Rights Convention or the Convention and Protocol Relating to  the
    Status of Refugees, it will only be in exceptional  circumstances  that
    the public interest  in  maintaining  refusal  will  be  outweighed  by
    compelling factors.

 9. As the refusal notice observed, the appellant fell firmly  within  that
    category  of  applicant  who  had  been  sentenced  to  a   period   of
    imprisonment of at least twelve months but less than  four  years;  the
    Rule provided for him to be excluded from  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    period of ten years since the end of his sentence.  The grounds  go  on
    to say:

         The  Rules  therefore  'sufficiently  recognise'   those   in   the
         appellant's situation.  Given that the Rules sufficiently recognise
         the appellant's situation, compelling circumstances  are  required.
         The  judge  did  not  identify   such   case-specific,   compelling
         circumstances.  The degree to which  circumstances  are  compelling
         further need to be addressed in the context of the public  interest
         in denying entry to those with a criminal past.

10. Judge Lingam refers to Gulshan and to Nagre in the  determination  [14-
    15].  Then, at [16], she states simply: "I go on  to  deal  with  their
    appeal (sic) under Article 8 of the ECHR."

11. At the hearing on 9 July 2014, we directed that both  parties  file  at
    the Tribunal and serve upon each other written  submissions  addressing
    this ground  of  appeal.   The  Upper  Tribunal  has  received  written
    submissions from Ms Revill; no submissions have been received from  the
    respondent.

12. The Court of Appeal in MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985 (a judgment delivered  on
    11 July 2014, two days after the Upper Tribunal in the  instant  appeal
    and before we received Ms  Revill's  submissions)  contains  a  helpful
    summary of the relevant authorities, in particular at [130-135]:
          1. The next case on this topic is MF(Nigeria)  v  SSHD.[141]  New
             paragraphs 398, 399, 399A and 399B of the IRs were  introduced
             in July 2012 and set out criteria by reference  to  which  the
             right to respect for a person's private and family life  under
             Article 8 was to be assessed in criminal deportation cases. In
             the Court of Appeal, Lord Dyson MR gave the  judgment  of  the
             court. The  court  held  that  the  new  rules  constituted  a
             "comprehensive code" of criteria by which to determine whether
             or not a "foreign criminal" who would otherwise be  liable  to
             deportation under the terms of section 32(4) of the UKBA  2009
             and section 3(5) of the 1971 Act might be permitted to  remain
             in the UK on Article 8 grounds.[142] The consequence  of  this
             conclusion is that any claim by a "foreign criminal" to remain
             in the UK on  Article  8  grounds  has  to  be  considered  in
             accordance with the new rules 398, 399 and 399A. This involves
             a "two stage" test: does the "foreign  criminal's"  case  come
             within rule 399 or 399A; if not, then does he fall within  the
             circumstances as set out in rule  398,  as  construed  by  the
             Court of Appeal.[143] The other point to  note  is  that  Lord
             Dyson MR specifically referred to the analysis of Lord Bingham
             at [17] of Huang and endorsed it.
          1. We did not specifically hear argument on whether the  new  MIR
             together with the Guidance constituted a "comprehensive code".
             But whether or  not  they  do  makes  no  difference,  on  the
             analysis of the Master of the Rolls in  MF(Nigeria).  This  is
             because, as he  said  at  [45],  in  any  event  it  would  be
             necessary to apply a "proportionality test" with regard to the
             "exceptional circumstances" guidance in order to be compatible
             with the Convention and in compliance with Huang at [20].[144]


          1. The last case  to  consider  under  this  heading  is  SSHD  v
             Shahzad.[145] It concerned a student who had  made  a  renewed
             application for leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
             (General) Student migrant under the Points  Based  System.  As
             such the IRs required that he demonstrate that he had  private
             financial support from a parent or legal guardian,  which  the
             applicant could not do. The FTT had, nonetheless, allowed  his
             appeal from the refusal of the SSHD's decision  not  to  grant
             leave to remain, doing so  on  Article  8  grounds.  The  SSHD
             appealed  to  the  UT  and  (effectively)   her   appeal   was
             allowed.[146] For present purposes the  important  conclusions
             of the UT are: (1) MF(Nigeria) did not  rule  that  all  other
             provisions of the new IRs constituted a "complete code" on how
             to consider Article 8 rights of applicants in relation to  the
             IR concerned in that particular case; (2) where an area of the
             Rules   does   contain   an   express   provision    requiring
             consideration  in  the  Article  8  context  of   "exceptional
             circumstances" and "other factors" it would constitute such  a
             "complete code"; (3) where an area of the IRs  does  not  have
             such an express mechanism, the approach in  Nagre[147]  should
             be followed: "ie.  after  applying  the  requirements  of  the
             Rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting
             leave to remain outside them is it  necessary  for  Article  8
             purposes to go on to consider  whether  there  are  compelling
             circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them".[148]
          1. What  is  the  upshot  of  all  these  decisions?  First,  the
             Secretary of State plainly is under a common law duty  not  to
             promulgate an IR that is  discriminatory,  manifestly  unjust,
             made in bad faith or involves "such oppressive  or  gratuitous
             interference with the rights of those subject to them as could
             find no justification in the minds of reasonable men". If  she
             does promulgate such an IR, it  can  be  struck  down  or  the
             offending part can be severed. Secondly, I think  that  Huang,
             Baiai, Quila and Bibi all support the proposition that  it  is
             the duty of the Secretary of State to formulate an IR in a way
             that means that even if it  does  interfere  with  a  relevant
             Convention right, it has to be capable of doing so in a manner
             which is not inherently disproportionate or inherently unfair.
             Otherwise  it  will  not  be  "rational",  or  it   could   be
             stigmatised as being "arbitrary" or objectionable",[149] or be
             characterised as being "arbitrary and  unjust".[150]  Thirdly,
             the analysis of the Supreme Court in Quila and of  this  Court
             in Bibi make it clear that if the relevant IR is challenged as
             being contrary to a Convention right,  then  the  Huang  tests
             have to be applied. The only difference, when it is an IR that
             is  being  challenged  in  principle,  as  opposed  to  a   an
             individual Article 8 decision, is that  the  "proportionality"
             questions have to be considered in principle. In that case, it
             seems to me the test must be whether, assuming the relevant IR
             constitutes an interference with a Convention  right,  the  IR
             and its application to particular cases, would  be  inherently
             disproportionate or unfair. Another way of putting the test is
             whether the IR is incapable of being proportionate and  so  is
             inherently unjustified.
          1. Where does that leave the statements made in the AM(Ethiopia),
             Pankina and Nagre line of cases, viz. that  the  Secretary  of
             State's duty is to protect an  immigrant's  Convention  rights
             whether or not that is done through the medium of the  IRs  so
             that "it follows that the Rules are not of themselves required
             to guarantee compliance with the [relevant  Article]".[151]  I
             think that the reconciliation  must  be  along  the  following
             lines: first, Laws LJ  was  dealing  with  the  principles  of
             construction of IRs. IRs are not  to  be  construed  upon  the
             presumption that  they  will  guarantee  compliance  with  the
             relevant Convention right. Secondly, therefore,  a  particular
             IR does not, in each  case,  have  to  result  in  a  person's
             Convention rights being "guaranteed". In a particular case, an
             IR may result in a person's Convention rights being interfered
             with in a manner which is not proportionate or justifiable  on
             the facts of that case. That will not make  the  IR  unlawful.
             But if the particular IR is one which, being  an  interference
             with the relevant Convention right, is also incapable of being
             applied in a manner which is proportionate or  justifiable  or
             is disproportionate in all (or nearly all cases), then  it  is
             unlawful.
          1.  Where  the  relevant  group  of  IRs,   upon   their   proper
             construction, provide a "complete code"  for  dealing  with  a
             person's Convention rights in the context of a  particular  IR
             or statutory provision,  such  as  in  the  case  of  "foreign
             criminals",[152] then the balancing exercise and the  way  the
             various factors are to be taken into account in an  individual
             case must be done  in  accordance  with  that  code,  although
             references to "exceptional circumstances"  in  the  code  will
             nonetheless entail a proportionality exercise.[153] But if the
             relevant group of IRs is not such a "complete code"  then  the
             proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by
             the Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.[154]

13. Ms Revill submits that S-EC1.4  provides  for  a  "comprehensive  code"
    similar to that provision in the Immigration Rules for  those  who  are
    liable to automatic deportation.  Indeed, we observe that S-EC1.4  does
    not simply provide (as the deportation provisions of paragraph 398  and
    399A provide) an "exceptional circumstances" provision but rather makes
    explicit the requirement for a decision maker to consider the ECHR.  In
    this context, we also note that the Court of  Appeal  in  MF  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192  made  clear  that  an  analysis  of  "exceptional
    circumstances" should produce the same result as the application to the
    same facts of Article 8 ECHR jurisprudence.

14. We agree with Ms Revill's submission.  The wording of the last part  of
    S-EC1.4 could not  be  more  clear.   It  provides  that  the  specific
    provisions of the Rule be applied followed then by an assessment as  to
    whether the Human Rights Convention or the Refugee Convention would  be
    breached by excluding an applicant and then for a consideration of  any
    "exceptional circumstances".  Following the ratio of MF, the last stage
    of that process would  appear  to  be  nugatory  given  that  a  proper
    assessment  of   an   applicant's   human   rights   and   "exceptional
    circumstances" should produce the same result.

15. In consequence, we find that ground 1 is without merit.  The respondent
    is suggesting that the judge erred because she failed to identify "case-
    specific compelling circumstances" which would entitle her to  consider
    the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  First, such an approach would be
    contrary to the  wording  of  the  Rule  itself  which  makes  specific
    reference to the Human Rights Convention.  Secondly, the requirement to
    pass through a  "compelling  circumstances"  threshold  was  considered
    unnecessary by the Court of Appeal in MM at [129]:

         Sales J's  decision  therefore  follows  the  logic  of  Laws  LJ's
         statements in [38]-[39] of AM(Ethiopia), analysed  above.  However,
         there is  a  difference  in  that  in  Nagre  the  new  rules  were
         themselves attempting to cover, generally, circumstances  where  an
         individual should be allowed to remain  in  the  UK  on  Article  8
         grounds; whereas in AM(Ethiopia) and in  the  present  appeals  the
         rule challenged stipulates a particular requirement that has to  be
         fulfilled before the applicant will be allowed to enter or  remain.
         The argument in each case is that it is that  specific  requirement
         that offends Article 8. Nagre does not add anything to the  debate,
         save for the statement that if a particular person is  outside  the
         rule  then  he  has  to  demonstrate,  as  a   preliminary   to   a
         consideration outside the rule, that he has an arguable  case  that
         there may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the
         rules.  I  cannot  see  much  utility  in  imposing  this  further,
         intermediary, test. If the applicant cannot satisfy the rule,  then
         there either is or there is not a further  Article  8  claim.  That
         will have to be determined by the relevant decision-maker.

16. Accordingly, we find that Judge Lingam  was  required  by  the  correct
    application of S-EC1.4 to consider the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Ground 2: Failure to Consider the Appellant's Precarious Immigration  Status
in the Evaluation of Proportionality

17. The respondent relies on Rodrigues Da Silva [2007] 44 EHRR 34 at [39]:

         The Court reiterates that in  the  context  of  both  positive  and
         negative obligations the State must strike a fair  balance  between
         the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a
         whole. However, in both contexts the State enjoys a certain  margin
         of appreciation. Moreover, Article 8 does  not  entail  a  general
         obligation for a State to respect immigrants' choice of the country
         of  their  residence  and  to  authorise  family  reunion  in   its
         territory. Nevertheless, in a case which concerns  family  life  as
         well as immigration, the extent of a State's obligations  to  admit
         to its territory relatives of  persons  residing  there  will  vary
         according to the particular circumstances of the  persons  involved
         and the general interest (see G�l v. Switzerland,  judgment  of  19
         February 1996, Reports 1996-I, pp. 174-75, � 38).  Factors  to  be
         taken into account in this context are the extent to  which  family
         life is effectively  ruptured,  the  extent  of  the  ties  in  the
         Contracting State, whether there are  insurmountable  obstacles  in
         the way of the family living in the country of  origin  of  one  or
         more of them, whether there  are  factors  of  immigration  control
         (e.g. a history of breaches of immigration law)  or  considerations
         of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Solomon v. the
         Netherlands  (dec.),  no.  44328/98,  5 September  2000).  Another
         important consideration  will  also  be  whether  family  life  was
         created at a time when the persons involved  were  aware  that  the
         immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence  of
         that family life within the host state would  from  the  outset  be
         precarious. The Court has previously held that where  this  is  the
         case it is likely only to be in the most exceptional  circumstances
         that the removal of the non-national family member will  constitute
         a violation of Article 8 (Mitchell v. the  United  Kingdom  (dec.),
         no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi and Others v. the  United
         Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999).

18. In the grounds of appeal, the respondent asserts that "the relationship
    between the sponsor and first appellant began when the sponsor  was  in
    the USA for a holiday.  It continued by means of visits by the  sponsor
    to the USA.  It must therefore have been well-known to all parties that
    the relationship could be frustrated by a lawful immigration  decision.
    Accordingly, the weight to be placed on the family life between sponsor
    and appellants is  diminished.   The  judge  failed  to  consider  this
    relevant consideration."

19. Mr Saunders, for the respondent, told us that the  respondent  did  not
    accept that the appellants had formed a family life with the sponsor in
    the United Kingdom.  That submission is at  odds  with  Judge  Lingam's
    statement at [23] that "it is not contested that the appellant and  the
    sponsor formed an Article 8 family life."  We  note  from  the  refusal
    notice that, for the purposes of  EC-P.1.1(d)  (Eligibility  for  entry
    clearance as a partner) the refusal notice records that  the  appellant
    "meets relationship requirements."  We note also that  the  application
    for permission to appeal contains no  suggestion  that  the  respondent
    took issue with the judge's statement that  both  parties  agreed  that
    family life existed.  We are satisfied that the  judge's  statement  is
    accurate.

20. The judge did not refer to  the  precise  circumstances  in  which  the
    relationship between the appellant and sponsor had developed.  However,
    we are satisfied that the judge's analysis of Article 8 ECHR represents
    a sufficient assessment of all the relevant circumstances.  We are  not
    persuaded that the judge's failure to refer in the determination  to  a
    circumstance of which she was patently aware constitutes  an  error  of
    law or  one  so  serious  that  it  would  justify  setting  aside  her
    determination.  Except for the one respect referred to in ground 2, the
    respondent does not otherwise  take  issue  in  the  grounds  with  the
    judge's Article 8 analysis.  In our opinion the judge was required by S-
    EC1.4 to consider Article 8 ECHR and she reached an outcome  which  was
    open to her on the evidence.  We accept that a differently  constituted
    Tribunal may have come to a different decision  but  that  is  not  the
    point.  In the circumstances, the respondent's appeal is dismissed.
