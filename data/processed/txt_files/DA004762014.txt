                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mr A Ollennu, Counsel, instructed by BWF Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lester who allowed the appeal of Miss Yankson
    against a decision to  refuse  to  revoke  a  deportation  order.   The
    determination was promulgated on 7 October 2014.

2.   The Secretary of State sought and was granted permission on  the  issue
    of whether the judge had correctly applied the test of unduly harsh  in
    the Immigration Rules and Section 117 of the 2002 Act.  Section 117C of
    the 2002 Act states where relevant  that  the  deportation  of  foreign
    criminals is in the public  interest,  the  more  serious  the  offence
    committed by a foreign criminal the greater is the public  interest  in
    deportation of the criminal, and there are then two exceptions that  if
    an appellant falls within one  of  those  exceptions  then  the  public
    interest does not require deportation.

3.   Miss Yankson's submissions before Judge Lester  were  that  she  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying  child  and  that
    the effect of her deportation on the child would be unduly  harsh.   It
    was accepted by the Secretary of State that she did have a genuine  and
    subsisting  parental relationship with a qualifying child.

4.   The issue was whether or not the judge had correctly applied  the  test
    of unduly harsh.

5.   In paragraph 45 of the determination Judge  Lester  made  a  number  of
    findings of fact which included, and these findings are not disputed by
    the Secretary of State, that she is in a relationship  with  a  British
    citizen and they have lived together since August  2013  and  it  is  a
    genuine and mutually supportive relationship; that she has no immediate
    family in Ghana and has no relationship with her extended family there;
    that the child who is a  British  citizen  attends  infant  school  and
    attends her local medical centre for treatment for  asthma  and  eczema
    and that the conclusions of the independent social  worker  state  that
    the child's best interests and welfare would be better safeguarded  and
    promoted in the UK rather than in Ghana.

6.   The judge then refers in  paragraph  48  of  the  determination  to  ZH
    (Tanzania) and says, as is well known, that although nationality is not
    a trump card, it is of particular  importance  in  assessing  the  best
    interests of any child.

7.   The judge then goes on in paragraph 49 to say

         "Bearing in mind also the provisions of section 117C(5) which again
         uses the words 'unduly harsh' in the  context,  I  note  that  [the
         child] has spent all her life with her mother, that she has already
         suffered the emotional distress of a father who abused  her  mother
         and then abandoned them. To lose another father figure, to whom she
         has become genuinely attached cannot be anything but  harmful.  The
         report of the independent social worker also dealt with whether her
         welfare would be best served  were  she  to  travel  to  Ghana  and
         concluded  that  that  would  have  a  'negative  impact'  on   her
         wellbeing. She would have no family members, no  accommodation,  no
         income, no access to medical care  and  would  have  her  education
         disrupted."

8.   In paragraph 50 the judge also makes  reference  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy document of November 2009 "Every Child Matters" and  the
    judge finds that the child's "best interests, her life chances would be
    jeopardised were she to go with her mother to Ghana and goes on to  say
    "In my view, the test of unjustifiable harshness  is  satisfied  taking
    into account all the circumstances of this appeal".

9.   As Mr Ollennu said, the question was whether  the  deportation  of  the
    mother which would be followed by the departure of the child, is unduly
    harsh for the child.  Clearly it is in the best interests of that child
    to be with her mother and it appears the judge has made a finding  that
    it would be in the best interests of  the  child  to  remain  with  her
    mother in the UK as opposed to with her mother in Ghana.

10.  That however is not the test.  The test is  not  simply  what  are  the
    best interests of the child.  It is whether taking  into  account  what
    those best interests are, it would be unduly harsh for her to leave the
    UK if her mother is deported.

11.  The Secretary of State was unable to find the  judicial  definition  of
    unduly harsh and relies  upon  a  dictionary  definition  for  "unduly"
    meaning "to an unwarranted degree" "inordinately" and "harsh"  to  mean
    "cruel  or  severe".   It  may  well  be  that  those  are   dictionary
    definitions but as Mr Ollennu says, the issue of whether  something  is
    unduly harsh or not is something that is apparent from  just  the  mere
    use of those words.

12.  That, however, means that it is not simply a question of whether it  is
    going to be harsh for the child to depart  with  her  mother  but  also
    whether in the context of all the factors it would be unduly harsh.  As
    Mr Ollennu says, it is necessary to look at all  the  matters.   It  is
    important to look whether or not the harshness and the  best  interests
    of the child are outweighed by other matters.

13.  One of the significant issues that the  judge  has  not  considered  is
    that Miss Yankson in her witness statement says in paragraph 22:

         "Somehow my employers told the police that I had lost  the  company
         about ï¿½70,000 which was untrue to the  best  of  my  knowledge.   I
         strongly believe that my employers came up with that allegation  as
         they faced being fined for employing an illegal immigrant."

14.  At paragraph 23 of her witness statement she goes on to say:

         "On 15 May 2009  I  attended  Southwark  Crown  Court  and  pleaded
         guilty.  I did not imply that I was guilty of the crime but  I  was
         compelled to enter a guilty plea  as  the  police  and  prison  had
         regular meetings with me regarding separation from my child  should
         the investigation go on and kept threatening me that if I am  found
         guilty I could  be  separated  from  my  child  for  a  long  time,
         something I did not want to happen. I therefore had no other choice
         than to plead guilty in order to get a lenient sentence."

15.  Mr Ollennu says that by  pleading  guilty  she  accepts  that  she  has
    committed the crime.  From her witness statement she clearly  does  not
    accept that she committed the crime.   The  judge  at  Southwark  Crown
    Court was not informed that this was  the  basis  upon  which  she  was
    pleading guilty.  Had he been so informed he would not have accepted  a
    plea of guilty. In his sentencing remarks he  says  "You  have  pleaded
    guilty fairly late to the most serious count of fraud."  The judge took
    into account that it must have been ghastly for her to  give  birth  in
    prison but against that he refers to her having applied for a job which
    was a position of high trust.

16.  He says:

         "It was a reasonably complex fraud and you did  it  carefully.  You
         were continuing to do it and  you  were  only  caught  because  you
         phoned in pretending you were a claimant when you  were  supposedly
         off sick."

    He then sentences her on that basis.

17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has not taken  this  into  account.   The
    judge has taken into account that she was convicted  and  sentenced  to
    eighteen months' imprisonment but does not take into account  the  fact
    that she denies having committed that offence.  Nor does the  judge  in
    paragraphs 49 and 50 take into account the whole  of  the  evidence  in
    assessing whether, given that it is in the child's  best  interests  to
    remain in the UK with her mother  and  to  avoid  any  disruption,  the
    offences committed by the mother and the  context  of  those  offences.
    Those are issues which have to  be  taken  into  account  in  assessing
    whether the subsequent departure of the child along with her mother  is
    unduly harsh in that context.

18. That failure by the judge to look at all of those matters  renders  the
    determination of the judge unsafe.  She has erred in law in failing  to
    properly assess the evidence before her in assessing whether or not  it
    would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK and I therefore
    set aside the decision.

19. So far as future conduct of the matter is concerned,  it  seems  to  me
    that this should go back to the First-tier for a proper  assessment  of
    whether it is unduly harsh for this child to depart  with  her  mother.
    The findings of fact set out in paragraph 45 remain but evidence as  to
    unduly harsh should be heard.

    CONCLUSION

    The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.


    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard with  the
    findings of fact set out in paragraph 45 retained.
