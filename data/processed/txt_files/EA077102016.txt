                        (no anonymity direction made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on the 20th June 1960.   On
    the 20th September 2017 his  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the grounds that pursuant to the decision  in  Sala  (EFMs:
    right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) there was no jurisdiction.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on  the
    29th January 2018. Judge Kebede indicated that the Upper  Tribunal  was
    minded, following the decision in Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 to find an error of law and  remit
    the matter for hearing de novo before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  Judge
    Kebede directed that this would be the final disposal of the matter  in
    the Upper Tribunal unless submissions were  received  to  the  contrary
    within 7 working days of his decision being sent.


 3. No such representations  having  been  received  I  therefore  set  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside  and  remit  the  matter  for
    hearing de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.
