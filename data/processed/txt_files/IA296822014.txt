                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge V A  Osborne
    of the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 28th October 2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FTT and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male citizen of Gambia born 24th August 1985.

 4. The Claimant married a Swedish citizen in the  United  Kingdom  on  2nd
    July 2008, and was granted a residence card on 6th November 2009.   The
    Claimant and his wife subsequently separated  and  divorce  proceedings
    were commenced, and a decree absolute of  divorce  pronounced  on  16th
    July 2014.

 5. The Appellant on  30th  May  2014  had  submitted  an  application  for
    permanent residence, which application was refused on 10th July 2014.

 6. The Appellant applied to the FTT  and  a  hearing  took  place  on  8th
    October 2014.  The FTT dismissed  the  appeal  with  reference  to  The
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the   2006
    regulations) but allowed the appeal pursuant to Article 8 of  the  1950
    European Convention on Human Rights (the 1950  Convention)  based  upon
    the private life that the Claimant had developed in the United Kingdom.

 7. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal contending, in summary, that the FTT had erred in allowing the
    appeal pursuant to Article 8.  It was contended in particular, that the
    judge had erred in concluding  that  the  Claimant's  presence  in  the
    United Kingdom was not precarious, and the  FTT  should  have  accorded
    little weight to  the  Claimant's  private  life  pursuant  to  section
    117B(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (the  2002
    Act) on the basis that his private life had been established  when  his
    immigration status in the United Kingdom was precarious.

 8. It was contended that the FTT had erred in considering Article  8,  and
    should have taken into account and attached considerable weight to  the
    fact that the Claimant could not satisfy the requirements of  the  2006
    regulations.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted on 15th December 2014.



The Upper Tribunal Hearing

10. Mrs Imamovic conceded that the FTT had erred in  law  in  allowing  the
    appeal pursuant to Article 8, in the  light  of  subsequent  case  law,
    Amirteymour and Others (EEA Appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  00466
    (IAC) and TY (Sri Lanka) [2015] EWCA Civ 1233.  It  was  accepted  that
    the decision of the FTT in allowing the appeal pursuant  to  Article  8
    could not stand and must be set aside.  As there had been no  challenge
    to the findings made by the FTT that the Claimant's  appeal  could  not
    succeed pursuant to the 2006 regulations that meant that the Claimant's
    appeal must be dismissed.

11. In view of the concession made on behalf of the  Claimant,  I  did  not
    need to hear from Mr Mills, who supplied the Tribunal  with  copies  of
    the case law referred to above.

My Conclusions and Reasons

12. The FTT materially erred in  law  in  allowing  the  Claimant's  appeal
    pursuant to Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.  The law has subsequently
    been clarified, and I set out below the headnote to Amirteymour;

         "Where no notice under section 120 of the 2002 Act has been  served
         and where no EEA decision to remove has  been  made,  an  Appellant
         cannot bring a human rights challenge to removal in an appeal under
         the EEA Regulations.  Neither the factual matrix nor the  reasoning
         in JM (Liberia) [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 has any application to appeals
         of this nature."

13. In this case, the decision made by the Secretary of State was to refuse
    the application for permanent  residence,  and  there  was  no  removal
    decision made.  No notice under section 120 of the 2002 Act was served.
     Therefore the FTT should not have considered Article 8.

14. The decision of the FTT must therefore be set aside  but  the  findings
    made that the Claimant's appeal could not succeed pursuant to the  2006
    regulations are preserved.  These findings are contained in  paragraphs
    31-40 of the FTT decision.  In very brief summary,  the  FTT  dismissed
    the appeal under the 2006 regulations, finding that  the  Claimant  had
    not proved that his former wife was, (paragraph 39)  "at  all  relevant
    times, a qualified person within the meaning of the Regulations."

15. I therefore re-make the decision by dismissing the  Claimant's  appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT contained an error of law  and  was  set  aside.   I
substitute a fresh decision.  The Claimant's appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

There has been no request for anonymity  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity order.
