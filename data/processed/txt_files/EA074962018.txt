For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

      1. The Appellant appeals against a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Rose promulgated on 18 July 2019 ("the Decision")  dismissing
         the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision  dated  24
         October 2018 refusing his application for a residence card  as  the
         family member (dependent adult child) of Ms Bella [G] who is an EEA
         (Irish)  national  exercising  Treaty  rights  in  the   UK   ("the
         Sponsor").  The Respondent refused the  application  on  the  basis
         that he was not satisfied that the Appellant is  dependent  on  the
         Sponsor.  The Appellant is aged twenty-three years and is  resident
         in Nigeria with his aunt.  He has been so  resident  since  he  was
         aged fourteen years.

      2. The Judge accepted the documentary and witness  evidence  that  the
         Sponsor sends regular remittances to the Appellant.   However,  she
         did not accept that the  evidence  showed  that  the  Appellant  is
         dependent on the Sponsor.  She therefore dismissed the appeal.

      3. The Appellant appeals on the basis that the Judge's  conclusion  is
         irrational when read with her  findings  about  what  the  evidence
         shows.  The Appellant points out that the amount  which  the  Judge
         found that the Sponsor remits to Nigeria is about three  times  the
         minimum wage in that country.

      4. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Povey
         on 30 September 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:

             "... 2.   The grounds assert that the Judge erred  in  law  in
             determining that the Appellant  was  not  dependent  upon  his
             mother (per Regulation 7 (1)(b) of the EEA Regulations 2016).

             3.  The Appellant lives in Nigeria with his aunt.  He  was  23
             at the date of the determination.   His  mother  is  an  Irish
             citizen.  He appealed against the Respondent's refusal of  his
             application for entry clearance.  The  Judge  found  that  the
             mother sent her son money transfers "sufficient to fund  [his]
             school fees and pay for his upkeep, living with  his  maternal
             aunt..."  (at  [16]).   However  the  Judge  found  that   the
             Appellant's mother did not fund  his  "accommodation  and  all
             ancillary expenses" because "she was not needed to" (at [16]).
              The Judge directed herself  correctly  on  the  law  (namely,
             whether the Appellant  needed  the  material  support  of  his
             mother, as an EU citizen, in order to meet his essential needs
             in Nigeria)  but  found  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
             establish such dependency on the evidence.  It was  a  finding
             open to the Judge.  The mother's witness statement (which  was
             accepted by the Judge at [16]) only referred to  "school  fees
             and upkeep" as the purpose  of  the  funds  she  provided  (at
             Paragraphs 14-17 and 19).  The  grounds  did  not  claim  that
             there was more detailed evidence before the Judge of how  such
             "upkeep"  manifested  itself.   The  Judge  was  entitled   to
             conclude  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  that   the
             mother's funds were  needed  to  meet  the  Appellant's  basic
             needs.  Additionally, she was implicitly entitled to find that
             schooling costs for a 23-year-old were not essential needs, as
             envisaged by the EEA Regulations.

             4.  For those  reasons,  the  grounds  disclosed  no  arguable
             errors of law and permission to appeal is refused."

      5. The Appellant renewed his application to this Tribunal.  Permission
         to appeal was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Sheridan  on  29
         October 2019 as follows:

             "... 2.   The issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether
             the appellant was dependent on his mother.  Given the  finding
             at paragraph 16  that  the  appellant's  mother  provided  the
             appellant with sufficient funds to pay for his school fees and
             upkeep,  the  judge  arguably  fell  into  error  by   finding
             dependency under regulation 7(b)(ii) of the Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2016 had not been established."

      6. The Respondent opposes the Appellant's  appeal.   He  submits  that
         Judge Rose directed  herself  appropriately.   In  particular,  the
         Respondent's Rule 24 statement says the following:

             "... 3.   At paragraph 16 of the determination the FTTJ  finds
             that the Appellant's Aunt in Nigeria provides  for  his  basic
             needs, ie accommodation, bills etc.  The Judge was entitled to
             find on the evidence submitted that the money provided by  his
             mother in the United Kingdom was  not  required  to  meet  the
             Appellant's essential needs in Nigeria in line with Lim v  The
             Entry Clearance Officer (Manila) [2013] EWCA Civ 1383"

      7. The appeal comes before me to determine whether there is a material
         error of law in the Decision  and  if  so  either  to  re-make  the
         decision or to remit to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

      8.  The  Judge's  findings  on  the  evidence  and  central  issue  of
         dependency appear at [14] to [16] of the Decision as follows:

             "14.       I  accept  the  evidence  of  the   appellant,   as
             summarised in his witness statement, and the evidence  of  Mrs
             [G], namely that Mrs [G]  regularly  sends  small  amounts  of
             money (i.e. �50) to  the  appellant  via  money  transfer  and
             periodically  sends  much  larger  sums  (i.e.  �500)  on   an
             occasional basis, for example via Henry Mordi  or  her  sister
             Rosemary Williams, both of whom gave evidence to  me  to  that
             effect.

             15. I have had the benefit of money transfer receipts  and  of
             annotated copies of Mrs [G]'s  TSB  bank  account  statements,
             which accord with that evidence.  I attach significant  weight
             to the money  transfer  receipts,  which  cover  a  period  of
             approximately  6  months.   I   considered   with   care   the
             annotations  on  the  bank  account  statements,  which   show
             fluctuating amounts being withdrawn, but where the annotations
             are at odds with the money transfer receipts  -  i.e.  showing
             much greater amounts being withdrawn or  multiple  withdrawals
             in a particular month - I prefer the  evidence  of  the  money
             transfer receipts.  Of course, I accept that there  have  been
             occasions when Mrs [G] has arranged, via relatives or friends,
             to have larger sums taken to  Nigeria.   However,  bearing  in
             mind Mrs [G]'s income from her work as a care worker,  I  find
             that  she  has  provided  the  appellant  with  no  more  than
             approximately �1,500 in any given year.

             16. I accept  that  that  has  been  sufficient  to  fund  the
             appellant's school fees and pay for his  upkeep,  living  with
             his maternal Aunt, as  described  in  Mrs  [G]'s  own  witness
             statement.  It does not, however, mean that  he  is  dependent
             upon his mother.  At best, I find that Mrs [G]  has  paid  for
             his upkeep but has not - because  she  has  not  needed  to  -
             funded his living  in  Nigeria,  i.e.  accommodation  and  all
             ancillary   expenses,   such   as   bills,    taxes    ...etc.
             Consequently, I do not find that the appellant has  proven  to
             the required standard that he is a dependant of his mother."

      9. The Judge thereafter correctly self-directed herself in  accordance
         with the judgment in Lim v The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Manila)
         [2013] EWCA Civ 1383 ("Lim") ([18]).  She also noted that the  fact
         that the Appellant was not self-sufficient as was the appellant  in
         Lim did not matter; the issue remained whether he was dependent  in
         that sense on the Sponsor or not ([17]).

     10. Mr Olawanle's submission was, in essence, that, having accepted the
         Appellant's evidence at [14] to [16] of the Decision,  the  Judge's
         finding that the Appellant was not dependent on the Sponsor at [16]
         was irrational.  That is the point which found  favour  with  Judge
         Sheridan when he granted permission.  Of course, irrationality is a
         high test.  The Appellant must show that the finding  made  by  the
         Judge as regards dependency is one which was not open to her on the
         evidence.

     11. I turn first to the evidence on which  the  Judge's  findings  were
         based.  I had before me a bundle of  documents  which  were  before
         Judge Rose to which I refer hereafter as [AB/xx].

     12. An issue arose in the course of the hearing  as  to  whether  Judge
         Rose had any statement from the  aunt  in  Nigeria  with  whom  the
         Appellant currently lives.  I had initially  understood  that  this
         was Ms Williams whose statement  appears  at  [AB/J-K]).   However,
         that is apparently an aunt who lives in the UK.  The aunt with whom
         the Appellant resides is  Mrs  Mary  Fufeyn.   I  was  told  by  Mr
         Olanwale that her signed statement was handed in at the  First-tier
         Tribunal.  Notwithstanding that assertion, there  was  no  copy  on
         either the Tribunal's file or the Home Office's file.  Nor  was  Mr
         Olanwale able to produce one from the papers which he had with him.
          I therefore allowed him a short adjournment  to  obtain  the  file
         copy.  That statement is  dated  11  May  2019  and  was  therefore
         available at the time of the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Olanwale said
         that he had given  three  copies  to  the  Tribunal  clerk  at  the
         hearing.  He did not think that Judge Rose had "probed" that aspect
         of the evidence and so it was not dealt with.   That  does  not  of
         course explain why it was not on either the Tribunal file  or  Home
         Office file.  Based on Mr Olanwale's assertion that  the  statement
         was handed in,  I  am  prepared  to  deal  with  the  case  on  the
         assumption that it was before Judge Rose even though not  mentioned
         in the Decision.  Given the  absence  of  the  statement  from  the
         Tribunal and Home Office files, however, the position is  far  from
         clear.  I also note that the Appellant has not taken any  point  in
         the grounds about  a  failure  of  the  Judge  to  deal  with  this
         statement.  For  reasons  which  follow,  the  statement  does  not
         advance the Appellant's case materially in any event.

     13. Dealing first with the statements in the  bundle,  the  Appellant's
         statement dated 11 May 2019 (unsigned) ([AB/D-F]  records  that  he
         has completed his secondary education and  is  now  due  to  go  to
         university ([8]).  As to money received from his  mother,  he  says
         this:

             "11.      My mother has always provided for my upkeep while  I
             was with her in Ireland and since I have been in Nigeria.  She
             is a single mother and responsible for our upbringing.

             12. She sends money regularly to me  through  our  family  and
             friends who travel to Nigeria from the UK.  She is  always  on
             the lookout for our family who are making trips to Nigeria  to
             help her take money  to  me.   This  is  because  it  is  more
             convenient and cheaper for her to send money to me  that  way.
             They also get more when  the  foreign  currency  is  exchanged
             locally than when it is  sent  through  money  agencies.   The
             family friends also use that opportunity to talk  to  me,  see
             how well I am doing and to take me out  for  shopping  and  to
             eat.  They definitely knew I missed my mother and sibling."

         The remainder of the statement details the money  sent  and  family
         circumstances.

     14. The Sponsor's statement also dated 11  May  2019  and  unsigned  at
         [AB/G-] is in very similar form.   She  says  the  following  about
         financial support:

             "9. I have always paid my son's school fees and  I  have  been
             involved in every aspect of his day to day life.

             ...

             11. I have always provided for my son's upkeep  while  he  was
             with me in Ireland and since he has been in Nigeria.  I  am  a
             single Mother and responsible for my children.

             12. I send money regularly to my son  through  my  family  and
             friends who travel to Nigeria from the UK.  I am always on the
             lookout for my family who are making trips to Nigeria to  help
             me take money to my son to save a little on commission.   This
             is because it is more convenient and cheaper for  me  to  send
             money to him this way."

         Again, the statement goes on to detail  payments  made  and  family
         circumstances.

     15.  I do not need to deal in any detail with  the  statements  of  the
         Appellant's aunt in the UK or the family friend, Mr Mordi.  I  note
         that the Appellant's aunt  in  the  UK  says  that  she  gives  the
         Appellant money when she visits Nigeria, takes  him  out  and  buys
         "many things for him".  Mr Mordi makes the point  in  very  similar
         terms to the Appellant  and  Sponsor  that  the  Sponsor  pays  the
         Appellant's school  fees  and  has  provided  for  the  Appellant's
         upkeep.  It is not clear how he would know but that  evidence  from
         the Appellant and Sponsor was accepted by the Judge in any event.

     16. Finally, I turn to Ms Fufeyn's statement which, unlike  the  others
         in the bundle, is signed.  Ms Fufeyn is of course  well  placed  to
         comment on what financial support is provided by  the  Sponsor  for
         the Appellant.  She is also well placed to deal with any  financial
         arrangements between her and the Sponsor as to  the  amounts  which
         are needed to provide for the Appellant.  Her statement  says  this
         about  the  Appellant's  living  arrangements  and  the   Sponsor's
         support:

             "5. The Appellant has been living with me under the same  roof
             since he came to Nigeria.

             6.  He  has  been  supported  financially  and  in  every  way
             possible by his mother who always sends money and  food  items
             through  friends  and  family  members  when  they   come   to
             Nigeria...

             7.  Of course when I cook [Luke] eats part of it and I support
             him in my own  little  way  but  his  school  fees  and  major
             maintenance is provided by her [sic] mother as I  suffer  from
             very poor health and I had to take early retirement  based  on
             ill health.

             ...

             11. I may not list all the people that  brought  money  to  me
             from the Appellant's mother over the years as I did not  write
             them down but I confirm in all honesty that Bella  has  always
             supported Luke more so when he [sic] is  the  mother  and  the
             father.  Luke has never had any input into  his  life  by  his
             father."

     17. The difficulty with  the  Appellant's  grounds  and  Mr  Olanwale's
         submissions is  the  failure  to  differentiate  between  financial
         remittances and a need to show that the Appellant is  dependent  on
         the Sponsor for "his basic needs".  As Judge Rose  points  out,  it
         does not matter that he may be dependent on another person,  namely
         Ms Fufeyn, for those needs.  As  such,  Mr  Olanwale's  attempt  to
         distinguish Lim on the facts does not assist.  As appears from  the
         CJEU and  other  authorities  cited  in  Lim,  the  Appellant  must
         establish on the evidence "the existence of  a  situation  of  real
         dependence" whereby the EEA national is shown to provide  "material
         support".  The position is succinctly made by the Court  of  Appeal
         at [25] of the judgment in Lim:

             "In my judgment, this makes it unambiguously clear that it  is
             not enough simply to show that financial support  is  in  fact
             provided by the EU citizen to the family  member.   There  are
             numerous  references  in  these  paragraphs  which  are   only
             consistent with a notion that the family member must need this
             support from his or her relatives in order to meet his or  her
             basic  needs.   For  example,  paragraph  20  refers  to   the
             existence of 'a situation of real dependence'  which  must  be
             established; paragraph 22 is even more striking and refers  to
             the need for material support in the state of  origin  of  the
             descendant ' who is not in a position to support himself'; and
             paragraph  24  requires  that  financial   support   must   be
             'necessary' for the putative dependant to support  himself  in
             the state of origin.  It is also pertinent  to  note  that  in
             paragraph 22, in  the  context  of  considering  the  Citizens
             Directive, the court specifically approved the test adopted in
             Jia at paragraph 37, namely that:

                  'The need for material support must exist in the State  of
                  origin of those relatives or the State whence they came at
                  the time when they apply to join the Community national.'"

             [my emphasis]

     18. Mr Olanwale submitted that on the evidence here, the test  is  met.
         However, the evidence from the witnesses  is  that  Ms  Fufeyn  has
         accommodated the Appellant for about  nine  years,  from  childhood
         into  adulthood.   She  herself  says  that  when  she  cooks,  the
         Appellant eats part of it.  She does not say how often that  is  or
         what happens when she does not cook.  She does not say that she  is
         paid any set amount by the Sponsor to cover the  Appellant's  board
         and lodging.  Indeed, the inference from her statement is that  she
         receives irregular payments when friends and family visit (although
         Judge Rose did accept that there were some regular money  transfers
         being made based on what the Appellant and the Sponsor said was the
         position).  The evidence does not show what happens  to  the  money
         sent to Nigeria, whether that goes to the Appellant for  incidental
         expenses or whether he gives some or all of it to his aunt to  feed
         and accommodate him.  Mr Olanwale did seek to suggest at one  point
         that the reference to "food items" at [6] of Ms Fufeyn's  statement
         meant that the Sponsor was providing food to the  Appellant.   That
         point has to be read in context.  Mr Olanwale agreed that  what  is
         there shown is that friends and family members take food items  out
         to Nigeria when they visit; most probably items of food  which  the
         Appellant grew to like from his childhood  spent  in  Ireland.   It
         cannot sensibly be suggested that  this  evidence  shows  that  the
         Sponsor regularly provides food to the Appellant.

     19. There is evidence of receipts for school fees during  the  academic
         sessions 2014-2017 at [AB/41-47].  However,  three  points  can  be
         made about those.  First, none of them are addressed to the Sponsor
         (although I accept that the Judge found that the Sponsor  had  paid
         those fees based on her and the Appellant's evidence).  Second,  it
         is not clear to me that school fees form  part  of  "basic  needs".
         They might of course whilst a child is attending primary  and  even
         secondary education.  However, this Appellant is now  aged  twenty-
         three years.  That  then  brings  me  on  to  the  third  and  most
         important point which is that  they  are  historic.   They  do  not
         reflect the current  position  which  is  that  the  Appellant  has
         completed his secondary education.  There is no evidence that he is
         currently in education for which the Sponsor pays.  As the Court of
         Appeal noted in Lim, the point in time at which dependency must  be
         assessed is when the application to join the EEA national  is  made
         or, more probably in the case of an appeal,  at  the  date  of  the
         hearing.  In either event,  there  is  nothing  to  show  that  the
         Appellant was dependent on the Sponsor for payment for school  fees
         at that point in time.

     20. Whilst I accept therefore that "upkeep" denotes  some  contribution
         to living needs, on the evidence here, the Judge  was  entitled  to
         find that dependency for those basic needs on the Sponsor  was  not
         established.  As I have already pointed out, the issue  for  me  is
         whether there is an error of law in the Decision which requires  me
         to consider whether the Judge was rationally entitled to reach  the
         conclusion which she did on the evidence.  Other Judges might  have
         reached a contrary view (although in my opinion,  the  evidence  of
         dependency is thin), but that is not the  issue  which  I  have  to
         decide.  I also note that it is of course open to the Appellant  to
         make a further application supported by further and better evidence
         as to the living arrangements in  Nigeria  and  who  pays  for  the
         Appellant's living needs.  However, for the foregoing reasons,  the
         Appellant has not shown that the Decision  contains  any  error  of
         law.

   Conclusion

     21. For the above reasons, the Appellant's grounds do not establish any
         material error of law.  I therefore uphold the Decision.



DECISION

I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Decision  of  Judge  Rose
promulgated on 18 July 2019 does not contain any material error  of  law.  I
therefore uphold the Decision.
