                       Judicial Review Decision Notice







   The Queen on the application of Priya Aka Bhartiben Girish Zalavadia &
                         Girish Rajahbhai Zaladavia
                                                                  Applicants

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective  representatives,  Mr  P  J  Lewis  of  Counsel,  instructed   by
Waterfords Solicitors, on behalf of the  Applicant  and  Miss  S  Idelbi  of
Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department,  on  behalf  of  the
Respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 28 January 2019.

      Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

 1. The First Applicant (hereinafter the "Applicant"), Ms Priya Zalavardia,
    is a national of India and the Second Applicant is her  husband,  whose
    application is entirely dependent on the Applicant's challenge.


 2. The Applicant was granted permission to apply for  Judicial  Review  of
    the decision of the Respondent dated 10 February 2018 which  maintained
    on Administrative  Review,  an  earlier  decision  of  9  January  2018
    refusing her application for indefinite leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant.


 3. The Applicant's immigration history is as follows.  She  first  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2010 as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant
    with leave to remain to 30 November 2012.  She then applied  for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Highly Skilled - General) Migrant, together with
    the Second Applicant as her dependent spouse, which  was  granted  with
    leave to remain to 31 January 2016.  The Applicant's child was added as
    a dependent with the same period of leave on 25 April 2013.


 4.  On 25 January 2016, the Applicant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, which  was  refused  on  1  March
    2017, a decision which was upheld on Administrative Review on 13  April
    2017.  The Applicant subsequently made a  further  application  on  the
    same basis on 1 May 2017, it is the refusal of that  application  which
    is the subject of challenge in these proceedings.

The relevant Immigration Rules, Guidance & law

 5. Paragraph 245CD of the Immigration rules, so far as relevant, sets  out
    the requirements for leave to remain as follows:

      "To qualify for indefinite leave to remain, a Tier 1 (General) Migrant
      must meet the requirements listed below.  If the applicant meets these
      requirements, indefinite leave to remain  will  be  granted.   If  the
      applicant does not meet these requirements, the  application  will  be
      refused.
      ...
      (b) The applicant must not fall for refusal under the general  grounds
      of refusal.
      (c) The applicant must have spent a continuous period specified in (d)
      lawfully in the UK, of which the most recent period must be spent with
      leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant ...
      (d) The continuous period in (c) is: ... (ii) 5 years
      ...
      (g) ... The applicant must have 80 points under paragraphs 7 to 34  of
      Appendix A."

 6. Paragraph 245AAA of the Immigration Rules, so far as relevant, provides
    as follows:

      "(a) References to a "continuous period of 5 years lawfully in the UK"
      means, subject to paragraph (e), residence in the UK for  an  unbroken
      period with valid leave, and for these  purposes  a  period  shall  be
      considered unbroken where:
          i) the applicant has not been absent from the UK  for  more  than
             180 days during any 12 month period in the continuous  period,
             except that any  absence  from  the  UK  for  the  purpose  of
             assisting with a national  or  international  humanitarian  or
             environmental crisis overseas shall not count towards the  180
             days, if the applicant provides evidence  that  this  was  the
             purpose of the absence(s) and that their Sponsor if there  was
             one, agreed to the absence(s) for that purpose;
         ii) the applicant has existing limited leave to  enter  or  remain
             upon their departure and return except that:
                 1) where that leave expired no more than 28 days prior to a
                    further application for entry-clearance which  was  made
                    before 24 November 2016 and subsequently  granted,  that
                    period and any period pending the  applicant's  re-entry
                    into the United Kingdom shall be disregarded; and
                 2) where, on or after 24 November 2016, the applicant makes
                    a further application for  entry  clearance  during  the
                    currency  of   continuing   limited   leave   which   is
                    subsequently granted, the period spent  outside  the  UK
                    with  continuing  leave  and  any  period  pending   the
                    applicant's re-entry into the United  Kingdom  shall  be
                    disregarded; and
        iii)  the  applicant  has  any  current   period   of   overstaying
             disregarded where paragraph 39E of these Rules applies; and
         iv) the applicant has any previous period of  overstaying  between
             periods of leave disregarded where:  the  further  application
             was made before 24 November 2016 and within  28  days  of  the
             expiry of leave; or the further application  was  made  on  or
             after 24 November  2016  and  paragraph  39E  of  these  Rules
             applied.
       ...
      (c) Except for periods where the applicant  had  leave  as  a  Tier  1
      (Investor)  Migrant,  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  a  Tier  1
      (Exceptional Talent) Migrant or a highly skilled migrant, any absences
      from the UK during the relevant qualifying period must have been for a
      purpose that is consistent with the applicant's basis  of  stay  here,
      including paid annual leave, or for serious or compelling reasons."


 7. Paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules sets out grounds on which  leave
    to remain and variation of leave to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom should normally be refused, which so far as  relevant  provides
    as follows:

      "(5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to  remain
      in  the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct  (including
      convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C)), character  or
      associations or the fact that  he  represents  a  threat  to  national
      security;"


 8. The Upper Tribunal and the Administrative  Court  have  considered  the
    issues raised in  cases  such  as  the  present  one  on  a  number  of
    occasions,  the  points  emerging  from  which  have   been   helpfully
    summarised in both R (on the application  of  Kayani)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (JR/9552/2017) and R (on the  application
    of Khan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Dishonesty,  tax
    return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  Where necessary  in
    response to particular submissions by the parties in the present  case,
    I return to the detail of points made within such decisions below.  For
    present purposes, it is helpful to recount the  guidance  given  by  Mr
    Justice Spencer in Khan as to the approach to decision-making  in  this
    sort of case, which is set out in paragraph 37 as follows:

       i) Where there has been a significant difference between  the  income
          claimed in a previous application for  leave  to  remain  and  the
          income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of  State  is  entitled  to
          draw an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
          dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR within  paragraph
          322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary  of
          State  to  draw  that  inference  where  there  is  no   plausible
          explanation for the discrepancy.

      ii) However, where an Applicant has presented evidence to  show  that,
          despite the prima facie inference, he was not  in  fact  dishonest
          but only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented with a
          fact-finding task: she must decide  whether  the  explanation  and
          evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace the  prima  facie
          inference of deceit/dishonesty.

     iii) In approaching that fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of  State
          should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is  the
          "balance of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
          deceitful and dishonest in relation to his tax  affairs  with  the
          consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a very
          serious finding with serious consequences.

      iv) However, for an applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant
          for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return  will  not
          be the end of the matter: far from it.   Thus,  the  Secretary  of
          State is entitled  to  take  into  account  that,  even  where  an
          accountant has made an error, the accountant will or  should  have
          asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and to
          have signed the tax return, and  furthermore  the  Applicant  will
          have known of his or her earnings and will have  expected  to  pay
          tax thereon.  If, realising this (or wilfully shutting his eyes to
          the situation),  the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
          reasonable time to remedy the situation, the  Secretary  of  State
          may be entitled to conclude either that the error was  not  simply
          the fault of the accountant  or,  alternatively,  the  Applicant's
          failure to remedy the situation itself justifies a conclusion that
          he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and  therefore  he
          should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration
          Rules.

       v) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a  tax
          return has been dishonest or merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of
          State is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
          direction  and,  in  her  decision,  justify  her  conclusion   by
          reference to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the
          reasoning  is  rational  and  the  evidence  has   been   properly
          considered, the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  cannot  be
          impugned.

      vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State  to
          consider in reaching her decision in these cases,  including  (but
          these are by no means exclusive):

         i. Whether the explanation for the  error  by  the  accountant  is
            plausible;

        ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist  (for
            example,  correspondence  between   the   Applicant   and   his
            accountant at the time of the tax return) has been disclosed or
            there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

       iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been  made
            because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should  have
            expected;

        iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to  remedy
            the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken  and  the
            explanation for any significant delay.

     vii) In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary of State is
          likely to want to see evidence which goes beyond  mere  assertion:
          for example, in a case such as the present where  the  explanation
          is that the Applicant was distracted by his concern for his  son's
          health, there should be documentary evidence about the matter.  If
          there is, then the Secretary of  State  would  need  to  weigh  up
          whether such concern genuinely excuses or explains the failure  to
          account for tax, or at least  displaces  the  inference  that  the
          Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest. The  Secretary  of  State,
          before making her decision, should call for the evidence which she
          considers ought to exist, and may draw an  unfavourable  inference
          from any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.

    viii) In her decision, the Secretary  of  State  should  articulate  her
          reasoning, setting out  the  matters  which  she  has  taken  into
          account in reaching her decision and stating the reasons  for  the
          decision she has reached.

 9. The basis for Judicial Review in cases such as these was made clear  by
    the Court of Appeal in the case of R (on the  application  of  Giri)  v
    Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  784.
    Essentially, a  challenge  can  be  brought  against  the  Respondent's
    decision only on public law grounds of Wednesbury unreasonableness.


Detailed factual background to the decision under challenge

10. At the time of  the  Respondent's  decision  on  9  January  2018,  the
    evidence from the Applicant, so far as relevant to  these  proceedings,
    included a letter from M Pattni & Company (accountants) dated  17  July
    2017; the Applicant's response to a questionnaire also  dated  17  July
    2017; and the Applicant's tax returns for the  financial  years  ending
    2012 to  2016  inclusive,  including  amended  returns  and  SA302  tax
    calculations from HMRC.


11. In the questionnaire completed by the Applicant, she  stated  that  her
    tax returns had been prepared and filed by an accountant on her behalf,
    on the basis of invoices, bank statements, payslips and  a  provisional
    expenses sheet and that she was unable to review her tax returns before
    they were filed for the years 2011/12 and  2012/13  so  relied  on  her
    accountant to do so.  The tax return for the year 2012/13  was  amended
    "as the overall income and net profit was  wrongly  stated".   This  is
    further explained in answer to another question in which the  Applicant
    stated the following:


      "a) in the  returns  for  2012/13  the  turnover  &  net  profit  were
      incorrectly stated that due to overlooking of invoices & there  is  an
      excess provision of expenses  which  were  not  incurred  and  wrongly
      accounted


      b) in July 2016, I was checking my tax file  &  discovered  that  some
      invoices were missing for the year 2012/13.  When I looked for them  I
      realised that I missed to provide them to my accountant initially.   I
      also found that I had submitted a provisional expenses sheet  for  the
      expenses which were actually not incurred.


      c) the turnover and the net profit was wrongly stated."

12. In  the  additional  information  section  of  the  questionnaire,  the
    Applicant stated that she had an emergency caesarean on 28 January 2013
    and for this reason was not able to  provide  her  accountant  with  an
    accurate invoice summary and expense  calculations  for  the  tax  year
    2011/12, so her accountant based the return on the information provided
    and filed it on the basis of a turnover of  �8975  and  net  profit  of
    �3350.  The Applicant again relied on her accountant to  file  her  tax
    return in January 2014 for the year 2012/13 because  she  was  away  in
    India from 17 to 29 January 2014.  For this tax year, the Applicant had
    overlooked some of the invoices and receipts and had overestimated  her
    expenses.  These errors were identified in July 2016 and rectified with
    an amended tax return in August 2016.


13. The accountant's letter dated 17 July 2017 confirmed that they had been
    responsible for the Applicant's  tax  affairs  since  2011/12  and  had
    amended the tax return for  the  year  2012/13  due  to  the  Applicant
    overlooking some of the income invoices and receipts for that year  and
    also some of the expenses excess provision required to be reversed.  It
    was  said  that  the  "error  was  due  to  submission  of   incomplete
    information and provisional expenses which were not actually incurred".
     A breakdown of the initial and revised figures was then given.


14. The Respondent refused the application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    on 9 January 2018 under paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules,  a
    general ground of refusal  and  also  under  paragraph  245CD(b),  (c),
    (d)(ii) and (g) with reference to  paragraph  245AAA(c)  and  paragraph
    19(i) and (j) of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.


15. The decision letter begins with reference to a significant  discrepancy
    between earnings declared to the Respondent  for  the  purposes  of  an
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant made on 9
    November 2012, in which earnings from self-employment for the period  1
    November 2011 to 31 October 2012 were claimed in the  sum  of  �35,180.
    However, in the relevant tax years,  self-employed  earnings  of  �3350
    were declared for the  year  2011/12  and  �18,563  for  the  tax  year
    2012/13; albeit the latter was later amended on 3 August 2016  to  show
    earnings of �31,980.  There was  an  initial  discrepancy  between  the
    declarations of �13,417.


16. The Respondent  considered  responses  given  by  the  Appellant  in  a
    questionnaire about her tax affairs and evidence submitted  by  her  in
    relation to the same  and  noted  that  it  was  not  credible  that  a
    professional accountant would make such a fundamental  mistake  in  the
    tax declaration to HMRC and that in any event it  was  the  Applicant's
    responsibility to ensure correct declarations were made  at  the  time.
    The Applicant's explanations given for the need to amend her tax return
    were not accepted.  The decision letter then concludes as follows:

      "In view of the clear discrepancies between the  above  earnings  that
      you have declared to HMRC and the earnings you had  declared  to  UKVI
      for your previous immigration application we are  not  satisfied  that
      you have been able to credibly account for why the  earnings  declared
      to HMRC are significantly less than the earnings you declared in  your
      previous Tier 1 (General) application.


      Had you declared earnings in your Tier 1 (General)  application  of  9
      November 2012 which were consistent with your initial declarations  to
      HMRC,  you  would  not  have  scored  sufficient  points   under   the
      Immigration Rules for leave to remain to be granted.


      We are satisfied that, based on your actions  in  declaring  different
      amounts of income to HRC and UKVI, you have either misrepresented your
      earnings to HMRC in order to reduce your  tax  liability  or  provided
      false information about your earnings UKVI in order to obtain leave to
      remain, or both."


17. The Respondent, in view of  the  above,  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Applicant's  claimed  self-employed  earnings  were  genuine,   thereby
    refusing the application  under  paragraph  245CD(b)  and  (g)  of  the
    Immigration Rules with reference to paragraph 19(i) and (j) of Appendix
    A.  On the same  factual  basis,  having  considered  the  exercise  of
    discretion, the application was also refused under paragraph 322(5)  of
    the Immigration Rules as the Applicant's character and conduct made  it
    undesirable to grant her further leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


18. The Respondent also refused the application on  the  grounds  that  the
    Applicant was absent from the United Kingdom for a total  of  150  days
    from 19 May 2013 to 17 October 2013  and  the  reason  given  for  this
    absence, postnatal care from the Applicant's parents in India, was  not
    considered to be  an  extreme  circumstance.   Due  to  the  length  of
    absence,  discretion  would  not  be  applied.   The  application   was
    therefore further refused under paragraph 245CD(c) and (d)(ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules with reference to paragraph 245AAA(c) of the same.


19. The Applicant sought Administrative Review of the refusal  decision  on
    23 January  2018  in  which  she  stated  that  her  tax  returns  were
    "incorrectly filed for year 2012/13 she was depending on her accountant
    for the same" as at the time the  tax  returns  were  due  she  was  in
    hospital for an emergency caesarean, due to which she had forgotten  to
    submit details of all  of  the  invoices  which  were  required  to  be
    included in her return.  In  relation  to  tax  returns  for  the  year
    2012/13, the Applicant stated that she was attending a  family  wedding
    in India from 17 to 29 January 2014 and depended on her  accountant  to
    file her tax return and did not at the time review in  any  detail  the
    filing, relying on the accountant and paying tax that she was told  she
    was due.  The explanation for realisation of the error was repeated  in
    the same form as it had been given previously and overall the Applicant
    contended that she had given an entirely plausible explanation for  the
    apparent discrepancies and all of her  taxes  were  now  settled.   She
    added the following:


      "Subsequent  to  her  application  refusal  applicant  approached  her
      accountant  who  have  admitted  and  accepted   their   mistake   for
      overlooking the details and for not contacting the  applicant  at  the
      time   of   above   tax   returns   submissions   for   the    missing
      information/discrepancies  in  her  income  figures  and  have   filed
      applicant's tax returns incorrectly on both occasions.  It  is  to  be
      noted that same accountants issued the applicant income certificate at
      time of her Tier 1 General application of 9  November  2012  and  were
      fully aware of income and expenses applicant had claimed at  the  time
      of her above application."

20. The Applicant sought to rely  on  a  letter  from  her  accountants  in
    support of this.  Further explanations  and  supporting  evidence  were
    also given in relation to the  Applicant's  absences  from  the  United
    Kingdom.

21.  On  10  February  2018,  the  Respondent  refused  the   request   for
    Administrative Review and maintained  the  decision,  albeit  with  the
    correction of the date of decision.  In relation to the  points  raised
    by the Applicant on the general  grounds  of  refusal,  the  Respondent
    stated as follows:

      "In your administrative review you state that on  3  August  2016  you
      amended and submitted 2012/13 return with the income  rectified.   You
      said that your accountant, who you were dependent on at the time,  did
      not review any details and that  the  accountant  has  accepted  their
      mistake overlooking the details.  However, having entered the  UK  and
      decided to engage in self-employment  it  is  your  responsibility  to
      maintain accurate records of your finances  and  tax  liabilities  and
      ensure any earnings are accounted for and declared in line with the UK
      law  and  HMRC  regulations.   The  ultimate  responsibility  for  the
      requirements lies with  you  and  not  your  accountant,  as  you  are
      responsible for ensuring that when tax returns are submitted  to  HMRC
      the details within are correct.  It is additionally noted  that  there
      would be clear benefit to yourself either by under-reporting your self
      employed earnings to HMRC  and  thereby  reducing  your  personal  tax
      liability, or by over-inflating self employed  earnings  in  order  to
      meet the threshold for points required as a Tier 1 (General)  migrant.
      Upon review we are satisfied the  original  caseworker  assessed  your
      application correctly and we have maintained the original decision.


      You argue that you have  provided  a  plausible  explanation  for  the
      discrepancies and you have ensured that all the  due  taxes  have  now
      been settled.  However, whilst HMRC accept amendments  backdated,  the
      Secretary of State remains concerned with the initial discrepancies in
      your declarations, compared with the information  submitted  to  UKVI.
      Although you have provided explanations regarding  the  discrepancies,
      these have not been accepted by the original caseworker.  On review of
      the decision, we have concluded that is correct. ..."


Grounds of challenge

22. The Applicant's challenge  to  the  Respondent's  decision  is  on  two
    primary grounds, first, challenging the refusal under paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules on the basis that the Respondent has failed to
    determine whether  the  Applicant  was  dishonest  rather  than  merely
    careless in relation to her tax return  and  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons as to why her explanation has not been accepted.  Secondly, the
    Applicant challenges the Respondent's decision to  refuse  to  exercise
    discretion in relation to her absences from the United Kingdom  on  the
    basis that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules and inadequate reasons were given for the refusal on this ground.



23. In relation to  the  first  ground  of  challenge,  Mr  Lewis  for  the
    Applicant submitted that an adequate and plausible explanation had been
    given by the Applicant as to the error in her tax return for  the  year
    2012/13 and that the error had been rectified.  The Applicant had taken
    responsibility for her failure  to  give  her  accountant  all  of  the
    invoices and to have overestimated her expenses; neither of  which  had
    been raised by the  accountant  as  an  issue.   To  this  extent,  the
    Applicant had admitted she had been careless  in  respect  of  her  tax
    returns, but not dishonest.  The  Respondent  had  not  given  adequate
    reasons  for  rejecting  her  explanation.   The  statement   that   an
    accountant would not make such a mistake and  it  was  the  Applicant's
    responsibility to ensure her tax returns may be correct  but  does  not
    provide an adequate response to her explanation, which did not seek  to
    entirely place the blame on her accountant.  The Administrative  Review
    decision also fails  to  engage  with  the  explanation  given  by  the
    Applicant.  Overall, it was submitted that a conclusion  of  dishonesty
    may have been open to the Respondent, but so was  the  conclusion  that
    she had been merely careless  in  respect  of  her  tax  return  and  a
    plausible explanation in support of the latter  had  been  given.   The
    Respondent simply failed to properly engage  with  the  explanation  to
    determine this question and only if the Applicant  had  been  dishonest
    would the refusal based on paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules be
    sustainable.

24. In the Respondent's Detailed Grounds of Defence, it was suggested  that
    the Applicant should have provided  copies  of  the  invoices  and  the
    provisional expenses sheets  to  support  her  explanation.   Mr  Lewis
    submitted that such documentation would serve no useful  purpose  given
    it could not shed any light on whether the  explanation  that  she  had
    simply omitted to give all of the correct documents to  her  accountant
    was as a result of carelessness  or  dishonesty.   In  any  event,  the
    Applicant  has  now  provided  details  of  the  missing  invoices  and
    provisional expenses claimed as well  as  a  further  letter  from  her
    accountants giving more detail as to the situation.


25. In relation to the second ground of appeal, Mr Lewis submitted that the
    decision in relation to  absences  from  the  United  Kingdom  was  not
    consistent  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  245AAA(c)  of   the
    Immigration Rules given that  there  is  no  requirement  for  "extreme
    circumstances" as suggested in the Respondent's decision, nor is  there
    any need for the exercise  of  discretion  given  that  the  length  of
    absence amounted to 150 days which was  within  the  outside  limit  of
    absences of 180 days.  The only possible issue that could  have  arisen
    under the Immigration Rules is whether  the  absences  were  consistent
    with the Applicant's basis of stay in the United  Kingdom,  or  whether
    they were for serious  and  compelling  reasons.   The  Respondent  has
    failed to engage at all with these points.  Further, the fact that  the
    Applicant had, during a period of  maternity  leave,  stayed  with  her
    parents for postnatal support in India, is not  inconsistent  with  the
    purposes of her stay in the United Kingdom pursuant to a Tier  1  visa.
    The use of a period of maternity leave is no different  whether  it  is
    spent in the United Kingdom or  with  family  abroad,  nor  is  it  any
    different to a period of leave for a holiday.


26. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Idelbi  reiterated  that  the  decision
    letter  and  the  reasons  contained   therein,   including   that   on
    Administrative Review for the refusal under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules in particular, must be read in  the  context  of  the
    information and evidence that was actually before the Respondent at the
    time of decision.


27. This was the Applicant's second application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, the first refusal being made on 1
    March 2017, which itself followed an interview with the Applicant on  8
    November 2016.  In the course of that application,  the  Applicant  had
    already been asked about her self-employed earnings and tax returns  in
    relation to the tax years 2011/12 and 2012/13 and by which time she was
    already aware that she had been required to amend her tax return, which
    was done on 3 August 2016.


28. At the time of the decision there had  been  three  themes  within  the
    Applicant's explanation for  the  discrepancy  in  the  declaration  of
    earnings  between  the  Respondent  and  HMRC.   In  her  questionnaire
    response, she had stated that there was an error in the tax return  for
    the year 2012/13 because  certain  invoices  had  been  overlooked  and
    certain expenses overestimated, although there was no  explanation  for
    the delay in identifying those errors until 2016 or why the errors came
    to light at that particular  time.   In  the  course  of  her  previous
    explanation, as well as in the application  for  Administrative  Review
    leading to the decision under challenge in  this  case,  the  Applicant
    also stated that she had been entirely dependent upon her accountant in
    filing the tax returns for  the  years  2011/12  and  2012/13,  leaving
    matters entirely in their hands and suggesting that it was their error,
    later enforced by the accountants themselves suggesting that  they  had
    not cross referred or checked information between that  given  to  them
    for the income statement for the purposes of the application for  leave
    to remain and the later tax return.  Finally, the Applicant had  relied
    upon the birth of her child in January 2013 and being absent  from  the
    United Kingdom in January  2014  as  reasons  why  documents  had  been
    overlooked and why she relied specifically on  the  accountants.   That
    explanation however does not give any reason why the tax return was not
    checked on return to the United Kingdom.  Overall it was  submitted  on
    behalf of the Respondent that the Applicant had not given a  clear  and
    consistent explanation as to the discrepancy, which itself shows a lack
    of credibility.


29. The Applicant had not at any time given any detailed explanation as  to
    how or why the error in her tax return was  identified  in  July  2016,
    which did not coincide with any deadline for a tax return  and  was  in
    proximity at least to her first application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, even if not the present application.  It was  suggested  by  Ms
    Idelbi that the Applicant had essentially provided no more than a  bare
    assertion of how the error was identified and entirely skirted over the
    detail of it.  For example, there is no explanation as to  how  missing
    documents from the Applicant's own file led  to  the  realisation  that
    these had not been submitted several years previously to her accountant
    or that they had worked from only a provisional expenses list and not a
    final one.  The applicant was of course aware of the  declarations  she
    had made to the Respondent in relation to her earnings and there was no
    reason why she did not, at the  relevant  time,  notice  a  substantial
    difference in the earnings, or even the claimed  expenses,  filed  with
    her tax return.  The amended return  came  only  a  significant  period
    after the original return was filed in January 2014.


30. Further, it would have been  obvious  to  the  Applicant  that  a  much
    smaller amount of tax was due than should have  been  expected  shortly
    after the tax return had been filed.  This is even more so  given  that
    the  Applicant's  claimed  self-employment  included  bookkeeping   and
    accounting.


31. The Applicant now relies on a number of documents which were not before
    the Respondent, showing a schedule of invoices  omitted  and  different
    expense figures.  However,  Ms  Idelbi  submitted  that  the  documents
    postdate the decision under challenge and therefore cannot be  used  to
    undermine it in any way.  Further, in any event they do not  assist  or
    support the Applicant's explanation given at  the  time,  but  in  fact
    undermine it as they rely on making up the shortfall in declaration  to
    HMRC by reference to invoices which  postdate  the  income  period  for
    earnings declared to the  Respondent.   If  anything,  this  highlights
    further sums undeclared to HMRC for which no explanation has been given
    at all.


32. Finally, the authorities in cases such as the  present  one  are  clear
    that the fact that HMRC has not imposed a penalty on an individual  for
    a late amended tax return is irrelevant.  The Respondent and HMRC  have
    different objectives and different assessment in different fields  such
    that no comparative analysis of the respective responses is possible.


33. In these circumstances, the level of detail of reasoning given  in  the
    Respondent's decision  letter  and  Administrative  Review  letter  was
    submitted to be commensurate with the level  of  detail  given  by  the
    Applicant in her  explanation  for  the  circumstances.   The  decision
    letter sets out the Applicant's explanation and notes the  letter  from
    her accountant but rejects it.  The significant discrepancies permit an
    inference  of  dishonesty  which  is  not  dispelled  by  the   limited
    explanation given.  This is further  confirmed  in  the  Administrative
    Review  decision  where  the  claimed  plausible  explanation  for  the
    discrepancy from the Applicant  was  expressly  rejected  and  emphasis
    placed  on  the  fact  that  there  was  such  a  significant   initial
    discrepancy between earnings declarations.  Ms Idelbi submitted that in
    all of the circumstances and in accordance with the guidance  given  in
    Khan, the Respondent reached a rational conclusion.


34. In relation to the second ground of challenge, Ms Idelbi submitted that
    the Applicant had left the United Kingdom for postnatal care  when  her
    child was five months old and there  was  little,  if  any,  supporting
    information about this at  the  time  of  the  decision,  such  further
    evidence and explanation only  being  submitted  much  later.   It  was
    submitted that in these circumstances, it was a rational conclusion for
    the Respondent to find that the lengthy absence  was  not  commensurate
    with the Applicant's leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  Ms  Idelbi
    had no instructions on whether a person remaining in the United Kingdom
    but not working, for maternity leave reasons, whilst here as a  Tier  1
    Migrant would be inconsistent with the basis of stay, but submitted  in
    the present case that the issue was one of demonstrating commitment  to
    the United Kingdom rather than work.


 Discussion

35. There is no real dispute between the parties in this  case  as  to  the
    applicable legal principles on the application of paragraph  322(5)  of
    the Immigration Rules and  in  particular  as  to  the  requirement  of
    dishonesty or deception as opposed to mere carelessness or  mistake  by
    an  applicant  in  relation  to  their  tax  affairs.   This  has  been
    consistently set out by the Upper Tribunal in  cases  where  there  has
    been a significant discrepancy between  earnings  declarations  to  the
    Respondent and to HMRC for the same financial period.


36. The issues in the first ground of challenge are whether the  Respondent
    properly turned his mind to the question of whether the  Applicant  was
    careless or dishonest in declaring different earnings to the Respondent
    for the purposes of an application for leave to remain and to HMRC  for
    the purposes of tax; and whether  on  the  evidence  available  it  was
    rational for the Respondent to find that the Applicant was dishonest in
    this case, and if so, whether adequate reasons were given  for  such  a
    conclusion.


37. It is clear from the guidance given in Khan and in many  of  the  other
    authorities from the Upper Tribunal in relation to cases such as these,
    that the Respondent is entitled to draw an inference of  dishonesty  or
    deception by an  applicant  by  virtue  of  a  significant  discrepancy
    between earnings declared to the Respondent and to HMRC  for  the  same
    financial period.  In the present case, the decision letter  starts  by
    setting out the significant discrepancy  in  the  initial  declarations
    made which was over �13,000 and, on any view,  rationally  permits  the
    inference of the use of dishonesty and/or deception by  the  Respondent
    to be drawn and for paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules  to  be
    engaged.


38. The Respondent then lists the evidence before him from the Applicant in
    relation to earnings and sets out in detail the  Applicant's  responses
    to the questionnaire given to her, including that certain documents had
    been overlooked and not sent  to  her  accountant,  together  with  the
    express reliance on the accountant for filing  tax  returns  correctly.
    The Respondent rejects the explanation, which lacks detail and  on  its
    face amounts to little more than a bare assertion, on the basis that it
    is not credible that  a  professional  accountant  would  make  such  a
    fundamental mistake in the tax return and that in any event it  is  the
    Applicant's responsibility to ensure accurate records are maintained of
    finances and tax liabilities and to ensure the correct  declaration  of
    earnings are made to HMRC at the time.  The  explanations  provided  in
    the Applicant's questionnaire are expressly rejected.   The  Respondent
    then  reiterates  the  significant  discrepancy  and  the   Applicant's
    dishonest motive in declaring different income to the Respondent and to
    HMRC, noting in particular that leave to remain  would  not  have  been
    granted previously on the basis of earnings declared to HMRC.


39. The Respondent has clearly turned his mind to the question  of  whether
    there was an honest mistake or whether the Applicant was  dishonest  or
    used deception, drawing the  initial  inference  from  the  significant
    discrepancy,  rejecting  the  limited  explanation  put   forward   and
    identifying the dishonest motive.  Reading the  decision  letter  as  a
    whole and against the background of the guidance given in cases such as
    Khan and what has been described as the evidential  pendulum  in  cases
    involving allegations of dishonesty or deception, as described in  Shen
    (Paper Appeals: Proving Dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC) and  approved
    in Muhandiramge (Section S-LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT 675 (IAC)  and  SM  and
    Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS) -  Evidence  -
    Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC), that process has self-evidently
    been followed.




40. The Applicant's explanation lacked any significant detail  as  to  what
    invoices  had  been  omitted,  how  expenses  were   so   significantly
    overestimated and contained no explanation whatsoever as to  why,  even
    if unable to check the tax returns at the time of submission in January
    2013 or January 2014, that these were not checked as soon  as  possible
    thereafter and no plausible explanation given as to how the errors were
    suddenly identified many years later.  The  explanation  lacks  greater
    credibility when one takes into account that  the  Applicant  describes
    her self-employed work as including accounting  and  bookkeeping.   The
    Applicant has also attempted to blame her accountant  for  not  somehow
    recognising that full information had not been disclosed  to  them  for
    the purposes of tax returns.   In  this  context,  the  Respondent  was
    rational and reasonable in rejecting  the  explanations  given  by  the
    Applicant in accordance with the guidance in Khan and in  circumstances
    where a  little  more  than  a  bare  assertion  had  been  made.   The
    Respondent gave brief but adequate and  rational  reasons  for  finding
    that the Applicant had been dishonest or deceitful  and  for  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules to be applied.


41. The Respondent's conclusion is further reinforced by the post  decision
    evidence  which  the  Applicant  has  submitted  in  response  to   the
    Respondent's Detailed Grounds of Defence that she could and should have
    submitted much earlier to substantiate her explanation for the error at
    the time, but which in fact wholly undermine  the  credibility  of  the
    explanation given at the time.


42. In a document  produced  for  the  purposes  of  this  application  for
    Judicial Review, which was not before the Respondent at the date of the
    original decision nor the Administrative Review, the Applicant has  set
    out in a spreadsheet her self-employed income for the  period  6  April
    2012 to 5 April 2013.  This document identifies additional  income  not
    included in the original tax return from seven invoices  dated  between
    16 November 2012 and 8 March 2013, totalling  gross  income  of  �5825.
    This, together with the overestimation of expenses, is said to  explain
    the shortfall in earnings declaration to HMRC for the tax year 2012/13.
     The income declared as amended, together with earnings declared in the
    tax year 2011/12, equates to exactly the same earnings declared to  the
    Respondent in November 2012, although that related to a shorter period.


43. The difficulty for the Applicant is that this further information in no
    way supports her explanation given to the Respondent that invoices  had
    been overlooked and  not  provided  to  the  accountant  to  explain  a
    discrepancy in earnings declared to the Respondent  for  the  period  1
    November 2011 to 31 October 2012 and the  tax  returns  for  the  years
    2011/12 and  2012/13.   The  additional  invoices  said  to  have  been
    overlooked, all postdate the income period for earnings declared to the
    Respondent.  On the Applicant's own evidence before the Upper Tribunal,
    leaving aside the amendment to deductible  expenses,  there  remains  a
    discrepancy  between  the  self-employed  earnings  declared   to   the
    Respondent in the application dated November 2012 and those declared to
    HMRC for the relevant tax years of 2011/12 and 2012/13.


44. This  evidence  also  undermines  the  letters  relied  upon  from  the
    Applicant's accountants, who admit  a  mistake  in  not  comparing  the
    information they had about the Applicant's income  when  preparing  her
    income statement accompanying her application  to  the  Respondent  for
    leave to remain, with the information provided for the purpose  of  the
    tax return.  Any such failure to compare the information would not have
    identified the discrepancy nor the reason for  it  as  claimed  by  the
    Applicant, as the invoices that were provided for the purposes  of  the
    tax return, in accordance with the schedule now provided by  her,  were
    entirely consistent with those relied upon for the income statement  in
    November 2012.  The only missing invoices  post-dated  the  period  for
    that statement.


45. For all of these  reasons,  the  application  for  Judicial  Review  is
    dismissed on the first ground of challenge.


46. It is  not  strictly  necessary  to  determine  the  second  ground  of
    challenge in relation to absences from the United  Kingdom  given  that
    the Applicant has failed in her first ground of challenge and therefore
    the outcome of her application for leave to  remain  and  for  Judicial
    Review must be that the application fails.  However,  for  completeness
    the second ground of challenge is made  out,  albeit  for  the  reasons
    given above, the application must be dismissed.


47. The applicant was absent from the United Kingdom for a  period  of  150
    days such that the only issue  was  as  to  whether  she  had  spent  a
    continuous period of five years lawfully in the UK for the purposes  of
    paragraph 245CD(c) and  (d)  together  with  paragraph  245AAA  of  the
    Immigration Rules and whether those absences were for a purpose that is
    consistent with the Applicant's basis of stay in  the  United  Kingdom,
    including paid annual leave,  or  for  serious  or  compelling  reasons
    (paragraph 245AAA(c)).  The length of the absence is within the cap  of
    180 days given in paragraph 245AAA(a)(i) of the Immigration  Rules  and
    therefore the Respondent cannot justify  a  refusal  on  the  basis  of
    length of absence alone.


48. In the decision letter, the Respondent has  entirely  failed  to  grasp
    that the only issue in terms of absence that needed  to  be  determined
    was the consistency of absence with the purpose of leave.  The decision
    letter proceeded on  entirely  the  wrong  premise  when  refusing  the
    application on the basis that first, the reason given for  absence  was
    not an extreme circumstance and secondly, due to the  sheer  number  of
    days of absence, no discretion was applied.  The decision  required  to
    be made on this aspect of the application was not a discretionary  one,
    but one  to  be  made  in  accordance  with  paragraph  245AAA  of  the
    Immigration Rules which the Respondent failed to do in this case.


49. The Respondent has suggested in the course of  these  proceedings  that
    the Applicant's absence from the United Kingdom was not consistent with
    her leave to remain as a Tier 1 migrant given her choice to  take  part
    of her maternity leave in India rather than the United  Kingdom.   This
    is said to raise an issue of her  commitment  to  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, this was not a reason given in the  decision  under  challenge
    nor  in  the  Administrative  Review  and  is  in  any   event   highly
    questionable given the factual circumstances and that  whether  or  not
    her time was spent in the United Kingdom or in India during the  period
    of maternity leave, the  Applicant  would  not  be  working,  which  is
    clearly the primary purpose of her basis of stay in the United Kingdom.
     He could not reasonably or rationally suggest that taking the standard
    period of maternity leave was not consistent with the purpose of stay.

Order


I order, therefore, that the judicial review application be dismissed.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

The Applicant sought permission to appeal on the basis that  the  Respondent
had given insufficient reasons for a finding of dishonest against her,  such
that  ground  1  of  this  application  should  have  succeeded.   I  refuse
permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because  there  is  no  arguable
error of law contained in my decision on ground 1.


 Costs

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
