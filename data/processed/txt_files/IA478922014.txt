For the appellant:     Ms V Sharkey
For the respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Grace Titilola Badru Gansallo, date of birth 5.1.57,  is
    a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Green promulgated 17.2.15, dismissing her appeal against  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State, dated  27.11.14,  to  remove  her  from  the
    United Kingdom under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
     The Judge dealt with the  appeal  on  the  papers  placed  before  the
    Tribunal on 13.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    22.4.15, on the basis that it was an arguable  error  of  law  for  the
    judge to assume that the appellant's daughter  and  grandchildren  were
    not British citizens but citizens of Nigeria. In that light, at �25  of
    the decision, Judge Green concluded that  it  was  entirely  reason  to
    expect the appellant's daughter, her  husband  and  their  children  to
    return to Nigeria with the appellant and continue family life there.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.6.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was such error of law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    determination of Judge Green should be set aside.

 6. As stated, Judge Green had to deal with the appeal on the papers before
    the Tribunal. At �17(i) the  judge  stated  that  the  daughter  Fumi's
    immigration status was unclear and no evidence was presented  that  she
    or her children are British citizens.

 7. There was much confusion in the hearing before me  as  to  the  correct
    chronology and as to what evidence was in fact put  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  that  the  appellant's  daughter  or  grandchildren  are
    British citizens. The appellant was  not  previously  represented.  The
    Tribunal was also hampered by incomplete information, including clarity
    as to whether the appellant  made  a  fresh  application  in  2014,  as
    implied in �2 of the decision, and if not what she had  stated  in  the
    previous application of June 2013.

 8. The chronology set out in �1 of the decision is largely correct. It  is
    relevant to point out that the application made on 7.6.13  was  refused
    on 22.7.13 with no right  of  appeal  and  the  appellant  was  refused
    permission to  apply  for  Judicial  Review  on  20.3.14.  Reading  the
    Secretary  of  State's  decision  of  27.11.14,  it  appears  that  the
    appellant did not make a new application but  rather  that  on  6.6.14,
    following the  conclusion  of  the  Judicial  Review  application,  the
    Secretary of State sent the appellant a One Stop notice and request for
    additional grounds. The appellant did not help her position by the fact
    that her representatives did not reply and the appellant did not  reply
    to direct communication, although Royal Mail Tracking confirmed she had
    received the request on 2.7.14. In the  absence  of  response  and  any
    further representation, the Secretary of State  proceeded  to  consider
    the appellant's immigration status on the basis of private  and  family
    life under the Rules and whether there were compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances justifying granting leave to remain outside the Rules  on
    the basis of  Article  8  ECHR.  This  consideration  resulted  in  the
    decision to remove the appellant, which is the subject matter  of  this
    appeal.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge is not to be  criticised  for  not  being
    aware, as the document is not in the case file, but in  the  full  June
    2013 application the appellant had clearly stated her  relationship  to
    her British citizen daughter and it also appears  that  the  daughter's
    birth certificate had been submitted with that  application.  Ms  Jones
    also  points  out  that  in  the  covering  letter  to  the  June  2013
    application, the appellant's representatives clearly  stated  that  the
    appellant's daughter is a  British  citizen.  Further,  the  daughter's
    British citizenship is referred to at  �15  of  the  previous  Tribunal
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Tiffen,  promulgated  14.3.12.  A
    further copy of the birth certificate has been submitted in relation to
    the appeal to the Upper Tribunal. In the light of the birth certificate
    and the information referred to above, Ms Holmes did not challenge that
    the appellant's daughter is a British citizen.

10. It is not entirely  clear  what  of  the  above  chronology  and  above
    information was made available to  Judge  Green  and,  as  stated,  the
    appellant did not assist herself by failing to respond to requests  for
    any and all grounds of appeal. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied
    that Judge Green has any responsibility for the error in the  decision.
    Nevertheless, given the evidence  now  available  suggesting  that  the
    appellant's daughter is a British citizen, it necessarily follows  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was made  under  a  mistake  of
    fact.

11. Ms  Sharkey  contends  that  as  the  judge  was  mistaken  as  to  the
    nationality of the appellant's daughter and grandchildren and  that  in
    consequence  the  subsequent  Article  8  family  life  proportionality
    assessment was necessarily flawed by failing to take into account  that
    the daughter and grandchildren are British and cannot  be  required  to
    leave the UK. It does not necessarily follow that it is unreasonable or
    unjustifiably  harsh  to  expect  the  daughter  and  grandchildren  to
    relocate to Nigeria with the appellant, but the true circumstances  are
    certainly  relevant  to  the  proper  conduct  of  the  proportionality
    assessment. In  the  circumstances,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal cannot stand and must be set aside.

12. In the light of the fact that the decision of the Secretary of State of
    27.11.14 failed to  acknowledge  that  the  appellant's  daughter,  and
    perhaps also her grandchildren, are British citizens, I find  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law. It is clear from the  June
    2013 application that  the  appellant  had  raised  the  issue  of  her
    relationship with her British citizen daughter. The decision is  flawed
    in failing to take account of this highly relevant fact and needs to be
    remade.

13. In considering the remaking of the decision in the appeal, I find  that
    the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  of  27.11.14  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and thus there is no valid decision before  the
    Tribunal.

Conclusions:

14. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside set aside the decision.

                    There is no valid decision before the Tribunal which can
                    be appealed. It remains for the Secretary  of  State  to
                    make a decision which is in accordance with the law.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There is no valid decision and thus  no  valid  appeal  before  the
Tribunal.
