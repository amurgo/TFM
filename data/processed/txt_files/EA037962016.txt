                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr M Upadhyay, of Norman Lawson & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals  against  a  decision  by  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray, promulgated on 23 August  2017,  dismissing  his
    appeal "for want of jurisdiction".

 2. Judge Murray applied the law as then understood.

 3. In light of Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ, which binds  the  UT  (or,  in
    Scotland, is persuasive to the same effect) that must now be  taken  as
    an error of law.

 4. In accordance with the letter from the President of the UT (IAC) to the
    respondent dated 21 December 2017, declining a general stay in  the  UT
    pending authority of the Supreme Court, the decision of the FtT is  set
    aside and the case is remitted to the FtT for hearing.

 5. Any request for a stay in the FtT will raise  different  considerations
    and is a matter for that tribunal, if  and  when  such  application  is
    made.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
