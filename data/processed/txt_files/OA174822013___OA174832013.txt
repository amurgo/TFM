Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr J Collins, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of Nepal and brothers.  Mr  Sukbir  Limbu's
    date of birth is 20 February 1991 and Mr Bhim Bahadur Limbu's date  of
    birth is 26 December 1991.  They made applications for entry  clearance
    which was refused by the ECO (New Delhi) in a  decision  of  28  August
    2013.  The applications were to join their father  (the  sponsor  Padam
    Lal Limbu), their mother  (Bhim  Rani  Limbu)  and  their  two  younger
    siblings (Man Bahadur Limbu  (date  of  birth  16  February  1993)  and
    Purandhoj Limbu (date of  birth  26  October  1996)).  The  family  was
    granted entry clearance in 2010.  The sponsor was in the Gurkha Brigade
    of the British Army between 29 October 1951 and 14 January 1959 and was
    granted entry clearance under the policy applicable at the time.

2.   The appellants appealed against the  decision  of  the  ECO  and  their
    appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal.  Deputy Upper Tribunal
    Judge Mailer found that the First-tier Tribunal  had  made  a  material
    error of law and set aside the decision to dismiss  the  appeals.   The
    error of law decision reads as follows:

         "32  I am satisfied that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has  not
             adequately   engaged   and   applied   the    current    legal
             considerations and jurisprudence  relevant  to  the  issue  of
             whether  family  life  in  this  case  existed   between   the
             appellants, the sponsor and his family in the UK.


          33.     The correct approach has been to move on from the  earlier
             case law requiring that it be demonstrated that more than  the
             usual normal emotional ties existed.


         34.  Moreover, the finding that  no  weight  whatsoever  should  be
             given  to  the  historic  injustice  in  the  context  of  the
             proportionality assessment appears to be contrary to the dicta
             in Ghising, supra.  Finally in maintaining that on  discharge,
             the  sponsor  most  certainly  would  not  have  applied   for
             settlement in the UK with their mother and their children, the
             Judge did not properly take into account the relevant evidence
             given by the sponsor himself".

3.   The matter came before me  for  a  rehearing.   At  the  start  of  the
    hearing Mr Collins indicated that the sponsor was not in attendance  at
    court because he was unwell.  He took  further  instructions  from  his
    solicitor and spoke with the sponsor's wife who was in attendance.   On
    resuming the hearing Mr Collins explained that  the  sponsor  was  very
    unwell as a result of a road traffic accident  which  had  occurred  in
    2013.  (The fact that he was involved in such an accident  is  referred
    to by the First-tier Tribunal and is not a matter  of  contention.)  Mr
    Collins  having  spoken  to  his  instructing  solicitors   and   those
    solicitors instructed by Mr Limbu in relation to  the  accident  itself
    agreed that the hearing should proceed in his absence.

4.   The sponsor has memory loss as a result of  the  accident  and  it  now
    appears that he has developed dementia.  I took into account  a  letter
    handed to me by Mr Collins to from Fentons Solicitors to  Dr  Cockerell
    which refers to a report of Dr Cockerell's in which he states that  the
    sponsor suffered a relatively minor head injury  as  a  result  of  the
    incident and that he is now fully dependent on his family for his  care
    needs and there is  a  possibility  that  he  has  dementia  which  was
    probably caused by the incident although this is not definite.

5.   It was intended that the sponsor's wife give evidence  at  the  hearing
    before me.  On the file there is the respondent's bundle which contains
    the Reasons for Refusal Letter.  There is an appellants'  bundle  which
    contains witness statements and  other  documents  in  support  of  the
    appeal and an authorities bundle.   Mr  Collins  submitted  a  skeleton
    argument and relied on the  skeleton  argument  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Parties referred to the cases of Dube (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]
    UKUT 00090 (IAC), Ghising and Others  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC), . (Gurung) and SSHD [2013] 1 WLR 2546,
    Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal [2012] UKUT 160.

The Evidence of Sukbir Limbu

6.   This appellant's evidence is contained in a  witness  statement  of  20
    February 2013 and a joint witness statement (with Bhim  Bahadur  Limbu)
    of 17 July 2014.  His evidence can be summarised.

7.   Both appellants are living in Dharan in the family  home  there.   They
    are totally dependent on their parents who they miss.  They are  single
    and unemployed.  The sponsor visited Nepal in order to assist  them  to
    complete their application for entry  clearance.   Since  their  family
    left Nepal to live in the UK their aunt has moved into the family home.
     The sponsor remits money to her so that she can use  it  in  order  to
    support them.   The appellants  have  regular  telephone  contact  with
    their family and they miss them desperately.

The Evidence of Bhim Bahadur Limbu

8.   This appellant's evidence is contained in  the  above  mentioned  joint
    statement and a witness statement of 17 July 2014. His evidence can  be
    summarised.

9.   Mr Limbu is a student  at  Bajwa  International  College  in  Kathmandu
    where he is studying a degree.  He lives in rented accommodation and is
    wholly financially dependent on his father who pays his rent and course
    fees.  During holidays and at some weekends he returns  to  the  family
    home in Dharan which is his permanent  address.   He  is  in  full-time
    education and does not  have  an  income.    His  father  remits  money
    directly to him.  He lived in the family  home  in  Dharan  permanently
    until he completed his schooling.  In this appellant's later  statement
    it appears to be the case  that  he  is  no  longer  studying  and  has
    returned to the family home.

The Evidence of Padam Lal Limbu (the Sponsor)

10.  The sponsor's evidence is contained in  his  witness  statement  of  15
    July 2014, and of 1 February 2013.  His evidence can be summarised.

11.  The sponsor sold his land in Nepal in order to  fund  the  applications
    for entry clearance for himself and his  wife  and  their  two  younger
    sons.  The sponsor and the two younger sons travelled to the  UK  on  4
    December 2010.  The sponsor's wife remained in Nepal in order  to  look
    after the two older sons.

12.  It was difficult for the sponsor to look after  the  two  younger  sons
    and he asked his wife to join him in the UK.  She joined him on 18  May
    2011 and left the two older sons alone for the first time.

13.  The sponsor had a road traffic accident on 6 July 2013 and was  injured
    and as a result has become very forgetful.

14.  The sponsor was married to his first  wife  Maya  Limbu  a  citizen  of
    Malaysia whom he married after he was discharged from the  army.   They
    were married for about 25 years and have two children who are grown  up
    and independent.  The sponsor cannot remember the date that she  passed
    away.  He married his current wife Bhim Rani Limbu on 20 August 1988.

15.  The appellants are dependent on the sponsor and are very much  part  of
    the family unit.  They rely wholly on the  sponsor  and  his  wife  for
    financial support and accommodation.  They are single  and  unemployed.
    The family is very close and they are sad to be  separated.   They  are
    both students in full-time education and wish to continue their studies
    in the UK.  It is the sponsor's duty as a Gurkha to continue to support
    his children.

16.  The sponsor's wife sends money to the appellants in Nepal.   She  sends
    approximately �200 a month.  They are concerned about their  children's
    safety in Nepal.  The sponsor contacts them  every  day  by  telephone.
    The sponsor enlisted in the Brigade of Gurkhas on 29 October  1951  and
    he served for over seven years. The sponsor was not  allowed  to  apply
    for settlement in the UK when he was discharged and therefore he  never
    made enquiries about settlement here.  He learned in 2010 that he would
    be able to apply for settlement but wishes that this had been  possible
    at an earlier stage.  By the time the sponsor was allowed to apply  (in
    2009) the appellants had already reached 18 years of age.  Because  the
    sponsor was not able to settle in the UK on discharge from the army  he
    obtained work as a farmer in Malaysia where he worked for 25 years.

The Evidence of Bhim Rani Limbu

17.  Mrs Limbu's evidence is contained in her witness statement of  15  July
    2014. She attended the hearing  and  gave  oral  evidence,  through  an
    interpreter, in Nepalese.  Her evidence can be summarised.

18.  It was a difficult decision for the  family  to  make  to  leave  their
    dependent children in Nepal.  It was the first time they had been  left
    on their own.  Mrs Limbu had to come and join her husband here  because
    he was finding it difficult to take care of the two younger children.

19.  The family communicates daily on  the  telephone.   In  Gurkha  culture
    unmarried children are the sole responsibility of their  parents  until
    they are married and the appellants are still very  much  part  of  the
    family unit.

20.  The family in the UK receives pension credit and Mrs Limbu  receives  a
    benefit for taking care of her husband.  The sponsor forgets things and
    has no control over himself. In her first  statement  her  evidence  is
    that she works as a cleaner and earns approximately �300 a  month,  but
    this does not appear to be the case any more.

21.  If her sons are allowed to join them they can look  after  the  family.
    They can work here and help them.  One of her sons is currently working
    here in the UK, but Mrs Limbu was unable to give  any  details  of  his
    employment.

Submissions

22.  Mr Tufan submitted that the appellants  cannot  be  wholly  financially
    dependent on funds from the UK because the family here is dependent  on
    benefits.  The Secretary of State's position is that there is no family
    life between the appellants and the sponsor and their family in the  UK
    and therefore Article 8 is not engaged.  It is also  the  Secretary  of
    State's case that there is no historic injustice in this case.

23.  Mr Tufan relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  Gurung  and
    submitted that the  appellants'  circumstances  are  analogous  to  the
    appellants NL and SL (see paragraph 47-52).  I asked Mr  Tufan  if  the
    Secretary of State is relying on matters  over  and  above  the  public
    interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy and he referred me to
    Section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act.

24.  Mr Collins made submissions in the context of his skeleton argument.

Findings and Reasons

25.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  there  was  financial  dependency
    between the appellants and the sponsor and there is  no  reason  to  go
    behind this finding.  The  sponsor  gave  evidence  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and his evidence is recorded as follows:-

         "11.     It  was  the  sponsor's  testimony  that  he  applied  for
             discharge from the Gurkhas in  1959  because  his  father,  in
             Nepal, had become seriously ill and it was  his  duty  as  the
             eldest son to care for the father.  Thus, the sponsor  further
             testified, he would not have come to  the  United  Kingdom  at
             that time since he would not have been able to look after  his
             father.  The sponsor's father had died six  months  after  the
             sponsor returned to Nepal.  In that context it was  submitted,
             on behalf of the appellants, that had the sponsor waited until
             his father's death before  applying  to  come  to  the  United
             Kingdom it was impossible to  believe  that  that  application
             would have been  refused  by  reason  of  six  months'  delay.
             Following the death of the sponsor's father, according to  his
             testimony, the sponsor had gone to Malaya to secure  work  and
             not to join his girlfriend in  that  country.   This  was  the
             situation,  it  was  submitted,  it  was  apparent  from   the
             sponsor's testimony that he had been to India  to  find  work.
             No  doubt  the  sponsor  equally  would  have,  if  given  the
             opportunity, sought  work  in  the  United  Kingdom.   It  was
             submitted that the question as to whether the  sponsor  would,
             following his discharge from the Gurkhas,  have  come  to  the
             United Kingdom could  only  be  very  hypothetical  given  the
             considerable passage of time.  In  the  case  of  Ghising  and
             Gurung the sponsor's  discharge  from  the  Gurkhas  had  been
             within the last twenty years thus  the  time  frame  had  been
             different.  The sponsor should not be penalised because he was
             an older Gurkha veteran and did not meet his second wife  (the
             mother) and have four children with  her  until  a  number  of
             years later.  It was a long outstanding injustice which  arose
             in the present case".

26.  I had the benefit of hearing the appellants' mother give  evidence.   I
    found her to be credible.  Her evidence was consistent both  internally
    and with the evidence of the other  witnesses  and  it  was  relatively
    detailed.

27.  I have had full regard to the judgment of Ghising  [2012]  in  relation
    to family life.  At the date of the decision the eldest  appellant  was
    22 and the youngest was 21. I must consider the position at the date of
    the decision.

28.    There is no inconsistency in the evidence  of  financial  dependency.
    It does not follow that because the family here is dependent on benefit
    the appellants in Nepal are  not  financially  dependent  on  them.   I
    accept that the family in the UK sends money on a regular basis to  the
    appellants and they are wholly financially dependent on this.

29.      There has been deterioration in  the  sponsor's  health  since  the
    date of the decision. .  At the date of the decision which was prior to
    his accident his evidence was (see his witness statement of 1  February
    2013) that the appellants are very much part of the family  unit.  This
    is supported by the evidence of the appellants' mother.   She  remained
    in Nepal in order to stay with them after her husband and  two  younger
    children had come to the UK.  I accept her evidence that  this  was  an
    emotionally  difficult  decision  for  her  to  make  because  of   the
    dependency of the appellants.

30.  I find that prior to the sponsor and his wife  coming  to  the  UK  the
    family lived together in the family home in Dharan. It may be  that  at
    the date of the decision Bhim Bahaadur Limbu was at University, but  he
    regularly returned to the family home.  I accept  that  the  appellants
    are not independent and that they form part of the  family  unit.   The
    sponsor's evidence is that the family has daily telephone contact and I
    accept this evidence.

31.  Family life may continue between parent and child even after the  child
    has attained his majority.  I am satisfied on  the  evidence  that  the
    appellants have a close knit family relationship with their parents and
    younger siblings in the UK.  The appellants depend on their parents for
    financial, practical and emotional support and guidance.

32.   The determinative issue in this case is whether or  not  the  decision
    is proportionate (Razgar, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2004]  UKHL
    27).

33.  I find that the sponsor in this case would  have  made  an  application
    for settlement shortly after  his  discharge  should  there  have  been
    provision for him to do so.  I have taken  into  account  his  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal  in  relation  to  taking  care  of  his
    elderly father; however, I accept that the sponsor would have made such
    an application after the death of his father which was six months after
    his discharge from the army.  I have attached particular weight to  the
    sponsor's witness statement which in which he states that he would have
    applied for settlement had he been able to do so.

34.  There is in my view a casual nexus between the historic  injustice  and
    the action of the sponsor.  I have taken on board the passage  of  time
    and the obvious fact that neither appellant was born at  the  time  the
    sponsor was discharged from the British  Army;  however  in  this  case
    there is a nexus and there is family life between the sponsor  and  the
    appellant.  The family should not be prejudiced on the basis  that  the
    sponsor's discharge from the British Army is historic and that in light
    of the fact he was not able to settle in the UK he got on with his life
    and had another family.

35.  I must consider proportionality through the prism of Section 117B,  the
    Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is in the public  interest.   Maintenance
    of immigration control is not a legitimate aim under  Article  8(2)  of
    ECHR but it is in this case an aspect of the economic wellbeing of  the
    country.

36.    It is the evidence of the appellants' mother that both were  able  to
    speak English and this was not challenged by Mr Tufan.  I  accept  that
    the appellants have some English language ability.

37.  Mr Tufan attached significance to 117B(3), namely that  it  is  in  the
    public interest that persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United
    Kingdom are financially independent.  However,  this  limb  of  Section
    117A has to be considered in the context of the circumstances  of  this
    application  and  that  it  rests  on  establishing   dependency.   The
    appellants were and still are financially dependant on  their  parents.
    The family is at the date of the hearing  mainly  dependent  on  public
    funds here in the UK.   I  have  considered  the  appellants'  mother's
    witness statement which is dated 15 July 2014.  In this  statement  her
    evidence is that she was working as a cleaner.   Her  evidence  at  the
    hearing before me is that she now cares for the sponsor.  She  was  not
    cross-examined about her previous employment, but it is a fact that the
    sponsor's health has deteriorated and he  has  become  more  dependent.
    Mrs Limbu's statement was made after the date of the decision,  but  it
    casts light on the circumstances of this family  at  the  date  of  the
    decision, namely that they have  an  intention  to  become  financially
    independent.  I accept that at least one son in the UK is currently  in
    employment although there is very little detail of this. It was and  is
    the intention of the appellants to study  and  seek  employment  should
    they come to the UK.  That  the  sponsor  was  involved  in  a  serious
    accident and has dementia or dementia like symptoms  must  have  had  a
    profound effect upon the family.  I must consider the circumstances  at
    the date of the decision which was made weeks after the accident  since
    when his condition has deteriorated and this has affected his and their
    ability to work.

38.  Mr Tufan has not pointed to matters over and above the public  interest
    in maintaining a firm immigration policy.  I accept that being an adult
    child of a UK settled Gurkha ex-serviceman is not a "trump  card",  but
    the weight in this case to be given to the historic injustice  requires
    a decision in the appellants' favour.  The economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country through the maintenance of immigration control  is  the  public
    interest relied upon by the Secretary of State in this case and it does
    not outweigh the powerful factors bearing on the appellants' side.
