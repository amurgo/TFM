Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Gajjar, Direct Access Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan and he arrived in the United
    Kingdom on a student visa on October 17, 2006. The appellant extended
    his leave in the Tier 1 (Post Study) Migrant category until March 21,
    2016. On March 17, 2016 he applied for indefinite leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 (General) Migrant but later varied this to an application for
    indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B HC 395.


 2. Th respondent refused this application on February 12, 2018 under
    paragraph 322(5) HC 395 on the basis the appellant had failed to
    disclose his true earnings to HMRC for his Tier 1 application lodged on
    December 23, 2010.

 3. The appellant appealed the refusal decision on February 23, 2018 and
    blamed his former accountants for negligently preparing his tax
    returns.

 4. His appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Beach on
    December 11, 2018 who in a decision promulgated on January 9, 2019
    applied the decision of R (on the application of Khan) v SSHD
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) and
    dismissed the appellant's appeal by rejecting the appellant's claim
    that he had not been provided with either draft or final accounts to
    check by the former accountants.

 5. The appellant appealed this decision on January 22, 2019 and, although
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Saffer refused permission to appeal,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Storey granted permission on the ground that it
    was arguable the Judge had failed to keep in his mind, when analysing
    the evidence, that the respondent bore the burden of proof in
    establishing dishonesty.

 6. Mr Bates opposed the application on the basis the  appellant  had  been
    given an opportunity to offer an innocent explanation and this had been
    rejected by the respondent and also the Tribunal.

 7. No anonymity direction is made.

    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

 8. Mr Gajjar submitted the Judge's decision contained irrational  findings
    and proceeded to outline those areas of the Judge's decision that  were
    irrational.

 9. At paragraph 23 the Judge found in the appellant's favour for tax  year
    2009/2010 but  when  considering  his  explanation  for  the  tax  year
    2010/2011 the Judge did not accept the explanation advanced even though
    he had previously accepted the argument for the previous tax year.

10. The appellant's case was his accountant was so incompetent that he  had
    under-declared both the appellant's employed and self-employed  income.
    In paragraph 25 of his decision, the Judge found the appellant had  not
    provided all his P60s for the 2010/2011 tax year, but this finding  was
    irrational and could not be sustained.

11. If the Judge was correct in finding that the appellant may have  hidden
    one or more P60s then it must follow the P60s  provided  by  him  would
    total �7,093, but no combination of his P60s reached that  figure  with
    one P60 being  for  �477.73,  one  for  �5,398.70  and  the  other  for
    �5,919.88. The Judge's finding was not supported by the evidence.

12. The Judge took issue with the  fact  the  appellant  only  amended  his
    return on advice but overlooked the  fact  the  appellant  only  became
    aware of the discrepancy when he checked with HMRC. Given paragraph  25
    is unsustainable and given this is core to the appellant's account then
    he submitted the decision may not have been the same  if  paragraph  25
    had been revisited.

13. The second ground concerned the application of an incorrect standard of
    proof. Upper Tribunal Judge Storey granted permission on the basis  the
    Judge may have misapplied it.

14. At paragraph 24 of the decision, the  Judge  accepted  the  accountancy
    firm had not complied with Companies House Rules for themselves and  Mr
    Gajjar submitted that the Judge had applied the wrong test by saying it
    was "quite a leap to accept" whereas he should have considered  whether
    his  explanation  was  implausible  against  the   acknowledgment   the
    accountants had possibly erred in their  preparation  of  the  relevant
    income for the previous year.

15. Mr Gajjar submitted it was not so implausible the accountants would not
    have made another mistake and he submitted the Judge's expectation  was
    flawed and he referred to paragraphs 20.2. and 20.3 of the  grounds  of
    appeal. The third ground followed on from ground two in that the  Judge
    failed to attach weight to the fact the appellant did pay �3,805 tax.

16. The final issue arose from the recent Court of Appeal decision  in  the
    case of Balajigari and Others [2019] EWCA Civ  673.  Whilst  there  had
    been a fact-finding approach in this  case,  Mr  Gajjar  submitted  the
    Judge had erred by failing to consider "desirability" issue and this in
    itself there was an error in law. He referred the Tribunal to paragraph
    [33] of in the case of Balajigari.

17. Mr Bates submitted there was no error in law and whilst the  Judge  did
    not have the benefit of the recent Court of  Appeal  guidance,  he  had
    followed approach set out in the decision of Khan. The  Court  in  Khan
    said it was not sufficient to simply place the blame on the  accountant
    and the appellant had to back up such assertions with evidence.

18. The finding at paragraph 25 was prefaced by the Judge  noting  she  had
    not been given the evidence that was said to have been  passed  to  the
    former accountant. She  concluded,  following  Khan,  there  should  be
    evidence of what contact he had  with  those  former  accountants.  The
    Judge speculated that only one or two P60s were provided  but  she  was
    not satisfied all the evidence had been provided.

19. At paragraph 23 the Judge had given the appellant the benefit of  doubt
    and found either the appellant or accountant may  have  overlooked  the
    evidence because it was his  first  year  of  self-employment  and  the
    discrepancy was significantly less compared to the figure in 2010/2011.
    The fact the accountants were tardy providing their own returns did not
    mean they were negligent  in  providing  the  appellant's  returns.  No
    explanation had been obtained from the former firm of accountants which
    is something the Tribunal in Khan said should be done.  The  Judge  had
    noted there was a larger discrepancy in 2010/2011  and  the  correction
    only occurred four years later in 2016 when he was preparing his Tier 1
    application and the year, he would be eligible for indefinite leave  to
    remain application.

20. The Judge rejected the appellant's claim it was the accountant's  fault
    as there was a lack of evidence and the Judge's finding on his  failure
    to explain the discrepancy was sustainable.

21. As to issue of desirability Mr Bates referred  to  paragraph  37(2)  of
    Balajigari and argued that if  there  had  been  dishonesty  then  this
    pointed to the undesirability of granting him status. At paragraph [28]
    of her decision, the Judge found appropriate to refuse him leave and Mr
    Bates submitted paragraphs [28] and [29] were sustainable  because  the
    Judge had carried out a balancing act on proportionality  and  rejected
    the claim.

22. Mr  Gajjar  responded  to  these  submissions  by  arguing  Mr  Bates's
    arguments about paragraphs [24] and [25] were flawed and that Mr  Bates
    was simply inviting  the  Tribunal  to  ignore  those  aspects  of  the
    decision he did not like. The appellant had put forward an  explanation
    and had highlighted the problems facing the former accountants and  had
    submitted the tardy actions of the accountants demonstrated  they  were
    at fault. It should also not be overlooked that the firm had also  been
    dissolved.

    FINDINGS

23. The appellant's application for indefinite leave  to  remain  had  been
    rejected because the Judge accepted the respondent had been entitled to
    refuse the application under paragraph 322(5) HC 395 through a  failure
    to declare all his income to HMRC.

24. The Judge's decision was extremely detailed and set out in considerable
    detail the facts of  this  appeal.  The  Judge  acknowledged  that  the
    appellant had not deliberately sought to mislead ether  the  respondent
    or HMRC for the tax year 2009/2010 and she gave her reasons for this in
    paragraph [23] of her decision. Mr Gajjar's  argument  is  that  having
    made that finding and on the basis the accountancy firm  did  not  have
    its own affairs in order  the  Judge  should  have  reached  a  similar
    finding for the 2010/2011 tax year.

25. The  appellant  blamed  the  accountants  and  claimed  the  accountant
    submitted the tax return without checking the same with  him.  Both  he
    and Mr Gajjar pointed to the fact  that  since  his  former  accountant
    company was formed in November 2008  there  had  been  steps  taken  to
    strike the company off Companies Register in 2010-2014  culminating  in
    the Company being struck off in January 2015.

26. The Judge acknowledged these problems in paragraph [24] of her decision
    but stated, "it was quite a leap to move from this to  a  finding  that
    the  accountant  firm  was  either  so  negligent  in   preparing   the
    appellant's tax return that it missed a large amount of the appellant's
    income or that it was knowingly misrepresenting the appellant's  income
    to HMRC and that it was further negligent in failing  to  ask  for  the
    client's approval of the tax returns before submitting it".  The  Judge
    continued in paragraph [25] of her decision to find, "... I do not find
    it credible that an accountant (even one as disorganised  as  could  be
    evidenced by the failure to  comply  with  Company  House  regulations)
    would not provide a draft tax return to a client and ask  for  approval
    before submitting it to HMRC". The  Judge  went  on  to  criticise  the
    appellant for failing to check the return himself or follow up the lack
    of information with the accountant. The Judge  then  went  on  to  find
    there was no evidence of what had been provided to the accountant.

27. Mr Gajjir has argued that the Judge's approach in paragraphs  [24]  and
    [25] were flawed when taken together whereas  Mr  Bates  submitted  the
    Judge had followed the guidance in Khan and had not placed  the  burden
    of proof on the appellant.

28. Whilst I acknowledge the Judge spent considerable  time  reviewing  the
    evidence and making findings, I am satisfied there is an error in law.

29. The Judge did not address the fact the P60's did not total the  amounts
    submitted in the tax return which brought into  question  what  figures
    the accountants submitted.  The  Judge  criticised  the  appellant  for
    producing no evidence from the former accountant overlooking  the  fact
    the firm had been dissolved in January 2015.  The  Judge  accepted  the
    accountants may have messed up the previous years accounts  and  whilst
    the discrepancy was larger the appellant's explanation was the same for
    this second year as it was for the  first.  The  issues  raised  by  Mr
    Gajjar do go to the core of the assessment and I find there has been an
    error in law for this reason.

30. Evidence will be required in this appeal and I am also conscious of the
    recent approach taken  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Balajigari.  The
    respondent should satisfy himself that the decision  letter  issued  in
    this appeal does not fall within the type of case  dealt  with  by  the
    Court of Appeal. I remit this matter back to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

    DECISION

31. There was an error in law and material error in law and I set aside the
    decision and I remit this matter back to the First-tier Tribunal  under
    section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
