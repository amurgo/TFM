For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim, Counsel instructed by Toltops Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Fox sitting at Hatton Cross on 16th  February  2017
    when by way of a decision and reasons promulgated on  22nd  March  2017
    the judge dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  in  respect  of  an  EEA
    residence document.

2.    The position appears to be that the judge  was  dealing  with  various
    floating cases and indeed the judge said at paragraph 8:-

         "The appeal had been listed as  a  floating  case.   This  was  the
         second floating case I was asked to hear.  However, I  had  already
         released the Home Office Presenting Officer Mr S Vaghela after  the
         first floating case had been concluded as I was not expecting to do
         another.  Therefore, the respondent was not represented."

    He said at paragraph 9:-

         "As the appeal turned on documents appertaining to the ex-partner's
         economic activity it was agreed that the appeal  would  proceed  by
         way of submissions only."

    Then at paragraphs 13 to 17 the judge made various  findings  and  said
    that in the absence of reliable evidence the Appellant  had  failed  to
    demonstrate  that  her  ex-partner  was  economically  active  for  the
    purposes of Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations.

3.    Mr Karim relied on the written  grounds  which  were  drafted  by  his
    instructing solicitors.  They explain that the Appellant was married to
    a Mr Rene Jolo, an  EEA  national  exercising  treaty  rights  on  31st
    October 2008.  On 29th January the Central Family Court  dissolved  the
    Appellant's marriage and it was subsequent to that that  the  Appellant
    had applied for a permanent residence  card.   It  was  said  that  the
    Respondent had accepted that the  Appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 10(5) but in  the  refusal  letter  it  was  said  that  the
    Appellant had not established that her ex-husband was  working  at  the
    time of her divorce.  The grounds said further that,

         "7.      It  is  submitted  that  Judge  Fox  materially  erred  in
             proceeding  as  he  did  without  hearing  evidence  from  the
             Appellant who after all had requested and  paid  for  an  oral
             hearing.  Importantly, the judge erred by concluding that  the
             Appeal  turned  on  paper  evidence  only   given   that   the
             Appellant's oral evidence regarding her ex-husband's  economic
             activity at the time of divorce [and perhaps  throughout  that
             was a 7 year  marriage]  is  also  germane  to  the  issue  in
             contention; the Appellant's evidence, it is  submitted  cannot
             be discounted and it may well have been that  the  Appellant's
             oral evidence together with the assessment of her  credibility
             in conjunction with the Accountant's report  would  have  been
             persuasive  in  respect  of  the  only  question  in   dispute
             particularly as the Appellant had been the  beneficiary  of  a
             Residence Card previously."

4.    It is said that the Appellant who was not  heard  did  not  receive  a
    fair hearing.  It is  said  further  in  the  grounds  that  the  judge
    materially erred in concluding without the  benefit  of  oral  evidence
    from the Appellant, rather than just focussing on expediency  of  time,
    the circumstances under which the Appellant obtained  the  accountant's
    report or the ease or otherwise of being able to obtain other  evidence
    would have been apparent.

5.    It is right to say that the written grounds are  not  the  easiest  to
    follow but Mr Karim explained skilfully the basis  of  the  Appellant's
    appeal.  He said that at paragraph 9 when the judge said there  was  an
    "agreement" as to how the case was to proceed, that agreement must have
    been between the Appellant's solicitor Mr T Okunowo and the judge.   It
    was said that insofar as paragraphs 14 and 15 were concerned that  they
    merited further consideration. Paragraph  15  concerned  the  need  for
    there to be a proper finding in relation to  there  being  no  reliable
    evidence.  In this regard reference was made to  paragraph  14  of  the
    Appellant's witness statement at page 8 of  the  original  FtT  bundle.
    Within that the appellant explains how her husband would go out to work
    as a barber and indeed others would visit the home.  It is said nowhere
    did the judge engage with that aspect of the case.   It  was  submitted
    that was probably because the judge was dealing  with  the  case  on  a
    misconceived basis.  In any event former partners do  not  always  have
    access to all of the documents.  Insofar as paragraph 14 of the judge's
    decision is concerned where he said that the  accountant's  report  was
    insufficient, the judge did not adequately explain why the  report  was
    insufficient.

6.    In his submissions Mr Wilding said that there was  no  material  error
    of law.  He said it was simply not a valid argument for  the  Appellant
    to say that this case  should  not  have  proceeded  on  the  basis  of
    submissions only.  It was quite clear from paragraph 9 of  the  judge's
    decision that there was an agreement then that would  be  the  way  the
    case would proceed.  The same solicitors who appeared then remained  on
    record now. There was no evidence  from  those  solicitors  seeking  to
    dispute paragraph 9 of the judge's  decision.   It  was  wrong  of  the
    grounds and indeed  in  the  grant  of  the  permission  to  appeal  to
    criticise this case having proceeded on the basis of  submissions  only
    when that was the course  agreed  by  the  Appellant's  representative.
    There was no unfairness and there was no unlawfulness.  Where there had
    been an explicit agreement as to the course the case  would  take  then
    the Appellant cannot seek to argue thereafter to demonstrate that there
    was an error of law.  Another way of putting that was to say  that  the
    argument was doomed to fail.

7.    Mr Wilding said what the submissions really turned on in  relation  to
    firstly the Appellant submitting that the judge was wrong  to  say  the
    financial documents were more than marginal or ancillary and  secondly,
    to examine the economic activity up to and prior to  the  divorce.   He
    submitted that the observations at paragraph 15 of the judge's decision
    were referring to a lack of reliable evidence.  It was a finding  which
    was within the judge's remit to come  to.   The  relevant  accountant's
    report was for the one year ending April 2015.  I  was  taken  to  that
    document at page 16 in the original bundle which  showed  a  profit  of
    some �5,718 which is about �110 a week.  It  was  submitted  that  this
    fell squarely within "marginal and ancillary" given the cost of living.
     It was submitted that this was exactly the type of amount which can be
    marginal or ancillary.  The judge had come to that  decision  and  that
    was by way of the evidence which had  been  submitted.   There  was  no
    issue with the Appellant's own activity. She, as it were, had picked up
    the baton after the divorce.  It was said that there was little  to  be
    gained by looking at  the  Appellant's  witness  statement  because  in
    reality, as I understood the submissions, this was not a case where the
    Appellant would have been able to  see  the  economic  activity  taking
    place.  When one looked at paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 in  conjunction  it
    was clear that the judge had given reasons as to why  the  accountant's
    report was insufficient.  It was the entirety of the findings which led
    to  the  decision  being  made  in  respect  of  the  contents  of  the
    accountant's report.  In the  end  the  judge  had  found  against  the
    Appellant on a narrow point and this ultimately was  the  issue  before
    me.  Interference in effect with these sorts  of  cases  would  require
    there to be a material error of law.  Ultimately it was said the appeal
    had failed before the judge because of the limited evidence  which  was
    presented.  The findings were open to the judge and that there  was  no
    material error of law.

8.    Mr Karim in his response said that earnings of around  �110  per  week
    were not so low as to not be genuine economic activity.   �110  a  week
    was equivalent to the approximate public funds which would be available
    to a person if claiming state benefits and thereby Mr Karim  in  effect
    was saying if that was sufficient for  living  purposes  in  accordance
    with  public  funds  regulations  then   it   should   be   for   these
    considerations as well.  Therefore, he said it was irrational  for  the
    judge to have said that these aspects were  marginal.   Mr  Karim  also
    said that in any event the Secretary of State  had  never  raised  this
    point in the refusal letter.  The Secretary of State had not said  this
    was a case where there was no genuine economic activity. The  Secretary
    of State  instead  had  said  the  Appellant's  husband  had  not  been
    exercising treaty rights.  There was a difference.

9.    As to whether or not the accountant's report was unreliable  Mr  Karim
    pointed out that this was a sole trader so the submissions in  relation
    to drawings was irrelevant, but the expenses were set out in any event,
    such as cost of telephones and the like.  Mr Karim said it was not open
    to the judge to reach the conclusions that he  did.   Where  the  judge
    said "access to other documents" he had  not  heard  the  evidence  and
    where he said "everything turned on the documents" these issues  should
    have been put to the Appellant.

10.   When coming to my decision in this case I do have  sympathy  for  what
    is being said by Mr Wilding in respect of the apparent agreement  which
    was reached between the judge and the Appellant's solicitor  namely  as
    to whether this was going to be a case by way of submissions only.   It
    does appear the way in which the grounds were drafted  that  the  major
    complaint was that the hearing should not  have  proceeded  by  way  of
    submissions only.  Insofar as that aspect of the appeal is concerned as
    I say I have sympathy for what Mr Wilding has submitted.

11.   There  are  however  three  features  of  the  case  which  caused  me
    considerable concern, and which  had  been  highlighted  by  Mr  Karim.
    Firstly, even if the judge was merely going to deal with  the  case  on
    the documents available to him then it was incumbent for  him  to  deal
    with the witness statement which the Appellant herself  had  presented.
    That did indeed present further detail and  background  to  her  former
    husband's work.  The failure to refer to  that  in  the  decision  does
    require one to hesitate about the soundness of  the  judge's  decision.
    Then, when I look to the  grounds  which  were  submitted  against  the
    Secretary of State's  decision  dated  24th  November  2015  there  was
    reference to the Appellant's husband's work and  what  the  Appellant's
    husband had been doing previously.  It therefore was necessary for  the
    judge to either have said that he agreed or disagreed with the evidence
    that the Appellant had presented in her witness statement.

12.   Secondly, there is the issue  of  the  accountant's  report.   In  the
    relatively short paragraphs at 14, 15 and 16 of  the  judge's  decision
    the judge, in reality was looking to  see  if  there  was  anything  to
    support what was set out in  the  accountant's  report  and  the  judge
    referred at paragraph 15 to  seeking  evidence  of  drawings  or  other
    sources of income for the ex-partner.  I am persuaded by what Mr  Karim
    had said in this regard that this was, as one can  see,  a  small  sole
    trader business.  There should not ordinarily  be  the  expectation  of
    drawings within those documents.  The document  at  page  16  is  in  a
    proper form.  It sets out what the expenses were, such as telephone and
    other expenses.  It then sets out what the income was.  If that  was  a
    document that was not going to be accepted, even if  this  was  a  case
    which was being dealt with by way of  submissions,  then  at  the  very
    least it should have been raised by the judge so  that  it  could  have
    been dealt with.

13.   The third aspect of the case is in relation  to  whether  or  not  the
    earnings were marginal and/or ancillary.  Again, I am persuaded  by  Mr
    Karim that earnings of �110 a week in a sole proprietor business is not
    marginal or ancillary activity.  In my judgement although �110 per week
    was a relatively small sum of money, it is equivalent to the amount for
    public funds. In my judgment the judge was not entitled to come to  the
    conclusion that he did about "marginal and ancillary".  Overall, I have
    to say it appears to me that the judge was put in a difficult  position
    having to deal with this second floating  case  but  that  was  a  task
    before him and there was no  Presenting  Officer  but  nonetheless  the
    judge had to deal with the matters before him. Cumulatively, the errors
    amount to a material error of law albeit individually they may not have
    shown a material error of law.

14.   In the circumstances the decision of the judge is  set  aside.   There
    will have to be a re-hearing  on  all  issues.   None  of  the  current
    findings shall stand.  The re-hearing shall take place at Hatton Cross.
