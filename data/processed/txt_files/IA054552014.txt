Officer

Premier Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Britton in which he allowed the appeal  of
    Mr Bah, a citizen of Gambia, against the Secretary of State's  decision
    to refuse to grant leave to remain on  the  basis  of  his  family  and
    private life and to remove the him from the  United  Kingdom.  I  shall
    refer to Mr Bah as the Applicant, although he was the Appellant in  the
    proceedings below.
 2. The decision under appeal was made on 13 January 2014 by  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  (HC395)  and
    Article 8 ECHR.  The Applicant exercised his right  of  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  His appeal included additional  grounds  claiming
    that his removal would be in breach of  his  rights  protected  by  the
    Refugee Convention. This is the appeal which came before Judge  Britton
    on 24 July 2014 and was dismissed by virtue of the  Refugee  Convention
    and the Immigration Rules but allowed by reference to Article 8 of  the
    Human Rights Convention. The Secretary of State applied for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The application was granted by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Fisher on 28 August 2014 and on  5  September  2014
    the Applicant submitted a rule 24 response.

 3. At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Richards  appeared  to  represent  the
    Secretary of State and Ms  Rutherford  represented  the  Applicant  and
    submitted an indexed bundle including a written skeleton argument.


Background

 4. The facts, not challenged, are that the Applicant was born in Gambia on
    1 January 1962. He came to the United Kingdom with leave to enter as  a
    visitor on 23 November 2003 and following the expiration of  his  leave
    remained here unlawfully. The Applicant met his partner Susan Gillum in
    2006 and after deciding that their relationship was to be lasting  they
    moved  in  together.  Ms  Gillum  has   four   adult   children,   five
    grandchildren  and  three  step-grandchildren.  None  live   with   the
    Applicant and Ms Gillum but they have a close relationship with all  of
    them particularly their grandchildren Mason who has cerebral palsy  and
    his brother Leo. The Applicant applied for leave to remain on the basis
    of his relationship with Ms Gillum on 22 December 2011 and  after  this
    application was refused on 21 May  2012  further  representations  were
    made which were rejected by the decision made on 13 January 2014.

 5. In allowing the Applicant's appeal by virtue  of  Article  8  ECHR  the
    Judge found that he did not meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules  (paragraph  44)  and  dismissed  his  claim   for   asylum   and
    humanitarian protection finding (paragraph 43) "... he had no intention
    of returning to Gambia. He has no regard for the  immigration  laws  of
    this country, has deceived the immigration authorities on entry to  the
    country, and told a pack of lies with regard to his asylum claim."
.
 6. The Applicant does not challenge the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to
    dismiss his appeal by virtue of the Immigration Rules and  the  Refugee
    Convention.


Submissions

 7. On behalf the Secretary of State Mr Richards relied on the  grounds  of
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal and referred to the decisions  in  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640  (IAC)  and
    Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin). He said that despite MM (Lebanon)
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985 both remained good law. The Judge found  that  this
    was an exceptional case. Seen in the  light  of  paragraph  43  of  the
    decision this conclusion is irrational. There is nothing exceptional or
    compelling about the  Applicant  being  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship. The Judge has conducted no meaningful balancing exercise.
    He has not weighed the public interest into the  equation.  Indeed  the
    only exceptional factor identified in the decision is the extent of the
    Applicant's abuse of the immigration system. The error is clear.

 8. For the Applicant Ms Rutherford said that  the  decision  needs  to  be
    looked at as a whole. The positive factors referred to in paragraph  41
    and 42 of the decision need to be weighed against the negative  factors
    contained in paragraph 43. Although the Judge does  not  expressly  say
    that he is doing this it is clear that this is how he has  reached  his
    decision. This is not irrational. Referring to her skeleton argument Ms
    Rutherford said that whilst the findings are  short  they  address  the
    pertinent issues and were findings that it was open  to  the  judge  to
    make. In particular the  judge  found  that  Ms  Gillum  could  not  be
    expected to relocate to Gambia.

 9. I reserved my decision. In the event that an error  of  law  was  found
    both representatives agreed that I should remake  the  decision  taking
    into account the evidence submitted to the First-tier Tribunal and that
    in these circumstances there would be no need to call further evidence.


Error of law

10. In my judgment the decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses  clear
    and material errors of law. Having found that the Applicant was  not  a
    refugee  (paragraph  38),  that  the  Applicant  did  not  qualify  for
    humanitarian protection (paragraph 39),  that  the  Applicant  did  not
    qualify for Article 3 protection (paragraph 40) and that the  Applicant
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  (paragraph  44)
    the Judge reaches a conclusion that the removal of the Applicant  would
    not be proportionate (paragraph 42).

11. The determination does not examine the Immigration  Rules  despite  the
    refusal letter accepting that the Applicant  met  the  suitability  and
    relationship requirements. The finding that the Applicant does not meet
    the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  (paragraph  44)  is  made
    without a reference to those rules. The determination fails to give any
    reasoned consideration of why it was necessary to go outside the family
    and private life provisions of the Immigration Rules. Despite the  word
    'exceptional' being used, there is no explanation of what makes this an
    exceptional  case.  Despite  the  finding  that   it   would   not   be
    proportionate to return the applicant to Gambia there is no  indication
    of the factors taken into consideration in the proportionality balance.
    Indeed to the extent that any rationality can  be  extracted  from  the
    single sentence  of  paragraph  42  it  is  the  Applicant's  partner's
    (referred to  as  the  sponsor)  situation  rather  than  that  of  the
    Applicant that appears to be considered exceptional. The final sentence
    of paragraph 41, being a finding  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect the 'sponsor' to go and live in Gambia appears to be a reference
    to paragraph Ex.1 of Appendix FM whereas the last words of paragraph 42
    finding as they do that it would not be  proportionate  to  return  the
    Applicant to Gambia for him to make an application  to  return  to  the
    United Kingdom appears to be a conclusion  based  on  the  Chikwamba  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 principles.

12. Looking at the determination as a whole, as Ms Rutherford invited me to
    do the inconsistency of  approach  between  paragraphs  42  and  43  is
    immediately  apparent.  Whereas  paragraph  42  finds  this  to  be  an
    exceptional case where it would not  be  proportionate  to  return  the
    Applicant to Gambia paragraph  43  finds  that  the  Applicant  had  no
    intention of returning to the Gambia, has no regard for the immigration
    laws of this country, has deceived the immigration authorities and  has
    told a pack of lies with regard to his asylum claim. In this respect it
    is essential when weighing matters in the  proportionality  balance  to
    consider the positive and negative  factors  in  that  balance  and  to
    explain why the one outweighs  the  other.  The  public  interest  will
    normally be manifested by factors  on  negative  side  of  the  balance
    whilst the extent of family and private life established will be on the
    positive side. In this case the Judge  raises what appear to be  highly
    relevant issues to the public  interest  and  is  condemnatory  of  the
    Applicant's conduct yet then goes on to  find  his  removal  to  Gambia
    simply  to  make  an  application  to  return   disproportionate.   The
    inadequacy of reasoning in this respect is manifest  and  without  such
    reasoning the rationality of the decision is impugned. I set aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


Remaking the decision

13. In remaking the decision the first aspect to consider is whether  there
    are sufficient reasons to conduct an Article 8  exercise.  The  refusal
    letter does not help  greatly  in  this  respect  in  that  it  is  not
    immediately clear how  the  Secretary  of  State  has  arrived  at  her
    decision. Matters need to be inferred. After reciting  the  Applicant's
    immigration history the Secretary of State  goes  on  to  consider  the
    suitability requirements (paragraph 8  -  9)  and  concludes  that  the
    Applicant meets those requirements. The partner relationship aspects of
    the eligibility requirements are then considered  (paragraphs  10  -12)
    and the conclusion reached that the Applicant satisfies the eligibility
    criteria. For some reason the letter goes on to consider  the  parental
    relationship eligibility requirements (paragraphs 13 - 14) and  reaches
    the obvious but seemingly irrelevant conclusion that those requirements
    are not  satisfied.  The  financial  requirements  are  not  mentioned,
    presumably because it is accepted that  with  the  Applicant's  partner
    earning  around  �23,000  per  year  these  are  met.  The  immigration
    requirements are not mentioned and it must be implicit here,  and  this
    is not challenged by  the  Applicant,  that  these  are  not  met.  The
    Applicant accepts that  he  is  not  lawfully  present  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The Secretary of State goes on to consider  Ex.1  and  decides
    that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the  Applicant's  partner
    joining him in Gambia.

14. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal shows that the  Applicant's
    partner is 46 years old and in full time employment. She has  grown  up
    children in the United Kingdom and infant grandchildren one of whom has
    a significant disability. She has never left the United Kingdom. On the
    one hand it is easy to see reasons why she would not wish to leave  the
    United Kingdom but on the  other  having  voluntarily  entered  into  a
    relationship with a person from another country who had no lawful basis
    to live in the United Kingdom it is difficult to see why  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect her to do so should her partner not be  able  to
    stay in the United Kingdom. The Applicant's partner is neither  elderly
    nor infirm. Her lack of previous travel experience  does  not  make  it
    unreasonable for her to travel to live with the person she  has  chosen
    to spend her future with. None  of  her  children  live  at  home.  Her
    grandchildren can visit her in the Gambia and she can visit them in the
    United Kingdom. Her grandchild who has cerebral palsy lives with and is
    cared for on a day to day basis by his parents.

15. There is in my judgement little if any arguable reason to look  at  the
    Applicant's  status  outside  the  terms  of  the   Immigration   Rules
    particularly as the rules appear to provide a complete code in that, it
    being  accepted  that  he  meets  the  suitability   and   relationship
    requirements the only outstanding factor is the immigration requirement
    and he can, in effect, satisfy  this,  by  making  an  entry  clearance
    application from Gambia. There is absolutely nothing  in  the  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal to suggest that a short term  separation
    to enable the Applicant to travel to Gambia  would  cause  hardship  to
    anyone. The Chikwamba principles do not apply unless and until  Article
    8 is separately considered.

16. In the alternative and, if it were necessary to turn to Article 8, then
    the issue at the time of the decision and, on the evidence before  more
    still pertaining, is only  whether  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Applicant to return to make an  entry  clearance  application  In  this
    respect the balance to be struck is the  Chikwamba  principles  against
    the Applicant's immigration history. Here it is necessary to return  to
    the findings the First-tier Tribunal. The Applicant had no intention of
    returning to Gambia. He has no regard for the immigration laws of  this
    country, has deceived the  immigration  authorities  on  entry  to  the
    country, and told a pack of lies with regard to his  asylum  claim.  He
    stands on the proportionality scales with a heavy weight against him on
    the public interest side of the  balance.  It  is  not  in  the  public
    interest for those who seek to circumvent the Immigration Rules  to  be
    allowed to remain simply because they have  found  a  partner  in  this
    country whom they can return to join after a brief absence  to  make  a
    proper entry clearance application. There can be little doubt that  the
    weight to be given to the public interest has moved since Chikwamba and
    MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953.  This  is  not  to  say  that  those
    principles have ceased to have effect but where the failure to meet the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  is  easily  remediable  for  an
    applicant who meets all the requirements of the Immigration Rules  save
    the one requiring him to return to make an entry clearance application,
    where there are no children involved, where  there  is  a  partner  who
    could if she wished travel with him and where that person  has  a  poor
    immigration history it is difficult to see that it is  disproportionate
    to expect that applicant to return to make that application.


  Summary

17. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I set aside that decision.

18. I remake the decision by dismissing  the  Applicant's  appeal  both  by
    virtue of the Immigration Rules and  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention.
