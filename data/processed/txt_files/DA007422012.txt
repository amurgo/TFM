                            CHRISTOPHER RICHARDS

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent




                       NOTICE

                         (Rule 17(5), The Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008)


    1. At the hearing at Manchester on 5 April 2013, I was shown a copy  of
       a letter  dated  25  February  2013  addressed  to  the  appellant's
       solicitors and sent by UKBA. The letter indicates unambiguously that
       a "six month period of discretionary leave" would be granted to  the
       appellant upon the completion by him  of  documents  relating  to  a
       biometric residence permit.


    2. I record that Mrs Daley, counsel for the appellant and  acting  upon
       his instructions sought to withdraw this appeal at  the  hearing.  I
       give my consent to the proposed withdrawal under paragraph 17 (2) of
       the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and  record  also
       that the appellant has only sought to withdraw  his  appeal  on  the
       understanding that the Secretary of State will grant him a period of
       6 months discretionary leave to remain.
