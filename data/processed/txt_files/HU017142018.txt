Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant in the appeal before me is the Secretary of State  for
       the Home Department and the respondent to this  appeal  is  Mr  Amor
       Albert.  However for ease  of  reference,  in  the  course  of  this
       decision I shall adopt the parties' status  as  it  was  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").  I shall in this decision, refer to  Mr
       Albert  as  the  appellant,  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
       respondent.


    2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan. He  arrived  in  the  United
       Kingdom in October 2006 as a student and in March 2009, he made an in-
       time application for leave to remain as a Post study migrant. He  was
       granted leave to remain  until  April  2011.  In  February  2011,  he
       applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 General Migrant  and  he  was
       granted leave  to  remain  until  March  2013.   He  made  a  similar
       application in March 2013 and was granted  further  leave  to  remain
       until March 2016. On 29th February 2016 the appellant made a  further
       in-time application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 General  Migrant.
       That application was refused for the reasons set out  in  a  decision
       dated 29th February 2016 and the decision  was  maintained  following
       administrative review on 6th April 2016.  Thereafter, on 25th   April
       2016, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier
       1 Migrant. That application was refused for the reasons set out in  a
       decision dated  25th  April  2016  and  again,  maintained  following
       administrative review. The appellant challenged that  decision  by  a
       claim for judicial review and the respondent agreed to reconsider the
       application. The application was reconsidered, and refused again  for
       the reasons set out in a decision dated 2nd March 2017. The  decision
       was again maintained following Administrative Review.  The March 2017
       decision was challenged by a claim for Judicial  Review.   Permission
       to claim Judicial Review was refused on the papers and  following  an
       oral renewal.  The decision to refuse permission is the subject of an
       appeal before the Court of Appeal.


    3. Nevertheless, on 19th April 2017, the appellant made  an  application
       for indefinite leave to remain on  the  grounds  of  long  residence.
       That application was refused for the reasons  set  out  in  a  letter
       dated  14th  December  2017.   The  application  was  considered   by
       reference to the requirements  set  out  in  paragraph  276B  of  the
       immigration rules, to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave  to
       remain on the grounds of long residence.  The respondent  gave  three
       reasons for refusing the application. First, the respondent concluded
       that the appellant could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
       276B(i)(a) of the immigration rules that he has had at least 10 years
       continuous lawful  residence  in  the  UK.   Second,  the  respondent
       concluded that the applicant could not  satisfy  the  requirement  of
       paragraph 276B(iii) that he does  not  fall  for  refusal  under  the
       general grounds for refusal. Third, the respondent concluded that the
       application made on 19 April 2017 was made when the applicant was  in
       the UK in breach of immigration laws and thus the applicant could not
       meet the requirements of paragraph 276B(v).


    4. The decision of 14 December 2017 gave rise  to  an  appeal  that  was
       heard by FtT Judge Smith on 14th June 2018.  For the reasons set  out
       in a decision promulgated on 26th of June 2018, the FtT Judge allowed
       the appeal on human rights grounds. It is that decision that that  is
       the subject of the appeal before me.


The decision of FtT Judge Smith


    5. The background to the appeal and the appellant's immigration  history
       is set out at paragraph [7] to [19] of the decision of the FtT Judge.
        Noting that there was a pending appeal before the  Court  of  Appeal
       that was capable of having an impact upon whether the appellant might
       fall for refusal under the general grounds for refusal, the FtT Judge
       canvassed  with  the  parties  whether  an   adjournment   might   be
       appropriate. There was no application for an  adjournment,  and  with
       limited information before him as to the appeal before the  Court  of
       Appeal, the FtT Judge went on to hear the appeal.


    6. The findings and  conclusions  of  the  FtT  Judge  are  set  out  at
       paragraphs [31] to [45] of his decision.  It  appears  to  have  been
       common ground between the parties that  the  only  ground  of  appeal
       available to the appellant was  that  the  respondent's  decision  is
       unlawful under s6 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998.   The  appellant's
       ability to satisfy  the  immigration  rules  was  therefore  not  the
       question to be determined by the Tribunal, but was capable of being a
       weighty, though not determinative factor, when deciding  whether  the
       refusal  of  the  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  is
       proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.


    7. The FtT Judge considered whether the appellant is able to satisfy the
       requirement set  out  at  paragraphs  276B(i)(a)  of  the  rules,  at
       paragraphs [33] to [37] of his decision.   That  is  the  requirement
       that the appellant has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
       residence in the United Kingdom.  At paragraph [33] of his  decision,
       the FtT Judge records  the  respondent's  position.   The  respondent
       contended that the appellant had  accumulated  nine  years  and  five
       months continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom between 12th
       October 2016 (when he first arrived as a student) and 6th April  2016
       (when this application made on 29th February  2016  was  refused  and
       that decision maintained following Administrative Review.).


    8. The FtT Judge found, at [35], that the appellant did not  have  leave
       to remain between 6th April 2016 and 25th April 2016.  He went on  to
       note the appellant's claim that he had not received the decision  (of
       6th April 2016) until 12th of April 2016, and that  "..The  appellant
       asserts that he is allowed a period of 14 days, thereafter, to submit
       a further application..".  The appellant  claimed  that  his  further
       application  made  on  25th  April  2016  was  therefore  an  in-time
       application. At paragraph [36] the FtT Judge states:


             "However, paragraph 276B(v)(a) provides  that  any  period  of
             overstaying will be disregarded if a further  application  was
             made before 24 November 2016 and within 28 days of the  expiry
             of leave. I am satisfied that the appellants  application  was
             made within 28 days of the expiry of his 3C leave on 6th April
             2016 and he, therefore, satisfies the provisions of  paragraph
             276B(i)(a) of the rules."


    9. The FtT Judge then turned to the question of  whether  the  applicant
       fell for refusal under the general  grounds  for  refusal.   That  is
       addressed at paragraphs [37] to [42]  of  the  decision.   The  Judge
       noted, at paragraph [38], the claim made by the respondent  that  the
       information provided by the applicant in  his  applications  of  11th
       February 2011 and 2nd March 2013, contained details  of  income  that
       were contrary to self-assessment tax returns filed by  the  appellant
       for the years ending April 2011 and April 2013.  At  paragraph  [39],
       the Judge states:


             "The appellant accepts that the figures presented in  his  tax
             returns was in error and as  soon  as  he  knew  he  moved  to
             correct the error. He has set out  his  case  in  considerable
             detail in his witness statement (AB pl-9) which he adopted and
             which I do not intend to recite. In  essence  the  appellant's
             claims that it was an innocent mistake and  when  set  against
             his impeccable Immigration history, his commitment to  the  UK
             and his continual employment. Mr Saini identified to the court
             the  HMRC  penalties  which  can  flow  from  the  errors   in
             understating due tax which could  be  between  0%-30%  of  the
             extra tax due. The HMRC has not issued any  penalties  against
             the appellant.


   10. At paragraphs [41] and [42], the FtT Judge concluded as follows:


             "41. I am satisfied the fact there were factual errors in  the
             information provided by  the  appellant  and,  therefore,  the
             initial burden of proof moves to the appellant to establish  a
             reasonable explanation for the  discrepancies.  The  appellant
             gave evidence and adopted his statement. He was cross-examined
             by Mr Swaby. With the exception of  establishing  the  various
             documents Mr Swaby did not challenge the  credibility  of  the
             appellant. Having heard the appellant's  evidence  and  having
             considered his statement  setting  out  the  reasons  for  the
             events that unfolded in 2011 and 2013 and taking into  account
             the burden and standard of proof I cannot  conclude  that  the
             appellant's  answer  is  unreasonable.  Having  established  a
             reasonable  explanation,  I  am  satisfied   the   appellant's
             explanations were not undermined by  the  respondent.  I  take
             note that the refusal  letter  I  cannot  assess  whether  the
             respondent has balanced the positive side of  the  appellant's
             case before reaching the decision she did. I find that without
             conducting such a balancing exercise of the facts it dangerous
             and arguably unfair to rely upon paragraph 322(5).


             42.  Having considered all the evidence in the round both  for
             and against the appellant I cannot conclude the respondent has
             established that the actions of the appellant in regard to his
             applications for 11th February 2011 and  the  2nd  March  2013
             breaches paragraph 322(5) of The Rules."


   11. Having found  that  the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
       immigration  rules  the  Judge  referred  to  the   public   interest
       considerations set out in sections 117A and 117B of the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and in the end  concluded,  at  [45],
       that the interference is disproportionate.


The appeal before me


   12. The respondent advances five grounds of appeal.  Four of the grounds,
       (one, two, three and five)  concern  the  Judge's  approach  to,  and
       decision in respect of whether the requirements of paragraph 276B  of
       the rules are in fact met.  That is, whether the appellant meets  the
       requirements of paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the immigration rules that he
       has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK,  and
       the requirement of paragraph 276B(iii) that  he  does  not  fall  for
       refusal under the general grounds for refusal.  The remaining  ground
       (ground four) concerns the Judge's  conclusion  that  to  remove  the
       appellant and his family from the  UK  when  he  has  established  he
       satisfies the immigration rules  would  be  disproportionate,  having
       "factored in the best interests of his two children  as  required  by
       section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.".


   13. Permission to appeal was granted by  FtT  Judge  Hodgkinson  on  17th
       October 2018. The matter comes before me to consider whether  or  not
       the decision of FtT Judge Smith involved the  making  of  a  material
       error of law, and if the  decision  is  set  aside,  to  re-make  the
       decision.


Discussion


   14. The FtT Judge found that the appellant satisfies the requirements  of
       paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the immigration rules.  The  Judge  accepted,
       at [35], that the appellant's leave to remain in the UK ended on  6th
       April 2016 and that between 6th April 2016 and 25th April  2016,  the
       appellant was in the UK without leave.  The Judge proceeds,  at  [35]
       and [36], upon the premise that the  s3C  leave  that  the  appellant
       enjoyed, continued for the period of grace permitted by the rules  so
       that  the  appellant  satisfies   the   requirements   of   paragraph
       276B(i)(a).


   15. In my judgement, the FtT Judge erred in reaching the conclusion  that
       paragraph 276B(i)(a) could be met by the appellant  for  the  reasons
       given.  There is no doubt that the appellant arrived  in  the  United
       Kingdom as a student on 12th October 2006.  He made a number  of  in-
       time applications for leave to remain that  were  granted.   On  29th
       February 2016, the appellant made an  in-time  application  that  was
       refused on for the reasons set out in a decision  made  on  the  same
       day. The appellant applied, as he was entitled to, for Administrative
       Review. For the reasons set out in a decision dated 6th  April  2016,
       the respondent maintained the decision to refuse the application  for
       leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.


   16. Section 3C Immigration 1971 Act makes provision for the  continuation
       of any leave  granted  to  a  person,  pending  a  decision  upon  an
       application for variation of that leave.  s3C(2)  provides  that  the
       leave is extended by virtue of s3C during any period when-


             (a) the application  for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
           withdrawn,


             (b) an appeal under s82(1)  of  the  Nationality,  Asylum  and
             Immigration Act 2002 could be brought, while the appellant  is
             in the United Kingdom against the decision on the  application
             for variation (ignoring any possibility of an  appeal  out  of
             time with permission), or


             c) an appeal under that section against that decision, brought
             while the appellant is  in  the  United  Kingdom,  is  pending
             (within the meaning of s104 of that Act) or


             d)    an  administrative  review  of  the  decision   on   the
             application for variation -


                  (i) could be sought, or


                  (ii)     is pending


   17. Properly understood, s3C applies so that  where  an  application  for
       variation of an existing leave is made before that leave expires (and
       provided that there has been no decision on that  application  before
       the leave expires), there is, by s3C(2), a statutory extension of the
       original leave until;  (a) the application is decided  or  withdrawn;
       (b), if the application has been decided and  there  is  a  right  of
       appeal against that decision, the time  for  appealing  has  expired;
       (c), if an appeal has been brought, that appeal is  decided;  (d)  if
       the  application  has  been  decided  and  there  is   a   right   to
       Administrative Review,  the  time  for  applying  for  Administrative
       Review has expired, or the Administrative  Review  is  decided.   The
       continuation of any leave granted to a person by operation of s3C  of
       the 1971 Act does not extend beyond that provided  for  in  the  1971
       Act, and is not in my judgment  extended  by  any  provision  in  the
       immigration rules that permits the decision maker  to  disregard  any
       period of overstaying.  If parliament had intended s3C to be extended
       in such  a  way,  it  would  have  expressly  provided  for  such  an
       extension.


   18. The requirement under paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the  immigration  rules
       is that the appellant must have had  at  least  10  years  continuous
       lawful residence in the UK.  Paragraph  276A(a)  of  the  immigration
       rules provides that "continuous residence" means residence in the  UK
       for an unbroken period. The rule sets out a number  of  circumstances
       in which a period shall  not  be  considered  to  have  been  broken.
       Paragraph 276A(b) provides that "lawful  residence"  means  residence
       which is continuous residence pursuant to, inter alia, existing leave
       to enter or remain.


   19. The appellant here  has  continuous  lawful  residence  between  12th
       October 2006 and 6th April  2016.   He  could  not  therefore  in  my
       judgment, satisfy the requirement of paragraph  276B(i)(a)the  rules.
       In reaching his decision, the FtT Judge conflates the requirements of
       paragraph 276B(i)(a) and 276B(v) of the immigration rules.  Paragraph
       276B(v) of the rules provides that the applicant must not be  in  the
       UK in breach of immigration laws, except that, where paragraph 39E of
       the  rules  applies,  any  current  period  of  overstaying  will  be
       disregarded. That is not to say that the period of overstaying is  to
       be treated as a period of lawful residence.  The rules  simply  makes
       provision for a short period of overstaying  to  be  disregarded.  An
       individual that has 'overstayed' in the UK cannot in my  judgment  be
       regarded as  an  individual  that  is  exercising  continuous  lawful
       residence in the UK, whilst he  or  she  remains  in  the  UK  as  an
       'overstayer'.


   20. It is clear from the structure of paragraph 276B of  the  rules  that
       there are five requirements that must be met.  They are five separate
       and freestanding requirements, and in my judgement, an applicant  who
       cannot otherwise satisfy the requirement that they have had at  least
       10 years continuous lawful residence in the UK, cannot rely upon  the
       provision that a short period of overstaying is to be disregarded, as
       counting towards the  requirement  for  10  years  continuous  lawful
       residence.


   21. That in itself is sufficient to establish that the  decision  of  the
       FtT Judge is infected by a material error of law  because  the  Judge
       proceeds  upon  the  premise  that  the   appellant   satisfies   the
       requirements the immigration rules and therefore his removal would be
       disproportionate on Article 8 grounds.  In my judgment, the appellant
       cannot meet the requirement set out at paragraph  276B(i)(a)  of  the
       rules.


   22. However, the respondent  had  also  said  in  the  decision  of  14th
       December 2017 that the appellant fell for refusal under  the  general
       grounds for refusal.  The respondent referred to paragraph 322(5)  of
       the rules.  That is, the undesirability of permitting  the  appellant
       to  remain  in  the  UK  in  light  of  his  conduct,  character   or
       associations or the fact that he  represents  a  threat  to  national
       security.  The  respondent  referred  to  discrepancies  between  the
       appellant's earnings declared to the respondent  in  support  of  the
       applications made on 11th February 2011 and 2nd March  2013  and  the
       self-employed earnings declared by the appellant to HMRC for the  tax
       years ending 2011 and 2013.


   23. In his application dated 11th February 2011,  the  appellant  claimed
       that he had previous earnings of �43,230.55, during  the  period  1st
       February 2010 and 31st  January 2011.  Checks by the respondent  with
       HMRC disclosed declared earnings of �17,704.00. The  income  declared
       to HMRC would not have demonstrated sufficient  earnings  to  qualify
       for the points required by the appellant.


   24. In his application dated 2nd March 2013, the appellant  claimed  that
       he had previous earnings of �40,308.82 between 1st February 2012  and
       31st  January  2013.  That   included   self-employed   earnings   of
       �17,018.00.  Checks with HMRC revealed  total  earnings  declared  to
       HMRC of �25,349, significantly lower than the �40,308.82  claimed  by
       the appellant in  support  of  his  application  to  the  respondent.
       Again, the income  declared  to  HMRC  would  not  have  demonstrated
       sufficient earnings  to  qualify  for  the  points  required  by  the
       appellant.


   25. At paragraph [39] of his decision, the  FtT  Judge  notes  that  "The
       appellant accepts that the figures presented in his tax  returns  was
       in error and as soon as he knew he moved to correct the error.".   At
       paragraph [40], the FtT Judge referred to the decision of Mr  Justice
       Foskett in R  (Ngouh)  -v-  SSHD  [2010]  EWHC  (sic)  Civ  2218  and
       concluded at [41] and [42] as follows:


             "4.1 I am satisfied the fact there were factual errors in  the
             information provided by  the  appellant  and,  therefore,  the
             initial burden of proof moves to the appellant to establish  a
             reasonable explanation for the  discrepancies.  The  appellant
             gave evidence and adopted his statement. He was cross-examined
             by Mr Swaby. With the exception of  establishing  the  various
             documents Mr Swaby did not challenge the  credibility  of  the
             appellant. Having heard the appellant's  evidence  and  having
             considered his statement  setting  out  the  reasons  for  the
             events that unfolded in 2011 and 2013 and taking into  account
             the burden and standard of proof I cannot  conclude  that  the
             appellant's  answer  is  unreasonable.  Having  established  a
             reasonable  explanation,  I  am  satisfied   the   appellant's
             explanations were not undermined by  the  respondent.  I  take
             note that [from] the refusal letter I  cannot  assess  whether
             the respondent balanced the positive side of  the  appellant's
             case before reaching  the  decision  she  did.   I  find  that
             without conducting such a balancing exercise of the  facts  it
             dangerous and arguably unfair to rely upon paragraph 322 (5).


             42.  Having considered all the evidence in the round both  for
             and against the appellant I cannot conclude the respondent has
             established that the actions of the appellant in regard to his
             applications for 11th February 2011 and  the  2nd  March  2013
             breaches paragraph 322 (5) of The Rules."


   26. In my judgement, the consideration by the FtT Judge  of  whether  the
       appellant fell for refusal under  the  general  grounds  for  refusal
       (i.e. paragraph 322(5) of the  rules)  was  also  flawed.   Paragraph
       322(5) of the rules is a discretionary provision (a ground  on  which
       leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter  or  remain  should
       normally be refused) and on appeal, the Judge was required to  decide
       in this context whether the respondent  was  right  to  exercise  the
       discretion against the appellant, and conclude that it is undesirable
       to permit the appellant to remain in the  UK  in  the  light  of  his
       conduct, character or associations.


   27. The fact that there were discrepancies between the figures  presented
       by the appellant in his two applications (in 2011 and  2013)  to  the
       respondent,  and  his  tax  returns  to  HMRC  was  accepted  by  the
       appellant.  The  appellant's  explanation  that  there  were  genuine
       errors borne of the fact that  he  had  handled  his  self-assessment
       returns himself, without  professional  help,  and  with  a  mistaken
       understanding of allowable expenses, was accepted by the  Judge.   It
       not clear what the Judge was referring to when he  stated,  at  [41],
       that "..I take note that the refusal letter I cannot  assess  whether
       the respondent has balanced the positive side of the appellant's case
       before reaching the decision she did.", because  the  refusal  letter
       was before the  FtT  Judge,  and  the  matters  relied  upon  by  the
       respondent would have been apparent.  However, the FtT Judge went  on
       to find that without conducting a balancing exercise of the facts  it
       is dangerous and arguably unfair to rely upon  paragraph  322(5).   I
       accept, as Mr Malik submits, that the question for the  Tribunal  was
       not  whether  it  was  "dangerous"  or  "arguably  unfair"  for   the
       respondent to rely upon paragraph 322(5).  the Judge was required  to
       decide whether the respondent was right to  exercise  the  discretion
       against the appellant, and conclude that it is undesirable to  permit
       the appellant to remain in the  UK  in  the  light  of  his  conduct,
       character or associations.


   28. In R (Nghou) -v- SSHD [2010] EWHC 2218, Mr Justice Foskett held  that
       where an offence was committed during  a  person's  Army  career,  it
       could not simply be said that the nature and existence of an  unspent
       conviction cast very significant doubt upon  the  person's  character
       and conduct, for the purposes of and application for indefinite leave
       to remain, without a close investigation of  all  the  circumstances.
       He noted, at  paragraph  [120],  that  the  decision  would  need  to
       demonstrate that both the positive and negative aspects were  weighed
       up fully and fairly, not merely the positive and negative aspects  of
       the offence, but also other (potentially positive) factors that would
       make it 'desirable' that the applicant should be permitted to  remain
       in the UK.


   29. At paragraph [42] of his decision, the Judge  concluded  that  having
       considered all the evidence in the round, both for  and  against  the
       appellant, he cannot conclude the respondent has established that the
       actions of the appellant in  regard  to  his  applications  for  11th
       February 2011 and 2nd March 2013 breached  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       rules.  That appears to be a finding that the respondent was wrong to
       exercise the discretion against the appellant, but the Judge fails to
       identify the factors  that  weigh  in  favour  of,  and  against  the
       appellant.  The Judge accepted  that  there  had  been  an  'innocent
       mistake', and presumably accepted the submission made  on  behalf  of
       the appellant  that  the  appellant  had  an  impeccable  immigration
       history,  a  commitment  to  the  UK,  and  had  been  in   continual
       employment.  However, the Judge failed to have regard to factors that
       weigh against the appellant.  The mistakes were mistakes that  go  to
       the heart of the system of immigration control.   As  the  respondent
       had noted in the decision of 14th December 2017,  had  the  appellant
       declared to the respondent the same earnings, as he had  declared  to
       HMRC in 2011 and 2013, the appellant  would  not  have  acquired  the
       required points for a grant of leave to remain on each of  those  two
       previous occasions.


   30. Although it may have been open  in  the  end  to  the  FtT  Judge  to
       conclude that the respondent was wrong  to  exercise  his  discretion
       under paragraph 322(5) in a way that is adverse to the appellant,  in
       my judgement the FtT Judge failed to address  the  correct  question.
       The question  was  not  "whether  the  explanation  provided  by  the
       appellant was  reasonable"  or  "whether  the  explanation  had  been
       undermined by the respondent " or  whether  "it  was  "dangerous"  or
       "arguably unfair" for the respondent to rely upon  paragraph  322(5).
       The question was simply whether the respondent's decision to exercise
       his discretion under paragraph 322(5) in a way that is adverse to the
       appellant, was justified on its merits.


   31. As I have already said, the Judge proceeds upon the premise that  the
       appellant satisfies the requirements the immigration  rules  and  his
       removal would be disproportionate on  Article  8  grounds.   The  FtT
       Judge does not address whether Article  8  is  engaged  at  all.   He
       states, at  [45],  that  he  is  satisfied  that  "..to  remove  this
       appellant and his family from the  UK  when  he  has  established  he
       satisfies the Immigration Rules would be disproportionate." and  that
       "I have factored in  the  best  interests  of  his  two  children  as
       required by section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration
       Act 2009".       Quite apart from the fact that the appellant  cannot
       satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  rules,  particularly   paragraph
       276B(i)(a) for the reasons I have set out, the consideration  of  the
       Article 8 claim is cursory at best.  The Judge fails to identify  the
       factual basis upon which he considered the Article 8 claim based upon
       the appellant's family and private life and the best interests of the
       children.


   32. In my judgement, it is plain that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal involved in the making of an error on a point  of  law.   It
       follows that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal   must  be  set
       aside.


   33. I must then consider whether to remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, or to re-make the decision myself.  I consider the decision
       of the FtT Judge as to whether the requirements  paragraph  276B  are
       met, to be flawed.  There needs  to  be  a  proper  consideration  of
       paragraph 322(5) of the rules,  and  the  failure  of  the  Judge  to
       address the correct question and make a lawful  decision  as  regards
       paragraph 322(5) means that the appropriate course is  to  remit  the
       matter to a newly constituted First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing
       with no findings preserved.  In reaching my decision,  I  have  taken
       into  account  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
       Statement of 25th September 2012.  In my  view,  in  determining  the
       appeal, the nature and extent of any judicial fact-finding  necessary
       will be extensive. The parties will be advised of  the  date  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal hearing in due course.
