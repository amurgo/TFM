                            NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT

1. Whilst this is an appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO),  for
   convenience I will refer to the parties  in  the  determination  as  they
   appeared before the First-tier Tribunal

2. Mr Davidson advised the Tribunal at the hearing that  the  appellant  was
   granted entry clearance  pursuant  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
   decision promulgated on 4 July  2014  allowing  her  appeal  against  the
   refusal of entry clearance. The appellant has since entered the UK  as  a
   visitor and was in fact present in Court. He advised that  the  reference
   for the grant of entry clearance is 014980152.

3. Mr Davidson submitted that the ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal  should
   therefore be treated as abandoned in accordance  with  Rule  17A  of  the
   Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as  amended).  Mr  Walker
   had no objection to this course of action.

4. As the appellant has been granted leave to enter the UK the ECO's  appeal
   should be treated as abandoned under Rule 17A of the  Tribunal  Procedure
   (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
