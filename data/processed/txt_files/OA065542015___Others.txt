Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   None


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondents are referred to as Claimants 1, 2 and 3.

2.   At  the  outset  of  the  hearing  there  was  no  appearance  for  the
    Claimants.  They had previously  instructed  and  been  represented  by
    Goodfellows Solicitors of 12 Selkirk Road, London  SW17  0ES  and  have
    been represented also by their Sponsor,  Mr  Adeel  Ahmad.   Notice  of
    hearing was served  on  the  Claimants,  the  representatives  and  the
    Sponsor by letter, dated 5 August 2016, giving the  time  and  date  of
    hearing on 5 September at Field House with its address.  No submissions
    have been made by the representatives nor the  Sponsor  nor  anyone  on
    behalf of the Claimants seeking  to  either  adjourn  or  postpone  the
    hearing or on the substance of the appeals.

3.   Tribunal staff telephoned the  Claimants'  representatives  Goodfellows
    Solicitors, who said  they  were  without  instructions  and  were  not
    appearing.

4.   In the circumstances I decided  that  the  fair  and  just  and  timely
    disposal of Tribunal business required that the appeal  be  considered.
    I  could  find  no  unfairness  or  prejudice  to  the  Claimants  from
    proceeding in the absence of representatives or the Sponsor.

5.   The ECO's decision is dated 7 March 2015 refusing admission  under  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the   2006
    Regulations).

6.   The matter came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  J  K  Swaney  (the
    judge), who on 18 February 2016 allowed the appeals  of  the  Claimants
    under the 2006  Regulations.   A  fee  award  was  made  but  not  with
    reference to any particular sum: A fee had been paid of ï¿½140  for  each
    Claimant.

7.   The grounds, upon which permission was  given  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge A D Baker on 2 August 2016, were not particularly  clear  but  in
    essence the  ECO  challenge  really  amounted  to  a  lack  of  reasons
    challenge.  In this respect I was satisfied that it could be considered
    on that basis and the language of the permission, whilst  unclear,  did
    not constrain the challenge to the reasons for the judge's conclusions.

8.   It is of note that submissions on  behalf  of  the  ECO  had  correctly
    addressed the relevant date, being an assessment of the information  as
    at the date of the ECO's decision, [D22].  Unfortunately the submission
    was made and seemingly accepted that the relevant date was the date  of
    the judge's decision.  In  this  respect  although  that  is  generally
    correct in terms of 'in country' EEA 2006 Regulation appeals  the  fact
    is that it is the date of application in 'out of country' appeals.

9.   The judge having heard and recorded those conflicting  submissions  D28
    seems to have merged the two issues and it is unclear at what date  the
    judge was dealing with the evidence.

10.  Be that as it  may,  the  judge  accepted  that  the  first  and  third
    Claimants were family members within the meaning of Regulation  7(1)(c)
    of the 2006 Regulations.  However,  the  judge  did  not  consider  the
    nature of their dependency at the date of the ECO's decisions.   It  is
    to be noted for example that when the date of  decision  was  in  March
    2015 but it was not until November 2015 that the first Claimant gave up
    employment.  This raises the important point as to whether there  is  a
    dependency based around necessity.

11.  In the case of Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 it is clear  that  there  needs
    to be dependency related to particular necessity.  It is  necessary  to
    determine whether that family member is dependent in the sense of being
    in need of assistance.  It is not simply a matter of choosing to accept
    additional monies for whatever reason they are being given. It needs to
    be established why the dependant is dependant because  of  money  being
    given or because for example the person is unwilling to work:  In  this
    respect  it  is  clear  that  dependency  purely  decided  upon  as   a
    consequence of  an  EU  national  making  resources  available  to  the
    relative is not sufficient to establish that dependency; see Lim [ 29].

12.  The Court of Appeal in Lim also decided that the  view  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Storey had  given  in  Lim  was  not  to  be  followed.   In  the
    circumstances  dependency  by  choice  is  not  a   justification   for
    establishing responsibilities.

13.  Therefore the judge's reasons for concluding that the first  and  third
    Claimants were present dependants was not established by  reference  to
    the Sponsor in the UK's means at the  date  of  decision  by  the  ECO.
    Similarly the position was that the second Claimant was not a dependant
    at the date of that decision.  Therefore the  judge  on  the  evidence,
    which the judge had at the time,  could  not  reasonably  in  law  have
    concluded that there was the present dependency, necessary to  succeed,
    irrespective of the issue of  whether  there  was  past  dependency  in
    relation to the second Claimant: Were  one  to  consider  the  case  of
    Dauhoo [2012] UKUT 79 which I do not regard as being directly  relevant
    in this out of country appeal.

14.  What is clear is that the judge did take  into  account  after  arising
    information as at the  date  of  the  hearing.   There  is  nothing  to
    indicate that that was the correct  basis  to  do  so  come  what  may.
    Accordingly I was  satisfied  that  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision
    showed errors of law and could not stand for each of the Claimants.

15.  I heard submissions from Mr Kotas as  to  whether  or  not  the  matter
    should be remade in the  Upper  Tribunal  or  the  First-tier.   I  was
    content having considered his submissions that the right course was  to
    remake the decision in the Upper Tribunal with the file relating to the
    circumstances of the Sponsor  at  the  material  time.   Of  particular
    concern was the UK  Sponsor's,  already  considerable  dependency  upon
    public funding, ability to fund the Claimants. It was not clear  as  to
    how there could be as a fact any actual dependency at  all  because  of
    the Sponsor's limited means come what may.

16.  In the circumstances, having looked at the evidence again,  I  did  not
    find that the Claimants had discharged  the  burden  of  proof  upon  a
    balance of probabilities that they met the  requirements  of  the  2006
    Regulations  at  the  date  of  the   ECO's   decision.    Accordingly,
    irrespective of the facts of the  matter,  in  relation  to  the  third
    Claimant, I nevertheless concluded that their claims could not  succeed
    because quite simply there were not the funds to support any dependency
    of necessity.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeals of each Claimant are dismissed.

No anonymity order was previously  made  and  I  do  not  find  one  is  now
necessary or appropriate.
