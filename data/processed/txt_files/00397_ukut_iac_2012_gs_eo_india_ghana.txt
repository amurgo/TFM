Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Bourne instructed by the Treasury Solicitor
For GS:     Ms N Lieven QC, Mr D O'Callaghan and Ms J Lean instructed by
                    Jasvir Jutla & Co Solicitors
For EO:     Miss N Benitez instructed by Irving & Co Solicitors

      (i) The  fact  that  life  expectancy  is  dramatically  shortened  by
      withdrawal of medical  treatment  in  the  host  state  is  in  itself
      incapable of amounting to the highly exceptional case that engages the
      Article 3 duty.


      (ii) There are recognised departures from the high threshold  approach
      in cases concerning  children,  discriminatory  denial  of  treatment,
      absence of resources through civil war or similar human agency.


      (iii) Article 8 cases may also require a different approach  and  will
      do so where health questions arise in  the  context  of  obstacles  to
      relocation.


      (iv) Any extension of the principles set out in N v SSHD  [2005]  UKHL
      31 and N v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 39 will  be  for  the  higher
      courts.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This  judgment  is  one  to  which  all  members  of  the  panel  have
      contributed. These appeals raise the common question of whether and if
      so, in what circumstances, Article 3 of the  European  Convention  for
      the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms  (Rome  1950)
      ("ECHR") is infringed by the removal of an individual from the UK to a
      country where he or she will  be  unable  to  receive  life-sustaining
      medical treatment which is being provided in the UK and which, in  its
      absence, will lead to the death of the individual  in  a  short  time.
      Both appeals are subject to anonymity orders.

   2. Both GS and EO (whom we shall refer to as the "claimants") suffer from
      chronic advanced kidney disease which  is  irreversible  and  requires
      dialysis three times a week.  Without dialysis, the  medical  evidence
      is that GS would die within one to two weeks and EO would  die  within
      two to three weeks.  Although kidney dialysis is  available  in  their
      respective countries, namely India and Ghana, that treatment would not
      be available to them because of the cost and practical  difficulty  of
      accessing it.

   3. Central to both appeals  is  the  scope  of  Art  3  of  the  ECHR  as
      interpreted in the leading cases of D v United Kingdom (1997) 24  EHRR
      423 (ECtHR); N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31  (HL)  and  N  v  United  Kingdom
      (2008) 47 EHRR 39 (ECtHR).

The Appeals

   4. The facts in relation to both appeals are not now in dispute.

      GS

   5. GS was born on 1 March 1981.  He is a citizen of  India.   He  entered
      the United Kingdom on 1  November  2004  with  entry  clearance  as  a
      working-holidaymaker.  His leave was valid until 29 October  2006  but
      thereafter he overstayed.

   6. On 5 January 2009, medical tests confirmed that he had  problems  with
      his kidneys. He has been diagnosed with advance chronic kidney disease
      which is an irreversible condition.  He requires dialysis three  times
      per week, each session lasting for four hours.  He only has one kidney
      probably due to a genetic absence of his right  kidney.   He  requires
      the dialysis in order to remain alive.   The medical evidence is  that
      he  would  die  within  one  to  two  weeks  if  the   treatment   was
      discontinued.

   7. On 5 February 2009, GS applied for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
      Kingdom on compassionate grounds relying on Arts 3 and 8 of the  ECHR.
       On 12 March 2010, the Secretary of State refused his application  and
      made a decision to remove him by way of directions to India under s.10
      of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

   8. GS appealed to the First-tier Tribunal ("F-tT").  In  a  determination
      sent on 14 June 2010, Judge Ian Dove QC allowed GS's appeal.

   9. The Judge accepted that the appellant had close contact  with  uncles,
      aunts and cousins in the UK. He accepted that he had a mother and  two
      brothers in India but that his mother was in poor health.  He accepted
      that his family were not in a position to provide him  with  financial
      support and that, while kidney dialysis was available in India, due to
      GS's circumstances that would not be available  to  him  and  that  he
      would die within one to two weeks of returning to India.

  10. Having referred to the decision of the Strasbourg Court in D v UK  and
      of the House of Lords in N v SSHD, Judge  Dove  QC  concluded  that  a
      breach of Art 3 had been established. He held that GS's  circumstances
      fell within the "category of exceptionality" recognised  in  the  case
      law because of the "immediacy of his death"  upon  the  withdrawal  of
      treatment on his return to India.

  11. The Secretary of State appealed to  the  Upper  Tribunal  ("UT")  and,
      following the grant of permission (SIJ Freeman), the  UT  allowed  the
      Secretary of State's appeal and dismissed GS's  appeal  on  the  basis
      that no breach of Art 3 (or  indeed  Art  8)  of  the  ECHR  had  been
      established (see GS (Article 3 - Health - Exceptionality) India [2011]
      UKUT 35 (IAC) (Lord Bannatyne and SIJ Allen). The  UT  concluded  that
      the F-tT had erred in law in  finding  that  GS's  circumstances  fell
      within the "exceptional" category recognised in N v SSHD and D  v  UK.
      The UT went on to remake the decision and dismissed the appeal.

  12. GS then appealed to the Court of Appeal and, following  the  grant  of
      permission to appeal by Toulson LJ, the appeal was remitted by consent
      to the UT in order to determine whether "the consequences of  lack  of
      funds are capable of making a case exceptional in  terms  of  N".   In
      fact, this ground was not specifically relied upon before  us  by  the
      Secretary of State.  Rather, the appeal was argued both by  Mr  Bourne
      (on behalf of the Secretary of State) and Ms Lieven QC (on  behalf  of
      GS) more generally on the basis of  whether  GS's  circumstances  fell
      within the exceptional category in D v UK on the premise that dialysis
      treatment was not, for whatever reason, available to him in India.

      EO

  13. EO was born on 24 January 1970 and is a citizen of Ghana.   He  has  a
      wife and son, now aged 7 in Ghana.  On 26 March 2005,  he  arrived  in
      the United Kingdom on a short term work permit  valid  until  1  April
      2005 in order to work as a musician.  EO overstayed.

  14. In 2006 he became ill and was diagnosed with end-stage renal  failure.
      He requires dialysis three times a week  and  the  prognosis  is  that
      without dialysis he will probably die within two to three  weeks.   He
      also suffers from hyper-tension.

  15. On 1 March 2010, EO was arrested.  He claimed  asylum.   Following  an
      interview,  on  5  May  2010,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  his
      application for asylum under para 336  of  HC  395  (as  amended)  and
      refused to grant him leave to remain under Arts 3 and 8 on  the  basis
      of  his  medical  condition.    EO  appealed  to  the  F-tT.    In   a
      determination  dated  14  July  2010,  Judge  Hedworth   allowed   the
      appellant's appeal under Art 3 of the ECHR.  The Judge  accepted  that
      dialysis was available in Ghana but the cost was such that EO and  his
      family would not be able to afford  the  treatment  which  would  cost
      around ï¿½3,000 every three months.  The  Judge  accepted  that  without
      dialysis treatment EO would die within two to three weeks on return to
      Ghana. Having referred to the case law, Judge Hedworth concluded  that
      EO's case was "an exceptional  one"  because  the  high  cost  of  the
      treatment (which was available) meant that it was a  "certainty"  that
      EO could not afford it.

  16. The Secretary of  State  appealed  with  permission  (granted  by  SIJ
      Freeman) to the UT.  The Upper Tribunal (SIJ McGeachy) concluded  that
      the  F-tT  had  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  EO's  case  was  an
      "exceptional" one and remade the decision dismissing his appeal  under
      Art 3 (and Art 8) of the ECHR.

  17. EO appealed to the  Court  of  Appeal  and,  following  the  grant  of
      permission by Hooper  LJ,  the  appeal  was  allowed  by  consent  and
      remitted to the UT.  Following remittal, the UT  (Coulson  J  and  UTJ
      Latter) again found that the F-tT had erred in  law  in  allowing  the
      appeal and adjourned the hearing in  order  for  the  decision  to  be
      remade.  The re-making of the decision fell to  us  at  the  adjourned
      hearing.

The Issues

  18. In relation to GS we must decide whether Judge Dove QC erred in law in
      allowing the appellant's appeal and, if he did,  we  must  remake  the
      decision.  In relation to EO, the error of  law  in  Judge  Hedworth's
      decision has already been identified by the UT and it falls to  us  to
      remake the decision.

  19. In both appeals, the appellants rely exclusively upon  Art  3  of  the
      ECHR.  No reliance is placed upon Art 8.  Although we invited them  to
      do so, neither  Counsel  for  the  Secretary  of  State  nor  for  the
      appellants sought to address us  on  Art  8  and,  indeed,  Mr  Bourne
      invited us not to deal with Art 8 as we had not heard  submissions  in
      relation to it.

  20. We are grateful for the assistance given by Counsel in  their  helpful
      written submissions and also in  their  oral  submissions  before  us.
      Subsequent to the hearing, at our request, by  letter  dated  31  July
      2012 the Secretary of State provided us  with  information  (including
      the relevant Enforcement Instructions and Guidance  (ch  53))  dealing
      with the practicalities of removing a person with  a  medical  problem
      from  the  UK.  The  essence  of  the  parties'  submissions  may   be
      encapsulated as follows.

  21. Miss Lieven QC, on behalf of GS submitted that Judge Dove QC  had  not
      erred in law in allowing GS's appeal under Art 3.  She submitted  that
      the  Judge  was  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  GS's  case   was
      "exceptional" as recognised by the Strasbourg Court in D v UK and N  v
      UK.   The category of  "exceptional"  case  was  not  limited  to  the
      factual situation in D v UK where the individual was dying  and  would
      die in the UK from his underlying condition in any  event.   The  fact
      that an individual's continued presence in  the  UK  would  impose  an
      obligation (indefinite or otherwise) on the UK  to  provide  treatment
      was not the crucial issue and N v UK was not to be understood  to  the
      contrary.  The proper focus was on the individual's  circumstances  in
      his own country on return.  Treatment would not be available to GS  on
      return because he could not afford  it  and  it  was  not  practically
      available to him.  It did not matter that the  unavailability  of  the
      treatment was only because GS could not afford it or because it  could
      not be accessed in practice.   Judge Dove QC had  taken  into  account
      all  the  circumstances  of  GS.   Although  Art  3  imposed  a  "high
      threshold" in cases where the individual's claim  was  that  necessary
      life-sustaining medical treatment would not be available in their  own
      country, Judge Dove  QC  was  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  the
      certainty of GS's death on return in a  very  short  period  of  time,
      namely one to two weeks made his  circumstances  "exceptional".    The
      contrary view of Toulson LJ expressed when refusing permission  in  BC
      (India) [2007] EWCA Civ 1438 should  not  be  followed.  N  v  UK  was
      distinguishable because N could survive  in  her  own  country  for  a
      number of years without treatment.

  22. Miss Benitez invited us to allow EO's appeal on the same  basis.   She
      adopted Ms Lieven QC's submissions on the law.  Treatment would not be
      available to EO in Ghana because he could not afford  that  treatment.
      Given the circumstances  that  he  would  face  in  Ghana,  namely  an
      unpleasant and imminent death within two to  three  weeks,  EO's  case
      also  fell  within  the  "exceptional  category"  recognised  by   the
      Strasbourg Court.

  23. Mr Bourne on behalf of the Secretary of State submitted  that  neither
      appellant's circumstances were "exceptional".    Mr  Bourne  submitted
      that it was  not  sufficient  for  an  individual  to  establish  that
      treatment will not be available in their own country and that  without
      it the individual would die.  Mr Bourne  did  not  seek  to  draw  any
      distinction between the situations  where  treatment  was  simply  not
      available and where it was available but  could  not  be  afforded  or
      access was impracticable for the particular individual.

  24. Mr Bourne submitted that on the basis of D v UK and N v UK the correct
      approach was to look at the individual's circumstances  in  their  own
      country and to determine whether  (1)  the  individual's  illness  had
      reached a critical stage (i.e. he or she was dying) and (2) on  return
      the individual would encounter a lack of medical and  social  services
      (including  family  and  other  support)  which  would  prevent  acute
      suffering such that they  could  not  die  with  dignity.   Mr  Bourne
      submitted that the fact that an individual would die  within  a  short
      period of time was not sufficient to make  a  case  "exceptional".  He
      placed reliance upon the decision of Toulson LJ refusing permission to
      appeal to the Court of Appeal in BC (India).

  25. On this basis, Mr Bourne submitted that Judge Dove QC had erred in law
      by focussing on the immediacy of GS's death on return to conclude  the
      case was "exceptional".  In  relation  to  both  GS  and  EO,  neither
      appellant would face a situation where, given the support available to
      them, they would die without dignity and so both their appeals  should
      be dismissed.

The Cases

  26. We begin with  the  decision  of  the  Strasbourg  Court  in  D  v  UK
      (Application 30240/96) (1997)  24 EHRR 423

      D v UK

  27. D was a national  of  St  Kitts.   He  was  convicted  in  the  UK  of
      possession of prohibited drugs and imprisoned.  Whilst in  prison,  he
      was diagnosed as suffering from AIDS.  Shortly before his  release  on
      licence, the Secretary of State issued directions for his  removal  to
      St Kitts.  D applied for leave to remain in the UK on the  basis  that
      his removal would entail the loss of vital medical  treatment  he  was
      receiving for his condition and that  his  life  expectancy  would  be
      shortened.  It was accepted that D was in the  advanced  stages  of  a
      terminal and incurable illness.  It  was  accepted  that  the  limited
      quality of  life  that  he  enjoyed  was  due  to  the  treatment  and
      medication he received in the UK and the support he received from  his
      carers.  By contrast, the evidence was that D  had  no  family  in  St
      Kitts to provide him support and he had no prospect of medical care in
      St Kitts of the sort that  he  benefited  from  in  the  UK.   It  was
      accepted that D's prognosis was very poor and, even with the treatment
      in the UK, his life expectancy was limited to eight to twelve  months.
      The circumstances on his return to St Kitts were such  that  his  life
      expectancy would be shortened.  The European  Court  of  Human  Rights
      concluded (at [54]) that in the "very  exceptional  circumstances"  of
      D's case and "given the compelling  humanitarian  considerations"  his
      removal would amount to inhuman treatment falling within Art 3 of  the
      ECHR.

  28. The Court began  by  recognising  the  well-established  principle  of
      international  law  that  States,  subject  to   their   international
      obligations including under the European Convention, had  a  right  to
      control the entry and residence and expulsion of aliens,  particularly
      in the context of criminal offenders involved in drug  trafficking  or
      who were drug couriers such as D  (see  [46]).   At  [47],  the  Court
      recognised that a state's right to expel aliens was subject to,  inter
      alia, the obligation under Art 3 of the Convention which prohibited in
      absolute  terms  "torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading   treatment   or
      punishment".

  29. The Court noted, however, that the situation in D's case was  somewhat
      different from the usual.   The  court  recognised  that  usually  the
      prohibited form of treatment under Art 3 to which an individual  would
      be exposed on return emanated  from  the  state  itself  or  non-state
      bodies against which  the  state  was  unable  to  afford  appropriate
      protection.  Here, however, D was not claiming that the source of  any
      risk  to  him  arose  directly  or  indirectly  as  a  result  of  the
      responsibility of the receiving  state.   Nevertheless,  at  [49]  the
      Court recognised that in principle Art 3 could be engaged  in  such  a
      situation.  The Court said this.

           "49.  .... Aside from these situations and given the fundamental
                 importance of Article 3 in the convention system, the Court
                 must reserve to itself sufficient  flexibility  to  address
                 the application of that Article  in  other  contexts  which
                 might  arise.   It  is   not   therefore   prevented   from
                 scrutinising an applicant's claim under Article 3 where the
                 source of the risk of proscribed treatment in the receiving
                 country stems  from  factors  which  cannot  engage  either
                 directly or indirectly the  responsibility  of  the  public
                 authorities of that country, or which, taken alone, do  not
                 in themselves infringe the standards of that  Article.   To
                 limit the application of Article 3 in this manner would  be
                 to undermine the absolute character of its protection.   In
                 any such contexts, however, the Court must subject all  the
                 circumstances surrounding the case to a rigorous  scrutiny,
                 especially  the  applicant's  personal  situation  in   the
                 expelling State."

  30. The Court, having recognised what was undoubtedly an extension of  the
      existing case law, then went on to assess D's "personal situation"  in
      St Kitts.  At [50]-[52] the  Court  set  out  its  assessment  of  D's
      circumstances as follows:

           "50.  Against this background the Court will  determine  whether
                 there is a real risk that the applicant's removal would  be
                 contrary to the standards of Article 3 (art. 3) in view  of
                 his present medical condition.  In so doing the Court  will
                 assess the risk in the light of the material before  it  at
                 the time of its consideration of the  case,  including  the
                 most recent information on his state  of  health  (see  the
                 Ahmed judgment, loc. cit., p. 2207, para. 43).


           51.         The  Court  notes  that  the  applicant  is  in  the
                 advanced stages of a terminal and  incurable  illness.   At
                 the date of the hearing, it was  observed  that  there  had
                 been a marked decline in his condition and  he  had  to  be
                 transferred to a hospital.  His condition was  giving  rise
                 to concern (see paragraph 21 above).  The  limited  quality
                 of life he now enjoys  results  from  the  availability  of
                 sophisticated  treatment  and  medication  in  the   United
                 Kingdom  and  the  care  and  kindness  administered  by  a
                 charitable organisation.  He has been counselled on how  to
                 approach death and has formed bonds with  his  carers  (see
                 paragraph 19 above).


           52.         The  abrupt  withdrawal  of  these  facilities  will
                 entail the most dramatic consequences for him.  It  is  not
                 disputed that his removal will hasten his death.  There  is
                 a serious danger that the  conditions  of  adversity  which
                 await him in St  Kitts  will  further  reduce  his  already
                 limited life expectancy and subject him to acute mental and
                 physical suffering.  Any medical treatment which  he  might
                 hope to      receive  there  could  not  contend  with  the
                 infections which he may possibly contract on account of his
                 lack of shelter and of a proper diet as well as exposure to
                 the  health  and  sanitation  problems  which   beset   the
                 population of St Kitts (see paragraph 32 above).  While  he
                 may have a cousin in St Kitts (see paragraph 18 above),  no
                 evidence has been adduced to show whether this person would
                 be willing or in a position to attend to  the  needs  of  a
                 terminally ill man.  There is no evidence of any other form
                 of moral or social support.  Nor has it been shown  whether
                 the applicant would be guaranteed a bed in  either  of  the
                 hospitals on the island which, according to the Government,
                 care for AIDS patients."

  31. The Court assessed the situation in St Kitts and, describing  them  as
      being  "exceptional  circumstances"  ([53])  and   "very   exceptional
      circumstances" ([54]), found that D's removal would be a violation  of
      Art 3:

           "53.  In view of these exceptional circumstances and bearing  in
                 mind the critical stage  now  reached  in  the  applicant's
                 fatal illness, the implementation of the decision to remove
                 him to St Kitts would amount to inhuman  treatment  by  the
                 respondent State in violation of Article 3.


                 The Court also notes in this respect  that  the  respondent
                 State  has  assumed   responsibility   for   treating   the
                 applicant's condition since August  1994.   He  has  become
                 reliant on the medical and palliative care which he  is  at
                 present receiving and is no doubt psychologically  prepared
                 for death in an environment  which  is  both  familiar  and
                 compassionate.   Although  it  cannot  be  said  that   the
                 conditions  which  would  confront  him  in  the  receiving
                 country are themselves a breach of the standards of Article
                 3 (art. 3), his removal would expose him to a real risk  of
                 dying under most distressing circumstances and  would  thus
                 amount to inhuman treatment.


                 Without  calling  into  question  the  good  faith  of  the
                 undertaking given to  the  Court  by  the  Government  (see
                 paragraph 44 above), it is  to  be  noted  that  the  above
                 considerations must be seen as  wider  in  scope  than  the
                 question whether or not the applicant is fit to travel back
                 to St Kitts.


           54.         Against this background the  Court  emphasises  that
                 aliens who have  served  their  prison  sentences  and  are
                 subject  to  expulsion  cannot  in  principle   claim   any
                 entitlement to remain in the  territory  of  a  Contracting
                 State in order to continue to benefit from medical,  social
                 or other forms of  assistance  provided  by  the  expelling
                 State during their stay in prison.


                  However, in the very  exceptional  circumstances  of  this
                 case and given the compelling  humanitarian  considerations
                 at stake, it must be concluded that the  implementation  of
                 the decision to remove the applicant would be  a  violation
                 of Article 3."

  32. Clearly, the facts of D  v  UK  were,  on  any  view,  stark.   D  was
      terminally ill, being in the advanced  stages  of  AIDS,  and  it  was
      assessed that he would die in the UK even with treatment  and  support
      in less than twelve months.  His circumstances on return to  St  Kitts
      were bleak.  There was an absence of medical  facilities  and  support
      from family or others such that he would inevitably die (with an  even
      shorter life expectancy than in the UK) in  circumstances  of  extreme
      hardship.  By that, of course, the  Court  did  not  mean  numerically
      exceptional - there  may  be  a  significant  number  of  such  cases.
      Rather, it was the extreme nature of those circumstances which led the
      Court  to  conclude   that   there   were   "compelling   humanitarian
      considerations" and which made D's case an "exceptional" one.

  33. By way of post-script to this case, we are aware that the applicant  D
      in fact survived for considerably  longer  than  medical  science  had
      assessed at the time of the court  hearing.  It  is  likely  that  the
      prolongation of his life was due to  the  appropriate  palliative  and
      social care he continued to receive  following  the  judgment  of  the
      Court combined with the  developments  in  anti  retro  viral  medical
      treatment that enabled his immune system to resist fatal opportunistic
      disease for longer than had previously been the case.

  34. The Court's characterisation flowed from its  recognition  that  cases
      such as D v UK had two distinct features differing from  the  original
      sequence of  cases  where  the  host  state  is  responsible  for  the
      foreseeable consequences of the expulsion decision  in  the  state  of
      origin.  First, the individual is not alleging that the risk to him or
      her flows from the actions of the receiving  state  or  any  non-state
      actors against which that  state  is  unable  to  provide  protection.
      Secondly, the Court recognises that the  lack  of  medical  or  social
      resources in the receiving state,  in  itself,  does  not  breach  the
      standards of Art 3 or any equivalent Convention to which the state may
      be party.

  35. Cases such as D v UK (and other cases concerned with the  consequences
      to a claimant in a host state of  the  absence  of  medical  treatment
      being available in a receiving state) have therefore been described by
      Laws LJ referred to in N v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 1369  at  [37]  as  an
      "extension of an extension" to the Art 3 obligation, namely imposing a
      liability upon the sending state (here the UK) for a risk  arising  in
      the receiving country which, itself, could not breach Art 3.  This may
      be the reason why a very cautious approach to the scope of  Art  3  is
      demonstrated in the case law, in particular in N, both in the House of
      Lords and the Strasbourg Court itself.

  36. One matter not directly addressed in the Court's decision in D v UK is
      the extent to which the Convention can be invoked when the essence  of
      an individual's claim is the inequality of medical treatment  provided
      in the sending state and the receiving state.  On one view, D could be
      seen as a case where there was no question of imposing upon the UK any
      obligation to provide treatment (not available in St Kitts) to D.   It
      might be said as he was beyond the reach of treatment even in the  UK,
      the issue  was  simply  the  circumstances  in  which  he  would  die.
      However, that does not sit easily with the factual  situation  that  D
      was in fact receiving medical treatment in the UK both whilst  he  was
      serving his sentence in prison when there was an obligation to provide
      it, and while his case was considered by  the  court.  The  obligation
      would continue  for a short period of time as D's life  expectancy  at
      the time of the hearing was less than twelve months.   However,  as  D
      could not be removed, the UK was required to provide  that  treatment.
      Perhaps reflecting this Judge  Pettiti,  in  his  concurring  opinion,
      having noted that D's case arose in "exceptional circumstances" namely
      that he suffered from AIDS in its final stages, went on to state that,
      in his view, the Court's decision was not based upon the criterion  of
      "inequality of medical treatment".  He said this:

           "The inequality of  medical  treatment  was  not  the  criterion
           adopted by the Court as medical treatment in the  Member  States
           of  the  United  Nations  is,  alas,  not  all   of   the   same
           technological standard.  The case of D,  however,  is  concerned
           not with hospital  treatment  in  general,  but  only  with  the
           deportation of a patient in the final  stages  of  an  incurable
           disease."

  37. The issue of a state's responsibility (if any) to continue to  provide
      medical treatment rather than remove an individual to a country  where
      that treatment will not be available features large in  the  reasoning
      of the House of Lords and the Strasbourg Court in N v SSHD and N v  UK
      respectively.

      N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31; [2005] 2 AC 296

  38.  N  was  a  Ugandan  citizen  who  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
      unsuccessfully claimed asylum.  After her arrival, she  was  diagnosed
      as HIV positive (a condition of which  she  had  been  unaware).   She
      developed AIDS-related illnesses and  received  treatment  in  the  UK
      including antiretroviral medication.  Although  this  treatment  could
      not cure her disease, her condition was stable and if she continued to
      have access to the drugs and medical facilities in the UK  she  had  a
      life expectancy of "decades".  Here the advances  in  medical  science
      since the earlier stages of the D case were taken note of.  The  Court
      was no longer dealing with people who would  die  reasonably  soon  in
      whichever country they lived. Effective medication could  now  give  a
      high  level  of  protection  against  naturally   occurring   disease.
      However, without those drugs and facilities, her prognosis  was  poor,
      she would suffer ill-health, discomfort, pain and death within a  year
      or two.  Although some treatment for HIV and  AIDS  was  available  in
      Uganda, N was not able to afford the treatment and so it would not  in
      practice be available to her.

  39. The House of Lords held that N's removal would not breach Art 3 of the
      ECHR.  Individual opinions were given by Lords Nicholls of Birkenhead,
      Hope of Craighead and Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood and  Baroness  Hale
      of Richmond.  Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe  expressed  agreement  with
      the speeches of all the other Law Lords.

  40. At [8], Lord Nicholls recognised that N's claim derived from the  lack
      of medical treatment in Uganda.  Lord Nicholls acknowledged  that  the
      risk to N did not, as in the usual case, arise from  intentional  ill-
      treatment in her home country.  Instead, he said (at [8]):

         "The adverse prospect confronting the appellant in Uganda is  of  a
         different character.  It derives  from  Uganda's  lack  of  medical
         resources compared with those  available  in  the  United  Kingdom.
         Thus the all-important question is whether expelling the  appellant
         would be inhuman treatment within Article 3 given the uncertainties
         confronting her in Uganda through shortage of the  necessary  drugs
         and medical facilities there."

  41. Having identified the "pressing humanitarian  considerations"  of  N's
      case (at [9]), Lord Nicholls nevertheless went on to conclude that her
      case did not fall within the class of "exceptional" case recognised in
      D v  UK.   At  [10]-[13]  Lord  Nicholls  identified  difficulties  in
      applying the "extended" reach of Art 3 recognised by the court in D on
      the basis that N's case was any less  pressing  in  its  "humanitarian
      considerations" than  was  D's.   In  particular,  Lord  Nicholls  was
      unimpressed with a distinction based upon the fact that D's  condition
      was terminal (namely he was dying) and that of N since  her  condition
      would "rapidly become terminal" if  treatment  was  discontinued.   At
      [14] he  recognised  that  the  "humanitarian  considerations  in  the
      present case are of a very high  order"  and  that  a  "difference  of
      degree in humanitarian appeal" did not call  for  a  different  result
      from that in D's case.   Nevertheless,  at  [15]-[18],  Lord  Nicholls
      firmly rested his decision to dismiss N's appeal upon  the  fact  that
      her claim was, in essence, seeking to impose an obligation upon the UK
      to provide medical treatment.  In his judgment,  Art  3  of  the  ECHR
      imposed no such obligation upon a contracting state.  He said this:
           "15.  Is  there,  then,  some  other  rationale  underlying  the
                 decisions  in  the  many  immigration   cases   where   the
                 Strasbourg court has  distinguished  D's  case?  I  believe
                 there is. The essential distinction is not to be  found  in
                 humanitarian differences. Rather  it  lies  in  recognising
                 that article 3  does  not  require  contracting  states  to
                 undertake the obligation of providing  aliens  indefinitely
                 with medical treatment lacking in their home countries.  In
                 the case of D and in later cases the Strasbourg  court  has
                 constantly reiterated that in principle aliens  subject  to
                 expulsion cannot claim any entitlement  to  remain  in  the
                 territory of a contracting state in order  to  continue  to
                 benefit from medical, social and other forms of  assistance
                 provided by the expelling state. Article 3 imposes no  such
                 'medical care' obligation on contracting states. This is so
                 even where, in the absence of medical treatment,  the  life
                 of the would-be immigrant will be significantly  shortened.
                 But in the case of D, unlike the later cases, there was  no
                 question of imposing any  such  obligation  on  the  United
                 Kingdom. D was dying,  and  beyond  the  reach  of  medical
                 treatment then available.
              1.  I express the obligation in terms of provision of  medical
                 care because that is what cases of this type are all about.
                 The appellant, and others in her position,  seek  admission
                 to this country for the purpose of obtaining the advantages
                 of the medical care readily available to all who are  here.
                 What the appellant seeks in  this  case  is  the  right  to
                 remain here so  that  she  may  continue  to  receive  this
                 medical treatment.
              1.  That the appellant should seek to do  so  is,  of  course,
                 eminently   understandable.   But,   as   the    Strasbourg
                 jurisprudence confirms, article 3 cannot be interpreted  as
                 requiring  contracting  states  to  admit  and  treat  AIDS
                 sufferers from all over the world for  the  rest  of  their
                 lives.  Nor,  by  the  like  token,  is  article  3  to  be
                 interpreted as requiring  contracting  states  to  give  an
                 extended right to remain to would-be  immigrants  who  have
                 received medical treatment  while  their  applications  are
                 being considered. If their applications  are  refused,  the
                 improvement in their medical  condition  brought  about  by
                 this interim medical treatment, and the prospect of serious
                 or  fatal  relapse  on  expulsion,  cannot  make  expulsion
                 inhuman treatment for the purposes of article 3.  It  would
                 be strange if the humane treatment of a would-be  immigrant
                 while his immigration application is being considered  were
                 to place him in a  better  position  for  the  purposes  of
                 article 3 than a person who never reached this  country  at
                 all. True it is that a person who comes here  and  receives
                 treatment while his application is  being  considered  will
                 have his hopes raised. But it is difficult to see why  this
                 should subject this country to a greater obligation than it
                 would to someone who is turned away at the  port  of  entry
                 and never receives any treatment.
              1.   No  one  could  fail  to  be  moved  by  the  appellant's
                 situation. But those acting on her behalf  are  seeking  to
                 press the obligations arising under the European Convention
                 too far. The problem derives from the disparity of  medical
                 facilities in different countries  of  the  world.  Despite
                 this  disparity,  an  AIDS  sufferer's  need  for   medical
                 treatment does  not,  as  a  matter  of  Convention  right,
                 entitle him to enter a contracting state and  remain  there
                 in order to obtain the treatment he or she  so  desperately
                 needs."

  42. Lord Nicholls' view was, therefore, that Art 3 is  not  breached  even
      where the individual's claim is that their removal would result in the
      discontinuance of treatment, including life  sustaining  treatment  in
      the receiving country, where otherwise  the  sending  state  would  be
      required to provide treatment.  In Lord Nicholls' view (as  he  points
      out at [15]), D v UK was a  case  where  there  was  "no  question  of
      imposing any such obligation on the  United  Kingdom".   As  we  noted
      above, it is not clear to us that that was in fact the case in D v UK.
       There was a continuing obligation upon the UK to  provide  treatment,
      palliative or otherwise, albeit for a relatively short  time  until  D
      inevitably died within a twelve month period.  That was an  obligation
      to provide medical treatment, even though it  was  not  open-ended  in
      time

  43. The remaining opinions do not rest so clearly on this feature  of  the
      case.

  44. Lord Hope acknowledged that N's case concerned  an  "extension  of  an
      extension" to the obligation upon a  contracting  state  under  Art  3
      ([23]).  He  acknowledged  that  the  House  of  Lords'  task  was  to
      determine the limits of the extension recognised by the European Court
      of Human Rights in D v UK.

  45. At [31], Lord Hope noted that the court in D  had  required  "rigorous
      scrutiny" of "all the  circumstances"  of  the  individual's  personal
      situation.   At  [32]-[35],  Lord   Hope   identified   the   relevant
      circumstances in D's case that made his circumstances "exceptional" so
      as to engage Art 3.  Lord Hope said this:
           "32.  Here the court concentrated on the advanced state  of  his
                 illness, on the availability of sophisticated treatment and
                 medication in  this  country,  on  the  care  and  kindness
                 administered by the charitable organisation and on what the
                 abrupt withdrawal of these facilities would mean  for  him.
                 It was not just that his removal would  hasten  his  death.
                 There was a serious danger that the conditions in St  Kitts
                 would  further  reduce  his  limited  life  expectancy  and
                 subject him to acute mental and physical  suffering.  There
                 was no evidence that any person was available to attend  to
                 the needs of what the court described  in  para  52  as  "a
                 terminally ill man" or of any other form of moral or social
                 support. The court concluded in para 53  that  in  view  of
                 these exceptional circumstances and bearing in mind what it
                 described as "the critical stage  reached  the  applicant's
                 fatal illness" it would be a breach of article 3 for him to
                 be removed to St Kitts.  In  para  54  it  explained  that,
                 although it could not be said that the  conditions  in  the
                 receiving country were themselves a breach of the  standard
                 of article, his removal would expose him to a real risk  of
                 dying under the most  distressing  circumstances  and  that
                 this would amount to inhuman treatment.
              1.  The  court  concluded  its  assessment  in  para   54   by
                 emphasising  that  aliens  who  have  served  their  prison
                 sentences and are subject to expulsion cannot in  principle
                 claim any entitlement to  remain  on  the  territory  of  a
                 contracting state in order  to  continue  to  benefit  from
                 medical, social or other forms of  assistance  provided  by
                 the expelling state during their stay in prison. While this
                 statement was directed to  applicants  whose  stay  in  the
                 contracting state has been prolonged by a  prison  sentence
                 during which they have become accustomed to  receiving  the
                 benefit  of  various  forms  of  assistance,  it  must   be
                 understood as applying more generally. This  is  because  a
                 comparison between the health benefits and other  forms  of
                 assistance which are available in the expelling state  with
                 those in the receiving country does not in itself give rise
                 to an  entitlement  to  remain  in  the  territory  of  the
                 expelling state. It was only  because  of  the  exceptional
                 circumstances that were identified in D's case that he  was
                 found to be entitled to the absolute protection of  article
                 3.

              1. In a concurring opinion Judge  Pettiti  observed  that  the
                 humanitarian   considerations    arose    in    exceptional
                 circumstances, which he described as "the AIDS  disease  in
                 its final stages".  He  stressed  that  the  inequality  of
                 medical treatment was not  the  criterion  adopted  by  the
                 court, as medical equipment in the  member  states  of  the
                 United Nations  was  not  all  of  the  same  technological
                 standard.  The  case  was  not  concerned   with   hospital
                 treatment in general, but only with the  deportation  of  a
                 patient in the final stages of  an  incurable  disease.  He
                 noted that the earlier case law concerned only cases  where
                 there was direct state responsibility.  This  decision  was
                 intended to afford  additional  protection  to  individuals
                 confronted with an affliction  that  affects  thousands  of
                 victims.
              1. It has to be said that it would have been  helpful  if  the
                 court had done more to identify the criterion by which such
                 cases  were  to  be  identified.  The  phrase  "exceptional
                 circumstances" does not provide that kind of  guidance.  It
                 treats the issue as one of fact. But the judgment does  not
                 lack statements of principle. In para 54 it is stated  that
                 aliens cannot in principle claim any entitlement to  remain
                 on the  territory  of  a  contracting  state  in  order  to
                 continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms  of
                 assistance  provided  by  the  expelling   state.   Without
                 qualification, the application of  this  principle  to  D's
                 case would have led to the conclusion that the decision  to
                 remove him would not be a violation of article 3. The court
                 was  clearly  anxious  not  to  say  anything  that   would
                 undermine  this  principle.  As  Judge  Pettiti   said,   a
                 comparison  between  the  medical   and   social   benefits
                 available in the respective states was  not  the  criterion
                 adopted. "

  46. As [34]-[35] of Lord Hope's opinion  make  clear,  the  difference  in
      medical treatment and health benefits available in the  expelling  and
      receiving  states  did  not  in  itself  make  a  case  "exceptional".
      Likewise, Lord Hope did not see cases such as N being determined by  a
      "trump card" against an individual merely because the essence of their
      claim was a differential in medical treatment.  To that  extent,  Lord
      Hope differed from the view of Lord Nicholls.

  47. At [36], Lord Hope set out the circumstances which in  his  view  made
      D's case "exceptional":

           "36.  What was it then that made the case exceptional?  It is to
                 be found, I think in the references to D's 'present medical
                 condition'  (para  50)  and  to  that  fact  that  he   was
                 terminally ill (para 51: 'the advanced states of a terminal
                 and incurable illness'; para 52: 'a  terminally  ill  man';
                 para 53: 'the critical stage now reached in the applicant's
                 fatal illness'; Judge Pettiti (p 455): 'the final stages of
                 an incurable disease').   It  was  the  fact  that  he  was
                 already terminally ill while still present in the territory
                 of the expelling state that made his case exceptional."

  48.  Having  then  considered  cases  decided  by  the  Strasbourg   Court
      subsequent to D v UK, at [48], he  again  stated  that  an  individual
      "cannot claim  any  entitlement  to  remain  in  the  territory  of  a
      contracting state in order to continue to benefit from medical, social
      or other forms of assistance provided by the expelling state".

  49. Lord Hope went on to state  that  the  exception  from  expulsion  "on
      medical grounds" arose only in "very  exceptional  circumstances"  and
      that D v UK was the "paradigm  case  as  to  what  is  meant  by  this
      formula".  He noted that the Strasbourg Court had been  "at  pains  in
      its decisions to  avoid  any  further  extension  of  the  exceptional
      category of case which D v United Kingdom represents" (at [48]).

  50. At [50], Lord Hope observed that the Strasbourg Court appears, despite
      advances in medical science, to have continued:

           "... its adherence to the principle that aliens who are  subject
           to expulsion cannot claim  any  entitlement  to  remain  in  the
           territory of a contracting state in order to continue to benefit
           from medical, social or other forms of  assistance  provided  by
           the expelling state."

  51. At [50] Lord Hope expressed the proper approach to be as follows:

           "50.  ... What the court is in effect saying is  that  the  fact
                 that the treatment may be beyond the reach of the applicant
                 in  the  receiving  state  is  not  to  be  treated  as  an
                 exceptional circumstance.  It  might  be  different  if  it
                 could be said that it was not available there  at  all  and
                 that the applicant was exposed to an inevitable risk due to
                 its complete absence.  But that is increasingly unlikely to
                 be the case in view of the amount of medical  aid  that  is
                 now reaching countries in the third world, especially those
                 in sub-Saharan Africa.  For the circumstances to be, as  it
                 was put in Amegnigan v The Netherlands, 'very  exceptional'
                 it would need to be  shown  that  the  applicant's  medical
                 condition had reached such a critical stage that there were
                 compelling humanitarian grounds for not removing him  to  a
                 place which lacked the medical and social services which he
                 would need to prevent acute suffering while he is dying."

  52. In his judgment, the facts of N v SSHD would amount to an extension of
      the exceptional category in D v UK, which it was not appropriate for a
      national court to make but must be left to the Strasbourg Court.  That
      was an extension which the Strasbourg Court subsequently was unwilling
      to make.

  53. At [50], in setting out his proper approach,  Lord  Hope  stated  that
      this was the same test  as  was  proposed  by  Baroness  Hale  in  her
      opinion.

  54. At [67] Baroness Hale commented that she did not find "at all helpful"
      the notion of "compelling humanitarian considerations" as  delineating
      the "exceptional" case contemplated by the Court in D v UK.  At  [68],
      Baroness Hale, quoting the concurring opinion of Judge Pettiti in D  v
      UK, stated that the "inequality of  medical  treatment"  was  not  the
      defining criterion of the court's "exceptional" case in D  v  UK.   At
      [68], Baroness Hale went on to set out her understanding of the  reach
      of the Strasbourg Court's jurisprudence as follows:

           "68.  As Lord Hope's analysis shows, the later cases  have  made
                 it clear that it is the patient's present medical condition
                 which  is  the  crucial  factor.  The  difficulty   is   in
                 understanding where conditions in the receiving country fit
                 into the analysis. Even in those cases where the illness is
                 not in an advanced or terminal stage, the Court does  refer
                 to the medical care and family support available there. But
                 it does so in terms of there being "no  prospect"  of  such
                 care or support, rather than in terms of its  being  likely
                 to be available. It is difficult to see, therefore, whether
                 this consideration adds anything in those cases. Where  the
                 illness  is  in  an  advanced  or  terminal   stage,   then
                 conditions in the receiving country should be  crucial.  It
                 is not yet clear whether the applicant  has  to  show  that
                 appropriate care and support during those final stages  was
                 unlikely to be available or whether again the "no prospect"
                 test applies. That was undoubtedly the  situation  in  D  v
                 United Kingdom and the Court has made  it  clear  that  the
                 "compelling humanitarian considerations"  are  those  which
                 arise in a case where the facts come close to those  in  D.
                 But if it is indeed the case that this  class  of  case  is
                 limited to those where the applicant  is  in  the  advanced
                 stages of  a  life-threatening  illness,  it  would  appear
                 inhuman to send him home to die unless the conditions there
                 will be such that  he  can  do  so  with  dignity.  As  the
                 European Court said in Pretty v United  Kingdom  (2002)  35
                 EHRR 1, para 65, "The very essence  of  the  Convention  is
                 respect for human dignity and human freedom."

  55. At [69], Baroness Hale set out the test applicable as follows:

           "69.  In my view, therefore, the test, in this sort of case,  is
                 whether the applicant's illness has reached such a critical
                 stage (i e he is dying) that it would be inhuman  treatment
                 to deprive him of the care which he is currently  receiving
                 and send him home to an early death unless  there  is  care
                 available there to  enable  him  to  meet  that  fate  with
                 dignity.  This is to the same effect as the  test  preposed
                 by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hope of Craighead.  It
                 sums up the facts in D.  It is not met on the facts of this
                 case."

  56. In her opinion, therefore, Baroness Hale in  [68]  and  [69]  saw  the
      reach of the "exceptional" case in D v UK as defined by  the  elements
      of the individual's illness as having reached a "critical stage" which
      Baroness Hale equated to "dying" in circumstances where in the absence
      of treatment and/or care that death would not be met  "with  dignity".
      Given the mutual agreement in their opinions, Lord Hope  and  Baroness
      Hale appear to limit the D v UK category  of  "exceptional"  cases  to
      situations where the patient's "present medical condition" had reached
      a "critical stage" of dying.

  57. That said, however, at [70] Baroness Hale accepted that  the  category
      of "exceptional case" remained open, stating that:

           "There may, of course, be other exceptional  cases,  with  other
           extreme facts, where the humanitarian considerations are equally
           compelling.   The  law  must   be   sufficiently   flexible   to
           accommodate them."

  58. However, on the facts of N v  SSHD,  Baroness  Hale  agreed  that  the
      individual's circumstances  did  not  fall  within  the  "exceptional"
      category engaging Art 3.

  59. Lord Brown acknowledged that the case of D v UK was the starting point
      for determining the scope of Art 3 in cases of this sort.  He observed
      (at [78]) that the facts of D v UK were "very extreme".  At [81], Lord
      Brown set out the basis upon which, in his view, the Strasbourg  Court
      in D had considered the facts of that case to be "highly  exceptional"
      as follows:

           "81.  Nothing could  be  plainer  than  that  the  court  itself
                 regarded D as a highly exceptional case.  Para  53  of  its
                 judgment speaks of 'these exceptional circumstances',  para
                 54 of 'the very exceptional circumstances  of  this  case'.
                 These circumstances included that the applicant was 'in the
                 advanced states of a terminal and incurable illness'  (para
                 51); that 'The abrupt withdrawal of these [medical,  caring
                 and counselling] facilities will entail the  most  dramatic
                 consequences   for   him'   (para   52);   that   he    was
                 'psychologically compassionate' (para 53), and  that  there
                 were  'compelling  humanitarian  considerations  at  stake'
                 (para 54)."

  60. At [86], Lord Brown observed that the "unmistakeable  conclusion"  was
      that the Strasbourg Court had, in all subsequent  cases,  declined  to
      find a breach of Art 3 where an AIDS sufferer was returned to  his  or
      her home country "save in circumstances closely comparable to those in
      D  itself."  (We  would  interpolate  that  the   exception   is   the
      Commission's decision in BB v France (Application No  30930/96)  March
      9, 1998).)

  61. At [91], Lord Brown expressed  some  difficulty  with  the  Strasbourg
      Court's reasoning in restricting the scope of Art 3 to cases where the
      individual's  illness  "had  attained  its  terminal  stage"  and  the
      individual "had no prospect of  medical  care  or  family  support  on
      return home."  Lord Brown said this:

           "91.  .... It  is  perhaps  not,  however,  self-evidently  more
                 inhuman to deport someone who is facing imminent death than
                 someone whose life expectancy would thereby be reduced from
                 decades to a year or so.  Nor, as  already  suggested,  has
                 there generally been a sound evidential basis for supposing
                 that much if anything in the way of medical care of  family
                 support would be available to the applicants on return."

  62. At [93], Lord Brown nevertheless emphasised that D was terminally  ill
      and would die regardless of any treatment and, therefore, in that case
      unlike others such as N, the expelling state was not being required to
      provide the individual with beneficial medical, social, or other forms
      of assistance.

  63. At [94], Lord Brown expressed agreement with the test stated  by  Lord
      Hope in his opinion as follows:

           "It must be shown that the  applicant's  medical  condition  has
           reached  such  a  critical  stage  that  there  are   compelling
           humanitarian grounds for not removing him  or  her  to  a  place
           which lacks the medical and social  services  which  he  or  she
           would need to prevent acute suffering while he or she is dying."

  64. That test was not, for Lord Brown, satisfied on the facts.

      N v UK

  65. Subsequently,  the  Strasbourg  Court  considered  N's  case  in  Case
      26565/05; N v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 885.  That court also found  that  N's
      return to Uganda did not breach Art 3.

  66. At [42], the Strasbourg Court in N v UK set out a number of principles
      which it had consistently applied since D v UK.

  67. First:

           "Aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in  principle  claim
           any entitlement to remain in  the  territory  of  a  Contracting
           State in order to continue to benefit from  medical,  social  or
           other forms of assistance and services provided by the expelling
           State."

  68. Secondly:

           "The fact that the applicant's circumstances, including his life
           expectancy, would be significantly reduced  if  he  were  to  be
           removed from the Contracting State is not sufficient  in  itself
           to give rise to breach of Article 3."

  69. Thirdly:

           "The decision to remove an alien who is suffering from a serious
           mental or physical illness to a country where the facilities for
           the treatment of that illness are inferior to those available in
           the Contracting State may raise an issue under  Article  3,  but
           only in a very exceptional case, where the humanitarian  grounds
           against the removal are compelling."

  70. The Court then went on to set out the circumstances in D v UK which it
      considered were "exceptional":

           "In the D case the very exceptional circumstances were that  the
           applicant was critically ill and appeared to be close to  death,
           could not be guaranteed any  nursing  or  medical  care  in  his
           country of origin and had no family there  willing  or  able  to
           care for him or provide him with even a  basic  level  of  food,
           shelter or social support."

  71. The Court (at [43]) went on to state that  other  "exceptional"  cases
      could arise:

           "The Court does  not  exclude  that  there  may  be  other  very
           exceptional cases  where  the  humanitarian  considerations  are
           equally  compelling.  However,  it  considers  that  it   should
           maintain the high threshold set in D. v. the United Kingdom and
           applied in its subsequent case-law, which it regards as  correct
           in principle, given that in such cases the alleged  future  harm
           would emanate not from the  intentional  acts  or  omissions  of
           public authorities or  non-State  bodies,  but  instead  from  a
           naturally occurring illness and the lack of sufficient resources
           to deal with it in the receiving country."

  72. At [44] the Court reminded us that:

           "Advances in medical science, together with social and  economic
           differences  between  countries,  entail  that  the   level   of
           treatment available in the Contracting State and the country  of
           origin may vary considerably. While it is necessary,  given  the
           fundamental importance of Article 3 in the  Convention  system,
           for the Court to retain  a  degree  of  flexibility  to  prevent
           expulsion in very exceptional cases, Article 3 does not place an
           obligation  on  the  Contracting   State   to   alleviate   such
           disparities through the provision of free and  unlimited  health
           care  to  all  aliens  without  a  right  to  stay  within   its
           jurisdiction. A finding to the contrary would place too great  a
           burden on the Contracting States."

  73. At [45] the Court observed that the principles applied:

           " ... in relation to the expulsion of any person afflicted  with
           any serious, naturally  occurring  physical  or  mental  illness
           which may cause suffering, pain and reduce life  expectancy  and
           require specialised  medical  treatment  which  may  not  be  so
           readily available in the applicant's country of origin or  which
           may be available only at substantial cost."

  74. Consequently, in summary the Court recognised that:

           (1) a Contracting State was not obliged to continue  to  provide
           medical, social or other forms of  assistance,  including  where
           the effect  of  removal  would  significantly  reduce  the  life
           expectancy of the individual in their own country;

           (2)  the  obligation  under  Art  3  only  arose  in   a   "very
           exceptional" case, where "the humanitarian grounds  against  the
           removal are compelling";

           (3) D v UK involved  "very  exceptional  circumstances"  as  the
           individual was "critically ill  and  appeared  to  be  close  to
           death" and there was an "absence of care  or  support  including
           from his family" and of a "basic level of food, shelter or other
           social support" in his own country;

           (4) there  may  be  "other  very  exceptional  cases  where  the
           humanitarian considerations are equally compelling"; and

           (5) those principles were  applicable  in  every  case  where  a
           person  was  afflicted  with  a  "serious,  naturally  occurring
           physical or mental illness"  which  required  medical  treatment
           which was not readily  available  or  not  available  except  at
           substantial cost in an individual's own country.

  75. In relation to the facts of N v UK itself,  the  Court  at  [49]-[51],
      concluded that  they  did  not  fall  within  the  "very  exceptional"
      category in D v UK for the following reasons:

           "49.  The United Kingdom authorities have provided the applicant
                 with medical and social assistance at public expense during
                 the nine-year period it has taken  for  asylum  application
                 and claims under Arts 3 and  8  of  the  Convention  to  be
                 determined by the domestic courts and this Court.  However,
                 this does not in itself entail a duty on the  part  of  the
                 respondent State to continue so to provide for her.

           "50.  The Court accepts that  the  quality  of  the  applicant's
                 life, and her life expectancy, would  be  affected  if  she
                 were returned to Uganda.  The applicant is not, however, at
                 the present time  critically  ill.   The  rapidity  of  the
                 deterioration which she would  suffer  and  the  extent  to
                 which she  would  be  able  to  obtain  access  to  medical
                 treatment, support and care, including help from relatives,
                 must involve a certain degree of speculation,  particularly
                 in view of the constantly evolving situation as regards the
                 treatment of HIV and AIDS worldwide.

           51.   In the  Court's  view,  the  applicant's  case  cannot  be
                 distinguished from those cited in [36]-[41] above.  It does
                 not disclose very exceptional circumstances, such as in D v
                 United Kingdom, and the implementation of the  decision  to
                 remove the applicant to Uganda would not  give  rise  to  a
                 violation of Art.3 of the Convention."

  76. It might be said  that  the  above  reasoning  did  not  rise  to  the
      challenge set by the House of Lords to decide with  more  detail  what
      class of circumstance could be regarded as very exceptional, or why it
      is was appropriate to limit violations to cases where the claimant was
      close to death where in all AIDs  cases  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
      countries with similar health resources,  relevant  medical  treatment
      can prevent relapse in fatality as long as the treatment continues  to
      be administered.

  77. We note that three of the judges dissented in the case of N v UK.  For
      the dissentients the majority erred in rigidly distinguishing  between
      civil and political and social and economic rights; in  introducing  a
      policy balance into the application of an Article where other case law
      made it clear that the prohibition was an absolute one and in  seeking
      to distinguish the outcome from that in D v United Kingdom.

  78. The minority concluded:
           "23. There is no doubt that in the event of  removal  to  Uganda
           the applicant will face an early death after a period  of  acute
           physical and mental suffering. In this case we are satisfied  of
           the existence of such  extreme  facts  with  equally  compelling
           humanitarian considerations. After  all,  the  highest  judicial
           authorities in the  United  Kingdom  were  almost  unanimous  in
           holding that the applicant, if returned to Uganda, would have to
           face an  early  death.  The  expelling  State's  responsibility,
           because substantial grounds are thus shown  for  believing  that
           the applicant  almost  certainly  faces  a  risk  of  prohibited
           treatment in Uganda, is engaged."

      Other Cases

  79. Whilst we were referred to a  number  of  other  authorities  both  in
      Strasbourg and domestically, it was common ground between the  parties
      that it was the application of the principles derived from D v UK, N v
      SSHD and N v UK which were crucial to the outcome of these appeals.

  80. One other case to which we must make reference is BC  (India)  v  SSHD
      [2007] EWCA Civ 1438.  That  was  an  application  for  permission  to
      appeal to the Court of Appeal decided by Toulson LJ.   In  that  case,
      where the facts were materially identical to those in  these  appeals,
      Toulson LJ  refused  permission  to  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
      certainty of death within a two to  three  week  period  faced  by  an
      individual with end-stage renal  failure  in  his  own  country  where
      treatment was not available did not bring the circumstances within the
      "exceptional" category recognised in D v UK and N v SSHD.

  81. Having cited the opinion of Baroness Hale in N v SSHD at [69] and [70]
      (which we set out above), Toulson LJ said this at [4]:

           "Now, I do not read paragraph 70 as intending to  undermine  the
           test stated by her in the immediately preceding  sentences;  and
           if that is the correct interpretation, then I have to  say  that
           on my reading it does not fall in line with the speeches of  the
           other members of the House.  What she was recognising  was  that
           there might be a different type of case altogether, where  other
           exceptional  considerations  might  possibly  give  rise  to  an
           Article 3 claim.  When it comes to the facts, Mr  Samuel  points
           to a number of features which he says distinguish this from  the
           types of  case  considered  in  N  and  D.   In  particular,  he
           emphasises the certainty of death  in  a  short  period  without
           treatment.  He says that there  is  a  difference  between,  for
           example, somebody with HIV AIDS, where the risk of  death  would
           be (as mentioned  in  previous  authorities)  within  12  to  24
           months, and death within two to three weeks.  He  stresses  also
           that on the facts of this case, the appellant is unlikely to  be
           able to pay for  treatment,  and  that  although  treatment  for
           kidney disease sufferers is available in some parts of India, it
           is the big cities, and not in the  rural  area  from  which  the
           appellant comes.  I, regrettably, am  unable  to  see  that  the
           points which he identifies as compelling facts  create  a  legal
           distinction.  In terms  of  an  exercise  of  the  Secretary  of
           State's  discretion,  the  plea  that  particular  consideration
           should be given to him because of the early proximity  of  death
           may have a real attraction; but to try to introduce  some  legal
           test which differentiated  between  somebody  who  is  currently
           alive  and  will  be  kept  well  on  treatment   but   who   on
           discontinuation of treatment  would  die  within  two  to  three
           weeks, or on the other hand within 12 months, would lead to  the
           question:  where would the cutoff be?   Would  it  be  at  three
           weeks, or at three months, or at six months, or at what  figure?
           I do not see that there can be a workable legal rule which  said
           that proximity of death within X weeks engages Article 3, but in
           X plus one week does not."

  82. Mr Bourne placed reliance upon this case whilst recognising that, as a
      permission decision, it had no precedential authority.  The  reasoning
      was, nevertheless, he submitted, persuasive.  Ms Lieven  QC  contended
      that the decision was wrong and should not be followed.

Discussion and Analysis

  83. We begin with the relevant Convention provision.  Art 3  of  the  ECHR
      states that:

           "No-one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading
           treatment or punishment."

  84.  In cases of this sort the focus is upon the claim that the individual
      will be subject to "inhuman" or "degrading" treatment by  the  absence
      of (life-sustaining) treatment on his or her return to  the  receiving
      country.  We remind ourselves of the Strasbourg  Court's  approach  to
      Article 3  in  general.   The  Court  requires  a  "minimum  level  of
      severity" to engage Article 3.  'Inhuman' treatment  is  conduct  that
      causes sufficient mental  and/or  physical  suffering  to  attain  the
      minimum standard of severity (e.g. Ireland v UK (1978) 2  EHRR  25  at
      [162]).  'Degrading' treatment is conduct which  arouses  feelings  of
      fear, anguish and inferiority such  as  to  humiliate  or  debase  the
      individual (Ireland at [167]).  Again that must reach a minimum  level
      of severity to engage Art 3.  The assessment is relative  and  depends
      upon an assessment of  all  factors  including  the  duration  of  the
      treatment,  its  physical  or  mental  effects,  and  the  age,   sex,
      vulnerability and state  of  health  of  the  individual  (Ireland  at
      [162]).  Once established, the obligation  under  Art  3  is  absolute
      (e.g. Chahal v UK (1996) 23 EHRR 413 and Saadi v Italy (2009) 49  EHRR
      30).

  85. Having set out at some length extracts from  the  trilogy  of  central
      decisions to these  appeals, we derive the  following  principles  and
      approach:

           (1) (a) Article 3 imposes an obligation  upon  a  state  not  to
              expel a person to a country where there is a real  risk  that
              he or she would be subjected to ill-treatment contrary to Art
              3 (see, e.g. Soering v UK (1989) 11 EHRR  439  and  Chahal  v
              UK).

              (b) That  obligation  can  arise  where  the  source  of  the
              individual's  alleged  ill-treatment  is  not   directly   or
              indirectly the responsibility  of  the  receiving  state  but
              rather arises from a naturally occurring illness, disease  or
              condition  where  treatment  (in  particular  life-sustaining
              treatment) is not available in the receiving state.

           (2) (a) An alien, subject to expulsion, can in  principle  claim
              no entitlement to remain in a Contracting State in  order  to
              continue to benefit from medical, social or  other  forms  of
              assistance (including life-sustaining assistance) which would
              not be available in the receiving state.

              (b) Nevertheless, in D v UK and N v UK the  Court  recognised
              that in "exceptional" or "very exceptional" circumstances  an
              infringement of Article 3 could  arise  where  a  Contracting
              State returns an individual to another state  in  which  they
              would be unable to obtain medical treatment or care for their
              condition  in  circumstances  where  the  absence   of   that
              treatment or care could result in the individual's death.

              (c) The Strasbourg Court's approach has been cautious in such
              cases and its extension of Art 3  has  been  incremental  and
              limited.

           (3) (a) In determining what amounts to  "exceptional"  or  "very
              exceptional"   circumstances,   the   focus   is   upon   the
              circumstances in  which  the  individual  will  find  him  or
              herself in the country to which they are to be returned.

              (b) An "exceptional" case does not require the  circumstances
              to be unique or even circumstances in which only a few or not
              many  individuals  might  find  themselves.   The  Strasbourg
              Court's description of a case as  "exceptional"  is  no  more
              than a pointer to the extreme  or  compassionately  demanding
              nature of the individual's  circumstances  in  the  receiving
              country.

              (c) The mere fact that the individual faces the  prospect  of
              death because medical treatment and  care  is  not  available
              does not, in  itself,  bring  the  circumstances  within  the
              "exceptional" category.

              (d) Although Lord Nicholls  in  N  v  SSHD  appears  to  have
              understood D v UK to be a case in which  the  individual  was
              beyond medical treatment in the UK  and  thus  his  continued
              presence in the UK did not impose any obligation on the UK to
              provide treatment that does not seem to us to have  been  the
              situation.  He was receiving treatment and care  albeit  that
              the treatment was palliative and would only be required for a
              relatively short period, less than 12 months.  The outcome in
              D v UK cannot be explained on that basis.  Indeed, the  other
              Law Lords in N v SSHD and the Strasbourg Court itself in N  v
              UK did not justify the outcome in D's  case  on  that  basis.
              The fact, therefore, that the sending state may  be  required
              to provide medical care or treatment  does  not,  in  itself,
              exclude the case from being an "exceptional" one.

           (4) (a) The decision maker must make a  holistic  assessment  of
              the individual's circumstances in the receiving country.

              (b) The threshold is a high one.

              (c) No one factor is necessarily crucial or determinative  in
              the dispassionate judicial assessment of those circumstances.



              (d) There is no difference in principle between a case  where
              the individual came to the  UK  knowingly  suffering  from  a
              medical condition and where  that  was  only  discovered  (or
              arose) after  arrival.   The  individual  cannot  invoke  any
              continuing obligation on the UK to provide that treatment.

              (e) It will be for  the  individual  to  prove  that  medical
              treatment and care will not  be  available  to  them  in  the
              receiving country.  That may arise because it is  simply  not
              available or, if available in theory, it is not accessible in
              practice because the individual does not have  the  financial
              resources  to  pay  for   that   treatment   or   care,   or,
              alternatively, it is as a practical matter beyond their reach
              for example because they would have to travel a long distance
              which   is   prohibited   by   their   health   or   personal
              circumstances.  As Baroness Hale noted in N v SSHD it is  the
              practical availability  of  the  treatment  rather  than  its
              theoretical availability which is important.   We  emphasise,
              however, this is a matter which a claimant must establish  on
              the evidence.

            (5) (a) The touch-stone identified  in  the  case  law  of  the
              "exceptional" case is the notion identified in  Pretty  v  UK
              (2002) 35 EHRR 1 at [65]:

                  "The very essence of the Convention is respect for  human
                  dignity and human freedom."

              As Baroness Hale stated in N v SSHD at [68]:

                  "It would appear inhuman to send [an individual] home  to
                  die unless the conditions there will be such that he  can
                  do so with dignity."

              It is this central notion that  lies  at  the  heart  of  the
              Court's decision in N v  UK  and  its  understanding  of  its
              earlier decision in D v UK.  At [40] the Court said that:

                  "In the D case the very  exceptional  circumstances  were
                  that the applicant was critically ill and appeared to  be
                  close to death, could not be guaranteed  any  nursing  or
                  medical care in his country of origin and had  no  family
                  there willing or able to care for him or provide him with
                  even a basic level of food, shelter or social support."

               (b) In N's case, both the House of Lords and the  Strasbourg
              Court considered D v UK to be the paradigm of a situation  of
              "exceptional" circumstances.

              (c) The case law provides a guide as to the extremity of  the
              individual's circumstances which are required to  engage  Art
              3.

              (d) The House of Lords "set the test" in part by reference to
              whether the individual's  illness  had  reached  a  "critical
              stage" such that it would be inhuman to deprive  him  of  the
              care which he is currently receiving so that he would  suffer
              an early death without care available to "meet that fate with
              dignity" (see Baroness Hale at [69] and Lord Hope  at  [50]).
              We do not understand that to limit the "exceptional" category
              to the facts of D v UK itself, in particular to an individual
              who is terminally ill in the  sense  that  treatment  is  not
              available even in the UK to prevent his or her death from the
              underlying illness or disease.  That is, in  our  view,  made
              plain by the recognition that there "may, of course, be other
              exceptional cases, with  other  extreme  factors,  where  the
              humanitarian  considerations  are  equally  compelling"  (per
              Baroness Hale at [70]). Likewise, the Court in N  v  UK  also
              recognised that there maybe  other  "very  exceptional  cases
              where the humanitarian considerations are equally compelling"
              (at [43]).

              (e) No such case has yet been  identified  in  the  case  law
              either in Strasbourg or the UK.  We recognise,  however,  the
              potential for other "compelling  humanitarian"  circumstances
              to engage Art 3 of the ECHR.

            (6) (a) In D v  UK  it  was  the  cumulative  impact  upon  the
              individual of his circumstances in St  Kitts  that  made  D's
              case "exceptional".  In the absence of medical care or family
              or social support he would be left to  die  without  dignity.
              That factor contrasts with the situation in N where, although
              unable to access treatment for her HIV condition, N  had  the
              prospects  of  some  medical  care  (albeit  not   the   life
              sustaining treatment she  received  in  the  UK)  and  family
              support.  It could not, as a consequence, be  said  that  her
              death would occur in circumstances of indignity  such  as  to
              reach the high threshold for "inhuman or degrading treatment"
              under Art 3.

               (b) Just as it may not be necessary for the individual to be
              terminally ill and in the end  stages  of  his  or  her  life
              regardless of medical treatment, likewise the length of  time
              that the individual will survive in their own country without
              treatment is not determinative of whether the high  threshold
              in Art 3 has been reached.  In that respect,  we  agree  with
              the view of Toulson LJ in BC (India) (at [4])  that  applying
              the current case law binding on us "[t]he certainty of  death
              in a short period  without  treatment"  does  not  in  itself
              brings an individual's circumstances within Art  3.   In  our
              judgment, that is not a determinative  factor  identified  in
              the Strasbourg cases or by the House of Lords  in  N's  case.
              As Toulson LJ pointed out:

                  "to try to introduce some legal test which differentiated
                  between someone who is currently alive and will  be  kept
                  well  on  treatment  but  who  on  a  discontinuance   of
                  treatment would die within two or three weeks, or on  the
                  other hand  within  twelve  months,  would  lead  to  the
                  question: Where would the cut off be?   Would  it  be  at
                  three weeks, or at three months, or at six months, or  at
                  what figure?  I do not see that there can be  a  workable
                  legal rule which said that proximity of  death  within  X
                  weeks engages Article 3, but in X plus 1 week does not."

              (c) the rapidity of decline will,  however,  be  relevant  in
              assessing all the circumstances of their death  and  whether,
              therefore, any indignity an individual faces (whether  for  a
              short or longer period of time) engages the  protection  from
              expulsion provided by  Art 3.

           (7) (a) Although not raised in these appeals, we anticipate that
              there may be  circumstances  which  enhance  an  individual's
              claim that the circumstances on return will be  "exceptional"
              and more likely pass the high threshold of Art 3 to establish
              a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment.

              (b) Relevant factors might include, for  example,  where  the
              non-availability of the treatment in the home country is  due
              to a discriminatory policy  of  the  State  for  example,  on
              racial, ethnic or other prohibitive grounds.  In such  cases,
              it may be that taking into account all the circumstances  Art
              3 is engaged or, at least, a breach of Art 14 read with Art 8
              could be established (see, East African Asians cases (1973) 3
              EHRR 76, E Com HR). In RS and others  (Zimbabwe-AIDS)  [2010]
              UKUT 623 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal considered  such  an  issue
              albeit found that the evidence fell short of demonstrating  a
              real risk of such treatment.

              (c) A further potential factor may be where the individual to
              be returned is a young child.  There  may  be  a  potentially
              greater effect upon that child of enduring the dying  process
              and may as a  consequence  elevate  the  indignity  of  those
              circumstances sufficiently to reach the high threshold  under
              Art 3.  Likewise,  a  parent  forced  to  witness  the  dying
              process of their  young  child  may  amount  to  a  level  of
              suffering greater than that confronted by an adult  dying  in
              such  circumstances  and  amount  to  inhuman  and  degrading
              treatment (see, CA v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 1165 per Laws LJ at
              [26]).

           (8) (a) We were invited not to consider the application of Art 8
              in cases of this sort.  Neither appellant  before  us  relied
              upon Art 8.  In those circumstances, we do  not  express  any
              conclusions on the issue.

              (b) However, in principle Art 8 can be relied on in cases  of
              this sort.   The removal of the individual would, on the face
              of it, engage Art 8(1) on the basis of an  interference  with
              his or her private life as an  aspect  of  that  individual's
              'physical and moral integrity' (see Bensaid v  UK  (2001)  33
              EHRR 10).  Unlike Art 3, however, Art 8 is not  absolute  and
              the legitimate aim of the economic well-being of the  country
              would be relevant in determining whether a breach  of  Art  8
              could be established given any  financial  implications  that
              continued treatment in the UK would entail (see  also  R  (on
              the application of Razgar) v SSHD  [2004] UKHL  27; [2004]  2
              AC 368).

              (c)  It may be that although, in principle, the scope of  Art
              8 is wider than that of Art 3, in practical terms that  in  a
              case like this where the claimant has no right to  remain  it
              will be a "very rare case" indeed where such  a  claim  could
              succeed (see KH (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1354 and
              MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 279).[1]   That  reality
              may lay at the heart of the majority's view of the Strasbourg
              Court in N v UK when, having rejected the individual's  claim
              under Art 3, stated that no "separate issue" arose under  Art
              8 (compare the dissenting Judge's opinion at 1 to 6).

              (d) Again we note that in N v UK the minority disagreed  with
              the failure to address Article 8.  We see some force in this.
              If it be  the  case  that  the  Article  3  threshold  is  an
              exceptionally high one because of the absolute  character  of
              the prohibition and concerns that Contracting States could be
              swamped by health tourism claims  by  people  with  no  prior
              connection to the state  in  question  seeking  to  enter  or
              remain to gain access  to  expensive  medical  treatment,  an
              Article 8 proportionality analysis might  yield  a  different
              outcome in other cases, possibly where  the  claimant  had  a
              lawful permission to reside in  the  host  state  before  the
              disease was diagnosed.

              (e) In  the  medical  evidence  in  the  present  cases,  for
              example, there was some indication that if the claimants were
              given leave to remain for an appropriate period of time,  one
              or other of then might be eligible for a  kidney  transplant,
              the result of which would  mean  that  they  were  no  longer
              dependent on dialysis.  However, in the light of the case law
              to date and the clear submissions of both parties to  us,  we
              have not explored the case from this perspective.

           (9)  Neither party referred us to the line of cases in which Art
              3 has been relied upon where the individual claims that as  a
              result of his removal to his or her home country there  is  a
              real risk that he will commit suicide (see,  e.g.  J  v  SSHD
              [2006] EWCA Civ 1238).   Those cases may also involve a claim
              that medical treatment and support in the home country  would
              not be available to obviate the risk  of  suicide.   To  that
              extent, those cases have a common feature with the cases with
              which we are concerned in these appeals.  Those cases do not,
              however, seem  to  be  treated  in  the  same  way  requiring
              "exceptional" circumstances in the home country in  order  to
              establish a breach of Art 3.  A difference may well  be  that
              in those cases the  removal  of  the  individual  creates  or
              enhances the risk of suicide and so they  are  not  concerned
              solely with a natural underlying disease  or  illness  which,
              although treatable in the UK, would not  be  treated  in  the
              individual's home country.  That distinction may well justify
              a different approach in applying Art 3 than in cases such  as
              these appeals.  As we have said, we were not referred to  the
              suicide cases which, in any event, have not  been  considered
              by the Strasbourg Court and formed no part of  its  reasoning
              in D v UK and N v UK.

           (10) We note that  in  its  decision  in  Sufi  and  Elmi  v  UK
              (Applications nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07) (2012) 54 EHRR 9 the
              Strasbourg Court did not apply the approach in N v UK:
                  "281.  The Court recalls that N. v. the  United  Kingdom
                  concerned the removal of  an  HIV-positive  applicant  to
                  Uganda, where her lifespan was likely to  be  reduced  on
                  account of the fact that the treatment  facilities  there
                  were inferior to those available in the  United  Kingdom.
                  In reaching its conclusions, the  Court  noted  that  the
                  alleged  future  harm  would   emanate   not   from   the
                  intentional acts or omission of public authorities or non-
                  State bodies but from a naturally occurring  illness  and
                  the lack of sufficient resources to deal with it  in  the
                  receiving country. The Court therefore relied on the fact
                  that neither the applicant's  illness  nor  the  inferior
                  medical facilities were caused by any act or omission  of
                  the receiving State or of any non-State actors within the
                  receiving State.
                  282. If the dire humanitarian conditions in Somalia  were
                  solely or even predominantly attributable to  poverty  or
                  to the State's lack of resources to deal with a naturally
                  occurring phenomenon, such as a drought, the test  in  N.
                  v. the United Kingdom may well have been considered to be
                  the appropriate one. However,  it  is  clear  that  while
                  drought has contributed to the humanitarian crisis,  that
                  crisis is predominantly due to the  direct  and  indirect
                  actions of the  parties  to  the  conflict.  The  reports
                  indicate that all parties to the conflict  have  employed
                  indiscriminate methods of warfare  in  densely  populated
                  urban areas with no regard to the safety of the  civilian
                  population (see paragraphs 82, 123, 127, 132,  137,  139-
                  140 and 160, above). This  fact  alone  has  resulted  in
                  widespread displacement  and  the  breakdown  of  social,
                  political and  economic  infrastructures.  Moreover,  the
                  situation has been greatly  exacerbated  by  al-Shabaab's
                  refusal to permit international aid agencies  to  operate
                  in the areas under its control,  despite  the  fact  that
                  between a third and a half of all Somalis are living in a
                  situation of serious  deprivation  (see  paragraphs  125,
                  131, 169, 187 and 193, above).
                  283.  Consequently,  the  Court  does  not  consider  the
                  approach adopted in  N.  v.  the  United  Kingdom  to  be
                  appropriate in the circumstances  of  the  present  case.
                  Rather, it prefers the  approach  adopted  in  M.S.S.  v.
                  Belgium and Greece, which requires it to have  regard  to
                  an applicant's ability to cater for his most basic needs,
                  such as food, hygiene and shelter, his  vulnerability  to
                  ill-treatment and the prospect of his situation improving
                  within a reasonable time-frame (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and
                  Greece, cited above, ï¿½ 254)."

86.   We confess that having surveyed the jurisprudence we do not  find  the
      state of the case law to be  altogether  satisfactory.  We  anticipate
      that we are not alone in puzzling at the ethical reach of the  Article
      3 jurisprudence where  on  the  one  hand  suspected  terrorists,  war
      criminals  otherwise  excluded  from  refugee  protection  or   others
      considered to be a source of risk to the host community are  protected
      from expulsion because of the real risk of being exposed to inhuman or
      degrading treatment on return, and on the  other  where  people  in  a
      similar position as these claimants, who may have entered  the  United
      Kingdom regularly and are guilty of  no  anti-social  conduct,  cannot
      claim human rights protection from return even though  they  face  the
      certainty of  imminent death following their removal  and the loss  of
      access to the life saving facilities they  enjoy  whilst  they  remain
      here.

87.   We cannot assess whether the observations in  Sufi  and  Elmi  suggest
      that the time  is  ripe  for  reconsideration  by  Strasbourg  of  the
      principles behind N v UK.[2]  We observe that there is surely  a  case
      for distinguishing between those who have never had access to a health
      facility to prolong life and those who have such access but will  lose
      it on removal. Equally a simple causation  test  as  favoured  by  the
      minority in N v UK, risks casting the net of Article 3 protection  too
      wide in contracting states facing rising demand for  health  resources
      and serious financial constraints on an ability to provide it. We  are
      however completely satisfied that it  is  not  for  this  Tribunal  to
      conduct such an analysis. We are bound by the conclusion of the  House
      of Lords in N v SSHD and have had due regard to the  decision  of  the
      majority in the Strasbourg Court in N v UK. We have no doubt for  both
      reasons we must follow N v SSHD. Any  development  in  the  applicable
      principles will not be for us. Unless and until there are developments
      at this level in the case law judges of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chambers must proceed on the basis that the rapidity of decline caused
      by the withdrawal of medical treatment cannot of itself amount to  the
      kind of exceptional circumstance  that  makes  removal   a  breach  of
      Article 3.

These Appeals

88.   We turn now to the determination of these appeals.

      GS

89.   The facts are not  in  dispute.   GS  came  to  the  UK  in  2004  and
      overstayed his working holiday visa.  In January 2009 he was diagnosed
      with kidney problems and now requires dialysis three times  per  week,
      each session lasting for about four hours.  He only  has  one  kidney.
      With that treatment, GS has a good life expectancy.  However,  without
      the treatment he would die within one to two weeks.  GS has family  in
      the UK including uncles, aunts and cousins.  In India, he has a mother
      and two brothers but his mother suffers from poor health.   The  Judge
      accepted that GS would not be able to  access  dialysis  treatment  in
      India which was available in Chandigarh which is about 300  kilometres
      from his village.  However, the cost would be 10,000-12,000 rupees per
      week which the Judge accepted GS and his family could not afford.   At
      para 10 of his determination, Judge Dove QC found that  the  certainty
      and immediacy of GS's death upon the withdrawal of treatment on return
      to  India  brought  his  case  within   the   "exceptional"   category
      contemplated in D v UK and N v UK.  The Judge found that  GS's  return
      to India would, therefore,  breach  Art  3.   The  Judge  reasoned  as
      follows at para 10:

           "In my view, whilst it  is  right  that  the  Appellant  in  the
           present case is not  suffering  from  a  condition  which  would
           conventionally be described as a terminal illness in  the  sense
           that with the treatment his otherwise immediate demise is  being
           staved off, nevertheless  in  my  view  in  effect  his  medical
           condition is extremely grave given  the  prospects  of  survival
           without the essential treatment which he requires.  It is  plain
           from the medical evidence that without dialysis  he  would  very
           quickly decline and die.  The immediacy of his  death  upon  the
           withdrawal of treatment brings his case, in my judgement, within
           the category of exceptionality contemplated  by,  for  instance,
           the case of N.  He is not a person who has come to the UK with a
           medical condition for which he has  then  been  able  to  obtain
           treatment in the UK the  withdrawal  of  which  might  upon  his
           return to his home country lead over the course of a  protracted
           period to a significant deterioration in his condition.  He is a
           person  who  came  to  the  UK  fit  and  well,  but   who   has
           unfortunately succumbed to kidney  failure,  a  condition  which
           without treatment would lead to  immediate  and  certain  death.
           Whilst theoretically there may be treatment available to him  in
           India,  the  practical  reality  is  that  there  would  be   no
           opportunity for  him  to  realistically  avail  himself  of  the
           dialysis which is essential to  prevent  his  early  death.   In
           those circumstances, in my judgement, his return to India  would
           amount to inhuman treatment of the kind prescribed by Article 3,
           given the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case.
            In those circumstances,  in  my  judgement,  the  appeal  under
           Article 3 must be allowed.

90.   Ms Lieven QC submitted that the Judge was entitled to find  that  GS's
      circumstances were "exceptional".  She submitted  that  there  was  no
      merit in the ground upon which permission  had  been  granted,  namely
      that it  was  an  arguable  error  to  conclude  that  GS's  case  was
      exceptional because the unavailability of the  medical  treatment  was
      only due to GS and his family not being able to pay for it.  Ms Lieven
      QC submitted that it was not the theoretical possibility of  treatment
      that  engaged  the  "exceptional"  case  but  rather   its   practical
      availability and she relied upon a passage in Baroness Hale's  opinion
      in N v SSHD at [69].  We agree with that submission.   Mr  Bourne  did
      not seek to rely upon the ground upon which permission to  appeal  was
      granted.  As we  have  set  out  above,  it  is  the  reality  of  the
      availability of the treatment  which  is  important  rather  than  its
      theoretical availability at a cost which the individual cannot afford.
       Providing the latter is factually  established,  and  Judge  Dove  QC
      found this fact in GS's favour, then the individual circumstances have
      to be assessed against the Art 3 threshold on the basis that the  life
      sustaining treatment is not available to them.

91.   Ms Lieven QC further submitted that GS's case was closer to  D's  than
      N's.  Both D and GS faced imminent death  on  return.   She  submitted
      that although GS's condition is not currently "critical", unlike  that
      of D when he was in the UK, it would become so  immediately  following
      removal.  She submitted that the  immediacy  and  certainty  of  death
      which would face GS on return with its attendant suffering and no hope
      of alleviation entitled Judge  Dove  to  conclude  that  this  was  an
      "exceptional" case and defined in GS's favour under Art 3.

92.   We do not accept Ms Lieven's submission.  The certainty and  immediacy
      of death did not, in our judgement, in itself bring GS's circumstances
      within the "exceptional" case contemplated in D v UK and N v UK.  That
      assessment  required  a  dispassionate  consideration   of   all   the
      circumstances facing GS on his  return  to  India.   That  included  a
      consideration of the circumstances in which he would die including any
      care and support available to him from family and  others.   We  agree
      with Toulson LJ's view in BC (India), that in itself the shortening of
      an individual's life expectancy to one to two  weeks  because  of  the
      absence of medical treatment does  not,  in  itself,  bring  the  case
      within Art 3. It is clear to us that Judge Dove QC considered that  it
      did and in that respect he erred in law and his decision cannot stand.
       It, therefore, falls to us to remake the decision.

93.   Would GS's  circumstances  in  India  fall  within  the  "exceptional"
      category that by  virtue  of  compelling  humanitarian  considerations
      engage Art 3?  As Judges before us have  noted,  these  are  difficult
      cases  to  decide  involving  life  threatening  conditions  and,   if
      unsuccessful,  inevitable  death.   The  latter,   however,   is   not
      determinative in leading inevitably to a breach of  Art  3.   That  is
      clear from the Strasbourg cases.  If  the  "exceptional"  category  of
      case contemplated in D v UK and N v UK were limited to those where the
      individual had already reached a critical stage in the  dying  process
      in the UK, then GS could not establish a breach of Art 3.  However, we
      do not consider that the "exceptional" category is so restricted.   We
      must reach a dispassionate judgement based on  all  the  circumstances
      which will face GS on return to India.  His  inevitable  death  within
      one to two weeks is one factor.  Another is his  family  circumstances
      in India.  He has two brothers and a mother, albeit  that  she  is  in
      poor health.  There is no suggestion in the evidence that  during  the
      period leading up to his death he  would  not  have  the  support  and
      comfort of his family.  Beyond speculation, there is  no  evidence  of
      the impact his dying and death will have on  his  family  beyond  what
      would ordinarily be expected in such a situation.  Equally,  there  is
      nothing to suggest that he would  not  be  able  to  obtain  at  least
      palliative care to alleviate, so far as possible, any suffering during
      that time.  Those facts differ from the situation faced by D on return
      to St Kitts where he would have no family or social support or medical
      care.

94.   Ms Lieven QC did not rely upon an argument  that  GS  would  suffer  a
      heightened intensity of suffering and  anguish  knowing  his  fate  on
      return to India by way of analogy to the 'death row' case of Soering v
      UK (1989) 11 EHRR 439.  Ms Benitez did place reliance on this argument
      in the case of EO.  It is appropriate that we also  deal  with  it  in
      respect of GS's appeal.   We  are  not  satisfied  that  the  evidence
      establishes any such aggravation of mental suffering of the  intensity
      seen in Soering where the 'death row phenomenon' resulted in  convicts
      awaiting execution in US prisons for many years.  Here, GS will return
      to his family.  He will have time to prepare and his removal  will  be
      in accordance with the Respondent's Guidelines, to which our attention
      has been drawn, only in carefully controlled circumstances where it is
      appropriate and safe to do so having regard to his medical  condition.
      GS's case does not, in our judgment, reach even the level  of  concern
      identified by the Strasbourg Court in Soering where, in any event, the
      applicant was unsuccessful in establishing a breach of Art 3.

95.    In  our  judgment,  GS's  circumstances  do  not  fall   within   the
      "exceptional" category.  GS's circumstances  do  not  reach  the  high
      threshold to establish a real risk of "inhuman or degrading treatment"
      as a result of suffering an undignified death.  For these reasons,  we
      dismiss this appellant's appeal under Art 3 of the ECHR.

      EO

96.   The facts are, again, not in dispute.  EO is  42  years  of  age.   He
      arrived in the UK in March 2005 on a short term work permit  which  he
      overstayed.  EO worked in this country as a full-time cleaner until he
      was arrested.  He sent money home.  In early 2006 he fell ill and  was
      diagnosed with end stage renal failure.  He  requires  dialysis  three
      times per week and although his life  is  currently  not  at  risk  if
      dialysis was stopped he would probably die within two to three  weeks.
      He also suffers from hypertension.  EO and his  family  would  not  be
      able to afford dialysis at around ï¿½3,000 per three month period.  EO's
      wife and son (now aged 9) live in Ghana. Their home  is  in  Tehma,  a
      suburb of Accra which is a three hour journey from the hospital.   His
      wife sells water for a living and lives in a rented one room  property
      with a toilet and bathroom but no running water.

97.   Ms Benitez adopted Ms Lieven's submissions in  relation  to  the  law.
      She told us that EO had been on a transplant list in the UK until 2006
      but was taken off it because of other health  factors  to  do  with  a
      heart  condition.   He  was  now  eligible  again.   As  regards  EO's
      condition on return to Ghana, Ms Benitez submitted that he  would  die
      an unpleasant and imminent death as treatment would not  be  available
      to him.  She reminded us that EO had a young son who had not seen  him
      since 2005 and who was unaware of his father's condition.  EO would be
      unable to work on return.  Ms Benitez submitted that EO would not have
      time to prepare for his death and this would aggravate  the  intensity
      of his suffering and mental anguish.  She relied upon the 'death  row'
      case of Soering v UK and submitted that Art 3 was engaged.

98.    We  must  reach  a  dispassionate  judgement   based   on   all   the
      circumstances which will face EO on return to Ghana.   His  inevitable
      death within two to three weeks is one factor.  Another is his  family
      circumstances in Ghana.  He has a wife and nine year old  son.   There
      is no suggestion in the evidence that during the period leading up  to
      his death he would not have the support and comfort of his family.  He
      has a home (albeit a modest one) in which he can live.  No  doubt  his
      family will be affected  by  his  dying  and  death  but  it  is  pure
      speculation as to the precise impact it will  have  upon  them  beyond
      what would ordinarily be expected in such a situation.  Equally, there
      is nothing to suggest that he would not be able  to  obtain  at  least
      palliative care to alleviate, so far as possible, any suffering during
      that time.  Those facts differ from the situation faced by D on return
      to St Kitts where he would have no family or social support or medical
      care.

99.   As regards Ms Benitez's reliance on Soering, we would repeat  what  we
      said in respect of GS at para 94 above which is, in our view,  equally
      applicable to EO's return to Ghana.

100.   In  our  judgment,  EO's  circumstances  do  not  fall   within   the
      "exceptional" category.   EO's circumstances do  not  reach  the  high
      threshold to establish a real risk of "inhuman or degrading treatment"
      as a result of suffering an undignified death.  For these reasons,  we
      also dismiss this appellant's appeal under Art 3 of the ECHR.

101.  Whilst we have concluded that neither GS nor EO can establish a  human
      right to remain in the UK, we would  repeat  as  applicable  to  these
      appellants the words of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in N v  SSHD
      at [99] where, speaking of the claimant in that case, he said:

           "Whilst, for the reasons given, I would not regard the return of
           this appellant to Uganda as a violation of article 3, it  by  no
           means follows that the Secretary of State  is  bound  to  deport
           her. Plainly he has the widest discretion  in  the  matter.  The
           likely impact upon immigration control (and, doubtless, National
           Health Service resources) of an adverse article 3 ruling in  the
           case  would  be  one  thing;  the  favourable  exercise  of   an
           administrative discretion in this individual case quite another.
           I am not saying that the Secretary of State should now  exercise
           his discretion in the appellant's  favour,  still  less  that  a
           refusal  to  do  so  would  be  challengeable;  only  that   the
           appellant's return would not inevitably follow from the  failure
           of her appeal."

Decisions

      GS

102.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow GS's appeal  under  Art  3
      of the ECHR involved the making of an error  of  law  and  we  set  it
      aside.

103.  We remake the decision dismissing GS's appeal.

      EO

104.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow EO's appeal  under  Art  3
      of the ECHR involved the making of an error  of  law  and  it  is  set
      aside.

105.        We re-make the decision dismissing EO's appeal.
