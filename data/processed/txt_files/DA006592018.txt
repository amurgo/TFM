Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr O Richards, Stanley Richards Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Latvia.  He was born  on  4  April  1997.
    On 5 October 2018, the Respondent made a deportation order against  the
    Appellant pursuant to Regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("2016  Regulations").   The  Appellant
    appealed against the decision.  His appeal was dismissed  by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Carey in  a  decision  dated  5  February  2020
    following a hearing on 30 January  2020.   Permission  was  granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison on 13 March 2020.  The matter
    came before the Upper Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 16  July
    2020 for an error of law hearing however there was no attendance by the
    Appellant either by way of Skype  or  telephone  communication  and  no
    indication as to why he as not attending.  Judge Kebede noted  that  he
    was no longer represented by Temple &  Co  Solicitors  who  had  ceased
    acting for  him.   Judge  Kebede  adjourned  the  matter  to  give  the
    Appellant a further opportunity to attend the hearing remotely  and  to
    call legal representation if possible.  The matter came before me on 10
    September 2020 by way of a remote hearing to  determine  whether  Judge
    Carey made an error of law.

 2. The Appellant came to the UK in  2004  when  he  was  aged  7.   On  25
    November 2013 he was cautioned for possession of cannabis.  On 18  July
    2014 he was cautioned for theft of a bicycle.  On 24 July 2014  he  was
    cautioned for shoplifting.  On 19 December 2017 at Norwich Crown  Court
    he  was  convicted  of  three  counts  of  burglary  and  breach  of  a
    conditional discharge.  On 5 February 2018 at Norwich combined court he
    was sentenced to a total of 22 months' detention in a young  offenders'
    institute and made subject to a criminal behaviour order for two years.
     He was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of �140.

 3. The sentencing judge made the following remarks:-

         "... Offences of domestic burglary  are  always  serious  offences.
         They involve unauthorised entry into peoples' homes.   They  often,
         as in some cases - here is clear from the victim impact  statements
         - have a very considerable effect on the people and  the  addresses
         burgled.  These - this is not a case of one isolated burglary of  a
         dwelling.  Each of you appear to be sentenced in relation to  three
         offences of burglaries of dwellings.  In relation to you, Mr X, you
         also appear for sentence in relation to two  offences  of  handling
         stolen goods; goods from burglary offences in which Mr Lazarevs was
         involved, but you were not.

         So far as Mr Lazarevs is concerned, Mr Lazarevs also appears to  be
         sentenced to a - for three offences of burglary.   In  relation  to
         two of those counts, counts 5 and 6,  they  were  burglaries  which
         occurred at night; they were burglaries in which at the time, there
         were - the occupants were asleep in their bed.  These -  those  are
         aggravating features.

         These are also offences that must have had some planning.   I  take
         the view that bearing in mind the nature of the offences, the  fact
         the number of offences, these are offences which substantially pass
         the custody threshold, and which only a custodial sentence  can  be
         appropriate.  Again, in your case, I take into account your age, in
         particular do not differ, bearing in mind your both come  here  for
         these three offences.  So far as those three offences are concerned
         - you've not been involved in anything else so far as sentence  day
         is concerned - the sentence would have been one of  24  months.   I
         reduce it to 21 months; 21 months in respect of each count and they
         will run concurrently.

         However,  these  offences  were  committed  within  weeks  of   you
         appearing before the Magistrates' Court and have been  given  a  24
         month conditional discharge in respect of an offence of shoplifting
         involving the theft of fragrances from Boots to a value of �368.50.
          The commission of these offences, i.e. the burglary offences, show
         a complete disregard for the sentence that you  -  for  you  -  the
         sentence was given by the Magistrates in respect of that matter.  I
         am going to deal with that today.  You will  be  sentenced  to  one
         months' custody in  respect  of  the  breach  of  that  conditional
         discharge, and that one month will be consecutive to the 21 months;
         a total sentence of 22 months ..."

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The Appellant attended the hearing and gave evidence in Russian through
    an interpreter.  He relied on his witness statement and he  was  cross-
    examined by the Home Office Presenting Officer. He accepted that he had
    been convicted at Norfolk Magistrates' Court on  18  January  2019  for
    possessing a specified item in prison without authority on 28 May  2018
    contrary to the Prison Act 1952.  He also accepted that  he  failed  to
    report to Immigration Enforcement in December 2019  and  January  2020.
    The judge recorded that the Appellant was released from  prison  on  14
    November 2018 on licence and that his licence was due to  expire  on  5
    February 2020.

 5. The judge had before him  a  witness  statement  from  the  Appellant's
    mother who did not attend the hearing.  The Appellant stated  that  she
    was unwell.  The judge had before an OASys assessment of 16  July  2018
    and an Appellant's bundle consisting of 266 pages.

 6. The Appellant's evidence in summary was that  since  his  release  from
    prison he had been employed for some of the time.  He was  living  with
    his mother.  He would not be able to manage should he return to Latvia.
     He does not know  anything  about  the  country  and  does  not  speak
    Latvian.  He accepted the convictions as noted  by  the  Respondent  in
    respect of the three burglaries.  He said that  he  had  committed  the
    offences because he was "young and really stupid".   His  evidence  was
    that he realised that he needed to change.

 7. The judge heard submissions from both  representatives.   Mr  Richards,
    appearing on behalf of the Appellant  submitted  that  the  Appellant's
    mother had secured  indefinite  leave  to  remain  which  in  his  view
    confirmed her existing rights of  residence.   He  submitted  that  his
    mother was a  permanent  resident  and  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    dependent on her since he was age 7.

 8. The judge made a number of findings.  He  set  out  the  background  at
    paragraph 27 recording when the  Appellant  entered  the  UK  with  his
    mother and that she was issued with a  registration  certificate  under
    the accession state worker registration scheme on 7 May 2004.  This was
    withdrawn due to non-exercise of treaty rights on 8  March  2008.   The
    judge recorded the Appellant's education  here.   He  attended  primary
    school and then secondary school.  He obtained various  qualifications.
    He joined the College of West Anglia and  enrolled  in  a  construction
    skills level 1 course.  Having previous attended an engineering  course
    at the same college the judge noted that the Appellant's offending  had
    escalated culminating in a series of domestic burglaries.   The  judge,
    at paragraph 33, considered the relevant level of protection  to  which
    the Appellant is entitled, and he directed himself, with  reference  to
    BF (Portugal) [2009] EWCA Civ 923.  He reminded himself  that  criminal
    convictions are never enough by themselves although they can  be  taken
    into account but only insofar as the circumstances which give  rise  to
    those convictions  or  evidence  of  personal  conduct  constituting  a
    present threat for the  requirement  of  public  policy.   He  reminded
    himself that the exclusion or deportation of an EEA national cannot  be
    justified on the grounds of general deterrence and that there  must  be
    some indication that the offender will commit further  offences  or  in
    some way infringe public security or policy.

 9. The judge, at paragraph 40, recorded that  the  Respondent's  case  was
    that the Appellant was not entitled to permanent residence at the  date
    of the decision.  The Respondent's case  was  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to produce any evidence that during the time when he was in full-
    time education as a minor either his  parents  were  exercising  treaty
    rights  during  the  necessary  five  year  period  or  that  he   held
    comprehensive sickness insurance.  The judge took into account a letter
    the  Appellant  produced  from  Job  Centre  Plus  dated  12  May  2010
    confirming that his mother received income  support  from  12  December
    2005 until 12 May 2010.  He also  took  into  account  a  P60  for  the
    Appellant's mother for the tax year 2014 - 2015.   The  judge  said  as
    follows:-

         "41. For some reason,  the  Appellant  has  not  produced  a  clear
             chronology  of  his  mother's  employment  history.   He   has
             produced some records from HMRC which  show  that  his  mother
             started work for Staffline Recruitment Limited on  30  January
             2015 when the Appellant would have been  age  17  and  was  no
             longer in education.  She appears to have worked for Staffline
             until beginning of December 2015  when  she  then  worked  for
             Number Nil Limited until 15 January 2016.   The  records  show
             that during the following year, she worked for Go West  Travel
             Limited and Store Central Info Limited.  None of that evidence
             suggests that the Appellant's  mother  was  exercising  treaty
             rights for any appreciable period when the  Appellant  was  in
             full-time education or prior to the Respondent's decision of 5
             October 2018 sufficient to entitle her son to recognition of a
             right of permanent residence.  Under the Regulations  the  cut
             off age for treatment of a child as a family member is 21  not
             18.

         42.  In addition, I do not have a clear account of the  Appellant's
             employment record prior to the date of the decision.  Although
             he claims in his statement of October 2019 that he has  worked
             in the United Kingdom and continues to be in employment, I  do
             not have any reliable information about his  employment  prior
             to 5 October 2018.  According to his  P60  for  the  tax  year
             2016/2017, he only earnt �458 during that tax year.  I have  a
             letter from Staffline confirming that he  was  employed  as  a
             temporary worker during that year from 29 July to 28 September
             2016.  At best his employment prior to the decision to  deport
             was sporadic.

         ...

         44.  Direct family members have an automatic right of residence  in
             the UK for as long as they remain the family  member  of  that
             EEA national and that person is either entitled to  reside  in
             the UK for an initial period of three months or as a qualified
             person or has a right of permanent residence.  It follows that
             in order to establish  any  right  to  reside  in  the  United
             Kingdom as a direct family member an  applicant  such  as  the
             Appellant must provide proof that the EEA national on whom his
             status is based (Ms Jelena Borescvska)  was  at  the  material
             time either living in the UK and exercising  a  free  movement
             right or has a permanent right of residence in the UK.

         45.  The Appellant's mother was granted indefinite leave to  remain
             under the EU settlement scheme on 10 April 2019.  EU  citizens
             are entitled to  apply  under  the  EU  settlement  scheme  to
             continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021.  Applicants  are
             entitled to settled status if they started living in the UK by
             31 December 2020 and have lived in the  UK  for  a  continuous
             five-year  period.   Successful  applicants  do  not  need  to
             establish that all or indeed any part of that period was spent
             as a qualified person.  Accordingly, the grant  of  indefinite
             leave to his mother does not assist the Appellant.  Applicants
             can simply  provide  their  national  insurance  number  which
             allows an automated check of the Applicant's  residence  based
             on tax and certain benefit records.  Those who  have  been  to
             prison usually need five years' continuous residence from  the
             day they were released to be  considered  for  settled  status
             under the scheme.

         46.  To achieve recognition of a right to permanent residence it is
             not necessary for the EEA national to  have  exercised  treaty
             rights for a continuous period of five years providing he  can
             show continuity of residence for that period.   The  five-year
             period may, however, be interrupted by gaps of  no  more  than
             two  year  when  Treaty  rights  were  not  being   exercised.
             Accordingly, periods when the union citizen is  working,  etc.
             can be aggregated so as to build up to five years eventually -
             the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Dias (case C-
             325/09 (CJEU) Third Chamber).  As long as the applicant has an
             aggregate of at least five years as a  qualifying  person,  it
             does not  matter  that  there  are  gaps.   There  has  to  be
             continuity of residence  throughout  but  not  necessarily  in
             accordance with the Directive or as a qualified person - COB v
             SSWP [2007] UKUT 255.

         47.  I am not satisfied that  at  the  date  of  the  decision  the
             Appellant was  then  entitled  to  permanent  residence  based
             either on his status as a family member and/or  as  a  worker.
             He does not have a clear or  comprehensive  work  history  and
             there was no evidence that he would be able to qualify in some
             other way such as a family member of a qualified  person.   In
             their letter of 5 March 2018, Temple & Co suggested  that  the
             Appellant's mother had acquired permanent  residence  by  2009
             but that cannot conceivably be right  if  his  mother  was  in
             receipt of income support from 12 December 2005 until  12  May
             2010 and had only been here since 2004.  There is no  evidence
             that during that period she  was  a  jobseeker  and  had  some
             prospect of obtaining employment.   In  her  statement  of  10
             October there is little mention of her employment and  benefit
             history."

10. The judge at paragraph 48 considered the  judge's  sentencing  remarks.
    At paragraph 49 of the decision  he  considered  the  OASys  assessment
    wherein the author had assessed the Appellant as being a medium risk to
    members of the public.  The nature of the risk was said to  be  "threat
    and  assault  if  challenged  and  psychological  harm  to  victims  of
    burglaries".  The judge recorded that the  risk  was  said  to  be  the
    greatest "when there is a need for money and in the company  in  others
    as he is easily influenced by peers".  The judge recorded factors  that
    were said to be likely to reduce the risk were "gaining employment  and
    not associating with likeminded peers".

11. The judge at paragraph 51 expressed  his  concern  at  the  Appellant's
    failure to comply with the terms of his immigration bail by failing  to
    report and that he was prosecuted for an offence committed  during  his
    time in prison.   The  judge  concluded  that  these  matters  did  not
    "inspire any confidence that the Appellant had learnt his lesson".

12. The judge said as follows:-

         "52. The Appellant was unable to tell me any significant about  his
             offences in evidence.  The account which he  gave  me  of  the
             reasons for his conviction for threatening  behaviour  do  not
             seem to reflect what is said about that offence in  the  OASys
             assessment.  There is it said that he  had  been  banned  from
             Farm  Foods  because  of  his  previous  behaviour  and   used
             threatening and abusive words  and  behaviour  when  asked  to
             leave by the manager.  He could  tell  me  nothing  about  his
             criminal damage offence yet according  to  the  assessment  it
             involved the Appellant with others entering  a  scrapyard  and
             causing damage by smashing the window of  a  crane  and  using
             that crane to smash another crane.  It is also  said  that  he
             was involved in smashing the headlights and  windows  of  five
             trucks.  His apparent unwillingness to tell me anything  about
             that offence or  alternatively  to  recall  what  happened  is
             troubling.

         53.  The Appellant's work history since his release from prison  is
             not entirely clear.  I do not have an undated  reference  from
             Trundley Properties Limited confirming that the Appellant  had
             been part of their team at the start of 2019.  However, he has
             only provided a few payslips relating to that employment and I
             have nothing from either Listerwoods or Travis Perkins.  I  am
             also concerned by the non-appearance  of  his  mother  at  the
             hearing or for that matter, any of his friends.  I have little
             evidence on the Appellant's current home circumstances and  in
             any event, it would appear  that  his  family  in  the  United
             Kingdom  (who  presumably   are   his   mother,   sister   and
             grandmother) had been unable to prevent him from offending  in
             the past.  Although the Appellant is currently said to  be  in
             employment I do not know  if  that  employment  is  stable  or
             secure.  He has had no less than three jobs since his  release
             from prison a little over one year ago.  His most  recent  job
             is low wage.

         54.  I am satisfied that  the  Appellant's  conduct  satisfies  the
             applicable policy criteria for removal in that  there  appears
             to be a risk that he  will  offend  in  the  future.   He  was
             assessed at medium risk of serious harm to the public  in  the
             OASys assessment completed less  than  two  years  ago.   That
             assessment identified that the Appellant had a problem 'mixing
             with bad company, 'managing money and dealing with debts'  and
             'making good decisions' and there is no  evidence  that  those
             factors may not continue  to  be  a  problem  in  the  future.
             Although he has not come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
             police since his release from  prison  he  has  only  been  at
             liberty for a relatively short period of time and is still  on
             licence.

         55.  The probation report of 25 September 2019 does not  say  there
             has been a decrease in the risk posed by  the  Appellant  from
             the assessment in the OASys Report.  Those assessed at  medium
             risk of serious harm are said to have 'identifiable indicators
             of risk of serious harm.  The offender has  the  potential  to
             cause serious harm but is unlikely to do so unless there is  a
             change  in  circumstances,  for  example   failure   to   take
             medication, loss  of  accommodation,  relationship  breakdown,
             drug or alcohol misuse'.  It was said in the OASys  assessment
             that the Appellant was 'currently easily encouraged to  offend
             by associates' and there is nothing in the probation report to
             suggest that has changed despite his attendance on the CHOICES
             rehabilitation group programme and what is said to  have  been
             the high level of engagement and understanding shown by him in
             relation to the  programme.   Although  it  is  said  that  he
             'appears' highly motivated 'learn from the programme'  and  to
             not reoffending (sic) in  the  future  there  is  insufficient
             evidence  that  the  risk  factors  identified  in  the  OASys
             assessment are no longer present or even if they are that  the
             Appellant will be able to  avoid  the  temptation  to  offend.
             Even if he was able to establish an entitlement  to  permanent
             residence, I consider that the Respondent  would  be  able  to
             show serious grounds for removal."

    In respect of rehabilitation the judge went on to say as follows:-

         "56. I therefore have to consider if it would be  proportionate  to
             remove the Appellant and in doing so,  I  have  to  take  into
             account the prospect of  rehabilitation.   It  is  only  where
             rehabilitation  is  incomplete  or   uncertain   that   future
             prospects may play a role in the overall assessment.  In  Essa
             (EEA rehabilitation/integration) [2013] UKUT 316 it  was  said
             that:-

                  'If the very factors that contribute  to  his  integration
                  that assist in rehabilitation of  such  offenders  (family
                  ties  and  responsibilities,   accommodation,   education,
                  training, employment, active membership of a community and
                  the like) will assist in the completion of  a  process  of
                  rehabilitation, then that can be a substantial  factor  in
                  the balance.  If the Claimant cannot constitute a  present
                  threat  when  rehabilitated  and   is   well-advanced   in
                  rehabilitation  in  a  host  state  where   there   is   a
                  substantial  degree  of  integration,  it  may   well   be
                  disproportionate to proceed to deportation.'

             At the other end of the scale,  if  there  are  no  reasonable
             prospects of rehabilitation, the Claimant is a present  threat
             and is likely to remain  so  for  the  indefinite  future,  we
             cannot  see  how  the  prospects   of   rehabilitation   could
             constitute  a  significant  factor  in  the  balance.    Thus,
             recidivist offenders, career criminals,  adult  offenders  who
             have failed to engage  with  treatment  programmes,  Claimants
             with impulses to commit sexual or  violent  offences  and  the
             like may well fall into this category.'

         57.  Even if I felt the prospects  of  rehabilitation  should  have
             significant weight, they are not a trump  card,  as  what  the
             Directive and the EEA Regulations require  is  a  wide-ranging
             holistic assessment.  Both recognise that the more serious the
             risk of reoffending,  and  the  offences  that  a  person  may
             commit, the greater the right to interfere with the  right  of
             residence.  The prospects of rehabilitation must be reasonable
             prospects not simply the  possibility  of  rehabilitation.   I
             accept that where  an  EEA  national  has  acquired  permanent
             residence it may be permissible to attach  substantial  weight
             to  the  prospects  of  his  rehabilitation  in  applying  the
             principles set  out  in  Regulation  27  particularly  as  the
             existence of permanent residence  may  suggest  a  significant
             degree of integration.

         58.  Where  an  applicant  does  not  have  a  permanent  right  of
             residence it is important that the issue of rehabilitation  is
             considered in context.  In SSHD v Dumliauskas and  Ors  [2015]
             EWCA Civ 145 the Court of Appeal made it  clear  that  in  the
             case of an offender  with  no  permanent  right  of  residence
             'substantial weight' should not be given to rehabilitation  as
             'the whole point of deportation is to remove from this country
             someone whose offending renders him  a  risk  to  the  public'
             (paragraph 54).  In the absence of evidence, it is not assumed
             that prospects are materially different between member states.

         59.  The Appellant's commission of a  further  offence  during  his
             time in prison and his failure  to  comply  in  terms  of  his
             immigration bail do not inspire confidence but he  is  someone
             who understands what is required to live in society.   I  know
             what is said in the probation report  of  25  September  2019.
             According to probation,  he  is  said  to  display  'excellent
             social skills and a  respectful  attitude  towards  staff  and
             other participants.  That report  was  prepared  in  September
             2019 before the Appellant failed to comply with the  terms  of
             its immigration bail.  It does not deal with  the  Appellant's
             employment records since his release from prison except to say
             that  he  had  secured  employment  with  Trundley  Properties
             Limited.  The report does not say why he left  that  company's
             employment and in particular whether  there  were  any  issues
             there.  It also does not say  anything  about  his  degree  of
             integration into society in this country.  I have little  idea
             how he spends his time here.  His mother  does  not  say  very
             much about his level of integration in her statement.

         60.  I accept the Appellant will not find it easy  to  relocate  to
             Latvia.  However, he should have no language difficulties even
             if he does not speak Latvian as a proportion  of  the  Latvian
             population continue to speak Russian.  He is a fit, young  man
             who should be able to relocate.  There is no evidence  of  any
             significant degree of integration into society in  the  United
             Kingdom despite his length of residence here.  The evidence  I
             have had suggests that  he  has  been  repeated  offender  and
             although he may not have come to the adverse attention of  the
             police since his release from prison, he has only been back in
             society for just over a year.

         61.  In summary I conclude that the Appellant's personal conduct as
             identified   above   represents   a   genuine,   present   and
             sufficiently serious threat; affecting one of the  fundamental
             interests  of  society   and   that   deportation   would   be
             proportionate in all the circumstances even if, contrary to my
             findings, he had established permanent residence at  the  date
             of the decision to remove him."

13. In respect of Article 8 the judge at paragraph  64  concluded  that  he
    does not have family life which  would  fall  for  consideration  under
    Article 8.  The Appellant does not have a partner or children here.  He
    accepted that the Appellant has a private life but does not  find  that
    he has a significant degree of integration.

                  condition in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             (2)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

                      more than two years prior to the termination; or

                  (b)  the incapacity is the result of an accident  at  work
                      or an occupational disease that entitles  the  person
                      to a pension  payable  in  full  or  in  part  by  an
                      institution in the United Kingdom.

             (4)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

                  (a)  is active as a worker or self-employed person  in  an
                      EEA State but retains a place  of  residence  in  the
                      United Kingdom and returns, as a rule, to that  place
                      at least once a week; and

                  (b)  prior to becoming so active in  the  EEA  State,  had
                      been continuously resident and continuously active as

                      Kingdom for at least three years.

             (5)  A person who satisfied the condition in paragraph  (4)(a)
                  but not the condition in paragraph (4)(b)  must,  for  the
                  purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), be  treated  as  being
                  active and resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  during  any
                  period during  which  that  person  is  working  or  self-
                  employed in the EEA State.

             (6)  The conditions in paragraphs (2) and (3) as to length  of

                  partner is a British citizen.

             (7)  Subject to regulation 6(2), periods of-

                  (a)  inactivity  for  reasons  not  of  the  person's  own
                      making;

                  (b)  inactivity due to illness or accident; and

                  (c)  in the case of  a  worker,  involuntary  unemployment
                      duly recorded by the relevant employment office,

                  must be treated as periods of activity as a worker or self-
                  employed person, as the case may be.

         'Qualified person'

         6.-  (1) In these Regulations-

                      cumulative total of any days during which the  person
                      concerned previously enjoyed a right to reside  as  a
                      jobseeker,  not  including  any  days  prior   to   a
                      continuous absence from  the  United  Kingdom  of  at
                      least 12 months.

             (2)  A person who is no longer working  must  continue  to  be
                  treated as a worker provided that the person-

                      illness or accident;

                  (b)  is in duly recorded  involuntary  unemployment  after
                      having been employed in the  United  Kingdom  for  at
                      least one year, provided the person-

                      (i)  has registered as a jobseeker with the  relevant

                      (i)  has registered as a jobseeker with the  relevant

             (3)  A person to whom paragraph (2)(c) applies may only retain
                  worker status for a maximum of six months.

             (4)  A person who is no longer in self-employment continues to
                  be treated as a self-employed person  if  that  person  is
                  temporarily unable to engage  in  activities  as  a  self-
                  employed person as the result of an illness or accident.

             (5)  Condition A is that the person-

                  (a)   entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  order   to   seek
                      employment; or

                  (b)  is present in the United Kingdom seeking  employment,
                      immediately after enjoying a right  to  reside  under
                      sub-paragraphs  (b)  to  (e)  of  the  definition  of
                      qualified person in paragraph (1)  (disregarding  any
                      period  during  which  worker  status  was   retained
                      pursuant to paragraph (2)(b) or (c)).

             (6)  Condition B is  that  the  person  provides  evidence  of
                  seeking employment and having a genuine  chance  of  being
                  engaged.

             (7)  A person may not retain the status of-

                  (a)  a worker under paragraph (2)(b); or

                  (b)  a jobseeker;

                  for longer than  the  relevant  period  without  providing
                  compelling evidence of continuing to seek  employment  and
                  having a genuine chance of being engaged.

             (8)  Condition C  applies  where  the  person  concerned  has,
                  previously,  enjoyed  a  right  to   reside   under   this
                  regulation as a result of satisfying conditions A and B-

                  (a)  in the case of a person to whom paragraph  (2)(b)  or
                      (c) applied, for at least six months; or

                  (b)  in the case of a jobseeker, for at least 91  days  in
                      total,

                  unless the person concerned has, since enjoying the  above
                  right to reside, been continuously absent from the  United
                  Kingdom for at least 12 months.

             (9)  Condition C is that  the  person  has  had  a  period  of
                  absence from the United Kingdom.

             (10) Where condition C applies-

                  (a)  paragraph (7) does not apply; and

                  (b)  condition  B  has  effect  as  if  'compelling'  were
                      inserted before 'evidence'."

         "Right of permanent residence

         15.- (1) The following persons acquire the right to reside  in  the
                  United Kingdom permanently-

                  (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom
                      in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous
                      period of five years;

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA
                      national but who has resided in  the  United  Kingdom
                      with  the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with  these
                      Regulations for a continuous period of five years;

                  (c)  a worker  or  self-employed  person  who  has  ceased
                      activity;

                  (d)  the family member of a worker or self-employed person
                      who has ceased activity, provided-

                      (i)  the person was the family member of  the  worker
                           or self-employed person at the point  the  worker
                           or self-employed person ceased activity; and

                      (ii) at that point, the family member enjoyed a right
                           to reside on the basis of being the family member
                           of that worker or self-employed person;

                  (e)  a person who was the family member  of  a  worker  or
                      self-employed person where-

                      (i)  the worker or self-employed person has died;

                      (ii) the family member resided  with  the  worker  or
                           self-employed  person  immediately   before   the
                           death; and

                      (iii)     the  worker  or  self-employed  person  had
                           resided continuously in the United Kingdom for at
                           least two years immediately before dying  or  the
                           death was the result of an accident at work or an
                           occupational disease;

                  (f)  a person who-

                      (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
                           with these Regulations for a continuous period of
                           five years; and

                      (ii) was, at the end of the period, a  family  member
                           who has retained the right of residence.

             (2)  Residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  result  of  a
                  derivative right to reside does not  constitute  residence
                  for the purpose of this regulation.

             (3)  The right of permanent residence under this regulation is
                  lost through absence from the United Kingdom for a  period
                  exceeding two years.

             (4)  A person who satisfies the criteria in this regulation is
                  not entitled to a right  to  permanent  residence  in  the
                  United  Kingdom  where  the  Secretary  of  State  or   an
                  immigration officer has made a decision  under  regulation
                  23(6)(b),  24(1),  25(1),  26(3)  or  31(1),  unless  that
                  decision is set aside or otherwise no longer has effect."

         ...

         Decisions taken on grounds of public policy,  public  security  and
         public health

         27.- (1) In this regulation, a 'relevant  decision'  means  an  EEA
                  decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                  security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
                  ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
                  person  with  a  right  of   permanent   residence   under
                  regulation 15 except on serious grounds of  public  policy
                  and public security.

             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
                  grounds of public security in respect of an  EEA  national
                  who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                      period of at least ten years prior  to  the  relevant
                      decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                      is in the best interests of the person concerned,  as
                      provided for in the Convention on the Rights  of  the
                      Child adopted by the General Assembly of  the  United
                      Nations on 20th November 1989(17).

             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
                  United  Kingdom  include  restricting   rights   otherwise
                  conferred by these Regulations in  order  to  protect  the
                  fundamental interests of society,  and  where  a  relevant
                  decision is taken on grounds of public  policy  or  public
                  security it must also be  taken  in  accordance  with  the
                  following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                      proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                      personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                      genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
                      affecting  one  of  the  fundamental   interests   of
                      society, taking into  account  past  conduct  of  the
                      person and that  the  threat  does  not  need  to  be
                      imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                      which relate to considerations of general  prevention
                      do not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                      themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                      even  in  the  absence   of   a   previous   criminal
                      conviction, provided the grounds are specific to  the
                      person.

             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                  public policy and public security in relation to a  person
                  ('P') who is resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision
                  maker must take account of considerations such as the age,
                  state of health, family and economic situation of  P,  P's
                  length of residence in the United Kingdom, P's social  and
                  cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
                  extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

             ...

             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the  requirements
                  of this regulation  are  met  must  (in  particular)  have
                  regard to  the  considerations  contained  in  Schedule  1
                  (considerations of public policy, public security and  the
                  fundamental interests of society etc.)."

Conclusions

15. There are six grounds of appeal.   They  are  repetitive  and  diffuse.
    They do not sufficiently particularise the challenges to the  decision.
    Mr Richards identified four distinct grounds in oral  submissions.   He
    did not pursue ground 6.  However, in his oral submissions he  did  not
    draw my attention to  the  decision  of  the  judge.   His  submissions
    challenged the decision of the Secretary of State. I will  engage  with
    each ground in order.

16.  The  first  written  ground  is  that  the  judge  erred  because  the
    Appellant's mother had permanent  residence.  (There  was  no  evidence
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  Appellant  had  permanent
    residence  independently  from  his  mother.   The  decision   is   not
    challenged on this basis).

17. Mr Richards said  that  because  the  Appellant's  mother  was  granted
    Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  under  the  EU  Settlement  scheme,  the
    Secretary of State must have been  satisfied  that  she  has  permanent
    residence.  However, there is  no  support  for  this.   There  was  no
    evidence before the judge to support the assertion.

18. It was argued by Mr Richards that in order to  receive  income  support
    the Appellant's mother had to meet the  "qualifying  conditions"  which
    included proving that she had worked for  at  least  a  year  prior  to
    claiming income support and meeting the right to reside  condition  for
    the duration of her claim.  Thus, the Appellant's mother  retained  her
    worker status and was able to claim income support continuing  to  meet
    the right to reside test. There is no substance in the argument.  There
    was evidence that the Appellant's mother came here as a worker in 2004.
     Her registration certificate was withdrawn in 2008.  It  may  be  that
    she was entitled to claim income support on the basis that she  resided
    here and/or had come here as a worker  but  that  does  not  mean  that
    throughout the period 2010 to 2015, when she was in receipt  of  income
    support, she was a  worker as  defined  in  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area Regulations 2016.  There is no support for this.

19. With reference to the written grounds, the Regulations  make  reference
    to temporary illness, but there was no  evidence  of  this  before  the
    judge and in any event the Appellant's mother  claimed  income  support
    from 2010 to 2015 and this cannot by any stretch of the imagination  be
    characterised  as  a  temporary  period.   The  grounds  say  that  the
    Appellant's mother was pregnant  and  gave  birth  to  the  Appellant's
    sister in 2009.  This was not disputed.  However, there was no evidence
    that she retained  worker  status  during  this  period  (or  that  she
    received Jobseeker's Allowance and was actively seeking  employment  or
    that she was unable to work as a result of temporary  illness  or  that
    she was on maternity leave- as asserted in the written grounds).

20. There was evidence that the Appellant's mother was in receipt of income
    support for almost five years.  There was a record of  employment  from
    2015.  There is no evidence that there were periods of  residence  that
    could be aggregated to amount to five years' residence as  a  qualified
    person.  The judge was wholly entitled to conclude that the Appellant's
    mother does not have permanent residence.

21. Ground 2 is an extension of ground 1.  It is asserted that because  the
    Appellant  mother  has  permanent  residence,  the  Appellant  as   her
    dependant has permanent residence and is entitled to a higher level  of
    protection.  However, the judge properly concluded that the Appellant's
    mother did not have permanent residence.  At [55] the judge  said  that
    even if he were wrong about the level of protection and  the  Appellant
    has permanent residence, the Respondent would still  be  able  to  show
    serious grounds.  There is no challenge to this  in  the  grounds.   Mr
    Richards did not address me on this finding.

22. Ground 3 asserts that the judge erred in relation to his findings about
    integration.  The grounds say that it is "absurd to conclude  that  the
    Appellant, having spent over two thirds of his formative  life  in  the
    UK, has not integrated in the UK".  Mr Richards pursued this ground  in
    oral submissions characterising it as  a  flaw  in  the  assessment  of
    proportionality.  His challenge was to the decision of the  Respondent.
    He said that there was no proper consideration of the  length  of  time
    that the Appellant has been here.  I conclude that there is no error of
    law.  The judge properly considered integration on the basis  that  the
    Appellant does not have permanent residence.  The judge was mindful  of
    the history and entitled to conclude that there was no  evidence  of  a
    significant degree of integration.  Despite the length of time that the
    Appellant has been here, in the light of his  offending  and  terms  of
    imprisonment and lack of evidence of integrative links, the decision is
    unarguably rational.  Periods of imprisonment weaken integrative links.
     There is nothing to support that the judge did not  properly  consider
    integration taking a holistic approach.

23. Ground 4 of the written grounds is that the judge did not apply a wide-
    ranging holistic assessment.   In  his  oral  submissions  Mr  Richards
    argued as ground 4 that the assessment of  proportionality  was  flawed
    because there was no account taken of the Appellant's lack of  ties  in
    Latvia.  However, this misrepresents the decision  of  the  judge  (see
    paragraph 60).

24. In the grounds it is asserted that the Appellant is a low risk offender
    contrary to the findings made by the judge.  Mr  Richards  conceded  in
    oral submissions that this was  not  supported  by  the  OASys  report.
    There was no properly articulated challenge to the level of risk  posed
    by the Appellant as found by the judge in the light of the OASys report
    and the risk factors identified therein. The probation report  did  not
    conclude that there was a reduction in risk posed. The judge considered
    the positive aspects of the probation report but was entitled to attach
    weight to the Appellant's more recent behaviour.   He  considered  that
    the Appellant had attended a rehabilitation group  programme,  but  was
    entitled to conclude that evidence of rehabilitation  was  limited  and
    that in any event, because the Appellant does not  have  permanent  and
    therefore the significance  of  rehabilitation  is  more  limited.  The
    judge's findings are grounded in the evidence and adequately  reasoned.



25. Mr Richards relied on the four grounds as set out above.  Ground  5  of
    the written grounds is a challenge to proportionality and an  extension
    of ground 4.  He did not rely on ground 6.  In any  event,  I  conclude
    that the judge properly identified the threat and properly engaged with
    the requirements of  the  2016  Regulations.   He  properly  considered
    future conduct and the risk factors identified by  the  author  of  the
    OASys  Report  and  how  they  applied  to  the   Appellant's   present
    circumstances.  The judge was entitled to express his concern about the
    evidence relating to the Appellant's employment.

26. The judge made findings which are grounded in the  evidence.   He  took
    into account all relevant matters and applied the correct  legal  test.
    The decision was open to the judge on  the  evidence  before  him.  The
    written grounds and  Mr  Richards  oral  submissions  do  not  properly
    identify an error of law. The decision of  the  judge  to  dismiss  the
    appeal under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016
    is maintained.

27. The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

28. No anonymity direction is made.
