For the Appellant:     Mr Ikeh, Moorehouse, Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Portugal  born  on  19  July  1983.   She
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 13 December  2014
    to remove her from the United Kingdom due to abuse of her rights  under
    Regulation  21B(2)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  (as
    amended).  The appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    James on 13 July 2015 and dismissed, in a decision  promulgated  on  24
    July 2015.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First Tier Tribunal Foudy on 12 November  2015.
    The grounds argue that the Judge erred in failing to consider  evidence
    that was submitted by the Appellant.  The grounds state that  a  bundle
    of documents was submitted within the terms  of  the  direction,  which
    stated that any further evidence had to be submitted by  14  July  2015
    but this bundle of evidence had not been put before the Judge  when  he
    made his decision.  The permission states that this amounts to possible
    procedural unfairness although the Judge was unaware of this.

The Hearing

 3. The decision was dealt with on the papers.  It is dated  14  July  2015
    although it was not promulgated until 24 July 2015.

 4. The direction  to  the  Appellant  stated  that  written  evidence  and
    submissions must be made to the Tribunal and the Respondent by 14  July
    2015.  There was no bundle from the Appellant  before  the  First  Tier
    Judge.

 5. The Appellant's representative submitted that  the  Appellant's  bundle
    was sent by fax on 14 July 2015.   Although  it  was  received  by  the
    Respondent it was not on the file when the First Tier  Judge  made  his
    decision.  He submitted that this resulted in procedural unfairness.

 6. The Home Office Presenting Officer submitted that when the  Appellant's
    bundle is considered it is clear that it was served on  14  July  2015.
    It is also clear that it was not before the  Judge  when  he  made  his
    decision.

 7. I find that there has been procedural unfairness in the way this appeal
    has been dealt with.

 8. I find that this amounts to a material error of law.

 9. I direct that the decision on this appeal is overturned and the  appeal
    is remitted to the First Tier Tribunal  for  a  fresh  hearing  on  all
    issues.

10. Anonymity has been directed.
