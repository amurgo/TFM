For the Respondent:    Mr P. Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant


1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  1st  March  1988.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 20th November  2014
    to refuse his application for leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student under the points-based system.  The Appellant wished  to  study
    for a BA  (Honours)  degree  in  marketing  at  the  London  School  of
    Marketing.  His appeal was allowed at first instance by  Judge  of  the
    First Tier Tribunal Watt sitting at Hatton Cross on 18th June 2015. The
    Respondent appeals with leave against that decision.  For  the  reasons
    which I have set out below (see paragraphs 13 to 18)  I  have  set  the
    First Tier Tribunal's decision aside on the grounds of a material error
    of law and have reheard the appeal.  Thus  although  this  matter  came
    before me originally as an appeal by the Respondent, for  the  sake  of
    convenience I will continue to refer to the parties as they were  known
    at first instance.

2.   The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 9th February 2008  after
    being granted leave to enter as a student valid from 23rd January  2008
    until 31st October 2011.  He then extended his leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student  and  his  last  leave  to
    remain was granted from 21st February 2013 until 20th April  2014.   On
    19th April 2014 he submitted his application for  further  leave  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student the refusal of which has  given  rise  to  the
    present proceedings.

3.   The Appellant was required to show that he was  in  possession  of  the
    sum of �2,000 for a consecutive 28  day  period  to  meet  the  Tier  4
    (General)  Student  maintenance  requirements  of  Appendix   C.    The
    Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  because  although  the
    Appellant had submitted a bank statement which showed an  account  with
    more than �2,000 in it the statement did not show the account  holder's
    name and thus  did  not  comply  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX(d).  The Appellant was awarded  30  points  for  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies (CAS).

4.    The  Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that   the
    Respondent should have afforded the opportunity  to  the  Appellant  to
    provide confirmation that the account in the bank statement was  indeed
    his.  Flexibility should have been exercised by  the  Respondent.   The
    bank account statement had not been delivered to the Appellant  at  the
    time he was making the application which  was  why  he  attended  on  a
    branch of the Halifax who stamped the copied statement.  The bank would
    not have stamped and verified those statements had they not  been  his.
    He was a genuine student  and  had  more  than  enough  funds  for  the
    required maintenance.  Furthermore the decision breached Article  8  of
    the Human Rights Convention.  The grounds gave scant  details  of  what
    this breach involved.

The Proceedings at First Instance

5.   Although the Appellant paid a fee of �140  entitling  him  to  an  oral
    hearing the Appellant's solicitors wrote to the Tribunal on  8th  April
    2015 stating that their client's instructions were that they would like
    the Tribunal to deal with the matter on the  papers.   The  matter  had
    been listed for hearing on 14th April but in light of the  request  for
    the matter to be determined on the papers the case  was  put  back  and
    thus came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Watt  on  18th  June
    2015 when he decided the matter on the papers.

6.   Judge Watt wrote:

         "6. The Appellant explains in his statement that in order to comply
         with the requirements for his visa he had  to  provide  a  personal
         bank statement to show a balance of over �2,000 for  more  than  28
         days.  He  explained  that  he  did  not  have  his  original  bank
         statement at the time of his application  so  he  asked  his  bank,
         Halifax, to stamp a printout of bank statement.  He then sent  this
         to the Home Office.  Unfortunately there was no note of his name at
         the top  of  these  printouts.   The  Appellant  has  now  produced
         documentation from the Halifax showing that this account is in fact
         his account and showing that the balance was over �2,000.  The bank
         account details and sort code details correspond  to  the  printout
         which was sent by him. The covering letters from the Halifax and  a
         copy of his current account which the Appellant has submitted  with
         this appeal all match the bank data details he  provided  with  the
         original application.  I am satisfied that the printouts  which  he
         submitted to the Home Office were in fact relating to  his  account
         and did show that there was the sum of �2,000 in  his  account  for
         more than 28 days.   However  I  understand  why  the  Home  Office
         refused the application as they had no proof that  these  printouts
         from the Halifax were in fact from the Appellant's account.


         "7. In all the circumstances I uphold this appeal before me to  the
         extent that the Home Office should now reconsider  the  application
         made by the Appellant."

7.   Although the Judge did not say so explicitly, I assume  that  what  the
    Judge meant was that he found the Respondent's decision to  be  not  in
    accordance with the law such  that  it  remained  outstanding  for  the
    Respondent to take a valid decision.  The appeal was  allowed  to  that
    limited extent.

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing that in  allowing
    the appeal  the  Judge  had  taken  into  account  further  documentary
    evidence submitted with the notice of appeal against  the  Respondent's
    decision.  This was contrary to the  restrictions  on  post-application
    evidence in points-based  system  cases  set  out  in  Section  85A  of
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  evidence  submitted
    with the original application did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and the Judge was bound to dismiss the appeal  under  the  Rules.
    It was unclear which of the statutory grounds  of  appeal  set  out  in
    Section 84(1) of the 2002 Act the Judge considered to be applicable  on
    the facts of this case.  The Respondent had  granted  the  Appellant  a
    right of appeal against the decision of  23rd  June  2014  stating  the
    Appellant was entitled to appeal the decision to refuse to  vary  leave
    and to remove him under Section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  amended  by  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

9.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nicholson on 29th September 2015.   He
    noted that  Appendix  C  paragraph  1B(ii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    required  the  Appellant  to  provide  bank   statements   covering   a
    consecutive  28  day  period  clearly  showing  the  Appellant's  name.
    Although the Judge had found that the Appellant had sent a printout  of
    his bank statement with his application that statement did not refer to
    the Appellant's name.  The Judge had allowed the appeal on the basis of
    post-application  documentation  from  the  bank  confirming  that  the
    account in question was indeed the Appellant's.  There was an exception
    to the operation of Section 85A of the 2002 Act whereby the Judge could
    consider evidence submitted with the  application  but  those  specific
    circumstances arguably did not apply in this case.   I  pause  to  note
    here that that exception includes for example evidence to prove that  a
    document is genuine.  The allegation in this  case  was  not  that  the
    document produced by the Appellant was not genuine the  allegation  was
    that it  did  not  comply  with  the  evidential  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, a different matter.  Judge Nicholson continued  that
    since the Judge had relied on post-application evidence  when  allowing
    the appeal the grounds of the permission application were arguable.

10.  Following the grant of permission to appeal the Appellant's  solicitors
    responded to the grounds of appeal  under  Rule  24  stating  that  the
    Appellant opposed the Respondent's appeal.  The Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal had directed himself appropriately. The bank account and  sort
    code details corresponded to the printout  sent  at  the  time  of  the
    application and thus it had been proven that the account  was  in  fact
    the Appellant's account.  The Appellant had given his  explanation  why
    he did not  have  an  original  bank  statement  at  the  time  of  the
    application and had asked the Halifax to stamp a printout.

11.  Reference was made in the Rule 24 reply to  paragraph  245AA(b)(iv)  of
    the Immigration Rules. The paragraph provides that if a  document  does
    not contain all of the specified information the Respondent may contact
    the applicant or his representative in writing and request the  correct
    documents.  The requested documents must be  received  at  the  address
    specified in the request within seven working days of the date  of  the
    request.  The Rule 24 reply contended that the Respondent had failed to
    apply her own published policy regarding points-based system evidential
    flexibility.  The Respondent must refuse an  application  if  it  would
    fall for refusal even if the missing information was  provided  but  in
    this case if the Respondent had requested  additional  information  the
    Appellant's application would have been approved.  It was open  to  the
    Judge to find on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  him  that  the
    Appellant did show that there was a sum of �2,000 in  his  account  for
    more than 28 days as required by the Rules.  The Appellant requested an
    oral hearing.

12.  The appeal was listed for hearing on Friday  18th  December  2015.   On
    10th December the Appellant's solicitors wrote again stating they would
    like to request the Tribunal to deal with the  matter  on  the  papers.
    Thus when the matter came before me  on  18th December  there  was  no
    attendance on behalf of the Appellant.  I heard brief submissions  from
    the Presenting Officer who argued that the Appellant could not  succeed
    under the Rules because the bank statement  submitted  did  not  comply
    with the evidential requirements.  As to  Article  8,  the  Appellant's
    status in this country had  been  precarious  and  in  accordance  with
    authorities such as AM Malawi and SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387,  little
    weight could be attached to the Appellant's private life when assessing
    the proportionality of any interference with it. The appeal  should  be
    dismissed.



Findings

13.  The first issue I have to decide is whether there was an error  of  law
    in the First-tier Tribunal's decision such  that  it  fell  to  be  set
    aside.  The Judge did not refer to paragraph 245AA(b)(iv) (or any issue
    of discretion) in allowing the appeal.  What the Judge said was that he
    understood why the Respondent had refused the application as  it  could
    not be proved that the document submitted by the Appellant was from the
    Appellant's account.

14.  The document  which  the  Appellant  had  submitted  was  marked  "view
    statement entries" and gave  a  fourteen  figure  number.   There  were
    entries covering the period 3rd March 2014 until 17th March 2014 and to
    26th March 2014 and to 3rd April 2014.  At no point during that  period
    had the balance fallen below the sum of �2,000.  There were a number of
    payments into the account credited to "Ahsan  M"  but  the  Appellant's
    name did not appear as the account holder and the bottom  of  the  page
    indicated a website which said "transcrm.lloydstsb.co.uk".

15.  It is difficult to see  how  this  document  satisfied  the  evidential
    requirements in Appendix C. These are: (i)  that  the  statements  must
    clearly show the name of the  applicant,  the  financial  institution's
    name, the financial institution's logo and must be  either  printed  on
    the bank's or building society's letterhead; (ii) if an electronic bank
    or building society statement it must be accompanied  by  a  supporting
    letter from the bank  or  building  society  on  company  headed  paper
    confirming the statement provided is  authentic;  (iii)  If  it  is  an
    electronic bank or building society statement it must bear the official
    stamp of the bank or building society on every  page.   The  statements
    must not be mini statements from automatic telemachines.

16.  The document submitted by the Appellant fell foul of a number of  these
    requirements particularly the name of the Appellant but if the document
    was to come under the  category  of  an  electronic  bank  or  building
    society statement it would have to bear the official stamp of the  bank
    or building society on every page.  What the document had  was  a  date
    stamp from the Halifax but the document itself was only  a  copy.   The
    Appellant did not  on  his  own  admission  have  the  original.   This
    document did not comply with the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    Appendix C.  It was not a document which was part of a series of  which
    one or other were missing.  Rather it could be said to be a document in
    the wrong format, a copy rather than an original and a  document  which
    did not contain all of the specified information.

17.  If it was the case that one or  more  of  the  three  circumstances  in
    paragraph 15 above  applied  then  the  Respondent  had  discretion  to
    contact the Appellant or his representative in writing and request  the
    correct documents.  Documents need not be requested where  a  specified
    document had not  been  submitted  or  where  the  Respondent  did  not
    anticipate that addressing the omission or error would leave to a grant
    because the application would be refused for other reasons.  Given  the
    lack  of  specified  information  on  the  document  submitted  by  the
    Appellant in this case it is difficult to see how the Respondent  could
    have considered that the deficiencies could  be  rectified.   What  the
    Appellant in fact did for the hearing at first instance was  to  supply
    full bank statements from the Halifax under cover of a letter from  the
    Halifax dated 2nd July 2014 almost two  weeks  after  the  decision  to
    refuse and thus postdecision evidence.  The Appellant had  provided  no
    valid reason why he had been unable to submit statements  in  the  form
    issued by the Halifax  to  him  in  July  when  he  made  his  original
    application.  This case was not caught by the provisions  of  paragraph
    245AA and it was not a case where the Respondent should have considered
    the exercise of her discretion but did not.  It is fair to say that the
    refusal decision does not  contain  a  reference  to  the  exercise  of
    discretion but for the reasons I have given I do not consider that  the
    issue arose in the first place.

18.  The Judge permitted the Appellant  to  rely  on  postdecision  evidence
    namely the letter from Halifax and the  accompanying  full  statements.
    That evidence was prohibited by operation of Section 85A and could  not
    be admitted.  The Appellant does  not  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules as his application fell for refusal by reason of his  failure  to
    comply with the requirements of Appendix C.  I set aside the First Tier
    decision and remake the decision by dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal
    under the Rules.

19.  The remaining matter is the Appellant's  claim  that  the  decision  to
    remove him would disproportionately interfere with  his  private  life.
    There is no claim to a family life. The Appellant had only been in  the
    United Kingdom for a relatively short time and his  immigration  status
    was precarious with no expectation that he would be  granted  permanent
    residence.  Although few details of the Appellant's private  life  have
    been given in this case I accept that he has established a private life
    during the almost eight years he has been  in  this  country  and  that
    private life will be interfered with by requiring  him  to  leave  now.
    The interference will be pursuant to the legitimate aim of  immigration
    control since the Appellant  cannot  meet  the  Rules  having  made  an
    application for further leave which has failed for the  reasons  given.
    The  issue  is  whether  the  interference  is  proportionate  to   the
    legitimate aim being pursued.  By reason of the  operation  of  Section
    117B of  the  2002  Act,  little  weight  is  to  be  attached  to  the
    Appellant's  private  life  established  whilst  his  status  here  was
    precarious.  On the other side of  the  equation  is  the  considerable
    weight to be attached to the public interest in removing the  Appellant
    which I find outweighs the  argument  on  the  Appellant's  side.   The
    decision to refuse the Appellant further leave and  to  remove  him  is
    proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.   The  Appellant's  appeal
    also fails under Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I have remade the decision  in  this  case  by
dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.
