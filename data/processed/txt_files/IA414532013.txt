Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Salam (Salam & Co Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

       1.  The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan.   There   was   no
          application for anonymity and I can see  no  reason  to  anonymise
          this decision.

       2. The issue before the First-tier Tribunal  was  a  narrow  one  and
          related to whether or not there was a valid appeal.

Background

       3. This is an appeal that has been considered by a number  of  Judges
          over an extended period of time but the  relevant  background  can
          be summarised quite easily.

       4. The appellant made an application to extend his Tier  4  (General)
          leave on 15 February 2013.  He completed the relevant FLR(O)  form
          together with the payment page (comprising 12 parts).   That  page
          clearly demonstrates that the appellant  properly  and  accurately
          completed the form save for part 5.   This  states  "amount-please
          tick the amount you are paying".  There then follows eight  boxes.
           It is accepted that none of these boxes were ticked.

       5. On 22 February 2013 the SSHD refused to accept the application  as
          valid on the basis that the appellant "has not  made  any  payment
          and has not completed the payment page of the  application  form".
          The application was resubmitted on 27 February and then varied  on
          16 April 2013.  Although a further refusal decision was made on  7
          May 2013, this did not address the variation to  the  application.
          In a decision dated 30 September 2013 the SSHD refused the  varied
          application  for  two  reasons.   First,  it  was  said  that  the
          appellant had overstayed his leave, which expired on  22  February
          2013.  For completeness, the appellant had  been  granted  further
          leave to remain until 19 February 2013 but this  was  extended  by
          virtue of section 3C until the application was treated as  invalid
          on 22 February 2013.  Second, it was said he did not have a  valid
          CAS.  This decision stated that there was no right  of  appeal  as
          the appellant did not have leave at the time  of  the  application
          dated 26 April 2013.

       6. When the matter came before Judge Gladstone on 19 June  2014  both
          parties accepted that the  sole  question  to  be  considered  was
          whether the decision dated 30 September 2013 should be treated  as
          a decision refusing to vary leave (which carries with it  a  right
          of appeal under s 82(2) of the NIAA 2002) as opposed to a  refusal
          of leave (which does not carry with it a right of appeal as it  is
          not an immigration decision for the purposes  of  the  2002  Act).
          It was also agreed that the answer  to  this  question  turned  on
          whether or not the SSHD was correct to treat the 15 February  2013
          application as invalid.  If valid, leave was  extended  by  virtue
          of section 3C pending the final determination of the  matter.   If
          invalid, leave expired on 22 February 2015.   The  parties  before
          me accepted that this was the correct way to approach this case.

       7. Judge Gladstone carefully recorded the competing submissions  [34-
          37] and directed herself to  Basnet  (validity  of  application  -
          respondent) [2012] UKUT 00113  (IAC).   She  concluded  that  [39]
          "the appellant had not completed the payment page in  full  as  he
          failed to tick the amount he was paying and  thus  the  respondent
          was unable to take the fee as it had not been  authorised  by  the
          appellant."  She went on to say [40]:

                 "On that basis, I find that the application of 15  February
                 2013  was  not  accompanied  by  a  fee  as  it   was   not
                 'accompanied by such  authorisation...as  will  enable  the
                 respondent to receive the entire fee in  question,  without
                 further recourse having to be made by the respondent to the
                 payer [her emphasis] given that no amount was specified and
                 thus not authorised."

       8.  Judge  Gladstone  therefore  found  that  there  was   no   valid
          application and no valid appeal before her.

       9. In grounds of appeal prepared by  the  appellant,  it  was  argued
          that R (Zinyemba)  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWHC  2237  (Admin)  contained
          persuasive reasoning that in circumstances similar to the  instant
          case the SSHD has not displaced the  burden  of  establishing  the
          application to be invalid.  In a decision dated 12  December  2014
          Judge Grubb considered this to be an arguable  point  and  granted
          permission to appeal.

      10.  The  matter  now  comes  before  me  to  decide   whether   Judge
          Gladstone's decision contains an error of law.

Hearing

      11. Mr Salam relied upon his grounds of appeal and provided a copy  of
          Zinyemba to Ms  Johnstone.   Ms  Johnstone  submitted  that  Judge
          Gladstone was correct and the observations in Zinyemba  failed  to
          appreciate that there was no mandate to process  the  fee  without
          the relevant box being ticked.

      12. I indicated that the decision contains an error of law  such  that
          the First-tier decision is set aside, and my reasons are  set  out
          below.

      13. Both representatives accepted that as the substantive issue  under
          appeal had not been considered by the First-tier Tribunal  it  was
          appropriate for the  appeal  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
          Tribunal. I agreed that this is the most  fair  and  proportionate
          way in which to deal with this case having regard to para  7.2  of
          the relevant Senior President's Practice Statement.   I  therefore
          gave directions for the future conduct of the appeal.

Findings

      14. This is a case in which it is accepted by the SSHD that  the  only
          reason that the application was treated as invalid is  because  of
          the failure to tick the box at part 5 in order  to  indicate  that
          the amount to be paid  was  �561  (because  the  appellant  was  a
          single applicant with no dependents).  The SSHD has accepted  that
          the burden is upon her to establish that  the  fee  could  not  be
          taken, in accordance with Basnet.  The SSHD does not contend  that
          there were insufficient funds or that an attempt was made to  take
          the funds but that it was successful.   The  SSHD  simply  submits
          that no attempt was made because the relevant box was not  ticked.
           The SSHD's reasoning is difficult to follow.  It is not  disputed
          that the only possible box applicable to  the  appellant  was  the
          �561 one.  No other box could apply because the appellant  had  no
          dependents and the application was postal,  not  premium.   Indeed
          the SSHD has accepted this was  the  only  possible  relevant  box
          when it was said in the letter dated 22  February  2013  "the  fee
          specified for an application made on this basis is  �561".   There
          was therefore very little room for any doubt  that  by  completing
          the payment form and the FLR(O) in the manner  that  he  did,  the
          application was accompanied by an  authorisation  to  process  the
          relevant fee of �561.  To use the wording in Basnet the  SSHD  was
          in a position "to receive the  entire  fee  in  question,  without
          recourse having to be made by the [SSHD] to the payer."

      15. That analysis is supported by the observations of James Lewis  QC,
          sitting  as  a  Deputy  High  Court  Judge  in  Zinyemba.    These
          observations were not available to Judge Gladstone as the  hearing
          before her took place shortly  before  the  hearing  in  Zinyemba.
          This case was different to the instant one  because  the  relevant
          payment form was unavailable and it was found that  the  SSHD  had
          not discharged the burden that the claimant was inaccurate in  her
          evidence that she ticked the relevant box.  By  contrast  in  this
          case it  is  accepted  that  the  relevant  box  was  not  ticked.
          However Judge Lewis went on to observe that even if he  was  wrong
          to reach that conclusion [15]:

                 "there is force in the claimant's submission that  all  the
                 information was available to deduct the correct  fee.   The
                 defendant says that the payment processor  would  not  know
                 that, but I am unimpressed by that argument.   Implicit  in
                 any finding that the correct box was ticked  would  be  the
                 evidence of the caseworkers of the defendant carrying out a
                 double check whether  the  payment  processor  had  made  a
                 mistake.  In that process, had it occurred, it  would  have
                 been clear to the caseworker what the correct fee was  even
                 if it was not clear to the payment  processor  so  that  it
                 could have been withdrawn in accordance with the claimant's
                 mandate to do so.  That would have been  the  common  sense
                 and fair  thing  to  do  given  the  clear  importance  and
                 consequences of rejection of the application."


      16. These observations are  of  course  not  binding  upon  me  but  I
          entirely agree with them.  Judge  Lewis  made  these  observations
          having  considered  detailed   evidence   regarding   the   SSHD's
          processes  for  considering  applications  such  as  these.   This
          evidence was apparently  relied  upon  in  order  to  address  the
          claimant's submission that there could be no  misunderstanding  of
          what the correct fee was on any reasonable reading of the  form  -
          a similar argument deployed before Judge Gladstone.

      17. I am satisfied that Judge  Gladstone  made  an  error  of  law  in
          determining that it would have been  necessary  for  the  SSHD  to
          clarify with the appellant precisely which fee  he  wished  to  be
          taken.  The relevant fee  was  absolutely  obvious  and  the  only
          possible one, as acknowledged  by  the  SSHD,  as  was  the  clear
          mandate provided by the appellant.  Even if I am wrong about  that
          the SSHD has not provided any caseworker notes  to  set  out  what
          happened in this case and why it was  believed  that  the  correct
          fee to be taken was not the patently obvious one.  In the  absence
          of such evidence Judge Gladstone erred in law in finding that  the
          SSHD had displaced the evidential burden.   There  was  simply  no
          evidence to establish that the mandate was unclear.   In  all  the
          circumstances of this case the completion of  the  relevant  forms
          was sufficiently clear to provide the mandate notwithstanding  the
          failure to tick a box at part 5.

      18. It follows that I remake the decision by  finding  that  the  SSHD
          has offered no evidence to support  the  assertion  that  the  fee
          could not be taken.  The evidence that is available - the forms  -
          are sufficient to indicate that the relevant fee of �561  was  the
          obvious and only possible one and could have  been  taken  without
          recourse  to  the  appellant.   On  the  evidence  available,  the
          application was accompanied by the specified fee, and was  validly
          made.  It follows that there is consequently a right of appeal  to
          the First-tier Tribunal.  The SSHD did  not  seek  to  argue  that
          there should be any other outcome if I was of the  view  that  the
          15 February 2015 application was accompanied by the relevant fee.

      19.  There  remains  a  dispute  as  to  whether  in  any  event   the
          application to vary  leave  should  have  been  granted  as  there
          remains a dispute regarding the  validity  of  the  CAS  provided.
          Neither party had the relevant material to argue  this  issue  and
          as there has never been a substantive hearing  in  the  First-tier
          Tribunal it was agreed that the appropriate  way  forward  bearing
          in mind para 7.2  of  the  relevant  Senior  President's  Practice
          Statement, is for the matter to be remitted to  that  Tribunal  to
          determine the appeal.

Decision

      20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
          and is set aside.

      21. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions

      22. Both parties agreed that there remains one  outstanding  issue  in
          dispute - the validity of the CAS relied upon by the appellant  at
          the relevant date in 2013 and I have  therefore  given  directions
          to ensure that this issue  can  be  resolved  either  between  the
          parties and if not, by the Tribunal as  efficiently  as  possible,
          given the delay in this matter.

               1)  Before  12noon  on  19  August  2015,  the   appellant's
                  solicitors  shall  file  and  serve  a  summary  of   the
                  appellant's position concerning the CAS as at the date of
                  the application dated 15 February 2013 and any other date
                  considered to be relevant.   This  shall  cross-refer  to
                  pages within an indexed and paginated  bundle  containing
                  relevant documents, rules, policy and case law.


               2) Before 12noon on 2 September 2015 the SSHD shall file and
                  serve its position in response together with any material
                  relied upon.  This shall include a clear indication as to
                  whether the decision dated 30 September 2013 in  relation
                  to the  CAS  is  maintained  or  withdrawn  with  reasons
                  provided for the course taken.

               3) The appeal shall be listed in the First-tier Tribunal  on
                  the first available date with  a  time  estimate  of  one
                  hour, in order to consider the only  remaining  issue  in
                  dispute - the validity of the CAS relied upon.
