                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, born on 13th June  1990.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 17th November  2014
    which had refused her application to vary leave to remain and to remove
    her by way of directions under Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  Her appeal was allowed at first instance  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer sitting at  Nottingham  on  3rd
    July 2015.  The Respondent  appealed  that  decision  and  following  a
    hearing at Field House on 15th January 2016 I set aside the decision of
    Judge  Colyer  particularly  insofar  as  it  related  to  whether  the
    Appellant could succeed under paragraph 276ADE(1)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Judge Colyer had found that there were significant obstacles to
    the Appellant's reintegration into Sri Lanka.  Annexed to this decision
    is my decision dated 11th February 2016 in which  I  found  a  material
    error of law in that decision and  set  it  aside.   The  question  was
    whether there were very significant obstacles  which  would  prevent  a
    return to Sri Lanka.

2.   The Appellant lived in Sri Lanka until she was 16  years  of  age  when
    she moved with her family to India where the family claimed asylum  and
    were recognised as refugees.  The Appellant's father came to the United
    Kingdom and made an application for asylum on 8th January 2008.  He was
    granted refugee status on 14th August  2009.  The  Appellant  lived  in
    India for five years making an application to join her  father  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2011.  This application was refused but  was  allowed
    on appeal when the Appellant was granted entry clearance for two  years
    valid from 16th April 2012  until  13th  August  2014.   The  Appellant
    entered the United Kingdom on 21st September 2012 after her  successful
    appeal.  On 17th July 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom outside the Rules.   It  was  the  refusal  of  this
    application by the Respondent on 17th November 2014 that has given rise
    to the present proceedings.

3.   At paragraph 28 of my earlier decision I noted the concession  made  by
    the Respondent that if further evidence was  submitted  the  Respondent
    could look at the matter again and potentially make a fresh decision on
    whether the Appellant would face very significant obstacles upon return
    to Sri Lanka.  On the other  hand  if  no  such  further  evidence  was
    submitted to the  Respondent  or  if  the  Respondent  replied  in  the
    negative, then the matter would have to  come  back  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal for the appeal to be concluded.  Further submissions were made
    to the Respondent by  letter  dated  28th  April  2016  which  included
    extracts from the Operational Guidance Note for Sri  Lanka  dated  July
    2013. However they were not considered by the  Respondent  in  time  to
    make any difference to the hearing before me which had been  fixed  for
    6th May 2016.

The Hearing Before Me

4.   Counsel for the Appellant indicated that the case would proceed by  way
    of submissions only as he did not propose to call any  oral  testimony.
    Certain findings of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal  determination
    of Judge Colyer were preserved.  The Appellant's uncle  and  aunts  had
    been displaced in Sri Lanka and there was no contact  with  them.   The
    Appellant had no family members in India where  she  had  travelled  to
    from Sri Lanka aged 16  and  had  been  accepted  as  a  refugee.   The
    Appellant had lived in India for five years.  Although over 18 she  was
    financially and emotionally dependent upon them.  I pause to note  here
    that I concluded at paragraph 25 of my earlier  decision  that  it  was
    difficult to say that the Appellant was dependent  on  her  family,  if
    anything they were more dependent upon her, given that she was  sending
    them half of her earnings each month.  Furthermore as  became  apparent
    the Appellant's case was in fact that the family were dependent on  her
    and not the other way around.  She worked in a residential care home in
    Essex since 7th June 2013 working away from home in  a  shift  pattern.
    She was no longer financially dependent on her family  but  pooled  her
    finances  with  them.   She  was  financially  supporting  her  younger
    siblings who were in full-time education.  She was unable to find  work
    in Leicester and cared for vulnerable people in a care home.   She  was
    single, not in a relationship and had no children.  All of  her  family
    save for her had indefinite leave to remain.  On this point I commented
    at paragraph 26 of my error of law decision:

         "The Appellant's position appears somewhat anomalous given that she
         alone of the family does not have indefinite leave to remain and it
         is difficult to see how her circumstances so  sharply  differ  from
         the others such that she should not have indefinite leave to remain
         whilst the others do.  Nevertheless the fact that the Appellant had
         two years' leave to remain granted to her did not mean that she had
         any  form  of  legitimate  expectation  that  her  leave  would  be
         continued."

5.   The skeleton argument cited page  41  of  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions on Family Migration, Section  8.2.3.4  that  the  starting
    point was to assume that an applicant would be able to  integrate  into
    their country of return unless they could demonstrate why this was  not
    the case.  The focus was squarely with respect  to  conditions  in  the
    country of origin.  There were three main headings to be  addressed  in
    the Respondent's policy: cultural background; length of time  spent  in
    Sri Lanka and family, friends and social network there.  The  Appellant
    was still a child with her immediate family when she left Sri Lanka  at
    age 16.  The Respondent could not depart from her own published  policy
    guidance without good reason and the Operational Guidance Note  was  to
    be treated as the published policy position of the Respondent; see  CMD
    [2010] UKUT 215.  The Appellant had no family friends or social network
    in Sri Lanka.  I pause to note here that it is not quite right.   As  I
    stated at paragraph 4 of my earlier decision, Judge Colyer had accepted
    that the Appellant and her family had fled Sri Lanka  as  refugees  but
    "although there might be some extended family in that country there was
    no contact with any of them".

6.   Women as part of a particular social group  could  be  granted  refugee
    status as they constituted a risk  group  on  account  of  gender-based
    violence without  effective  state  protection  or  a  viable  internal
    relocation alternative.  The Appellant was not highly educated or  part
    of a social elite.  Her work made her akin to a manual labour  category
    for women as a care assistant.  As she would be  returning  as  a  lone
    female without any family  network  in  Sri  Lanka  there  was  a  real
    likelihood that on the basis of the country evidence relied upon by the
    Respondent as a Tamil she could be  the  target  of  various  forms  of
    sexual assault.  The Asian Development Bank had  reported  that  sexual
    harassment of  women  was  trivialised  and  there  was  a  culture  of
    acceptance  around  violence  against  women.   Female  returnees   and
    internally displaced persons,  and  particularly  female  rehabilitees,
    were  vulnerable  facing  social,   cultural   and   livelihood-related
    difficulties  in  connection  with  their  resettlement.   On  a   fact
    sensitive enquiry and in the light of the  Respondent's  own  published
    policy position there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    integration of the Appellant as a lone woman returning  to  Sri  Lanka.
    The evidence showed a real risk of sexual assault with an acceptance by
    the Respondent in the 2013 Operational Guidance  Note  that  successful
    asylum claims could succeed with this category of claims.  The standard
    of proof in this case was the balance of probabilities.

7.   In the case of Miah [2016] UKUT 00131 it was  stated  that  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions were ranked as a relevant consideration to  be
    taken into account by decision makers in every case where they applied.
     The onus was on the applicant to show that there were very significant
    obstacles to that integration according to the IDIs.  It was not on the
    decision maker to show that there were no such obstacles.  The decision
    maker  should  expect  to  see  original  independent  and   verifiable
    documentary evidence of any claims made in this regard and  must  place
    less weight on assertions which were unsubstantiated.  Very significant
    obstacles would exist where the applicant demonstrates that they  would
    be unable to establish a private life in the country of return or where
    establishing a private life would entail very serious hardship for  the
    applicant.  The decision maker should consider  whether  the  applicant
    has the ability to form an adequate private life by  the  standards  of
    the country of return not by UK standards.  An applicant who has family
    or friends in the country of return should be able to turn to them  for
    support to help them to integrate into that country.  Where there  were
    no family friends or social networks in the country of return that  was
    not in itself a very significant  obstacle  to  integration.   Lack  of
    employment prospects  was  very  unlikely  to  be  a  very  significant
    obstacle to integration.  The IDIs did not claim to  be  an  exhaustive
    code.  They did not have the status of law and thus were subservient to
    primary legislation, secondary legislation and the Immigration Rules.

8.   Counsel argued that the starting point was where would the  Appellant's
    home area be?  The Appellant would be returning as a lone, single woman
    with no family support in Sri Lanka. If the Appellant could succeed  in
    a protection claim  then  she  would  succeed  under  Article  8.   The
    Appellant relied only on the Respondent's Operational Guidance Note but
    the Respondent could not challenge her  own  published  policies.   The
    Appellant was not part of  the  professional  elite,  she  was  not  an
    activist, she was within the manual  labour  category  of  individuals.
    She feared sexual assault.

9.   Counsel made further submissions on the  contents  of  the  Operational
    Guidance Note commencing at section 3.13 which stated that  some  women
    applicants may make an asylum and/or human rights claim based  on  ill-
    treatment  amounting  to  persecution  at  the  hands  of  Sri   Lankan
    authorities  on  the  grounds  of  gender-based  persecution.   Section
    3.13.15 stated that where a Sri Lankan woman was able to show that  she
    faced a real risk of gender-based  violence  amounting  to  torture  or
    inhuman or degrading treatment and was unable or unwilling through fear
    to access protection and where internal relocation was unduly  harsh  a
    grant of  refugee  status  would  be  appropriate  as  a  member  of  a
    particular social group.

10.  3.13.6 stated that Tamil women and  girls  had  historically  been  the
    targets of various forms of sexual assault following  their  arrest  or
    detention at checkpoints.  Such assaults were said to be  justified  on
    the grounds that they or their family members were suspected members of
    the Tamil insurgency.  Widespread sexual violence and  crime  had  also
    been a serious issue in interment camps during the conflict.  At 3.13.8
    the OGN cited the US State Department of Human Rights Practices  Report
    2012 that there were reports  that  individual  cases  of  gender-based
    violence were perpetrated by  members  of  the  security  forces  which
    occurred in areas with heavy security force presence.

11.  At 3.13.9 the organisation  LandInfo  was  quoted  having  reported  in
    December 2012 that a large proportion of  households  in  the  Northern
    Province were headed by women, in some areas as  much  as  30%.   These
    households  faced  more  multifaceted  and  larger  socioeconomic   and
    security problems than traditional households.  There was, however,  no
    evidence that the security forces were responsible for  many  cases  of
    rape/sexual violence against women in female-led households  in  Vanni.
    There could,  however,  be  under-reporting  of  sexual  violence.   At
    3.13.13 the OGN stated that in general state protection was statutorily
    available to women, however, impunity within the  police  and  security
    forces remained a serious problem.

12.  At 3.13.14 the OGN stated:

         "For some women in Sri Lanka relocation will not  be  unduly  harsh
         but given the number of IDPs in the post-conflict environment  this
         is only likely to be the  case  where  the  individual  can  access
         adequate support from family or from community members based in Sri
         Lanka  or  abroad  or  is  able  to  support  herself  and/or   any
         dependants.  The UNHCR's eligibility guidelines consider  that  Sri
         Lankan's Northern region in particular is not likely to qualify  as
         a reasonable relocation alternative for women".

13.  I raised with Counsel what the paragraph should be taken to  mean  when
    it referred to relocation not being unduly harsh  where  an  individual
    could access adequate support from family abroad.  Did this imply  that
    if financial support was available to a female returning to  Sri  Lanka
    that would mean that relocation would  not  be  unduly  harsh?  Counsel
    responded that money could not alleviate risk and that in any event the
    family were dependent on the  Appellant,  rather  than  the  other  way
    around.  There were some categories of women who would  be  treated  as
    refugees.  The  test  in  this  case,  however,  was  not  whether  the
    Appellant would be a refugee but whether there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to her return to Sri Lanka.

14.  In  response  the  Presenting  Officer  stated  that  the  Respondent's
    position was as outlined at paragraph 17 of my earlier decision, namely
    that the Appellant had a right to apply for asylum and if the Appellant
    wished to take that issue further her solicitors could send  additional
    material direct to the Presenting Officer.   The  Appellant  had  never
    claimed asylum in this country.  The argument in this case,  therefore,
    should be limited to whether the Appellant could show on the balance of
    probabilities that there were very significant obstacles.  This was not
    a protection claim. The Operational Guidance Note was more nuanced than
    Counsel's submissions led one to believe.   The  Respondent's  position
    was not that an applicant, if a woman, got protection  but  rather  for
    some women internal relocation might not be unduly harsh,  for  example
    because of adequate support from family members abroad.  This was not a
    case where it could be said that the family members  remaining  in  the
    United Kingdom would fail to support the Appellant in Sri Lanka.

15.  As Miah had pointed out when quoting  the  Operational  Guidance  Notes
    lack of a network  in  Sri  Lanka  would  not  be  a  very  significant
    obstacle.  This Appellant was a 25 year old Sri Lankan  Tamil  who  had
    lived in Sri Lanka for the first sixteen years of her  life  and  could
    reintegrate back into Sri Lanka.  The Appellant had a Bachelors  Degree
    in Nursing  according  to  her  evidence  and  could  speak  a  foreign
    language, English.  She lived outside the family unit due to  her  work
    commitments in the South of England and taken with family support  this
    would not amount to very significant obstacles or be unduly harsh.

16.  In conclusion, Counsel stated that the Respondent's  submission  relied
    on the family providing finance to the Appellant when in fact they were
    dependent on her.  They could not send  money  to  her.   The  relevant
    paragraph in the Operational Guidance Note related to Tamils  from  the
    North. This Appellant was from Jaffna.  The Appellant had not completed
    her qualification in India.

Findings

17.  The Appellant must show in this case pursuant to Paragraph 276ADE  (vi)
    of the Immigration Rules that it is more likely than not she will  face
    very significant obstacles to her reintegration back into Sri Lanka,  a
    country where she was born and lived for the first sixteen years of her
    life before travelling with the rest of her family to India  where  the
    family claimed asylum.  It is not suggested that the  Appellant  should
    be returned to India.

18.  The Appellant does not have a profile such that she  would  invite  the
    adverse attention of the  authorities  upon  return  to  Sri  Lanka  in
    accordance with the country guidance authority of GJ.   She  has  never
    been involved with any political organisation, nor has she ever been  a
    journalist or taken part in any actions for the  break-up  of  the  Sri
    Lankan state.  She has never come  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
    authorities before and I see no  reason  why  she  would  come  to  the
    adverse attention of the  authorities  now  upon  return.   I  was  not
    presented with any argument that the circumstances of her  father  were
    such that the Appellant's name would be on any form  of  stop  list  or
    otherwise of interest to  the  authorities.   The  Appellant  would  be
    returning to Sri Lanka as a Sri Lankan citizen who had spent  a  number
    of years abroad, some of it with leave in the United Kingdom.

19.  The Appellant's case is that the circumstances for lone females in  Sri
    Lanka are such that she would thereby  be  at  risk.   The  Operational
    Guidance Note does raise concerns that females who come to the  adverse
    attention of the Sri Lankan authorities might be abused by  individuals
    in the Sri Lankan forces etc.  However, there is  no  reason  why  this
    Appellant would come to the adverse attention of the authorities and to
    suggest that there is a risk  that  she  might  nevertheless  have  the
    misfortune to be caught up in some action or other of  the  authorities
    would in my view be speculative.  The Appellant has no profile  of  any
    description and there is no justification for saying,  therefore,  that
    she would come to the attention  of  the  authorities  by  accident  or
    design. The position is that the Appellant would  return  as  a  single
    female to a country she left nine years ago where she says she  has  no
    family or  other  supportive  network.   The  Respondent's  Operational
    Guidance Notes indicate that that is not to be taken as  a  significant
    factor.

20.  The Appellant has shown herself to be  resourceful  and  able  to  find
    employment  and  to  live  away  from  home  whilst  engaging  in  that
    employment.  I accept that the Appellant pools her  finances  with  the
    rest of her family and that the family have benefited  from  the  money
    which the Appellant has given to them.  The Appellant's  case  is  that
    she could not expect to receive financial support from  her  family  in
    the United Kingdom  because  they  would  be  significantly  worse  off
    without the money that she earns.  That is an important argument but it
    assumes that the Appellant  would  be  quite  unable  herself  to  find
    employment in her country of origin where she speaks the  language  and
    could return to her home area where she originated from or elsewhere in
    her country of origin if she did not wish to return to the Jaffna area.
     That she has been able to find employment in  a  completely  different
    country to Sri Lanka indicates that she would be  up  to  the  task  of
    finding employment in her country of origin.

21.  As the statistics show a very large number of households in  Sri  Lanka
    are headed by females.  It cannot be said, therefore, that merely being
    a lone female in Sri Lanka of itself is a very significant obstacle  to
    a return to that  country.   Whether  it  would  be  possible  for  the
    Appellant to re-establish contact with  those  members  of  her  family
    still in Sri Lanka  is  not  for  me  to  speculate  on,  the  case  is
    proceeding on the basis that the Appellant could not, but it  does  not
    seem to me to be a very significant obstacle for a 25 year old woman to
    return to her country of origin  and  live  her  life  there.   If  the
    Appellant had some form of political profile that would run the risk of
    bringing her to the adverse attention of the authorities, the  position
    might be different but that is not the  case  here,  that  is  not  the
    evidence which I have heard.   I  agree  with  the  submission  of  the
    Respondent that the OGN is somewhat more nuanced than was suggested  by
    Counsel for the Appellant.   There  may  be  cases  where  women  as  a
    particular social group who would face gender-based violence  would  be
    entitled to a grant of asylum in this country.  That, however,  is  not
    the case here.  The Appellant's claim to fear violence as a lone female
    returning to Sri Lanka is somewhat vague.  The Appellant cannot say she
    fears such violence from the rogue elements in the authorities  as  she
    has no particular profile that would attract adverse attention  in  the
    first place.  A risk of violence exists sadly in  any  society  in  the
    world.  The question is whether there are factors  in  the  Appellant's
    case that would mean that  she  could  show  that  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities there would be very  significant  obstacles.   I  do  not
    accept that the Appellant can show that it is more likely than not that
    she would face gender-based violence upon  return.   If  the  Appellant
    wishes to argue to the lower standard there is a real risk of such harm
    then the Appellant's remedy is to apply for asylum in  the  usual  way.
    This the Appellant has not done.

22.  Whilst I have some sympathy for the position that the  Appellant  finds
    herself in, particularly given the fact that she was granted  different
    leave to the rest of her family and that she has  sought  to  work  and
    make a contribution to UK society, my focus in this case  is  a  narrow
    one. It  is  whether  the  Appellant  can  show  that  there  are  very
    significant obstacles to her return to Sri  Lanka.   I  find  that  she
    cannot.

23.  As I indicated at paragraph 24 of my earlier decision  the  Appellant's
    claim to have a private life was a relatively weak one given  that  she
    had limited leave to remain and her status was precarious.  She had  no
    legitimate expectation that her leave to remain would  be  extended  at
    the end of the two year period granted to her following her  successful
    entry clearance appeal before Judge Bell.  Under Section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act, little weight could be attached to  the  Appellant's  private
    life in the event that the  assessment  under  Article  8  reached  the
    proportionality stage.  With only little weight being attached  on  the
    Appellant's side of the balance it was difficult to see how that  could
    outweigh the public interest in immigration control.   The  Appellant's
    claim to a private life failed as I indicated previously in my error of
    law decision and for the reasons which I  have  given  the  Appellant's
    claim to a family life also failed.  I was not addressed on  either  of
    those two points.

24.  If the Appellant has any evidence to show that she would be at risk  of
    inhuman or degrading treatment upon return to Sri Lanka it would  still
    be open to the Appellant to make such a  claim.   As  was  pointed  out
    during the hearing this was not a protection claim appeal.  It  was  an
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and it  does  not  succeed  for  the
    reasons which I have set out above.  It would be difficult on the basis
    of the information I have to come to the view that  there  was  a  real
    risk that the Appellant would suffer such ill-treatment upon return.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I  re-make  the  decision  by  dismissing  the
Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  to  grant
leave.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 13th  June  1990.   She
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 17th November  2014
    which had refused her application to vary leave to remain and to remove
    her by way of directions under Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.  Her appeal was allowed at first instance  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer sitting at  Nottingham  on  3rd
    July 2015.  The Respondent appeals with leave  against  that  decision.
    Although this matter came before me as an appeal by the Respondent  for
    the sake of convenience I will continue to refer to the parties as they
    were known at first instance.

2.   The Appellant lived in Sri Lanka until she was 16  years  of  age  when
    she moved with her family to India where the family claimed asylum  and
    were recognised as refugees.  The Appellant's father came to the United
    Kingdom and made an application for asylum on 8th January 2008.  He was
    granted refugee status on 14th August  2009.  The  Appellant  lived  in
    India for five years making an application to join her  father  in  the
    United Kingdom in 2011.  This application was refused but  was  allowed
    on appeal when the Appellant was granted entry clearance for two  years
    valid from 16th April 2012  until  13th  August  2014.   The  Appellant
    entered the United Kingdom on 21st September 2012 after her  successful
    appeal.  On 17th July 2014 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom outside the Rules.   It  was  the  refusal  of  this
    application by the Respondent on 17th November 2014 that has given rise
    to the present proceedings.

The Hearing at First Instance

3.   At the hearing before Judge Colyer  the  Appellant  gave  evidence  and
    stated that she was working for an agency as a care assistant.  Her net
    monthly pay was approximately �1,000.  She sent money to her family who
    lived in the Leicester area and used some of her money to pay her  rent
    and save for her studies.  She was not married  and  had  no  children.
    According to her father she was sending �500 to �600 per month  to  the
    family.  The Judge was satisfied that there was family life between the
    Appellant   and   her   parents   and   siblings   which    would    be
    disproportionately interfered with by the Appellant's removal.  All  of
    the Appellant's immediate family were in the United Kingdom her father,
    her mother, her brother and three sisters.  The Appellant's parents and
    siblings all had indefinite leave to remain.   Although  the  Appellant
    was no longer financially dependent upon her parents there was a system
    of family finance in that they pooled their finances together  to  help
    each other.   The  Appellant  still  considered  her  family  house  in
    Leicester as her home.  She was emotionally and morally dependent  upon
    her parents.

4.   The Judge accepted that the Appellant  and  her  family  had  fled  Sri
    Lanka as refugees.  Although there might be  some  extended  family  in
    that country there was no contact with any  of  them.  Under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iii) and (vi) of the Immigration Rules where an applicant  is
    18 years or above and has lived continuously in the United Kingdom  for
    less than twenty  years  such  a  person  must  show  very  significant
    obstacles to their integration into the country  to  which  they  would
    have to go if required to leave the United  Kingdom.   The  significant
    obstacles to the Appellant's integration in Sri Lanka were that she had
    left the country in order to claim refugee status in  India  where  she
    and her family were recognised as refugees.  She was a Tamil and  there
    would be concerns for her safety if she returned to Sri  Lanka  because
    of her Tamil origin.  She had no immediate family and no home she could
    rely on.

5.   The Immigration  Directorate  Instructions  defined  the  phrase  "very
    significant obstacles to integration".  A very significant obstacle was
    something which would prevent or seriously inhibit the  applicant  from
    integrating into their country of return.  The fact that  an  applicant
    may find life difficult or challenging in the country of return did not
    mean that there would be very significant obstacles.  At  paragraph  49
    the Judge found that the Appellant had  demonstrated  to  the  standard
    required  that  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
    integration into Sri Lanka.

6.   The Judge went on to consider Article 8 of the European  Convention  on
    Human Rights (right to respect for private  and  family  life).   After
    directing herself on case  law  the  Judge  found  that  the  Appellant
    established on the balance of  probabilities  that  significant  family
    life existed between her, her parents and her siblings.  She found that
    this family life was influenced by the Appellant's cultural  background
    and circumstances. It was exceptional in  that  the  Appellant  was  an
    adult and although no longer financially dependent upon her parents the
    family were now partially financially  dependent  upon  the  Appellant.
    Although the Appellant worked away from the family home she  considered
    her parents' house to be her home and it was only  the  requirement  of
    employment that had caused her to spend some time away from the  family
    home.  During the Appellant's  time  in  the  United  Kingdom  she  had
    developed a considerable private life and significant friendships.  The
    decision to remove would have a significant effect upon her  continuing
    employment and education and  would  disrupt  her  career  progression.
    Directing herself on the step-by-step approach required by the case  of
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 the Judge found that the weight to be  attributed
    to the public interest was outweighed in this particular  case  by  the
    cumulative weight established by the Appellant through her private  and
    family life in the United Kingdom.  She allowed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

7.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing that the  Judge's
    finding of very significant obstacles to the Appellant's  reintegration
    were no more than unreasoned generalisations with no reference  to  the
    actual facts or background evidence.  Whilst the Appellant might in the
    past have been granted some sort of refugee status in India  there  was
    no engagement by the Judge as to why this would now be an  obstacle  to
    reintegration to Sri Lanka or why as a female Tamil reintegration would
    be difficult.  In any event the Judge had set  out  the  test  as  very
    significant  obstacles  but  then  referred   to   merely   significant
    obstacles.

8.   The Judge had found  a  family  life  between  the  Appellant  and  her
    parents and her siblings.  The Appellant was  25  years  old  and  only
    spent weekends at the family home.  The Judge had  failed  to  identify
    what it was about this relationship that amounted to more  than  normal
    emotional ties between the Appellant  as  an  adult  and  other  family
    members.  The Judge had found the Appellant had established  a  private
    life but given that the Appellant had only been here  for  three  years
    the strength of any private life would be limited.  Following the  case
    of AM Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 the Appellant could  obtain  no  positive
    right to a grant of leave to remain from either Section 117B(3) or  (3)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 whatever the degree
    of her fluency in English or the strength of her financial resources.

9.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on 6th  November  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote that if the Appellant succeeded under the
    Immigration Rules there was no need for the Judge to go on and consider
    or allow an Article 8 appeal.   In  fact  it  was  arguable  that  both
    decisions of the Judge under the Immigration Rules and Article  8  were
    flawed.  It was arguable that the Judge  had  failed  to  consider  and
    apply the tests set out in Agyarko [which relates  to  the  meaning  of
    insurmountable obstacles] and SS Congo [that compelling reasons must be
    shown for an appeal to be allowed outside the Rules].  The Judge simply
    accepted that there was family  life  for  the  purpose  of  Article  8
    without  analysing  what  the  true  relationship  between  the   adult
    Appellant and her adult relatives in the UK consisted  of  particularly
    given that the Judge appeared to have accepted that the  Appellant  was
    living an independent life.


10.  Judge Holmes concluded:


         "Arguably at the heart of this appeal was  the  disputed  issue  of
         fact as to whether the Appellant was herself  genuinely  a  refugee
         from Sri Lanka at the date of the hearing and this issue was simply
         never addressed by the Judge.  If she  was  not  then  this  should
         arguably have been  the  context  in  which  the  Judge  approached
         paragraph 276ADE and Sections 117A to D  and  the  guidance  to  be
         found in AM Malawi.  Overall  it  is  arguable  that  the  decision
         displays a flawed approach to the issue of the  proportionality  of
         the  removal  and  a   failure   to   adequately   apply   existing
         jurisprudence.  All of the grounds may be argued."


11.  Following the grant of permission to appeal the Appellant filed a  Rule
    24 response drafted by Counsel who appeared before me.  The reply noted
    the successful appeal before Judge Bell in January 2012 (as a result of
    which the Appellant was granted two years  leave  to  remain)  and  the
    reasons given for  allowing  that  appeal.   There  were  a  number  of
    findings of fact which appeared  not  to  have  been  challenged.   The
    Appellant had no family members in India.  She went to India  when  she
    was age 16 and was accepted as a  refugee  and  lived  there  for  five
    years.  She was part of her parents' pre-existing family  and  although
    over 18 was financially and emotionally dependent upon them.  She would
    be considered part of the immediate family until marriage.


12.  The Appellant had worked in a residential care home in Essex since  7th
    June 2013 living away from home when working shifts  and  returning  to
    the family home in Leicester when she was  not  working.   All  of  her
    family lived together save for her elder sister who was married with  a
    child.  She was no longer financially dependent on her family but lived
    in a joint financial family  system  as  they  pooled  their  resources
    together.  She was financially supporting her younger siblings who were
    in full-time education.  She was unable to find work in Leicester.  The
    family had no assets and had lost ties to Sri Lanka.  The  findings  of
    Judge Colyer were fully reasoned and there was no  error  of  law.  The
    question of  whether  there  would  be  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration into Sri Lanka did not appear to have  been  an
    issue that was argued by the Respondent at the appeal hearing  although
    it was raised in the Appellant's original  grounds  of  appeal.   There
    were no errors in the Judge's consideration of Article 8.


The Hearing before Me


13.  For the Respondent it was argued that the Tribunal had  found  in  2012
    that there was a relationship which deserved respect  under  Article  8
    but since the Appellant had entered the United Kingdom  she  had  lived
    her own life and therefore there was no justification for allowing this
    appeal under Article 8.


14.  For the Appellant it was noted that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    granted leave  to  enter  to  the  Appellant's  siblings  who  now  had
    indefinite leave to remain.  It may be that the Respondent thought that
    the Appellant had lived in Sri Lanka for 22 years rather than that  the
    Appellant had had to leave Sri Lanka with her family to go to  live  in
    India.  The Appellant although an adult, was in a similar position to a
    child or young person still dependent on their parents.


15.  In reply for the Respondent it was argued that there  was  no  evidence
    that the Appellant would face very  significant  obstacles  as  a  lone
    female.  The test was not whether the Appellant could  have  a  private
    life in the United Kingdom but whether she was able to have  a  private
    life in her country of return.  This was not an asylum  claim  and  the
    risk to life was not being pursued by the Appellant.  The issue of  the
    Appellant's refugee status in India was something  of  a  red  herring.
    The Appellant was not being supported by her family.  The Judge  needed
    to do more than say that the Appellant believed herself to be  part  of
    the family in order to succeed.  The grant of two year leave to  remain
    meant that the Appellant's status was precarious.


16.  For the Appellant Counsel conceded that there  were  criticisms  to  be
    made of the Judge's determination but there was no  material  error  of
    law.  The Appellant had raised the issue of refugee status, she  was  a
    refugee in India.  She could not be removed to Sri Lanka.  It would  be
    disproportionate to remove the Appellant to  India.   She  was  granted
    leave in line with her father or should have been when she  came.   The
    Appellant still went home to the family house in Leicester;  there  was
    an emotional dependency on the parents.  Little weight to be given to a
    private life was not the same as saying no weight.  The grant of asylum
    in another country was something  which  went  to  the  issue  of  very
    significant obstacles.  If the most important issue  in  the  case  was
    whether the Appellant could return to Sri Lanka having fled there  with
    her family,  that  issue  should  be  more  fully  dealt  with  by  the
    Respondent upon proper consideration.


17.  In conclusion the Presenting Officer argued that the  Appellant  had  a
    right to apply for asylum.  It was not clear why the Appellant had been
    granted refugee status in India,  she  might  have  been  granted  that
    because she was a child.  If the Appellant wished to  take  that  issue
    further her solicitors could send additional  material  direct  to  the
    Presenting Officer to be considered.  There  should  be  a  substantive
    rehearing.


Findings


18.  The Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  with  two  years'  leave  to
    enter following a successful appeal before Judge Bell.  During that two
    years the Appellant  has  obtained  gainful  employment,  continues  to
    exhibit a strong bond between herself and  her  family  notwithstanding
    that her employment is in Essex and she returns to the family home when
    she is not working shifts.


19.  Judge Colyer allowed this appeal under both the Immigration  Rules  and
    outside the Rules under Article 8.  As Judge Holmes  pointed  out  once
    the appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules there  was  no  need
    for the Judge to go on  to  consider  the  matter  outside  the  Rules.
    Indeed it would be difficult to do so since if  one  is  to  decide  an
    appeal outside the Rules one has to weigh in the balance the fact  that
    the Appellant cannot succeed under the Rules. The Judge did not do this
    when considering proportionality.


20.  For the Appellant to succeed under the Immigration Rules she must  show
    that she comes within paragraph 276ADE and given that she  cannot  show
    she has lived in this country for more than twenty years, she must show
    that there are very significant obstacles  to  her  reintegration  back
    into life in India.


21.  This issue was touched upon in the Judge's determination at  paragraphs
    38 to 41 (see  paragraph  4  above).   It  does  not  appear  that  the
    Respondent intends to return the Appellant  to  India  a  country  with
    which the Appellant has little or no connections now.  Rather it  would
    be the Respondent's intention to remove the Appellant to Sri Lanka  and
    the issue therefore is whether there are very significant obstacles  to
    that course.  At paragraph 41 of the determination the Judge found that
    there were such obstacles because the Appellant had left Sri  Lanka  in
    order to claim refugee status in India where she and  her  family  were
    recognised as refugees.  She was a Tamil and there  would  be  concerns
    for the Appellant's safety if she returned to Sri Lanka because of  her
    Tamil  origin  and  because  she  would  be  alone,  a  female  without
    protection of a male or family.  She had no  immediate  family  and  no
    home that she could rely upon.


22.  I understand the Respondent's concern with  that  paragraph  (paragraph
    41) of the determination given the paucity of evidence upon which  that
    paragraph was based.  The Judge appeared to  accept  that  because  the
    Appellant was recognised as  a  refugee  that  of  itself  would  cause
    difficulties to the Appellant upon return.  There  needed  to  be  much
    more evidence to indicate  that  the  family  member  of  a  recognised
    refugee (who had  herself  been  granted  protection  in  India)  would
    thereby be at risk upon return to Sri Lanka.  It does not  appear  that
    that evidence was before the Judge and to that extent there was a clear
    error of law in the Judge's  finding  of  very  significant  obstacles.
    Even if the Judge was entitled to find that the Appellant would  return
    alone to Sri Lanka that of itself does  not  mean  that  the  Appellant
    would face very significant  obstacles  to  her  reintegration  into  a
    country in which she spoke the language.


23.  The Appellant had a history  of  working  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    without some evidence, there  could  not  be  an  assumption  that  the
    Appellant would be unable  to  find  work  in  Sri  Lanka.   The  Judge
    appeared to come close to saying that merely as a Tamil  the  Appellant
    would be at risk but  that  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  country
    guidance case of GJ.  I find that the Judge was wrong  to  conclude  on
    the evidence before him that there were significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's integration in Sri Lanka.  There was thus a material  error
    of law in finding that the Appellant came within paragraph 276ADE(1).


24.  That meant that the Appellant's claim to remain in this country had  to
    be considered under Article 8 outside the Rules bearing  in  mind  that
    the Appellant could not succeed under the Rules.  The Judge did not  do
    that.  The Appellant's claim to have a private life  was  a  relatively
    weak one given that she had limited leave to remain and her status  was
    precarious.  She had no legitimate expectation that her leave to remain
    would be extended at the end of the two  year  period  granted  to  her
    following her successful appeal before Judge Bell.  As  such  therefore
    under Section 117B, at the proportionality stage little weight could be
    given to the Appellant's established private life.  Whilst I appreciate
    that little weight is not the same as no  weight,  little  weight  must
    mean what it says and it is difficult to see how in  the  circumstances
    of this case someone with only little  weight  on  their  side  of  the
    balance can outweigh the public interest in immigration  control.   The
    Judge thus made a material error of law in allowing the appeal  outside
    the Rules in relation to private life.


25.  The issue in relation to family life  is  perhaps  more  complex.   The
    Appellant has a family life between herself and her parents  and  adult
    siblings all of whom have been  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain.
    That family life will be interfered with by removing the  Appellant  to
    Sri  Lanka  but  the  interference  will  be  in  accordance  with  the
    legitimate aim of immigration control  since  the  Appellant  only  had
    limited leave to be here and that limited leave has  now  expired.  The
    Appellant only has 3C leave at the present time.  It  is  difficult  to
    say that the Appellant is dependent on her family, if anything they are
    more dependent upon her given that she is  sending  them  half  of  her
    earnings each month.


26.  The Appellant's position appears  somewhat  anomalous  given  that  she
    alone of the family does not have indefinite leave  to  remain  and  it
    difficult to see how her  circumstances  so  sharply  differ  from  the
    others such that she should not have indefinite leave to remain  whilst
    the others do.  Nevertheless the fact that the Appellant had two years'
    leave to remain granted to her did not mean that she had  any  form  of
    legitimate expectation that her leave would be continued.  Family  life
    would be interfered with by requiring her to return to  Sri  Lanka  but
    the family relationship is one of adults without  significant  ties  of
    dependency.  The Appellant's father works and it is  difficult  to  see
    how the family  is  therefore  so  dependent  on  the  money  from  the
    Appellant that they would face difficulties if she were to return.  The
    Appellant's removal would be proportionate to the legitimate aim  being
    pursued.


27.  There are material errors in the decision of the Judge  to  allow  this
    appeal both within the Immigration Rules and outside the Rules.   I  do
    not however go on at this point to dismiss the appeal.  This is because
    there remains outstanding the question of whether the Appellant can  be
    expected to return to Sri Lanka a country from which  her  family  fled
    when she was 16.  If the Appellant  can  show  to  the  lower  standard
    applicable in asylum and Article 3 cases that there  are  real  reasons
    for believing that she would be at risk upon  return  then  this  would
    indeed create the very  significant  obstacles  required  by  paragraph
    276ADE.  I accept the point made by Counsel for the Appellant that this
    issue has not been properly considered.  The Appellant needs to provide
    more evidence of why she cannot be expected to return to Sri Lanka  and
    what the very significant obstacles in this case are.  I  am  therefore
    setting aside the decision of the First-tier and giving directions  for
    the matter to be reheard at a later date in the Upper  Tribunal  before
    me.  I do not consider it necessary to remit  this  case  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal since a substantial amount of evidence has  already
    been given and what is outstanding now is one discreet point on whether
    the Appellant can satisfy the test of very significant obstacles to her
    reintegration into Sri Lanka.


28.  The Presenting Officer very fairly indicated during the course  of  the
    hearing before me  that  if  further  evidence  was  submitted  to  the
    Respondent (he suggested directly to himself) then the Respondent could
    look at the matter again and potentially make a fresh decision  on  the
    issue of whether the Appellant  face  very  significant  obstacles.   I
    would commend that as a sensible course but if after the Appellant  has
    submitted further evidence the Respondent either does not reply to that
    further evidence or replies in the negative then the matter  must  come
    back before the Upper Tribunal for this  appeal  to  be  concluded.   I
    therefore direct that this  appeal  should  be  reheard  on  the  first
    available date after 15th April 2016.  The Appellant  should  file  and
    serve any further evidence on the issue of insurmountable obstacles  no
    later than fourteen days before the resumed hearing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  a  material
error of law and I have set it aside. I direct that the  appeal  be  reheard
on the first available date after 15th April 2016 before me.

The Appellant should file and  serve  any  further  evidence  on  which  she
proposes to rely in relation to the issue of her  return  to  Sri  Lanka  no
later than fourteen days before the resumed hearing.


I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
