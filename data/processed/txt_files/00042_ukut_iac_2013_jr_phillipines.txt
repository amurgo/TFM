     Since August 2009 UKBA has operated a policy relating to the processing
     and  determination  of  applications  under  the  Points  Based  System
     ("PBS"). This was revised with effect from May  2011.   In  its  policy
     letter of 19th May 2011, UKBA states that during an  unspecified  trial
     stage applicants will be contacted where mandatory evidence is  missing
     from their applications and given the opportunity to provide this. UKBA
     is under a public law duty to give effect to this policy in  all  cases
     to which it applies.




     As regards all other applications, to which the policy letter does  not
     apply, UKBA case workers and decision makers must be aware of and  give
     full effect to its  "Evidential  Flexibility"  policy  document.   This
     requires due appreciation of the discretionary powers enshrined therein
     to request further information from applicants in  any  case  and   the
     exercise thereof in accordance with established  legal  principles  viz
     the duties to appreciate the existence of and correctly understand  and
     give effect to the policy; to act fairly and rationally; to  take  into
     account  all   material   considerations;   to   disregard   immaterial
     considerations; to observe the  requirements  of  a  procedurally  fair
     decision making process; and to act compatibly with such ECHR rights as
     may be engaged in a particular case, in accordance with  section  6  of
     the Human Rights Act 1998.




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS





     The Matrix of this Appeal

  1. The material facts underlying  this  appeal  are  uncontentious.   Jovy
     Octubre Rodriguez ("The  Appellant"),  who  is  aged  thirty-two  years
     (having been born on  19th  September  1980),  is  a  national  of  The
     Philippines.   She was lawfully present in the United Kingdom from 15th
     November 2010, having been granted permission to enter for the  purpose
     of studying a professional diploma course in  tourism  and  hospitality
     management  (NVQ  Level  5)  at  Walthamstow  Business  College.    She
     completed this course in December 2011 and, en route,  she  achieved  a
     further vocational qualification [NVQ Level 3], in  health  and  social
     care.  She was then admitted  to  the  London  College  of  Social  and
     Management Sciences for the purpose of studying a course (QCF Level  6)
     designed to secure a diploma in business and administrative management.
      The Appellant's period of permission to remain in the  United  Kingdom
     was scheduled to end on 1st February 2012 and, in advance  thereof,  on
     31st January 2012 she applied formally in writing for extended leave to
     remain.


2.    By virtue of the Tier 4 (General) Requirements contained  in  Appendix
     C of the Immigration Rules, the Appellant, in order to secure  extended
     leave to remain, was obliged  to  demonstrate  that  she  had  been  in
     possession of �1,200 during a period of 28 consecutive  days.   In  the
     Appellant's case, this 28 day period began on 28th  December  2011  and
     expired on 24th January 2012.  This exercise  entailed  the  completion
     and submission by the Appellant of a standard  official  document,  the
     Tier 4 (General) application form (version 07/11).  This is  a  complex
     form, consisting of 43 pages, which the Appellant duly  submitted.  Her
     evidence was that, at this juncture, she received  a  letter  from  the
     Respondent to the effect that "... a case worker would  write   to  the
     Appellant as soon as  possible  if  there  was  any  problem  with  the
     validity of  the  application,  such  as  missing  documentation"  (per
     paragraph [13] of  the  first  instance  Determination).   Neither  the
     Appellant nor the Respondent has been able to produce a  copy  of  this
     letter, although the Appellant has produced copies of  similar  letters
     said to have been sent to fellow students. This is confirmatory of  the
     Appellant's assertion, which was both  persuasive  and  undisputed.  We
     find accordingly.


  3. From the Appellant's perspective, the next  development  was  a  letter
     dated 21st April 2012 from the Respondent, refusing her extended  leave
     application.  The letter notified the Appellant that the  decision  was
     based on the Immigration Rules and the Tier  4  Policy  Guidance.   Two
     reasons for the refusal were expressed.  Firstly, it  was  stated  that
     the Appellant had falsely misrepresented her achievements in the  TOEIC
     English Language  examinations,  thereby  attracting  a  refusal  under
     paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules, on account of  her  alleged
     deception.  Secondly, it was stated that she had failed  to  score  the
     requisite  number  of  points,  40  in  total,  for  "attributes"   and
     "maintenance (funds)".  The explanation provided was formulated thus:


           "Your course fees are �2,000 for the first year of  your  course
           and you have paid this fee in full.  As such, you  are  required
           to show that you are in possession of �1,200 for  a  consecutive
           28 day period to meet the [Tier 4  Guidance  requirements].   As
           the closing date of the bank statements submitted in support  of
           your application are [sic] dated 24th January 2012, you have  to
           show evidence of maintenance for  twenty-eight  days  from  28th
           December 2011 to  24th  January  2012.   However,  between  28th
           December 2011 and 24 January 2012  your  bank  statements  state
           that you are in possession of between just �903 and �1,704.   As
           such, you have not demonstrated that you have the level of funds
           required to be granted as a Tier 4  (General)  student  migrant.
           It has  therefore  been  decided  that  you  have  not  met  the
           requirements and no points have been awarded for maintenance."


  4. The Respondent's letter of refusal contains an accurate  exposition  of
     the information disclosed in  the  bank  statements  submitted  by  the
     Appellant  with  her  completed  application  form.   In   short,   the
     Respondent's decision to award the Appellant no points was based on two
     perceived deficiencies in the financial information supplied by her:

     (i)    The bank statements spanned a period of  17  days  only,  rather
     than 28 days.

     (ii)   Whereas these statements disclosed a  credit  balance  exceeding
     �1,200 for most of this period, the balance fell to �903.74 during four
     days, from 20th to 23rd January 2012.

     This gave rise to the  Respondent's  assessment  that  the  application
     failed on account  of  insufficiency  of  funds  and  insufficiency  of
     period.

The Initial Appeal

  5. It is recorded in paragraph [25] of the  first  instance  Determination
     that, having exercised her right of  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
     decision, the Appellant compiled  a  hearing  bundle  which  contained,
     inter alia,

     (a)    A further Lloyds TSB statement spanning the period 23rd December
     2011 to 13th February 2012, evidencing a credit balance  in  excess  of
     �1,200 for the entire period except for the four days between 20th  and
     23rd January 2012 (supra).

     (b)    Statements  from  the  RCBC  Savings  Bank  in  the  Philippines
     evidencing that throughout the period in question she had savings there
     of almost �600.

  6. In paragraph [26] of  the  first  instance  Determination,  Immigration
     Judge Chamberlain stated:

           "However, section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
           Act 2002 inserted by section 19  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
           provides that the Tribunal may only consider evidence adduced by
           the Appellant if it was submitted at  the  time  of  making  the
           application".

     This was followed by an observation that the further evidence on  which
     the Appellant was seeking to rely -

           "... did not cover the entire  period  required  by  the  rules,
           i.e., from 31st December 2011 to 27th January 2012".

     We consider that the Judge was in error in this discrete respect, since
     the total period to which the further evidence related was  one  of  53
     days and furthermore (as noted above), the relevant 28 day  period  ran
     from 28th December 2011 to 24th January 2012. The  effect  of  all  the
     evidence was that the Appellant proved herself capable of demonstrating
     at the material time her ability to comply with the  Tier  4  (General)
     requirements.  While the  Judge  does  not  indicate  whether  the  new
     evidence would be admitted - and, thus, considered by the Tribunal - it
     would appear that, by implication, it was excluded.  We  consider  that
     it had to be disregarded, by virtue of section 85A  of  the  2002  Act.
     Thus the  judge's  error  noted  above  was  immaterial.  We  too  must
     disregard the further evidence in question. The  Judge  concluded  that
     the Respondent had correctly declined to award the Appellant any points
     under  Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Judge's  second
     conclusion was that the Respondent's  decision  did  not  infringe  the
     Appellant's rights under Article  8  ECHR.  The  appeal  was  dismissed
     accordingly.


7.    The false representations issue under paragraph 322(1A) of the  Rules,
     which concerned  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant's  English  language
     qualifications, was resolved by the First-tier Tribunal in her  favour.
     Thus her application and initial appeal failed on the  sole  ground  of
     insufficient  points  which,  in  turn,  was  based  on  inadequacy  of
     documentation.

     The Central Issue: the Respondent's Policy

  8. The Appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.  The central focus of her
     grounds of appeal was a policy operated by  the  Respondent.   This  is
     described as the "flexibility policy".  We shall elaborate on its terms
     infra.  Two particular matters were not in dispute between the parties.
      The first is that the Respondent does indeed have  a  policy  of  this
     nature and that this was in force at the time of the impugned decision.
      The second is that this policy was  not  applied  to  the  Appellant's
     application for extended leave to remain.   Building  on  this  factual
     foundation, the basic contention advanced by  the  Appellant  was  that
     both the Respondent and the first-tier Tribunal had erred in law  since
     the impugned decision was vitiated  by  "the  Respondent's  failure  to
     abide by the thematic common law requirement of fairness".  A secondary
     argument developed by the Appellant was  that  the  decision  of  Judge
     Chamberlain was inconsistent with "a long  line"  of  other  first-tier
     Tribunal decisions allowing appeals on the basis  of  the  Respondent's
     "failure to apply her published and established policy  of  flexibility
     towards  PBS  applications".  The  Appellant  developed   her   central
     contention  in paragraph 9 of her appeal statement:

           "I submit that the IJ  erred  in  her  decision  in  failing  to
           consider that the Respondent erred in law in refusing my Tier  4
           application on the ground that  she  failed  to  apply  her  own
           policy".

     In granting permission to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge  Deans  referred
     to the Respondent's "policy of flexibility" and commented:

           "The findings in  the  appeal  indicate  that  the  Respondent's
           consideration  of  the  application  was  deficient  in  certain
           aspects and it is arguable that the judge erred in finding  that
           the Respondent was not in breach of the policy of flexibility in
           considering PBS Applications".

     This provides the context within which this appeal proceeded and  falls
     to be considered and determined.

  9. While it is clear that Appellant raised the issue of the failure by the
     Respondent to follow her own policy in her Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the
     First-tier Tribunal, it is apparent that the evidence pertaining to the
     Respondent's "policy of flexibility" available at  first  instance  was
     both limited and inadequate.   This was, self evidently, unsatisfactory
     and had three particular facets.   Firstly, the initial letter to which
     the Appellant adverted in her evidence - per paragraph [2] above -  was
     not available (and is  still  unavailable).   Secondly,  neither  party
     adduced the substantive UKBA policy document in evidence.  Thirdly, the
     only written evidence relating to the policy was the  brief  exposition
     contained in a letter dated 19th May 2011 addressed by UKBA to  persons
     described as "Joint Education Task Force Members".  The main thrust  of
     this letter concerned the imminent commencement of Section 19 to the UK
     Borders Act 2007. This letter is annexed hereto as Appendix  A.  Tucked
     within the text one finds the following passage:

           "While we are  confident  [that  the  Points  Based  System]  is
           accessible and understandable, we also recognise that there will
           always be potential for human  error.   UK  Border  Agency  Case
           Workers employ a measure of  flexibility  when  considering  PBS
           applications.  For example, case owners [sic] operate  a  system
           which allows them  to  contact  applicants  to  request  further
           documentation or clarification where appropriate.  In addition a
           validation stage is being trialled [sic] whereby applicants  are
           contacted where mandatory evidence  is  missing  and  given  the
           opportunity to provide it before their application is  rejected.
           These policies aim to provide  excellent  customer  service  and
           reduce the number of applications falling for rejection."

     [Emphasis added].

     In the first instance Determination, the Judge said the following:

           "[27] ...The letter from the UKBA dated 19th May 2011  regarding
           commencement of this section referred to  the  ability  of  case
           workers to contact applicants.  It  does  not  state  that  they
           will."

     As appears from the passage quoted  above,  this  is  not  an  accurate
     exposition of  the  Respondent's  policy.   We  consider  the  sentence
     highlighted in  the  excerpt  quoted  to  be  unequivocal.   It  is  an
     unambiguous statement to the effect that during  a  "validation  stage"
     (evidently a trial period) applicants will be contacted where  evidence
     is missing from their applications and will be given the opportunity to
     provide  such  evidence  before   a   rejection   decision   is   made.
     Furthermore, we observe that the Determination contains nothing further
     about the discrete issue of the  Respondent's  policy,  notwithstanding
     the  clear  espousal  by  the  Appellant  of  an  argument   that   the
     Respondent's decision was vitiated by non-compliance therewith.

 10. At the hearing before this Tribunal the  failure  of  both  parties  to
     produce the substantive UKBA policy document  was  perpetuated.   Given
     the Appellant's lack of legal representation, this  was  understandable
     on her part.  However, we cannot condone the Respondent's corresponding
     failure.  The policy became available to and  was  duly  considered  by
     this Tribunal only as a result of the Tribunal  sourcing  it  from  the
     relevant UKBA website. As this clearly forms part of "the circumstances
     appertaining at the time of the decision", in the language  of  section
     85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  ,  this
     Tribunal is not prevented from considering it.  It is a  relevant  UKBA
     policy document which was in existence at the material  time  viz  when
     the impugned determination was made. It is entitled:

     "PBS Process Instruction - Evidential Flexibility".

     A perusal of the text confirms that there was a predecessor policy,  in
     force from  August  2009,  having  essentially  the  same  thrust  viz.
     empowering  case  workers,  upon  receipt  of  PBS   applications,   to
     proactively take steps to have certain errors or  omissions  corrected.
     The text explains, with reference to the predecessor policy:

           "This instruction only applied to cases which would  be  refused
           solely on the absence of a piece  of  evidence  or  information.
           Where the application would fall for refusal even if the missing
           evidence  was  submitted,  a  request  to  submit  this  further
           information would not be made ...

           The introduction of  this  instruction  resulted  in  a  reduced
           refusal rate.   However,  those  that  fell  for  refusal  where
           multiple  pieces  of  information  were   missing   were   often
           successful on appeal."

     [Our emphasis]

     The background to the extant policy, according to  the  text,  was  the
     stimulus for the introduction  of  "two  significant  changes"  to  the
     policy:

           "(1)   The  time  given  to  applicants  to  produce  additional
           evidence has been increased from three  working  days  to  seven
           working days; and

           (2)   There is now no limit on the amount  of  information  that
           can be requested from the applicant.

     In the  instructions  contained  within  the  policy,  caseworkers  are
     directed to request additional information  of  applicants  where  they
     have "sufficient reason to believe" that this exists.  Certain examples
     - such as bank statements missing from a series - coupled with  a  non-
     exhaustive list (in Annex A) are provided.  It is stressed in the  text
     that this is guidance to caseworkers.  The latter are also advised that
     it is open to them to request "multiple pieces" of additional evidence.
      One of the significant features of the policy is  the  statement  that
     where there is uncertainty as to whether necessary evidence exists  the
     benefit of the doubt should be given to the applicant and the  evidence
     should be requested. The commencement date of this revised and enlarged
     policy was, on its face, 17th June 2011. The policy document is annexed
     hereto as Appendix B.

11.   At the hearing before this Tribunal, the Respondent  did  not  dispute
     any of the     following:

     (i)    Following submission of her completed application, the Appellant
     received a letter from the  Respondent  indicating  that  "...  a  case
     worker would write to the Appellant as soon as possible  if  there  was
     any problem with the validity  of  the  application,  such  as  missing
     documentation" (per paragraph [13] of the first instance  Determination
     - emphasis added).

     (ii)   In the event, no such further  letter  was  transmitted  by  the
     Respondent to the Appellant.

     (iii)  The Appellant was at all material times capable of demonstrating
     her ability to score the requisite number of points.

     (iv)   A simple letter of enquiry/request from the  Respondent  to  the
     Appellant would have  elicited  the  further  information  required  to
     demonstrate the Appellant's ability to score full points.

     Furthermore, the Respondent did  not  dispute  that  the  policies,  as
     described and outlined in paragraphs [9] and [10] above, applied to the
     processing and determination of the Appellant's application.   We  make
     findings of fact accordingly. We further find  that,  as  regards  this
     Appellant, the dominant policy was that contained in the UKBA letter of
     19th May 2011.

     Conclusions

 12. We consider the passage quoted from the UKBA letter of  19th  May  2011
     (rehearsed in paragraph [9] above) to be of unmistakable importance and
     of unambiguously clear import.   This  letter  did  not  merely  notify
     certain interested  agencies  of  the  advent  of  a  new  "flexibility
     policy".  It also heralded unequivocally  the  introduction  of  a  new
     practice whereby all applicants would be notified  of  the  absence  of
     mandatory evidence from their  applications  and  would  be  given  the
     opportunity to rectify the relevant  shortcoming  prior  to  rejection.
     This is the ordinary and natural meaning of the words  in  the  letter.
     Notably, there is no suggestion in the text of any  limited  or  select
     group of applicants. This newly introduced policy  is  harmonious  with
     the plainly detectable philosophy of progressive relaxation of the pre-
     2009 rigidity which prevailed in the determination of PBS  applications
     and which, consequentially, had reduced the  number  of  refusals.   We
     consider this construction of  the  UKBA  letter  consistent  with  the
     evidence given by the Appellant to  the  first  instance  Tribunal  and
     unchallenged by  the  Respondent  at  any  stage.   We  consider  that,
     properly construed and evaluated in its entirety, the policy enunciated
     in the letter required the Respondent to notify the  Appellant  of  the
     informational shortcomings in her application and  to  afford  her  the
     opportunity  of  rectification  and  addition  prior  to   an   adverse
     determination.  It is conceded that the Respondent failed to do so.


 13. We would add that the  Respondent  neither  adduced  any  evidence  nor
     advanced  any  argument  calling  into  question   the   analysis   and
     construction of its policy letter and policy document  set  out  above.
     Having regard to the language which the Respondent chose to  employ  in
     its policy letter, we consider that  a  narrower  construction  is  not
     warranted.

14.   The application of  a  public  law  template  to  the  factual  matrix
     rehearsed above  yields  the  following  analysis.   As  an  elementary
     principle of public law, public authorities are required to give effect
     to the policies which they promulgate from time to time.  This is so on
     account of the critical role  increasingly  played  by  policy  in  the
     exercise of discretionary  statutory  and  other  governmental  powers.
     This may also be viewed as a  requirement  of  elementary  fairness  to
     affected  applicants.   Furthermore,  this  operates  as  a  discipline
     designed to ensure the maintenance  of  appropriate  standards  in  the
     decision making processes of public authorities.  A  further  merit  of
     this requirement is that the public law  misdemeanours  of  failing  to
     take into account all material factors and taking into  account  alien,
     immaterial considerations are more likely to be avoided thereby.   Thus
     analysed,  the  requirement  that  public  authorities  should  act  in
     accordance with their policies is properly viewed as a principle.  This
     principle, thus formulated, seems to us  entirely  in  accordance  with
     contemporary  notions  and  standards  of  public   law.   Of   course,
     Governments are at liberty to revise and  revoke  their  policies  from
     time to time and the principles emerging from the  developing  doctrine
     of legitimate  expectations  confirm  this  entitlement.   Furthermore,
     Governments are also entitled, within certain  constraints,  to  decide
     that a published policy will not be applied to  a  particular  case  or
     cases.  However, none of these considerations arises in the context  of
     this appeal.  The present case is simplicity itself: a relevant  policy
     was adopted and promulgated by the Respondent and, in its determination
     of the Appellant's application, the  Respondent  manifestly  failed  to
     give  effect  thereto.   In  consequence,  two  errors  of  public  law
     occurred.  The  first  is  that  in  determining  the  application  the
     Respondent disregarded a plainly material consideration  viz.  its  own
     policy.   The  second  is  that  the  decision   making   process   was
     procedurally unfair, since the policy  conferred  on  the  Appellant  a
     procedural  right  to  be  afforded  the  opportunity  of   correction,
     rectification  and  expansion.   In  the  events  which  occurred,  the
     Appellant was denied this right.

15.   An alternative public law analysis may be  applied.   If  the  correct
     assessment is that the governing policy in play at  the  material  time
     was that contained in the UKBA policy  document  only,  excluding   the
     UKBA letter of 19th May 2011, we find that  the  Respondent's  decision
     was vitiated on  the  freestanding  ground  that  the  decision  making
     officials, in particular the case worker, were unaware of  the  policy.
     As a minimum, alertness to the policy was required.  However, there  is
     no evidence of this basic appreciation and we find,  on  the  facts  of
     this particular case, that the policy, with or without  the  additional
     ingredients identified in the letter  of  19th  May  2011,  was  simply
     ignored.  The public law  error  of  disregarding  a  plainly  material
     consideration was thereby committed. On this alternative analysis,  the
     procedural unfairness identified in paragraph [14] also occurred.

16.   We have included the second, alternative public law  analysis  in  the
     immediately preceding paragraph for  the  following  reason.  Upon  the
     hearing of this  appeal,  the  Respondent  was  unable  to  adduce  any
     evidence regarding the duration of the trial  period  heralded  in  its
     letter of 19th May 2011. Mindful of our elementary duty to decide  this
     appeal on the basis of the evidence adduced, we have found  as  a  fact
     that the Appellant's application was  made,  processed  and  determined
     during the trial period.  Accordingly, it was governed by both the UKBA
     letter of 19th May 2011 and the related policy document.  We  recognise
     the possibility that, in  other  cases,  the  Respondent  might  adduce
     evidence concerning the lifespan of the  trial  period.   If,  in  some
     other case, the Tribunal were to find as a fact that the  trial  period
     had expired with the result that the  application  under  scrutiny  was
     governed by the policy document only, excluding the letter of 19th  May
     2011, the alternative analysis in paragraph [15] above  will  hopefully
     provide some useful guidance. This would have been our approach if  the
     aforementioned hypothesis had applied in this case. The Appellant would
     have succeeded on this alternative approach also.

17.   We are conscious that this is not an application for  judicial  review
     and we are mindful of the jurisdictional competence of  Judges  in  the
     Immigration and Asylum  Chambers  of  both  the  First-Tier  and  Upper
     Tribunals under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
     Act 2002. The specific  statutory  ground  of  appeal  engaged  in  the
     present case is that enshrined in section 84(1)(e), which provides  for
     an appeal against an immigration decision on  the  ground  that  it  is
     "otherwise not in accordance with the law".  This  is  something  of  a
     "catch all" provision, which expands  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the
     Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-Tier and  Upper  Tribunals
     beyond the ambit of the specific grounds listed elsewhere in section 84
     - such as, to take a prominent example, the ground  that  the  impugned
     immigration decision "is not in accordance with immigration rules".

18.   The recent decision of the Upper Tribunal in T(S.55 BCIA 2009 -  Entry
     Clearance) Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00483 (IAC) promulgated  an  instructive
     reminder of the distinction between the function of appellate tribunals
     and that of the High Court in applications for judicial review:

           "[24] We would add further that the function of  judges  in  the
           Immigration and Asylum Chambers of both the First-Tier and Upper
           Tribunals is  to  decide  appeals,  rather  than  supervise  the
           exercise of public law functions by a  general  judicial  review
           jurisdiction.  When judges determine  appeals  they  can  decide
           what the material facts  are  and  proceed  from  those  factual
           findings to reach conclusions on the statutory grounds  set  out
           in Section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
           2002".


              The President then provides a useful summary  of  the  Section
     82 grounds:

           "(a)  Whether the decision is in accordance with the Immigration
           Rules applicable to the situation in question.

           (b)   Whether any discretion afforded by the Rules  should  have
           been exercised differently;

           (c)   Whether the decision is in accordance  with  international
           obligations reflected in UK Law and Practice; and

           (d)   Whether the decision is in accordance with the law.

          We accept that the 'law' in this context includes the duty to act
          fairly which in turn includes the duty to have regard to policies
          that are material to the decision in question."

     [Emphasis added]

     We consider that in this passage the President  was  clearly  directing
     his mind to well established public law principles.   These  impose  on
     all public authorities  (inexhaustively)  the  duties  of  taking  into
     account all material considerations, disregarding  immaterial  factors,
     acting in accordance with the dictates of  fair  procedures,  observing
     the rule  against  bias  and  avoiding  trespass  into  the  prohibited
     territory of Wednesbury irrationality. Duly analysed, these  entrenched
     principles operate as tools distributed amongst all public  authorities
     designed to secure a fair, disciplined and properly  informed  decision
     making process and, thereby, the avoidance of public law misdemeanours.



19.   The following passage in T also falls to be considered:

           "[25] ....Where an immigration decision is flawed for failure to
           have regard to an  applicable  policy  outside  the  Immigration
           Rules,  then  immigration  judges  of  both  Tribunals  have  no
           appellate function to review  the  merits  of  the  exercise  of
           discretion or judgment required to  be  made.   Except  in  most
           unusual circumstances the most that  can  be  done  is  for  the
           appellate decision to record that the decision making process is
           flawed and incomplete and so  the  application  or  decision  in
           question remains outstanding and not yet properly determined".

     The rationale underpinning this passage is in our view clear.  Where in
     the making of an immigration decision a relevant policy has been wholly
     disregarded, it follows logically  that  the  task  of  exercising  any
     discretion or forming  any  value  judgment  thereunder  has  not  been
     performed.  This will normally give rise to  the  conclusion  that  the
     ensuing decision was unlawful.  This species of illegality will usually
     be addressed and rectified by a remedial order  of  the  Tribunal,  the
     effect whereof requires the Respondent to  make  the  decision  afresh.
     The established practice is that Tribunals give effect to  findings  of
     this kind by the medium of an order declaring the decision not to be in
     accordance with the law, with the result that the  application  remains
     outstanding , requiring a lawful decision to be made by the Respondent.
      As paragraph [25] of T makes clear, cases of this kind will typically,
     though not exhaustively, be characterised by a failure on the  part  of
     the public authority concerned to  exercise  a  relevant  discretionary
     power or choice. In the particular context of  the  present  case,  the
     error committed was a failure to give effect  to  a  procedural  course
     promised and dictated by a material policy. We  shall  return  to  this
     issue in the final paragraph of this Determination.

20.   We have also considered one further aspect  of  the  decision  of  the
     Upper Tribunal in T, namely, the statement of the learned President, in
     paragraph [24], made in the context of section 82 of the 2002 Act, that
     in considering whether the impugned decision is "in accordance with the
     law":

           "... the law in this context includes the  duty  to  act  fairly
           which in turn includes the duty to have regard to policies  that
           are material to the decision in question."

     We consider this to be an unexceptional statement of  legal  principle.
     We observe that the President preferred to view the duty to have regard
     to material policies as an aspect of fairness.  We consider  that  this
     may also be viewed as a freestanding duty rooted in public law, without
     reference to fairness: see paragraph  [14]  above.  See  also  Fordham,
     Judicial Review Handbook [6th edition], pp 550-552 and 558-560 and  the
     decisions cited therein.

21.   We have considered the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in  Alam
     and Others - v - Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA
     Civ 960.  This decision was concerned with three conjoined  appeals  in
     each of which the Appellant's application for leave to  remain  in  the
     United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) student migrant under the  Points-
     based system in the Immigration Rules was refused as they had failed to
     comply with one of the requirements to  provide  specified  documentary
     evidence.  In each case, the missing documentation was available at the
     stage of the First-Tier Tribunal hearing.  The  approaches  adopted  by
     the Tribunals to the  admission  of  this  further  evidence  had  been
     inconsistent. The statutory provision in  play  in  these  appeals  was
     section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Acts 2002  which
     came into operation on 23rd May 2011. The Court of  Appeal  disapproved
     of the Upper Tribunal's decision in Shahzad [2012] UKUT 81  (IAC)  that
     section 85A applies only to applications made to the Secretary of State
     on or after 23rd May 2011:  see  paragraphs  [34]  -  [35].  Given  the
     contours of the present appeal, it  is  appropriate  to  highlight  the
     fourth  ground  of  appeal  in  Alam:  see  paragraph  [46].   It   was
     unsuccessful.  Sullivan LJ,  delivering  the  judgment  of  the  Court,
     stated:

           "[46] .... UKBA choosing to make improvements  to  its  decision
           making process as a matter of good  administrative  practice  is
           one thing, the Court imposing a general legal duty to  the  same
           effect upon the Secretary of State is a very  different  matter.
           I am not persuaded that the statutory scheme is so  unfair  that
           the imposition of such a duty can be justified."


      It is  also  appropriate  to  highlight  an  earlier  passage  in  the
     judgment:

           "[35] .... Mr Malik referred to the draconian consequences of  a
           failure to supply a specified document but that is  an  inherent
           feature of the PBS which puts a premium  on  predictability  and
           certainty at the expense of discretion."

     We note the absence from this passage of any mentioned of  the  related
     policy.


22.   We are of the opinion that the policy promulgated by  the  Respondent,
     considered in its full detail and breadth, is clearly designed to avoid
     and reduce substantive  unfairness to applicants.  We  also  take  into
     account the observation of the Court of Appeal in paragraph [43]:

           "The PBS [Points Based System] is a very detailed scheme and, in
           order to secure predictability and  consistency  in  a  decision
           making process which has to consider  a  very  large  number  of
           applications, it is highly prescriptive."

     While this may be correct in the abstract, we find a clear emphasis  in
     the related policy on increasing flexibility in processing applications
     and, consequentially, reducing substantive unfairness to applicants. We
     repeat our policy analysis and construction above  and  would  add  the
     following. Firstly, there is  no  challenge  to  the  fairness  of  the
     statutory scheme as a  whole  in  this  appeal.  Furthermore,  we  have
     construed the UKBA policies [viz  the  policy  letter  and  the  policy
     document]  as  shifting  the  emphasis  from  mechanistic  prescription
     towards flexibility, discretion and, ultimately,  greater  fairness  to
     applicants. This, without  any  artificiality  or  distortion,  is  the
     substance of what the policies themselves proclaim unambiguously to the
     public. It seems clear from the  judgment  in   Alam  that  the  policy
     analysis and construction and associated doctrinal  template  which  we
     have espoused and  applied  above  did  not  feature  in  that  appeal.
     Furthermore, it appears likely that the fourth ground of appeal did not
     form the centrepiece of the Appellants' case.


 .
23.   It is also apparent that in Alam the Court  of  Appeal  did  not  have
     available to it the full evidential matrix considered by this Tribunal:
     see paragraphs [8]-[10] above.   Furthermore, the alternative  analyses
     set forth in paragraphs [14]-[15] above do not emerge in  the  judgment
     of the Court.  In particular, there is no detailed consideration of the
     question of whether an immigration decision suffering  from  the  flaws
     set out in these alternative analyses can be said to be  in  accordance
     with the law, bearing in mind the statutory grounds of appeal enshrined
     in section 82 of the 2002 Act.  Moreover,  the  prism  applied  to  the
     fourth ground of appeal in Alam was that of fairness.  The  alternative
     analyses set forth above, which rehearse and are founded on  elementary
     public law dogma, are to be contrasted. On balance, giving  due  effect
     to the doctrine of precedent, we find no warrant  for  concluding  that
     the decision in Alam requires this appeal to be  dismissed.  Its  ratio
     decidendi is such that it is properly distinguishable from the  present
     case.

24.   We have also considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in Baig  -
     v - Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  1246
     and the ensuing decision of the AIT in AG - v  -  Kosovo  [2007]  UKAIT
     00082.  As regards the decision in Baig, we confine  ourselves  to  the
     observation that the Court of Appeal proceeded on the  basis  which  we
     have adopted in the present case, namely, that the  Immigration  Appeal
     Tribunal was, as a matter of law,  obliged  to  apply  the  immigration
     policy in question: see paragraphs [30] and [34].  We  note  also  that
     the decision of the AIT in AG - v - Kosovo was concerned with the  same
     policy [DP5/96].  This decision addressed, fundamentally,  the  correct
     approach to be adopted in  appeals  involving  both  human  rights  and
     policy issues.  Notably, the Tribunal made a distinction between  cases
     where the Respondent has failed  to  consider  whether  to  exercise  a
     discretion conferred by a  declared  policy  and  cases  where  he  has
     considered whether to do so, but has decided that the discretion should
     not be exercised: see paragraph [33]. We concur with this  distinction,
     while noting that the present case is of a somewhat different genre. We
     are also alert to the vital consideration of context:  in  both  cases,
     unlike the present, the issue under consideration was the exercise of a
     power  conferred  by  an  administrative  policy,  lying  outwith   the
     Immigration Rules, to permit a person to remain in the United  Kingdom.



25.    Finally,  bearing  in  mind  the  clearly  detectable  trend  towards
     increased flexibility and the avoidance and  reduction  of  substantive
     unfairness to applicants highlighted above, we note that the  Secretary
     of State chose to  impose  upon  herself  a  duty  to  request  missing
     documents in the changes to the Immigration Rules which took effect  on
     6th September 2012. We appreciate that these changes have been modified
     since by further amendment.  Paragraph 245AA of HC 395, as amended, was
     introduced as follows:

                 "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications
           (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A state
           that specified documents must be provided, the UK Border  Agency
           will only consider documents that have been submitted  with  the
           application, and will only consider  documents  submitted  after
           the application where subparagraph (b) applies.
           (b) The subparagraph applies if the applicant has submitted:
                (i) A sequence of documents and some of the documents in the
                sequence  have  been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                statement from a series is missing);
                (ii) A document in the wrong format; or
                (iii) A  document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                document,
           the  UK  Border  Agency  will  contact  the  applicant  or   his
           representative in writing, and request  the  correct  documents.
           The requested documents must be received by the UK Border Agency
           at the address specified in the request within 7 working days of
           the date of the request."


     The issue whether the policies which  feature  in  this  judgment  have
     survived this amendment to the Immigration Rules was not argued  before
     us and we express no view on it.  Given the dates  of  the  application
     and impugned determination with which this appeal is  concerned,  which
     precede the amendment, we are satisfied that it is  to  be  disregarded
     for present purposes.

26.   For the reasons elaborated above, we conclude  that  the  Respondent's
     decision was not in accordance with the law and  the  decision  of  the
     First-Tier Tribunal, which espoused this error of law, is unsustainable
     in consequence.  We find nothing in the decisions in Alam, Baig, AG  or
     T to require any different conclusion.

Decision

27.   We conclude that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved  the
     making of an error on a point of law in a plainly material respect.  It
     endorsed a decision by the Respondent which was not in accordance  with
     the law for the reasons explained above.

28.   It is not disputed by the Respondent that if the  decision  maker  had
     been cognisant of the relevant policy and had given effect  thereto  by
     alerting the Appellant to the perceived shortcomings in her application
     and inviting her to provide further information,  her  application  for
     extended leave to remain in the United Kingdom would have been  granted
     as she would have demonstrated her  ability  to  satisfy  the  relevant
     requirements. On its face, this might suggest that we should remake the
     impugned decision in  the  Appellant's  favour.  However,  we  must  be
     mindful of the nature of the legal infirmity which  we  have  found  to
     vitiate the Respondent's decision. This takes the form of a failure  to
     be aware of and give effect to a relevant policy. Having regard to  the
     decision in T, we declare  accordingly  and  allow  the  appeal.  As  a
     result, the Respondent is  under  a  public  law  duty  to  remake  the
     decision lawfully, in accordance with this judgment.

                                 Appendix A
      19 May 2011

      Dear Joint Education Taskforce Member

      Commencement of Section 19 of the UK Borders Act 2007

      I am writing to notify you of our plans to commence Section 19 of the
     UK
      Borders Act 2007 on 23 May 2011.  Once commenced, it will have effect
     for
      appeals heard for the first time on or after 23 May 2011.  Appeals
     that have
      been part or fully-heard heard by the First-tier Tribunal
     (Immigration and Asylum
      Chamber) by this date will not be affected.

      Section 19 will restrict the evidence an appellant can rely on at
     appeal to that
      which was provided to the original UK Border Agency decision maker.
     It
      applies to appeals against immigration decision refusals under the
     Points
      Based System (PBS).

      As you know the Home Affairs Committee has previously noted that the
      submission of new evidence at appeal stage was resulting not in a
     review of a
      decision at appeal, but rather an entirely different decision being
     made on
      entirely different evidence.  The Committee commented that such
     practice
      was not helpful to the overall integrity of the immigration system.
     Persons
      wishing to remain in the UK under the PBS are already required to
     submit all
      relevant evidence in support of their application at the time that
     application is
      made. In that regard the introduction of this measure does not
     require
      applicants to do anything different to what they should currently be
     doing.
      Section 19 reinforces this principle and will prevent persons from
     relying on an
      expensive and publicly funded appeal to correct their errors in the
     application
      process.

      In taking the decision to commence Section 19 we have given real
      consideration to the concerns raised in Parliament during the debates
     on the
      UK Borders Act 2007, such as ensuring the application process is
     clear and
      that minor errors can be addressed in the application process.

      Around 75% of PBS in-country applications are successful at the
     initial
      decision stage. To support applicants in the application process
     guidance is
      available on the UK Border Agency website including the 'Points
     Calculator'
      self assessment tool. Customer feedback suggests the application
     process to
      be straightforward and easy to understand. This feedback also reveals
     that
      the majority of applicants understand the documentary evidence
     required in
      their applications; in-country applicants more so than out of country
      applicants. We remain committed to making the process as easy to use
     as
      possible and are working to make continuous improvements such as the
      introduction of on-line applications later this year.

      While we are confident PBS is accessible and understandable, we also
      recognise there will always be the potential for human error. UK
     Border
      Agency caseowners employ a measure of flexibility when considering
     PBS
      applications. For example, caseowners operate a system which allows
     them
      to contact applicants to request further documentation or
clarification where
      appropriate.  In addition a validation stage is being trialled
     whereby applicants
      are contacted where mandatory evidence is missing  and given the
     opportunity
      to provide it before their application is rejected. These policies
     aim to provide
      excellent customer service and reduce the number of applications
     falling for
      rejection.

                     EVIDENTIAL FLEXIBILITY

 Introduction     In response to significant feedback from the caseworking
                  teams, as well as from our customers, from August 2009 a
                  flexible process was adopted allowing PBS  caseworkers  to
                  invite sponsors and applicants to correct minor  errors
                  or  omissions  in  applications  both  main  and
                  dependant submitted under Tiers 1, 2, 4 and 5.

                  The instruction enabled caseworkers to  query  details  or
                  request further information,  such  as  a   missing   wage
                  slip  or  bank  statement  from  a sequence. Three working
                  days was given to the customer to  provide  the  requested
                  information.

                  This instruction only applied  to  cases  which  would  be
                  refused solely on the absence of a piece  of  evidence  or
                  information. Where the application would  fall for refusal
                   even   if   the   missing  evidence   was   submitted,  a
                  request to submit this further information  would  not  be
                  made.

                  The introduction of this instruction resulted in a reduced
                  refusal rate. However, those that fell for  refusal  where
                  multiple pieces of information  were  missing  were  often
                  successful on appeal.

                  Following analysis of allowed appeals  and  feedback  from
                  the National Audit  Office  (NAO)  and   Chief   Inspector
                  (CI),  the  original  Evidential  Flexibility  instruction
                  has  been reviewed to meet the recommendations put forward
                  in these reports whilst  continuing  to  provide  improved
                  levels customer service.

                  As  such,  there  have  been   two   significant   changes
                  to  the  original
                  Evidential Flexibility instruction:

               1)  The time given to applicants to produce additional
               evidence has been
                  increased from three working days to seven  working  days;
                  and
               2)  There is now no limit on the amount of  information  that
                  can be requested from the applicant. However, requests for
                  information should  not  be  speculative,  we   must  have
                  sufficient reason to believe that any  evidence  requested
                  exists.

                  The evidence requested must only relate to the attributes,
                  not general immigration issues or validation.



 NOTE:      Although deadlines will be given for customers to respond
                  to our request for further information, if additional
                 information is received within UKBA (not necessarily by
                 the relevant case owner) prior to the case being
                 despatched this must be taken into account by the
                 caseworker. This applies even if a refusal decision has
                 been completed but the case has not been despatched on
                 CID.

  Procedure This procedure describes the steps to  take  when  an
                   application has missing evidence or there is a minor
                   error.



|Step |Action                                                                  |
|1    |Is there missing evidence, or evidence that is not in an acceptable     |
|     |format?                                                                 |
|     |If:                                                                     |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |? Yes - Go to step 2                                                    |
|     |? No  -  The  case  should  be  considered  as normal.  The Evidential  |
|     |Flexibility instruction should not be applied.                          |
|2    |Would the application fall for refusal even if the missing information  |
|     |was provided, or                                                        |
|     |minor error corrected?                                                  |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |An example of this may be where the applicant has failed to provide     |
|     |sufficient evidence to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of   |
|     |the Maintenance (funds) attribute, but in addition has not declared on  |
|     |their application that they have a conviction which is not spent.       |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Additionally, if there are any reasonable doubts over the information   |
|     |currently held that would cause caseworkers to seek further             |
|     |verification, this should take place prior to any request for further   |
|     |evidence. This also applies where the application hits a risk profile.  |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |If:                                                                     |
|     |? No - Go to step                                                       |
|     |? Yes - Evidence cannot be requested. The application should be refused.|
|     |All grounds should be included including any attributes where there was |
|     |any missing evidence or minor errors.                                   |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |                                                                        |
|3    |We will only go out for additional information in certain circumstances |
|     |which would lead to the approval of the application.                    |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Before we go out to the applicant we must have established that evidence|
|     |exists, or have sufficient reason to believe the information exists.    |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |Examples include (but are not limited to):                              |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |1)  bank statements missing from a series;                              |
|     |2)  evidence that specific qualifications have been provided previously |
|     |(either from reviewing CID, or a legacy application, such as globe);    |
|     |3)  evidence detailed on a CAS/ COS is missing; and                     |
|     |4)  named deposits on bank statements from an employer, but no wage     |
|     |slips provided.                                                         |
|     |                                                                        |
|     |The evidence listed in  Annex A is not exhaustive, but provides         |
|     |caseworkers with guidance as to the circumstances when evidence can be  |
|     |requested.                                                              |

|4    |If the caseworker is unsure as to whether the evidence exists, they     |

|     |                                                                        |

|6   |When attempting to contact the applicant / representative / sponsor by    |
|    |phone, caseworkers should  normally  make  no  more  than  two  attempts  |
|    |using  the  relevant  telephone number (s). If an applicant has a         |
|    |representative the caseworker should initially contact them rather than   |
|    |the applicant.                                                            |
|    |                                                                          |
|    |Each time and date of call, and the relevant number contacted should be   |
|    |recorded on CID as if the case is eventually refused, these details will  |
|    |need including in the Immigration History section of the refusal notice.  |
|    |                                                                          |
|    |Where ever possible, caseworkers should speak directly to a relevant      |
|    |person, rather than leave a message.                                      |
|    |                                                                          |
|    |Where an email address is held for the applicant / representative /       |
|    |sponsor the telephone call should be followed up by email. As part of the |
|    |telephone conversation, you should clarify the email address, or if one   |
|    |was not provided  as part of  the application, ask the applicant /        |
|    |representative / sponsor to provide one (if one exists).                  |
|    |                                                                          |
|    |Note  that  there  are  particular  points  that  need  to  be  made  to  |
|    |the  applicant  /                                                         |

|    |Ensure that all contact numbers available are used and that where multiple|
|    |attempts are required the calls are made at different times of the day    |
|    |(e.g. do not make two attempts 15 minutes apart)                          |
|    |                                                                          |

 Annex C

 Standard  lines  to  take  regarding  Evidential  Flexibility   caseworking
 instruction.

 .    Who does this new instruction apply to?

 The  instruction  applies  to   any   Tier   1,   2,   4   or   5   migrant
 application  which  is  under consideration as of 28 March 2011, as well as
 any applications submitted on or after this date. This instruction  applies
 to main  applicants and their associated dependants regardless  of  whether
 the dependant applies separately at a later date.

 .    I cannot provide the document within the time allowed / Why won't you
    give me more time to provide the evidence?

 We will allow up to 7 working days.  If we have not received  the  evidence
 requested within this time, a decision will be made based on  the  evidence
 provided with the  application  form.  The  guidance  clearly  states  what
 evidence should have been provided originally in support of an application.
 We are not able to hold cases open for extended periods.

 .    Does the information you require need to have been sent within the 7
    working days, or does it need to have been received within the 7 days?

 The information required must have been received by the UKBA within  the  7
 working days, starting from today.  We  therefore  strongly  recommend  you
 send the evidence by special next day delivery.

 .    Can I get back to you  with  the  recorded/special  recorded  delivery
 reference number?

 This shouldn't be necessary. You will be able to track for yourself whether
 what you have sent has arrived with UKBA.

 .    Reps/Sponsor/Applicant  telephones  to  complain  about  cases  which
    were  previously refused on the same basis

 As of 28 March 2011 we will request specific documents if  they  have  been
 omitted from the application, for cases currently outstanding  as  of  this
 date, or received on or after this date.

 Please note any applications which were decided before the above date  were
 considered against the operational procedures in place at the time.

 As the Points Based System continues to bed in we will,  where  appropriate
 and practicable, endeavour to contact customers to correct minor  omissions
 or errors in their applications.

 Applications can only be considered  in  accordance  with  the  policy  and
 operational procedures in force at the  time  of  consideration.  The  UKBA
 reserves the right to change these.

 .    A rep/sponsor/applicant telephones to ask why we are asking for
    certain documents and not others

                                   DOCUMENT IS ONLY VALID ON DAY OF PRINTING
                     EVIDENTIAL FLEXIBILITY



 Where appropriate and practicable we will endeavour to contact customers to
 correct minor omissions or errors in their applications. However, there are
 certain requirements which must be  met  for  a  PBS  application   to   be
 considered   valid,   which   includes   provision    of    key   mandatory
 documents, such as the passport.


 The requesting of  Mandatory  documentation  or  information  to  make  an
      application valid is governed by

 .    Can the applicant drop the document requested off at the PEO?

 No. We strongly recommend you send the evidence required  by  special  next
 day delivery.

 .    Can I arrange a courier to deliver the required information

 No. We strongly recommend you send the evidence required  by  special  next
 day delivery.

 ***FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY NOT FOR EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION***
 (If in exceptional circumstances it might be appropriate to accept delivery
 of the documents via courier the caseworker should discuss  this  with  the
 HEO/Senior Caseworker)

 .    Can I fax the evidence to you?

 In line with published guidelines we only accept original documentation.

 .    You previously refused my application on missing information so  I  re
    applied with the correct information.  Can I have a refund for the  case
    you refused as you did not give  me  a  second  chance  to  provide  the
    information?

 Unfortunately not. As of 28 March 2011 we will request  specific  documents
 if they have  been  omitted  from  the  application,  for  cases  currently
 outstanding as of this date, or received on or after this date.

 Please note any applications which were decided before the above date  were
 considered against the operational procedures in place at the time.

 As the Points Based System continues to bed in we will,  where  appropriate
 and practicable, endeavour to contact customers to correct minor  omissions
 or errors in their applications.

 Applications can only be considered  in  accordance  with  the  policy  and
 operational procedures in force at the  time  of  consideration.  The  UKBA
 reserves the right to change these.

 .    I  have  an  outstanding  appeal  for  a  case  that  was  refused  on
     this  basis. Will you reconsider?

 No.  The case was considered on the evidence and operational procedures  in
 place at the time of application, therefore we will not reconsider on  this
 basis.
