Representation:
Appellant   Ms Johnstone (Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mrs Chaggar, Counsel, instructed by RBM Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant, citizen of Bangladesh, arrived in the United Kingdom  on
    September 24, 2009. He applied for asylum on December 30, 2009 but  the
    respondent refused his application on March 5,  2010  although  he  was
    granted discretionary leave  until  March  4,  2013  to  remain  as  an
    unaccompanied minor and because he was considered to  have  established
    family life with is aunt in the United Kingdom. On  March  1,  2013  he
    applied to extend his leave but this was refused on November  3,  2014.
    He appealed this decision on December 16, 2014 under section  82(1)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hawden-Beal  on
    February 5, 2015 and she allowed the appeal under article 8 ECHR  in  a
    decision promulgated on February 17, 2015. Confusingly, she also  found
    the decision was not in accordance with the law.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal that  decision  on  February
    23, 2015 on the ground the Judge had erred by allowing the appeal under
    article 8 ECHR by failing to have regard to section 117 of the 2002 Act
    and for not only allowing the appeal on article 8 grounds but for  also
    finding the decision was not in accordance with the law. Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shimmin on March
    16, 2015 on both grounds.

 5. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  date  I  heard
    submissions from both Ms Johnstone and Mrs Chaggar.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  pursuant  to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I  extend
    that order.

    ERROR IN LAW

 7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hawden-Beal confusingly dismissed  the
    appeal on asylum/humanitarian protection grounds  as  well  as  finding
    there neither articles 2 or 3 ECHR were engaged. She then proceeded  to
    allow the appeal on article 8 grounds but then  remitted  the  decision
    back to the respondent because  she  found  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law due to the respondent's failings on tracing the
    family of unaccompanied asylum seeking children.

 8. Mrs Chaggar accepted that Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hawden-
    Beal's positive two findings were in conflict and in the absence of any
    explanation for the confusing conclusions I must find an error  in  law
    and I set aside the  findings  made  in  the  appellant's  favour.  Mrs
    Chaggar confirmed there was no challenge to the remaining decsions  and
    no cross-appeal had been made in any event. .

 9. I indicated to both representatives that no further evidence was needed
    because Mrs Chaggar confirmed that the appellant's  circumstances  were
    unchanged from those before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Hawden-
    Beal.

10. I therefore invited submissions from both  representatives  as  to  the
    disposal of the article 8 claim and/or whether  the  matter  should  be
    returned to the respondent  on  the  basis  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

11. Mrs Chaggar wished to adduce in  submissions  the  respondent's  policy
    published on August 18, 2015 as it  contained  transitional  provisions
    for dealing with discretionary leave where the  original  discretionary
    leave had been granted before July 9, 2012.  The  appellant's  original
    grant of leave was granted in March 2010 and would therefore be  caught
    by this policy. Ms Johnstone objected to this arguing  the  policy  had
    not been argued in the First-tier Tribunal.

12. In R (app Baktear Rashid) v SSHD 2004 EWCA 2465 Admin Davis J held that
    the principle of legitimate expectation in public law,  as  opposed  to
    the doctrine of estoppel in private law, was a principle of fairness in
    the decision making process.  It was a wholly  objective  concept,  not
    based upon any actual state of knowledge of the  individual.   Although
    the appellant in the instant case did not know of the  policy,  he  was
    entitled to assume - indeed, he had a  legitimate  expectation  -  that
    whatever applicable policy was  in  existence  at  the  time  would  be
    applied to him.

13. As I was remaking the decision and having regard to  the  principle  of
    fairness Ms Johnstone's argument carried little weight especially as it
    was a published document. I therefore allowed the introduction of  that
    policy.

14. Ms Johnstone submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had not had  regard
    to section 117B of the 2002 Act. The appellant was now 19 �  years  old
    and his asylum application had been rejected as long  ago  as  December
    30, 2009. Whilst he had been granted discretionary leave she  submitted
    he only had temporary leave and following the decision of Dube (ss.117A-
    117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) his  immigration  status  was  precarious
    because he was removable when his leave expired. The  Tribunal  had  to
    have regard to the fact he was  not  financially  independent  and  was
    wholly reliant on an aunt and uncle who stated they would be unable  to
    support him if he were returned. She submitted the Tribunal had to have
    regard to the importance of immigration control and she submitted  that
    even if article 8 was engaged  it  would  not  be  disproportionate  to
    return him. As to article 8 she submitted that he was now an adult  and
    any claim for family life had to be viewed in that light. He  had  been
    granted leave when  he  was  a  minor  and  because  at  the  time  the
    respondent accepted he had a family life with his  aunt.  However,  his
    circumstances had now changed and he was no longer  thirteen  years  of
    age but was now a young adult. The fact  tracing  may  not  have  taken
    place was not a reason to find the decision was not in accordance  with
    the law because he was now an adult and at the  date  of  decision  the
    respondent was not obliged to undertake any tracing because he was over
    he age of 18. Any delay had not prejudiced him because he had not  lost
    the benefit of any policy.

15. Mrs Chaggar submitted that there was family life and this was something
    the respondent had recognised in 2010. He had continued  to  live  with
    his aunt and his  family  life  had  continued.  She  argued  that  the
    respondent's transitional policy meant that he should have  been  given
    extended leave and she invited me to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the
    respondent for her to apply her own policy. Alternatively,  she  argued
    that section 117B factors were positive for the  appellant  because  he
    spoke English and had never claimed public funds  albeit  she  accepted
    that he was not entitled to claim benefits due to his age and the  fact
    he was in full time education. She submitted that the appellant  should
    be granted further discretionary leave to remain.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDING

16. For the reasons set out above I found there had been an error  in  law.
    The Tribunal must either dismiss a claim, allow it or find the decision
    was not in accordance with the law. By allowing the appeal under  human
    rights and finding it was not in accordance with the law  the  Tribunal
    erred and for that reason I set aside those two aspects of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision.

17. If a decision is not in accordance with the law, then that must be  the
    first finding made. A decision on article 8 grounds need only  be  made
    if the decision is in accordance with the law. In  Dhudi  Saleban  Abdi
    [1996] Imm AR 148 Peter Gibson LJ said: "I shall therefore  proceed  on
    the footing that, if it can be shown that the Home Secretary failed  to
    act in accordance with  established  principles  of  administrative  or
    common law, for example if he did not take account of or give effect to
    his own published policy, that was not in accordance with the law".

18. Mrs Chaggar referred me to  section  ten  of  the  respondent's  policy
    entitled "Asylum Policy Instruction".

19. Section 10.1 states-

         "Those granted leave under the DL policy in  force  before  9  July
         2012 will normally continue to be  dealt  with  under  that  policy
         through to settlement if they continue to qualify for further leave
         on the same basis as their original DL was granted ...

         Caseworkers must consider whether the circumstances  prevailing  at
         the time of the original grant of leave continue  at  the  date  of
         decision. If the circumstances remain the same the individual  does
         not fall within the restricted leave  policy  and  the  criminality
         thresholds do not apply a further three years DL should normally be
         granted ...

         If there have been significant changes that mean the  applicant  no
         longer qualifies for leave under the  DL  policy  ...  the  further
         leave application should be refused."

20. The appellant had been granted discretionary leave when he was thirteen
    years of age and when his application was made he was living  with  his
    aunt who was both providing accommodation for him and caring  for  him.
    The respondent granted discretionary leave on those facts. The position
    facing the respondent in November  2014  was  different.  Although  the
    application had been made when he was 16 � years of age the  respondent
    did not make a decision until he was over the age of eighteen by  which
    time he was an  adult.  His  discretionary  leave  primarily  had  been
    granted because the respondent has a policy  for  unaccompanied  minors
    that grants them discretionary leave to remain up to 17 � years of age.



21. When the respondent considered his  application  I  am  satisfied  that
    there had been two significant changes. Firstly, the appellant  was  no
    longer a minor and could not therefore benefit  from  the  respondent's
    policy on unaccompanied minors and secondly, any family life assessment
    had to be as an adult rather than as a minor. For these two  reasons  I
    am satisfied that this appellant could not benefit from the policy  set
    out above and accordingly I must consider his application under article
    8 ECHR only because no argument under the Immigration  rules  has  been
    advanced.

22. The starting point is whether there is family  life  in  an  article  8
    sense. The appellant is now an adult and neither  his  aunt  nor  uncle
    have any dependency on him. He has a  dependency  on  them  to  to  the
    extent that he continues to live with them and is financially supported
    by them. They receive a pension and as previously stated they would  be
    unable to  support  him  if  he  was  back  home  as  their  income  is
    insufficient.

23. Whilst I accept there is evidence of some financial support I  have  to
    consider his relationship to his  aunt  and  her  family  in  light  of
    Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170. The Court  of  Appeal  said  that,  in
    order to establish family life, it is necessary to show that there is a
    real committed or effective support or relationship between the  family
    members and the normal emotional ties between a mother and an adult son
    would not, without more, be enough.  In  JB(India)  and  Others  v  ECO
    [2009] EWCA Civ 234 the Court of Appeal said that financial  dependence
    "to some extent" on a parent  did  not  demonstrate  the  existence  of
    strong family ties between adult children and the parent nor did weekly
    telephone  calls  evidence  anything  more  than  the  normal  ties  of
    affection between a parent and her  adult  children.  In  AAO  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer [2011] EWCA Civ 840 the Court  of  Appeal  held  that
    family life would not normally exist between parents and adult children
    within the meaning of Article 8 in the absence of further  elements  of
    dependency, which  went  beyond  normal  emotional  ties.  However,  in
    Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160  (IAC)
    the Tribunal said that a review of  the  jurisprudence  discloses  that
    there is no general proposition that Article 8  can  never  be  engaged
    when the family life  it  is  sought  to  establish  is  between  adult
    siblings living together. Rather than  applying  a  blanket  rule  with
    regard to adult children, each case  should  be  analysed  on  its  own
    facts, to decide whether or not family life exists, within the  meaning
    of Article 8(1).  Whilst some generalisations are possible, each  case
    is fact-sensitive.

24. Each case therefore must be assessed on its facts  and  in  considering
    whether there was family life I have regard to the following factors:

      a. The appellant has been living in the United Kingdom with  his  aunt
         and her family since September 2009. He  had  come  to  the  United
         Kingdom after his father arranged for an agent to  bring  him  here
         and it was always intended he would live  with  his  aunt  and  her
         family.

      b. His asylum claim was rejected on March 5, 2010 but he  was  granted
         discretionary leave to remain until March  4,  2013  in  accordance
         with  the  Home  Office  Policy  on  unaccompanied  asylum  seeking
         children and based on the fact he had family life with his aunt  at
         that time.

      c. He has continued to live with his aunt since that date and has  now
         lived with her between the ages of 13 and 19.

      d. His mother abandoned him in 2005 and he was  taken  to  his  aunt's
         house because his father lived and  worked  in  Saudi  Arabia.  His
         mother has never been located. After  three  months  his  aunt  and
         other relatives began to mistreat him and he  was  treated  like  a
         servant. He was assaulted by one of his aunt's nephews. He reported
         what was happening to his father but he did not report that matters
         to the police.

      e. His father told him he would help him and he arranged  for  him  to
         leave and go and live in Dhaka until he met an agent  who  arranged
         for him to fly to the United Kingdom.

      f. He has no contact with his mother or any other family in the United
         Kingdom.

      g. He has been educated here and has a family life.

25.  Family  life  involving  adults  is  difficult  especially  when   the
    relationship is not even mother/father/sibling. Whilst I accept he  has
    been living with  his  aunt's  family  it  remains  questionable  there
    actually is family life in an article 8 sense in light of his  age  and
    the authorities referred to above. However, as he came here  as  a  13-
    year-old and has spent the last six years with his aunt and her  family
    I am prepared to accept there remains a family life and I  also  accept
    he has established a private life.

26. I have to apply the tests set out  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  00027  and
    clearly if he were removed then both his family and private life  would
    be interfered with but this would be in accordance with the law because
    the appellant has been unable  to  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  or
    demonstrate removal would place him at risk or persecution  or  serious
    harm. Removal would also be for a reason specified in article 8(2) ECHR
    and the issue turns on proportionality.

27. In assessing proportionality, I must have regard to Section 117 of  the
    2002 Act and in particular the  provisions  of  section  117B.  Section
    117B(1)  of  the  2002  Act  confirms  the  maintenance  of   effective
    immigration control is in the public interest.

28. The appellant gave his evidence in English and whilst he  currently  is
    financially supported by his aunt he is  not  financially  independent.
    His family life was established whilst he was here  lawfully  but  both
    his private and family life has developed whilst his immigration status
    has been precarious.  Section  117B  specifically  states  that  little
    weight should be attached to a private life that has  been  established
    when his immigration status was precarious  but  there  is  no  similar
    provision for family life.

29. The fact he does not meet the Immigration Rules is also a factor I must
    have regard to and Mrs Chaggar invited me  to  take  into  account  the
    failure to carry out any tracing for the appellant  and  the  delay  in
    dealing with this current appeal.

30. In so far as tracing is concerned the appellant was an adult  when  the
    decision was taken and there is no responsibility on the respondent  to
    try and trace any family for the appellant. Mrs Chaggar accepted  there
    was now no legal obligation on the respondent due to his age.

31. In any event, his evidence was he had no family he could  turn  to  and
    his evidence was that his father lived in Saudi Arabia. The failure  to
    trace is not a material factor in those circumstances.

32. The appellant lodged this application in March 2013 but the  respondent
    did not take a decision until November 2014. Any delay  is  undesirable
    but Mrs Chaggar did not  argue  the  appellant  had  lost  out  on  any
    entitlement by the delay and it is clear that if  the  application  had
    been dealt with earlier it would have led  to  him  having  to  make  a
    further application once he turned 17 � years  old  because  any  leave
    under the policy applied would not have taken him beyond that  date.  I
    therefore find any delay is not prejudicial.

33. In assessing the proportionality of removal I have taken  into  account
    all of the above factors. The respondent must show that  removal  would
    not be disproportionate and Ms Johnstone's submission is that he is fit
    and well, nineteen years of age and has benefited from his stay in  the
    United Kingdom.

34. With regard to his private life claim I am satisfied that  his  private
    life has been created whilst his stay was precarious. It was precarious
    because he had no guarantee he would be allowed to remain  and  he  was
    only told he could remain until March 2013 and any subsequent extension
    was clearly something he would have to apply for and as can be seen its
    grant is not automatic. I do not find removal would breach any  private
    life right created by virtue of article 8 ECHR.

35. With regard to his family life I accept he has enjoyed family life  but
    importantly that life was enjoyed predominantly  on  the  back  of  the
    respondent's own policy  on  unaccompanied  minors.  Whilst  leave  was
    granted having regard to family life with his aunt I  am  mindful  that
    when that application was made he was thirteen years of age and  living
    with his nearest family member. That situation  is  different  to  that
    facing me today as I am now dealing  with  a  young  adult  and  whilst
    becoming an adult does not mean family life ceases the appellant's  age
    is a factor to consider in any proportionality assessment.

36. I have regard  to  the  fact  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interests and although I accept Mrs Chaggar's submission that  he  does
    not receive  any  public  funds  he  is  nevertheless  not  financially
    independent. The family life was created because he entered the  United
    Kingdom in the circumstances he did and whilst he continues to enjoy it
    I cannot overlook the fact he is now an adult, fit and  well,  educated
    in two languages  and  he  has  spent  the  majority  of  his  life  in
    Bangladesh.  His  relationship  is  not   one   of   parent/child   but
    aunt/nephew.

37. Balancing all of the above factors I conclude that removal would not be
    disproportionate  and  accordingly  I  dismiss  his  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

    DECISION

38. There was a material error and I set aside the earlier decision  in  so
    far as article 8 and the finding the respondent's decision was  not  in
    accordance with the law. In all other respects the First-tier  decision
    is upheld

39.  I  have  remade  the  decision  and  dismiss  the  appeal  under  ECHR
    legislation.
