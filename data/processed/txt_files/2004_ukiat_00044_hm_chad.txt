                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr N Ahmed (counsel instructed by Burton & Burton, Nottingham) for the
appellant
Mr A Lawther for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mrs M Gurung-Thapa),
   sitting at  on 15 April 2003,  dismissing  an  asylum  and  human  rights
   appeal by a citizen of Chad. Permission to appeal was given on the  basis
   of allegations about the adjudicator's conduct of the hearing.

2. There is one other point, on which permission was not given, on which we
   agreed to hear Mr Ahmed's representations as to why it should  be  taken
   into account. It concerns a letter from the Movement for  Democracy  and
   Justice in Chad [MJDC] Great Britain section,  dated  15  October  2002,
   which reads, so far as relevant, as follows:

   [The appellant] born 25/8/1977 at N'djamena (Chad) is a  member  of  the
   Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad [MJDC] and in consequence his
   life is under serious threat in his country.

3. The complaint about that is that the adjudicator (at � 40)  rejected  it
   on the basis of her general credibility findings, rather than taking  it
   into account before reaching those, and then arriving at a view  on  it.
   While that was a wrong reading of Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT  00439,  we
   regard the letter as a wholly valueless generalized  testimonial,  which
   had no real bearing on the credibility or otherwise of  the  appellant's
   account of events in Chad. We see no reason to stray outside the  points
   on which permission was given.

4. These stemmed from the difficult situation in which the adjudicator  was
   placed, once again, by  the  now  notorious  inefficiency  of  the  Home
   Office, in  failing  to  field  a  presenting  officer  before  her,  in
   insignificant and far-flung Birmingham. On the  other  hand,  while  not
   everything in the claimant's account was specifically challenged in  the
   refusal letter, it was made very  clear  that  in  general  it  was  not
   accepted at all, with a number of reasons.  That  left  the  adjudicator
   with the job of assessing the claimant's credibility for herself.

5. We reject Mr Ahmed's suggestion, not supported by any authority to which
   he could refer us, that she was limited to the specific points taken  in
   the refusal letter. Provided she made it clear, where it was not already
   so from that, where there were problems  with  the  claimant's  account,
   then it was for her to reach an independent decision on its  credibility
   or otherwise.

6. Most of the points turn on interventions by the  adjudicator.  There  is
   one which does not: it is about the effectiveness or  otherwise  of  the
   interpreter. It is said  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  there  were
   problems with this, contrary to the adjudicator's statement at � 23 that
   there were not. If one actually reads the adjudicator's � 23, it at once
   becomes clear that this is a misrepresentation of it. She did note  that
   there were problems (over the dialect of Arabic used, always a potential
   source of difficulty); but  she  said  the  claimant  had  confirmed  he
   understood everything.

7. Following directions by the vice-president who gave permission, we  have
   the adjudicator's typed record of proceedings and comments from  her  as
   to the points raised in the grounds of appeal. There is also a  copy  of
   the  record  of  proceedings,  annotated   by  Miss  G  Allwood  of  the
   claimant's solicitors, who appeared for him before the adjudicator,  and
   two statements by her. Miss Allwood has marked the record of proceedings
   to show where a particular question was asked by the adjudicator, rather
   than her; and at some points with her own version of what was  said.  We
   wish that too had been put to the adjudicator for her  comments  on  it;
   but in the event we have been able to resolve  whatever  differences  in
   the two versions we needed to.

8. One of these points concerns the claimant's  confirmation  that  he  had
   understood  everything  the  interpreter  had  said:  see  p  8  of  the
   typewritten record. Miss Allwood has added to the adjudicator's  version
   of his reply "... but it has been difficult". That  might  have  led  to
   some difficulties in resolution, if  it  were  not  for  Miss  Allwood's
   helpful and conscientious specification in her second statement of  what
   "the interpretational  problem"  had  actually  involved.  She  says  it
   related to the word "stretcher".

9. This was a reference to the point in the  claimant's  account  where  at
   interview he had described being taken out of prison on a stretcher: see
   the adjudicator's review of this part of the evidence at � 16.  Contrary
   to that version, in his oral evidence before her  he  had  said  he  was
   dragged upstairs on a sheet. When this discrepancy was put to him by the
   adjudicator ("Stretcher or sheet?", as she  records  with  no  waste  of
   words at p 4 of the record of proceedings), the claimant insisted it had
   been at least some form of bed-covering. Unlikely as that might seem, he
   was clearly confirming the account he had given in  oral  evidence,  and
   blaming the Home Office interpreter at his interview for  recording  him
   as saying he was taken out on a stretcher.

10. The adjudicator made it clear at � 37 that she understood  the  claimant
   as saying that: this is not a point on which  any  deficiencies  of  the
   interpreter used before her could affect her view of the  evidence.  She
   was entitled to note, as  she  did  at  �  39,  that  the  claimant  had
   confirmed at the end of the interview record that he had understood  the
   questions put to him, and had had an  opportunity  to  add  anything  he
   wished, and had signed the record. In our view she was entitled to  take
   this particular point against the claimant, as she did at �  37,  though
   not with any degree of prominence.

11. The remaining points all concern interventions by the adjudicator.  They
   fall into three main groups:

    a) (at pp 6 and 8 of the record of proceedings) what is said  to  be  an
       over-confrontational challenge to his explanation  of  the  different
       dates he had given for his leaving Chad;

    b) (also p 6) a too-wide ranging foray of the adjudicator's own  on  the
       details of the claimant's account of the route and times he  took  in
       doing so; and

    c) (at p 9) a similar foray on the history of  the  claimant's  father's
       involvement with the MDJC (referred to  here  as  'MJDT',  using  the
       French spelling of the country in the acronym).

12. The approach to be taken to such points has recently been  clarified  in
   K (AS 58733-03), a decision written by Ouseley P (sitting with Eshun VP,
   as well as a lay member), to which we have his authority  to  refer,  in
   advance of its being reported:  we  had  it  faxed  to  the  parties  in
   Birmingham, so they were prepared  to  make  whatever  submissions  they
   wished on it. It was not a case  where  there  had  been  no  presenting
   officer before the adjudicator; so the views expressed on  interventions
   by her are if anything of more force in this, where there was none.  (It
   is hardly necessary to point out how much more necessary  such  judicial
   interventions must be, where only one side is represented).

13. The ratio of K on the points relevant to this case appears at  ��  42  -
   44, 49 and 55. We draw from it the following principles:

   42. Adjudicators are not limited to asking questions  for  clarification,
       and may intervene to move things along, and may also put questions to
       a witness, where a point which concerns them has not been dealt with,
       even where both sides are represented.

   43. They should not interrupt evidence  in  chief  or  cross-examination,
       except in the circumstances referred to at � 42, "...  or  for  other
       reasons associated with the general control of the case or the  court
       room". It is nearly always best to wait until after cross-examination
       and re-examination (where there is either) to see what is put  before
       taking up inconsistencies; but adjudicators are not limited to points
       raised by the other party (either in the refusal  letter  or  at  the
       hearing), though they should not pursue a different  case  or  theory
       altogether.

   44. Questions by adjudicators should not be asked  "...  in  any  hostile
       manner or in a manner which suggests that the Adjudicator's mind  has
       been made up." They should not be of a  leading  kind,  or  concealed
       traps, but direct and open-ended. Adjudicators should not  take  over
       conduct of the case; but the fact that questions they asked may  help
       one side or the other does not make them unfair.

   49.     "It is important for the distinctions between  cross-examination
       and evidence-in-chief to be remembered. In  evidence  in  chief,  the
       function of the advocate is to elicit  the  relevant  information  on
       which he relies. In cross-examination, one task of the advocate is to
       show how unreliable a witness is by showing how much he has forgotten
       and how little he is able to answer questions."

   55.     "It is important that a fair-minded  observer  would  have  been
       able to distinguish between an Adjudicator firmly  in  control  of  a
       case behaving fairly and properly in order to ascertain how the  case
       related to the available evidence  and  somebody  who  is  indicating
       hostility towards a party or predetermination through the timing  and
       manner of intervention."

14. Before dealing with the adjudicator's interventions in the present  case
   according to those principles, we need  to  reach  a  view  as  to  what
   actually happened at the points in issue to which we  have  referred  at
   11.

    a) We accept Miss Allwood's annotations at pp 6 and 9  as  showing  that
       the line of questioning about dates was pursued by  the  adjudicator,
       not her. This is because the adjudicator herself confirms that at  ��
       23 and 39. There is no such confirmation of the annotation  at  p  6,
       recording the adjudicator as asking, not as she records "Date escaped
       prison, asking you what date did  you  leave  Chad",  but  "You  just
       described day left prison. We are asking simple question,  what  date
       did you leave Chad". However we should not regard this question, even
       in that form, as objectionable in terms of  K:  the  adjudicator  was
       doing no more than bringing the  claimant  back  to  the  point,  and
       reassuring him that it was not a difficult one.

    b) Miss  Allwood  has  only  marked  two  questions  on  the  claimant's
       departure route as asked by the adjudicator:  "How  long  spend  Lake
       Tchad?", and "Where stay in Lake Tchad?". However, even if  Mr  Ahmed
       is right (as he  may  well  be)  in  suggesting  that  the  following
       questions on that page were  asked  by  the  adjudicator,  they  were
       certainly not a foray of the adjudicator's own, since the  point  had
       already been raised by Miss Allwood at the bottom  of  p  5.  If  the
       adjudicator  felt  the   account   she   had   heard   there   needed
       clarification, she was entitled to pursue that while it was fresh  in
       her mind, without waiting for the end of the evidence in  chief;  and
       there is nothing in the form of the questions to indicate any purpose
       other than clarification.

    c) Again it is clear from  the  adjudicator's  ��  24-25  that  she  was
       pursuing the  line  of  questioning  about  the  claimant's  father's
       involvement with the MDJT. That this was not a foray of  her  own  is
       shown by her statement of the claimant's own case at � 32:

      The MDJT  is the main political party for the Gorane tribe [to] which
       he belongs. He joined the party in 1999 because of the  influence  of
       his father. It is customary for sons to join  the  party  that  their
       father's [sic] belonged to.

      This intervention, together with the one at p 8, took  place  at  the
       end of the claimant's  evidence  in  chief,  which  was  an  entirely
       appropriate  point  for  it,  there  being  no  question  of   cross-
       examination or re-examination in the present case.

15. There was no question  of  this  adjudicator  taking  up  a  hostile  or
   apparently prejudged attitude in the questions she asked;  nor  of  them
   representing an inappropriate, or even inappropriately  timed  foray  of
   her own. We have no doubt  that  any  fair-minded  observer  would  have
   regarded her as controlling the proceedings in a fair  way.  This  is  a
   much more difficult task when only one side is present  or  represented,
   and it places heavy demands on judicial savoir-faire. We do  not  accept
   Mr Ahmed's general suggestion that adjudicators should put points to the
   advocate, rather than directly to the claimant. That may have  been  the
   view at one time; but it is a cumbersome procedure, and not required  by
   anything in K. The important thing, as that  decision  makes  clear,  is
   what the adjudicator's questions are about, and how they are put.

16. While advocates naturally wish  to  be  left  alone  to  bring  out  the
   evidence in their own way as much as they possibly can, in our view they
   must recognize, especially where they have no opposition to  face,  that
   some judicial intervention is almost inevitable, and should try  not  to
   be too sensitive about it. These are not ordinary civil proceedings, but
   ones in which there is a strong public interest; and adjudicators  would
   be failing in their duty of "anxious consideration", owed to the  public
   as much as to the individual concerned, if they did not do their best to
   make sure, within the principles set out in K, that  cases  before  them
   are properly gone into.
