                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr G Lee, Counsel instructed by Mreale Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondents are citizens of Brazil.  Mrs Ellen Miranda Lopes'  date
    of birth is 1 November 1982 and her daughter Miss Kamily Miranda  Lopes
    Dutra's date of birth is 9 August 1999.  I  will  refer  to  the  adult
    respondent as the appellant as she was before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and to the child appellant, Ms Dutra, as Kamily.

2.   On 22 August 2013 the appellant  applied  for  a  derivative  residence
    card pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  Her  case  is
    that she is entitled to a derivative  residence  card  as  the  primary
    carer of a British citizen, her daughter Julie Sanchez Miranda (born on
    29 December 2008) pursuant to Regulation 15A of the  2006  Regulations.
    Kamily's case is that she is entitled to a derivative residence card as
    the  dependant  of  a  primary  carer  of  a  British  citizen.   Their
    applications were refused by Secretary of State of in a decision  of  5
    March 2014.  There was no removal direction made.

3.   Their  appeals  were  allowed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    FitzGibbon QC in a decision promulgated on 4 November 2014 following  a
    hearing on 24 October 2014.  Permission to appeal was  granted  to  the
    Secretary of State in a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Kelly  of  29
    December 2014.  Thus the matter came before me.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

4.   The matter was dealt with by way of submissions only before the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  There were no  credibility  issues  raised.  The  judge
    recorded the unchallenged evidence. The  appellant  married  a  British
    citizen, Mr Moscote in August 2013 and their daughter, Julie, is also a
    British citizen.  Mr Moscote works  full-time  as  a  cleaner  and  the
    appellant stays at home and she looks after both children.  She is  not
    permitted to work in the UK.  Should the appellant have  to  leave  the
    UK, Mr Moscote would not be able to  take  care  of  the  children  and
    continue to work.  His earnings are insufficient to pay for  childcare.



5.   The judge found that there was sufficient evidence to show  that  Julie
    was dependent on the appellant and that Mr Moscote would be  unable  to
    care for her.  He found that Mr Moscote was the sole breadwinner in the
    family and could not take over the appellant's responsibilities  whilst
    keeping his job.

6.   The judge found that the appellant was responsible for Julie's  day-to-
    day  care.  She  is  Julie's  primary  carer  and   she   has   primary
    responsibility for her care. He found that the 2006 Regulations do  not
    require an applicant to be the sole carer.  The judge  found  that  the
    phrase 'primary carer' implies that others may also be carers but to  a
    lesser extent. He allowed the appeal on this basis, but he went  on  to
    find in the alternative, that  should  the  appellant  not  be  Julie's
    primary carer, she shares responsibility with Mr Moscote who is not  an
    exempt person pursuant to Regulation 15A(7)(b)(ii) and the appeal would
    succeed on that basis.

The Grounds of Appeal and Oral Submissions

7.    The  grounds  of  appeal  argue  that  the  judge  made   a   material
    misdirection in relation to the 2006 Regulations.  The appellant  lives
    with her husband as a family unit in  the  same  household  and  it  is
    irrational to conclude that she does  not  have  shared  responsibility
    with her husband  despite  the  fact  that  he  works  full-time.   The
    appellant and her husband are Julie's  primary  carers  with  a  shared
    responsibility. The judge erred in finding that the appellant's husband
    was an exempt person pursuant to Regulation 15A(7)(b)(ii). It is argued
    that the judge failed to make a finding whether Julie would  be  unable
    to reside in the UK or in another  EEA  state  if  the  appellant  were
    required to leave.

8.   Mr Duffy made oral  submissions  in  the  context  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  Mr Lee  made  submissions  in  the  context  of  his  skeleton
    argument.  He  conceded  that  the  judge  erred  in  relation  to  his
    conclusion that the appellant's  husband  was  not  an  exempt  person;
    however, this conclusion was posited on an alternative to his principal
    conclusion that the appellant was the primary carer for  her  daughter.
    The judge did not fail to consider  whether  the  appellant's  daughter
    would have to leave the  UK  and  reference  is  made  to  [9]  of  the
    determination.

9.   Mr Lee in his skeleton raises Article 8 with  particular  reference  to
    paragraph 117A(6) and submits  that  irrespective  of  the  appellant's
    position under the EEA Regulations the appeal would be bound to succeed
    pursuant to Article 8 following Sanade and Others (British  children  -
    Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT  00048  (IAC).   The  respondent  cannot
    assert that it would be reasonable to expect the appellant's  child  to
    leave the UK.

10.  Mr Lee urged me to determine the  appeal  under  Article  8.  Mr  Duffy
    stated that the respondent's position is that the appellant can make an
    application under Appendix FM and he urged me not determine the Article
    8 ground of appeal or to adjourn pending the outcome of a  decision  of
    the UT relating to the issue.

Error of Law

11.  Whether or not appellant is the primary carer  is  not  dispositive  of
    the appeal.  It must be established  that  Julie  would  be  unable  to
    remain in the UK if the appellant is required to leave (Regulation  15A
    (2) (b)(iii)). I do not accept Mr Lee's submission that the judge dealt
    with this at [9] of the decision. In my view there is no such  finding.
    The  judge  did  not  apply  his  mind  to  this  requirement  of   the
    regulations. If I am wrong about that it was not open to the  judge  to
    reach a conclusion that Julie would be unable to remain in the UK.  The
    judge made an error of law. It is my view that Julie would be  able  to
    reside in the UK because her father is a  British  citizen.   I  accept
    there may be some practical difficulties that the family would have  to
    face, but the reality is she would not be forced to leave the UK.   The
    error is material and I set aside the  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
    under the 2006 Regulations  and  remake  the  decision  dismissing  the
    appeal. There is no reason for me to make findings in relation  to  the
    primary carer issue. There is no reason to go behind the findings  made
    by the judge which are not the subject of  challenge  by  Secretary  of
    State.

Article 8

12.  The appellant and her daughter did not make an  application  to  remain
    under the Immigration rules and or Article 8. There is no  decision  to
    remove the appellant. Article 8 was raised in  the  grounds  of  appeal
    before the FtT, but this ground of appeal was not  determined.  As  the
    law now stands it is incumbent on me  to  determine  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 (JM v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1402).

13.  Mr Lee submitted that the appeal should  be  allowed  under  Article  8
    because it would not be reasonable to expect Julie  to  leave  the  UK,
    with reference to section 117A(6)(b) of the 2002 Act. The problem  with
    this submission is that the secretary of state does not expect Julie to
    leave the UK, but envisages her remaining here  with  her  father  who,
    like her, is a British citizen.

14.  The appellant's case in relation to Article 8  was  not  developed  any
    further than the submission under section 117A relating to  Julie.  The
    appellant has not made an application for leave. In  order  to  satisfy
    the Immigration Rules (without consideration of EX.1)  the  appellant's
    husband would have to establish that he earns �22,400 per annum  whilst
    his earnings are �14,453. In addition the appellant has  overstayed  in
    breach of immigration laws. As regards  EX.1,  the  evidence  does  not
    establish that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    outside the UK.  However, in my view, it would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect Julie or Kamily (who is now aged 15 and who has been here  since
    she was aged 5) to leave the UK. As noted above there is no expectation
    that Julie would leave, but it is expected that Kamily should leave and
    the reasonableness of this would need to be considered.

15.  Regrettably the focus of the appellant's case was Julie  and  the  2006
    Regulations. There was no evidence before the FtT or the UT relating to
    Kamily's best interests. It is, in my view, obvious on the  facts  that
    it is unreasonable and contrary to her best interests to expect her  to
    return to Brazil in the light of her age and because she has been  here
    for nearly ten years. Furthermore she is still in compulsory education.
    There has been lengthy residence here during a  significant  period  of
    her life, considering her age when she came here. It  is  obvious  that
    she will have developed social and educational ties. It is clear having
    considered  and  applied  the  guidance  in  Azimi-Moayed  and   others
    (decisions affecting children; onward appeals)  [2013]  UKUT  197   and
    Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC  74  that  it  would  be  in  Kamily's  best
    interest to remain here with her family. The facts in this case do  not
    bear analogy to those in EV (Philippines) and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA
    Civ 874. On this basis the appellant's appeal should succeed under EX.1
    and Kamily's appeal should succeed under A276ADE of the Rules. If I  am
    right about this, it follows  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
    remove the appellant appeal because  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect Kamily to leave the UK (section 117B (6)(b) of  the  2002  Act).
    There would be no merit in any argument that she  could  stay  and  her
    mother could return to Brazil.  Mr Moscote is not  Kamily's  biological
    father.

16.  In any event, I will go onto consider both the appellant  and  Kamily's
    appeals under Article 8 outside the rules through the prism of  section
    117B of the 2002 Act. The issue is one of proportionality.   It  is  in
    the best interests of the children to remain with both of their parents
    as a family unit. Julie is a British  citizen.  Citizenship  is  not  a
    trump card, but it is a strong indication that her best interests would
    be to remain  in  the  UK  so  that  she  could  enjoy  the  rights  of
    citizenship. She has started school  here.  Her  father  is  a  British
    citizen. In my view, it is in her best interests to remain  in  the  UK
    with both parents and her sibling.

17.  There are factors that are against the appellant.  The  maintenance  of
    immigration control is in the  public  interest  and  I  attach  little
    weight to private life established when status is precarious  or  to  a
    relationship formed with a qualifying partner when her unlawfully.  The
    appellant formed a family life with her husband  when  they  both  knew
    that she was here unlawfully. However, notwithstanding this  there  are
    two children of the family both of whom are qualifying children.  It is
    not proportionate or reasonable to expect the family  to  re-locate  to
    Brazil. Mr Moscote is  from  Colombia.  The  children  cannot  be  held
    responsible for the choices made by their parents and it  is  in  their
    best interests to remain in the UK  with  their  family.  There  is  no
    suggestion that the family is not self-supporting  or  that  there  are
    language difficulties. The scales in this case tip  in  favour  of  the
    appellant and Julie. A removal decision would not  be  a  fair  balance
    between the right to respect for private life of the appellant and  her
    family  and  the  economic  well-being  of  the  country  through   the
    maintenance of immigration control. In the light  of  the  unchallenged
    evidence and positive findings of the FtT in relation to the family, it
    would not be proportionate to expect the appellant and Kamily to return
    to Brazil to make applications for entry clearance (with or without the
    rest of  the  family)  because  of  the  disruption  that  would  ensue
    (notwithstanding that the appellant has breached immigration laws). The
    family is wholly dependent on Mr Moscote's income and the children  are
    both at school.

18.  I decided to determine  the  appeal  under  Article  8  as  opposed  to
    adjourning pending the outcome of a  forthcoming  decision  by  the  UT
    (there has to date been no hearing and it is unclear  when  a  decision
    will be promulgated) because I am bound to follow the law as it stands,
    in the light of  the  strength  of  the  appellant's  case  and  having
    considered the overriding objective at Rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
