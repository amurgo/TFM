Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms N Braganza, instructed by Migrant
For the respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, FK, date of birth [ ] 1986, is a citizen of Sierra Leon.



 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Grimshaw  promulgated  30.10.14,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse her  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims, and to remove her from  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Judge heard the appeal on 20.10.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.11.14. Permission was also refused in the Upper  Tribunal.  However,
    on application for Judicial Review the Administrative Court quashed the
    refusal of permission, on the basis that  it  was  "strongly  arguable"
    that there was deficient consideration of the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's daughters and had they been properly and  fully  considered
    the appeal should have been allowed. In consequence, the Vice President
    granted permission to appeal on 19.11.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons briefly set out below I found such error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Grimshaw to be set aside and remade in the First-tier
    Tribunal, in accordance with the attached directions.

 6. At �13 of the decision the judge  recognised  the  appellant's  claimed
    fear that if returned to Sierra Leone she and  her  daughters  will  be
    forced to undergo FGM. It is obvious that  the  refusal  decision  will
    impact not only  the  appellant  but  also  her  two  young  daughters.
    However, whilst the judge addressed the risk of FGM, she  did  so  from
    the perspective of the appellant and there was scant reference  to  her
    two female children. The decision contains no real assessment of  their
    individual best interests and the risks they might face as children  in
    Sierra Leone, whether from FGM  or  other  risks,  which  were  matters
    specifically addressed in the expert report of Dr Marks,  beginning  at
    A21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains but the  briefest
    of reference to that expert report at �27. The judge decided  to  place
    no significant weight on the expert  report  because,  in  the  judge's
    view, the assertion that the police would be  unlikely  to  help  those
    seeking to avoid involuntary circumcision was unsourced, with no detail
    of the location and numbers of such  incidents.  Whether  or  not  that
    criticism was justified, the judge made no reference to  that  part  of
    the report specifically addressing the challenges and  risks  faced  by
    children in Sierra Leone,  including  child  abuse,  forced  and  early
    marriage, sexual exploitation, and displacement of children.

 7.  In  addition,  reliance  was  placed  on  the  children's  social  and
    educational provision and stability, as well as  the  length  of  their
    residence in the UK. The only treatment of best  interests  is  at  �41
    where the judge expressed the view that their best interests  would  be
    to remain with the appellant as a family unit.

 8. In summary,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  inadequately
    addressed the best interests of the two children. I cannot say that had
    the judge done so the outcome would have necessarily been the same.  In
    the circumstances, the decision must be set aside to be remade.





Conclusions:

 9. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision to be made afresh  in
                    the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

1) The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Bradford;

2) The appeal is to be reheard afresh, with no findings of fact preserved;

3) The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours;

4) No interpreter will be required;

5) The appellant will be the only witness;

6) Not later than 10 working days before the appeal  hearing  the  appellant
   must serve on the  respondent  and  lodge  with  the  Tribunal  a  single
   indexed,  paginated  bundle  comprising  all  subjective  and   objective
   material to be relied on, together with any skeleton argument and  copies
   of case authorities to  be  relied  on.  The  Tribunal  will  not  accept
   evidence submitted on the day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
