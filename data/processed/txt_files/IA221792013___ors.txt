                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Jo Wilding, Counsel, instructed by
     Tower Hamlets Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. These appeals are brought by citizens of Ghana against a decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal against the decision of  the
    Secretary of State on 21  May  2013  to  remove  them  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  It is their case that  removing  them  is  contrary  to  their
    rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 and Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human  Rights  because  it  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with their private and family lives.

 2. There was no anonymity order made in the First-tier Tribunal but I think
    that an anonymity order is appropriate in this case which is essentially
    about the welfare of children. For the same reasons  that  anonymity  is
    preserved in the family courts I think it essential that  the  anonymity
    of the minor appellants is preserved and consequentially  the  anonymity
    of their mother must  also  be  preserved.   I  make  the  normal  order
    restraining publication details in this case in a way  that  allows  the
    children to be identified.

 3. I do not understand the delay in promulgating this  decision.  A  nearly
    completed draft Determination was prepared either at or soon  after  the
    hearing but the files seem to have been misplaced. They were brought  to
    me this morning and the Determination was completed immediately.

 4. All three appellants are citizens of Ghana.  The appellant in  IA  22179
    2013 is the mother of the two other appellants.   The  minor  appellants
    were born in 2004 and 2010 so are now aged 9 years and 3 � years.   They
    have lived all their lives in the United Kingdom.

 5. On 13  May  2010  the  appellants  applied  for  leave  to  remain.  The
    applications were refused outside the rules on 3 May 2011. The decisions
    were not "immigration decisions" for the  purpose  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and so  did  not  generate  a  right  of
    appeal. The applicants asked for judicial review of the decision and the
    respondent agreed to reconsider the decisions. It follows that  although
    the  decision  complained  of  was  not  made  until  21  May  2013  the
    application leading to the decision was made as long ago as 13 May  2010
    when the immigration rules applicable to a more recent application  were
    not in force.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself  correctly  to  have  regard  to
    Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
    requiring a decision maker to have regard to the best interests  of  the
    children.  However, having thus directed itself the First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make any discernable finding  on  this  fundamentally  important
    part of the evidence and went on to  decide  that  removing  the  entire
    family would be a proportionate interference with the private and family
    lives or family members  because  the  principle  of  family  unity  was
    preserved and it is generally best for families to stay together and for
    small children to be with their mothers.

 7. As Ms Wilding properly pointed out, my first task is  to  make  findings
    about the best interests of the  children.  This  will  not  necessarily
    determine the appeal but as their interests are a primary  consideration
    it is an appropriate place to start.  In the case of the 3� year old who
    I think is the second appellant, the evidence points to it being in  her
    best interest to stay with her sister and mother in the United  Kingdom.
    It is the only country she knows, she is  settled  there  and  has  some
    social contacts.  As that is true for her it is very  much  stronger  in
    the  case  of  the  third  appellant,  who  has  started  to   establish
    significant private and family life outside the nuclear family.  She has
    links with the local church as indeed do the other  two  appellants  and
    she attends school where apparently she is settled.  Her home is in  the
    United Kingdom, all her friendships and experience  of  life  are  there
    too.  Clearly it is in her  best  interests  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom with her mother.

 8. Because of the antiquity of the particular decision before me, this case
    was decided without reference to the changes in  the  Immigration  Rules
    that purport to encapsulate the requirements of Article  8.   Therefore,
    the First-tier Tribunal correctly  in  my  judgment  conducted  analysis
    without regard to the new Rules,  but  without,  as  I  have  indicated,
    regard to the essential premise of the best interests of the children.

 9. Mr Duffy invited me to assume that it had been done properly but  I  can
    see no justification for that. The failure  to  make  reasoned  findings
    about the rights of children is an error of law that went  to  the  very
    root of the determination.  I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and make the decision again.

10. I have looked carefully at the evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    with the assistance of both representatives and have seen typed notes of
    the evidence that was given as well as the witness statements.   It  was
    the case of the first appellant that she  has  no  contacts  anymore  in
    Ghana.  She gave details of her family but her family  relationships  in
    Ghana, she said, are at an  end.   There  was  unhappiness  in  her  own
    family.  She was not brought up by her mother and her relationship  with
    her father has deteriorated to the point that she  has  had  no  contact
    with him of any kind for over two years.  She  understands  that  he  is
    unemployed, that he has remarried and his wife has children  and  family
    responsibilities of her own.  What would actually happen if this  family
    were removed  to  Ghana  is  a  matter  of  speculation,  but  there  is
    absolutely nothing in the evidence to suggest for a  moment  that  there
    would be any welcoming party waiting to embrace them into the family and
    help them settle.

11. I find it very significant that there is no father in this family.   The
    first appellant would have to establish not only her own life  in  Ghana
    but look after her children.  I do not know how she would achieve  that.
    It is right  to  say  that  the  children's  father  has  proved  deeply
    unsatisfactory and was violent  towards  the  mother,  and  although  he
    showed little responsibility in removing to Ghana I  have  little  doubt
    that his absence was a source of some  rejoicing  on  the  part  of  her
    former partner.  However he cannot be looked to for any kind of help and
    support.

12. Ms Wilding has emphasised the age of the oldest child.  She is  a  young
    person over nine years.  It is often thought that seven years  residence
    in the United Kingdom for a child is a sort  of  rule  of  thumb  figure
    indicating that the child is likely  to  have  established  private  and
    family life of its own.  I understand that, but this case of  course  is
    much stronger.  The child is 9 and knows nowhere else.  In  my  judgment
    it would be a very serious interference with her private and family life
    to take her from the place where she is settled to a  country  that  she
    does not know at all, where  there  is  no  indication  of  any  support
    outside her immediate family, no indication of how the family  could  be
    supported or how it could function. Any decision  to  remove  her  would
    have to be made in the hope that somehow the mother  would  manage.   No
    doubt she would, because mothers do  but  the  evidence  points  to  the
    interference consequent on removal being very significant.  This is true
    too in the case of the younger child, just not so strong.

13. I have not said very much about the first appellant because  she  really
    is the author of her own misfortune.  I accept Counsel's  point  of  the
    ill-treatment she experienced by the father of her children, but not too
    much can be made of that.  People can regularise their status  with  the
    Secretary of State.  There are extensive powers in appropriate cases  to
    make decisions outside the Rule, and the fact she was unhappy  and  ill-
    treated is not of itself  a  reason  to  live  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, nothing is said to her detriment other than her  disregard  for
    the requirements of immigration control.  It is not to her  credit,  but
    allowing her to remain is not like allowing to remain a  person  with  a
    penchant for serious criminal activity or  other  grossly  discreditable
    behaviour.

14. When I balance the public  interest  in  upholding  immigration  control
    against the harm that it would do to these children I have no hesitation
    in concluding that removal is disproportionate.  If I had  had  to  have
    regard to the present Rules I may well have reached a similar conclusion
    for the same reasons.  The oldest child has established a strong private
    and family life, and given the absence of family  support  or  any  real
    prospects of her establishing herself in Ghana at more than a most basic
    level it would be unreasonable to expect her to go.  Clearly the  family
    should not be separated if separation can reasonably be avoided.

15. I am satisfied  that  when  the  best  interests  of  the  children  are
    considered and proper regard is had  for  the  jurisprudence,  then  the
    proper order here is to allow the appeal with reference to Article 8.

16. I set aside the decision  as  indicated  and  I  substitute  a  decision
    allowing  the  appeals.   I  hope  it  will  be  understood  by  anybody
    interested in this case that the real reasons here are  the  welfare  of
    the children, which I am required by statute to have specific regard.
    Decision

    The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set aside its  decision  and  I
    make a decision allowing the appeals.
