|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                                 |

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms. S. Osman, of  Counsel,  instructed  by   Freemans
                        Solicitors.
For the Respondent:          Ms. R. Giltrow, Senior Home  Office  Presenting
                        Officer.

1.    The Appellant has appealed, with leave, against the  determination  of
     Miss S. Jhirad, an  Adjudicator,  who  (following  a  hearing  on  17th
     February 2003 at Taylor House) dismissed her appeal on asylum and human
     rights grounds against the Respondent's decision of 24th  January  2002
     to give directions for her removal to Angola.
1.2   The Appellant's asylum claim was  certified.  The  Adjudicator  upheld
     the certificate. Accordingly, the appeal before us relates only to  the
     Appellant's human rights appeal.

2.    The Appellant entered the United Kingdom illegally  on  1st  September
     2001 and claimed asylum on 5th September 2001. The  Respondent  refused
     her application (on asylum and human rights grounds)  on  24th  January
     2002, for the reasons given in the refusal letter  dated  24th  October
     2001.

3.    Leave to appeal to the  Tribunal  was  granted  only  in  relation  to
     Ground  2  of  the  grounds  of  application.  This  asserts  that  the
     Adjudicator  had  failed  to  properly  apply  the   UNHCR's   position
     concerning the return of Angolans to Luanda. The Adjudicator was  wrong
     to assert that "it would be quickly discovered that the  Appellant  was
     someone who originated from  Luanda,  that  she  has  relatives,  close
     connections and a network  of  friends  in  Luanda".  In  fact,  it  is
     asserted in ground 2 of the grounds of application that  the  Appellant
     was only 8 years old when she  first  left  Luanda  to  live  with  her
     grandmother in the southern provinces of Angola.  The  Adjudicator  had
     therefore failed completely to consider the position of  the  Appellant
     as a young single female with a  young child on return to a  city  with
     which she has had no connection since she herself was a young child.

4.1   At the hearing before us, Ms. Osman informed us that the Appellant  is
     attending "mother and baby" psychotherapy counselling sessions  at  the
     Medical Foundation. She did not have any  up-to-date  letter  from  the
     Medical Foundation, nor did she have any medical evidence. The  general
     living conditions in Luanda are  very  bad,  as  is  evidenced  by  the
     UNHCR's  letter  of  October  2002.  The  medical  services  are   poor
     (paragraphs 5.27 to 5.29 of the CIPU report dated April 2003). Violence
     against  women  is  widespread.  Child  prostitution   is   a   problem
     (paragraphs 6.46 to 6.50 of the CIPU report).

4.2   Ms. Osman submitted that, if the Appellant is returned to Luanda  with
     her young child, she would be  deprived  of  the  counselling  sessions
     which she is currently receiving at  the  Medical  Foundation  and  the
     rights which she has enjoyed in he United Kingdom. Ms. Osman  submitted
     that, notwithstanding the judgement of the Court of Appeal in  Ullah  &
     Do [2002] EWCA Civ 1856,  the Appellant's rights under Article 8  would
     be breached if she is returned to Luanda.

5.     Ms.  Giltrow  accepted  that  the  Adjudicator  had  been   factually
     incorrect to say that the Appellant has connections in Luanda. However,
     the objective evidence does not  show  that  particular  categories  of
     people cannot be returned. The Appellant's mother arrived in the United
     Kingdom in 1992.  She  had  applied  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
     Overstayers  Scheme  but  she  was  considered  to  be  ineligible  for
     consideration under this scheme. The Appellant's mother has now made  a
     human rights application. Ms. Giltrow  understood  that  the  Appellant
     would be returned to Luanda with her mother. However, she was not  able
     to given us an undertaking to this effect. Ms.  Giltrow  accepted  that
     the general humanitarian condition in Luanda is very bad. However,  she
     submitted that poor country conditions cannot found an Article 3 claim.
     In  this  connection,  she  relied  on   Ngandu   (01/TH/-1994)   -   a
     determination of the Tribunal in the case of a DRC  national.  Even  if
     the Appellant would not receive any counselling in Angola, Ms.  Giltrow
     submitted that her return to Angola would not be in breach  of  Article
     3.

6.1   It was accepted before us that the Adjudicator incorrectly found  that
     the Appellant has relatives, close connections and a network of friends
     in Luanda. We accept that the Appellant left Luanda,  when  she  was  8
     years old, to live with her grandmother in the southern  provinces.  We
     therefore accept that, if returned to Angola, she would  not  have  any
     connections in Luanda.

6.2   We have noted that Ms. Giltrow indicated that it is intended that  the
     Appellant would be returned to Angola with her mother. However, we were
     not given an undertaking to this effect and, accordingly, have  decided
     that it would be inappropriate for us to determine this appeal  on  the
     basis that the Appellant would be returned to Angola with  her  mother.
     We determine this appeal on the  basis  that  the  Appellant  would  be
     returned to Angola, as a young single female (being  only  about  18  ï¿½
     years old), with a young baby to look after.

6.3    The  "Operational  Guidance  Note"  issued  by  the  Immigration  and
     Nationality Directorate of the Home Office dated  October  2002  (which
     was before the Adjudicator) states that, as is inevitable in a  country
     which had been in civil war for most of the last 25 years, the  general
     humanitarian situation is extremely poor. The conflict has resulted  in
     many internally displaced persons. The end of the conflict has  enabled
     aid agencies to provide supplies to remote regions of the country.  Aid
     agencies have begun humanitarian assessments of previously inaccessible
     regions in southern and central parts of the country.  The  implication
     is therefore  that  aid  agencies  are  able  to  provide  humanitarian
     assistance in Luanda, which is accessible. However, we entirely  accept
     that the humanitarian situation in Luanda is  very  poor  indeed.  This
     explains the position of the UNHCR issued in October 2002 (and referred
     to in the Operational Guidance Note), which is stated in paragraph 4 of
     the Operational Guidance Note to be as follows:

            As far as individuals originating from Luanda are concerned,  we
           believe that they should only be returned if, firstly, this will
           not  result  in  them  living  in  a   situation   of   internal
           displacement and, secondly, any family  members  residing  there
           have been identified and notified. As regards  individuals  from
           the provinces or those who do not have relatives in  Luanda,  we
           believe that their return to Angola should be avoided, lest they
           increase the already  large  number  of  internally  [dis]placed
           persons."

6.4   We were referred to the section on children in the CIPU  report  dated
     April 2003. We do not see the relevance of  this,  as  the  Appellant's
     child is not orphaned, nor would the  child  be  abandoned  unless  the
     Appellant chooses to abandon her child. The  objective  evidence  shows
     that there is widespread violence against women by  government  forces.
     However, according to paragraph 6.44 of the CIPU report,  this  appears
     to take place in areas where counter-insurgency operations take  place.
     However, we acknowledge that sexual harassment is a problem  (paragraph
     6.44 of  the  CIPU  report).  Women  suffer  from  discrimination,  are
     frequently the victims  of  brutality  in  the  home,  disproportionate
     malnutrition and poor medical provision  (paragraph  6.43  of  the  CPU
     Report).  Although  medical  care  is  provided  free  of  charge,  its
     availability  is  limited  by  a  shortage  of  trained  personnel  and
     medicines. Under-investment in health, coupled with  three  decades  of
     conflict, has caused an almost complete break down in health  services.
     Many  diseases  including  tuberculosis,  acute  diarrhoea  and   acute
     respiratory diseases are endemic in  many  parts  of  the  country  and
     preventative services are very limited  (paragraph  5.27  of  the  CIPU
     Report).

6.5   Whilst we were  not  provided  with  an  up-to-date  letter  from  the
     Medical Foundation, we are prepared to determine  this  appeal  on  the
     basis that the Appellant is attending psychotherapy sessions  with  her
     child at the Medical Foundation. The letter from the Medical Foundation
     dated 16th January 2002 (which was before the Adjudicator) states that,
     since 11th March  2002,  the  Appellant  and  her  daughter  have  been
     attending psychotherapeutic mother and  baby  group  sessions  twice  a
     week. There is no medical evidence, apart from this letter. We  do  not
     know the seriousness of the Appellant's condition. Indeed, we  have  no
     evidence of any diagnosis, or whether the Appellant  is  receiving  any
     medication.

6.6   If the Appellant is returned to Luanda, we accept that  her  situation
     would be very grim indeed. There is a real likelihood  that  she  would
     become  internally  displaced  in  Luanda,  given  that  she   has   no
     connections in Luanda. We do not underestimate  her  situation  and  we
     bear in mind that she would be returning with a  young  baby.  We  note
     that the UNHCR has not said categorically that  returns  to  Angola  of
     persons who do not have connections in Luanda should  not  take  place;
     its position is that such returns should be avoided.  However,  on  the
     whole of the evidence before us, we are of the clear opinion  that  the
     conditions the Appellant would face would not be of such severity as to
     reach the threshold for a breach of Article 3.  The Article 3 threshold
     is a high one. Any case such as this  must be judged in  the  light  of
     the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHr)  in  Bensaid
     v. The United Kingdom [2002[ INLR 325. In that  case,  the  ECtHr  said
     (paragraph 40 of the judgement):

      40.   The Court accepts the seriousness  of  the  applicant's  medical
           condition. Having regard however to the high  threshold  set  by
           Article 3, particularly where the  case  does  not  concern  the
           direct  responsibility  of  the  Contracting   State   for   the
           infliction of harm, the Court does not  find  that  there  is  a
           sufficiently real risk that the  applicant's  removal  in  these
           circumstances would be contrary to the standard of Article 3. It
           does not disclose the exceptional circumstances of the  D.  case
           (cited above) where the applicant was in the final stages  of  a
           terminal illness, AIDS, and had no prospect of medical  care  or
           family support on expulsion to St. Kitts.

6.7   Of course, in the appeal before us, the Appellant  does  not  rely  on
     any medical condition.  However,  the  principle  in  Bensaid  is  also
     applicable where the Article 3 claim is based  solely  on  the  general
     conditions in the receiving country.

6.8   In the grounds of application, reliance is placed  on  the  Tribunal's
     Determination in  Gregorio  [2002]  UKIAT  04045.  In  that  case,  the
     Tribunal had decided that a man of 29 years of age would not be at risk
     if returned to Angola.  There  was  evidence  in  that  case  that  the
     applicant had friends in Luanda. Mr. P. Moulden, who was the  Chairman,
     noted at paragraph 9 of the Determination:  "The  Appellant  is  not  a
     young woman".   In the grounds of application in the appeal before  us,
     it is asserted that the inference from paragraph 9 of the Determination
     in Gregorio is, arguably, that it is not safe for  young  women  to  be
     returned to Angola.

6.9   We entirely reject this argument.  In Gregorio, the Tribunal were  not
     laying down general  principles  for  ascertaining  the  categories  of
     persons who would be able to return to Angola and those who would  not.
     The comment of Mr. Moulden at paragraph  9  was  nothing  more  than  a
     comment made in passing.

7.1   Ms. Osman  submitted  that,  notwithstanding  the  Court  of  Appeal's
     judgement in Ullah & Do, the Appellant's rights under Article  8  would
     be breached by her return to Angola. The  reliance  on  Article  8  was
     based solely on the same general humanitarian condition  which  is  the
     basis of the reliance on Article 3.

7.2   We respectfully disagree with Ms. Osman.  It is clear,  from  Ullah  &
     Do, that, if an Article 3 claim is not made  out,  then  a  contracting
     state is under no obligation to recognise that any other  Articles,  to
     the extent that reliance is  based  on  treatment  the  applicant  will
     receive in the receiving country, are or may be engaged. Given that  we
     have found that the Appellant's return to Angola will not be in  breach
     of her rights under Article 3, it follows  that  her  Article  8  claim
     which is based  on  the  same  general  conditions  in  Angola,  cannot
     succeed.

8.    For all of these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

      Decision

      The appeal of the Secretary of State is DISMISSED.
