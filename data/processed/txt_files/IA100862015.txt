                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Kimnell  sitting  at  Harmondsworth  on  20
    August  2015)  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  by  the
    respondent to refuse to vary his leave to remain in the United Kingdom,
    and to give  directions  for  his  removal  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do  not  consider  that  the
    appellant  requires  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission

 2. On 12 April 2016  Judge  Pooler  gave  his  reasons  for  granting  the
    appellant permission to appeal:

    "2.  The application for permission was made in time and  submits  that
         the judge erred in law by failing to make findings in respect of an
         allegation that the appellant had used a false document.

    3.   The judge considered that it was unnecessary to make  findings  in
         relation to the allegation of deception because the respondent  had
         not decided a  Tier  2  application  with  which  the  document  in
         question was submitted.  However, it  is  clear  from  the  refusal
         letter of 13 February 2015 that the respondent relied on S-LTR.2.2,
         the  consequences  of  which  were  potentially  serious  for   the
         appellant insofar as he might in future be unable to  obtain  entry
         clearance.  Arguably the judge failed to take into  account  and/or
         resolve conflicts of fact on material matters.

    4.   It is entirely possible that the Upper Tribunal will  not,  if  it
         finds there to be a material error of law, re-decide the appeal  in
         favour of the appellant; but the grounds relating to the  issue  of
         deception and the long-term consequences for the appellant of  such
         a finding warrant the grant of permission."

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant is a national of Nepal, whose date of birth  is  5  March
    1987.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2009 with valid
    entry clearance as a student.  He remained in the United  Kingdom  with
    valid leave as a student until  31  July  2014.   He  made  an  in-time
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 2 Migrant.  He relied
    on a certificate of sponsorship from N  Peal  Retail  Limited,  sponsor
    licence number FA8RZSG3W, which had been assigned  to  him  on  9  June
    2014.

 4. On a date which is not apparent from the document at  E1  of  the  Home
    Office bundle, the Home Office carried out a check on  the  certificate
    of sponsorship.  The Home Office found that the COS did  not  exist  on
    the COS checker.  The sponsor was on the sponsorship management system,
    and the sponsor's licence number was X366DDB58.

 5. On 6 November 2014 the appellant wrote to the Home Office to  say  that
    he wanted to vary his application for  leave  to  remain.   Instead  of
    proceeding  with  his  Tier  2  application,  he  wished  to  make   an
    application for leave to remain under a form FLR(O).  In  a  follow  up
    letter dated 7 November 2014, his representatives  explained  that  the
    appellant now wished to do a research degree and had applied  to  Leeds
    University Business School for this  purpose,  as  well  as  to  Anglia
    Ruskin University.  In order to obtain  a  CAS  letter,  the  appellant
    needed to be successful in his FLR(O) visa application.

 6. On 13 February 2015  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application made using the FLR(O) form.  In  his  previous
    Tier 2 application for leave to remain, he had submitted a  certificate
    of sponsorship printout purporting to have been issued by N Peal Retail
    Limited  which  clearly  displayed  certificate  reference  number   of
    FA8RZSG3W.  She was satisfied the document was  false  because  the  UK
    Visas  and  Immigration  sponsor  investigations  team  confirmed   the
    certificate number in question did not  appear  when  cross-checked  on
    their systems.  As he had submitted a false document in relation to  an
    application, the Secretary of State was not satisfied that he  met  the
    requirements of S-LTR.2.2(a).  In view of this, the Secretary of  State
    was not satisfied he could meet the requirements of Rule  276ADE(1)(i).



 7. He had entered the United Kingdom on 14  September  2009  and  had  not
    lived continuously in the UK for at least twenty years, and so  he  did
    not meet the requirements of Rule 276ADE(1)(iii).

 8. Having spent 22 years in Nepal,  and  having  stated  his  parents  and
    siblings still live there, in  the  absence  of  any  evidence  to  the
    contrary, it was not accepted in the period of time that he had been in
    the United Kingdom he had lost ties to his home country  and  therefore
    the Secretary of State  was  not  satisfied  that  he  could  meet  the
    requirements of Rule 276ADE(1)(vi).

 9. A decision had also been made on exceptional circumstances.  He claimed
    he needed to stay in the United  Kingdom  to  arrange  admission  to  a
    university to undertake a research degree.  He did not need to make his
    applications from within the UK.  If he wished to, he can continue with
    his applications from Nepal.  If admitted onto a university course,  it
    would then be open to him to apply for entry clearance to the UK  under
    the current route, if he believed he met the Immigration Rules.  He had
    completed five years of study in the UK  and  he  could  now  use  this
    education to help him find employment or undertake further study in his
    home country.  The UK was not under an obligation  to  support  him  in
    arranging to undertake higher education.

10. He had shown he was able to support himself through employment  in  the
    UK.  There was no reason therefore why he could not continue to support
    himself in his home country where  he  would  be  legally  able  to  be
    employed.  His immediate family also lived in Nepal, and they would  be
    able to support him with his reintegration on his return.

11. He had provided no compelling or compassionate reasons why he should be
    granted leave to remain outside the Rules, and the Secretary  of  State
    was therefore not prepared to exercise discretion in his favour.





The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. Both parties were legally represented before Judge  Kimnell.   For  the
    purposes of the appeal hearing, the appellant's  legal  representatives
    compiled a bundle of documents which contained  correspondence  between
    the appellant and Action Fraud, which is the  UK's  national  reporting
    centre for fraud and internet crime operated  by  the  City  of  London
    Police.  In a letter dated 12 September 2014  the  director  of  Action
    Fraud wrote to the appellant, saying he was sorry to hear he had been a
    victim of a crime, and thanking him  for  taking  time  to  report  the
    matter to Action Fraud.  He gave him a national crime reference number.
     In a follow up letter dated 31 October 2014, the  director  said  that
    experts at the National Fraud  Intelligence  Bureau  had  reviewed  the
    information and  had  found  enough  evidence  for  a  possible  police
    investigation.  So his report had been sent to the Metropolitan  Police
    in Harrow.  On 27 November 2014 PC Cameron e-mailed  the  appellant  to
    say that he had looked at his crime report which  was  currently  being
    investigated by T D C Quraishi.  The investigation was  very  in  depth
    and complicated.  He was therefore forwarding  his  e-mail  to  T  D  C
    Quraishi for him to make contact with him.

13. In his witness statement for the appeal  hearing,  the  appellant  said
    that he had been duped by Amita Solutions, who had marketed  themselves
    as upmarket recruitment consultants.  Amita Solutions had  charged  him
    ï¿½8,000 as an introduction fee, and he had signed an employment contract
    with N Peal Retail Limited on 9 June 2014 when he visited their office.
     When he later found that he had been conned into a scam by  criminals,
    he contacted Action Fraud to report the matter on  12  September  2014.
    If he had not been conned by Amita Solutions, he would have focused  on
    completing his research degree.  As a result of the wrongful allegation
    of deception in the refusal letter, he had lost an important  right  to
    make a fresh application to the respondent because his application  was
    going to be refused under  the  general  grounds  of  refusal.   So  he
    requested the court to make a finding that the allegation of  deception
    was not maintainable, and to allow his appeal with a grant of 60  days'
    leave to enable him to obtain a CAS letter from a university.

14. In his subsequent decision, Judge Kimnell noted at paragraph [14]  that
    Mr Uppal, Counsel for the appellant, submitted that the  appellant  did
    not rely on Article 8 or Rule 276ADE.  At paragraph [16], he said if it
    were relevant in this case, the burden would be on  the  respondent  to
    prove that a document submitted with an  application  was  false.   But
    because the Tier 2 application was never  decided,  the  allegation  of
    falsehood was not material.  There was no evidence on  which  he  could
    make a finding, even if  it  were  necessary  to  do  so  in  order  to
    determine this appeal.  The appellant appeared to acknowledge that  the
    document he submitted was false, although he had no  knowledge  of  the
    falsehood.  It was not necessary for him to  make  a  finding  on  that
    point, and he did not do so.

15. The judge continued in paragraph [17]:

         "As to the current application it is very difficult to identify any
         ground on which it can succeed.  Mr Uppal said the decision was not
         in accordance with the law, but that  has  not  been  demonstrated.
         The appellant has claimed he does not rely on Article  8  ECHR  but
         invites a favourable decision from the  Tribunal  on  compassionate
         grounds.  However, the Tribunal has no  jurisdiction  to  do  that,
         even if compassionate grounds could  be  made  out  which,  on  the
         evidence, in this case they are not."

16. In paragraph [18] the judge held that Article 8 was  not  engaged,  and
    that he did not have jurisdiction to allow the appeal, "with the  grant
    of 60 days' leave to  find  a  CAS  letter  from  a  university".   The
    Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make such a decision  unless  one
    of the legal grounds specified in Section 82, as amended, was made out,
    which in this case was  not  the  position.   The  judge  continued  in
    paragraph [19]:

         "The  appellant  appears   perfectly   genuine   judging   by   his
         acknowledgement in evidence that there is nothing  to  prevent  him
         from making a further application from abroad; he merely  finds  it
         convenient to make a new application  from  the  UK,  whatever  the
         personal merits of the appellant but the appeal has no merit at all
         and is dismissed."

Rule 24 Response

17. On 6 May 2016 a member of the Specialist Appeals Team settled a Rule 24
    response opposing the appeal.  In summary, it was  contended  that  the
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had  directed  himself  appropriately.
    In the event that the appellant was to make an application from abroad,
    it would be open to him to adduce evidence to demonstrate that  he  was
    the victim of a scam  and  therefore  his  application  should  not  be
    refused under the general grounds for refusal.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

18. At the hearing before me, Mr Abbas explained that a  number  of  people
    had been the victims of fraud perpetrated by  Amita  Solutions,  and  a
    group of  them  were  pursuing  statutory  appeals  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse to grant
    them leave to remain.  Upon further inquiry, it became apparent that  a
    distinguishing feature in their cases was that they  had  informed  the
    Home Office that they were victims of fraud before the Home Office made
    a decision on their respective applications.  Mr Abbas agreed that  the
    appellant had not relied on such a claim when varying his  application.
    He submitted that this was not fatal, as the evidence  put  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  showed  in  retrospect  that  the   exercise   of
    discretion by the Secretary of State was flawed.  He relied on the case
    of Aliu and Another [2014] EWHC 3919 (Admin), a decision of Judge Grubb
    sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge.

Discussion

19. It appears that the case advanced before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by
    appellant's Counsel was solely that the decision appealed  against  was
    not in accordance with the law.  There was however no evidential  basis
    for this case, as there was no attempt to prove that the  Secretary  of
    State was aware at the date of decision that the appellant was claiming
    to be an innocent victim of fraud.  All the  Secretary  of  State  knew
    when making the decision was that the certificate of sponsorship  which
    had been relied on in support of the previous Tier  2  application  was
    false.  In the circumstances, there was nothing in the  decision  under
    the Rules which the Secretary of State wrongly  took  into  account  or
    wrongly omitted to take into account.  Similarly, when the Secretary of
    State went on to consider whether there are  exceptional  circumstances
    to justify discretion being exercised in the appellant's favour outside
    the Rules, there was nothing  which  the  Secretary  of  State  wrongly
    omitted to take into account.  In order for the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to be unlawful, the Secretary of State had to be in possession
    of the relevant information at the time of making the decision.  So  no
    error of law is disclosed by the judge rejecting Mr Uppal's  submission
    that the decision was not in accordance with the law.  On the contrary,
    this was the only finding that was open to the judge  on  the  evidence
    that had been put before him.

20. Mr Uppal made it clear the appellant was  not  pursuing  an  Article  8
    claim either under the Rules or outside the Rules.  Accordingly, it was
    open to the judge not to make a finding on the question of whether  the
    appellant was complicit in the false certificate of sponsorship on  the
    ground that it was immaterial.  It was immaterial because, even if  the
    appellant's evidence was accepted, it did not retrospectively convert a
    lawful immigration decision by the Secretary of State into an  unlawful
    one.

21. It was also immaterial for another reason, which is that the  appellant
    did not qualify for leave to remain on private life grounds under  Rule
    276ADE in any event.

22. In short, the judge reasonably exercised discretion in choosing not  to
    make a finding on an issue which he did not need to determine in  order
    to resolve whether the appeal  should  be  allowed  or  dismissed.   As
    submitted in the Rule 24 response,  the  appellant  can  bring  forward
    evidence that  he  was  not  complicit  in  the  false  certificate  of
    sponsorship in any further application which he may choose to make.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
