                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity because there are minors involved.   No  report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  him  or  any  member  of
their family.  This direction applies both  to  the  appellant  and  to  the
respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Brewer  promulgated  on  14th  November  2019   which   dismissed   the
    appellant's appeal from the Secretary of State's decision to refuse his
    human rights claim  and  make  a  deportation  order.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal refused permission to the Upper Tribunal  and  permission  was
    ultimately granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker stating  that  it  was
    arguable that the judge had imported into his assessment of whether  it
    would be unduly harsh upon the children, an assessment of the extent of
    the appellant's criminality.  She  added  "Whether  this  will  make  a
    difference to the outcome is not certain given the evidence before  the
    judge in any event.  In so far as the citizenship of  the  children  is
    concerned, it is for the appellant to  prove  his  case,  not  for  the
    respondent to look for evidence."

    The three grounds of appeal are as follows:

    (1)    The First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  follow  the  Supreme  Court
         judgment in KO (Nigeria) v the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2018] UKSC 53 attaching weight to  the  seriousness  of
         the appellant's offending in making its  assessment  under  Section
         117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  ("the
         2002 Act").

    (2)    The First-tier Tribunal failed to follow  the  Upper  Tribunal's
         decision in CS and Others (Proof of Foreign Law) India [2017]  UKUT
         199 (IAC) in holding that the appellant's children could return  to
         India.

    (3)    The First-tier Tribunal failed to recognise  the  importance  of
         the British citizenship of the appellant's children  and  erred  in
         law in failing to attach any weight to the applicable principles.

    Immigration History

 2. The appellant is an Indian national born on 21st July 1980 and  claimed
    to have entered the United  Kingdom  on  September  2000.   He  entered
    illegally and had remained in the UK without valid leave.  In  December
    2011 he married an Indian national  in  the  United  Kingdom,  but  the
    appellant was then  encountered  on  25th  August  2016,  detained  and
    released with reporting restrictions.  On 23rd June 2017 the  appellant
    was convicted of seven offences - four counts of dishonesty and  making
    false representations to make gain for self/another or  cause  loss  to
    other/expose others  to  risk,  two  counts  of  possessing/controlling
    identity documents with intent and one count of  possessing/controlling
    articles for use in fraud.  On 21st July 2017 he was sentenced  to  two
    years and eight months' imprisonment and did  not  appeal  against  the
    convictions or sentence.

 3. On 1st August 2017, the Secretary  of  State  proposed  to  deport  the
    appellant.  On 6th September 2017 the appellant  made  a  human  rights
    claim.  On 20th March 2019 the  respondent  refused  the  human  rights
    application and made a deportation order.

 4. In his statement of case the  appellant  advanced  that  he  had  three
    children, two who are now British citizens and one,  the  youngest,  he
    submitted was stateless.  His wife worked which meant  that  he  looked
    after the children.  His family relied on him for  support  during  the
    day and he helped the children with their homework.

    First-tier Tribunal Decision

 5. In the First-tier Tribunal decision, the judge recorded at paragraph 12
    that the appellant maintained he was a changed man and had not offended
    since coming out of prison and recorded as follows

         "The appellant said he was a changed man and had not offended since
         coming out of prison.  He said that at the time  he  committed  the
         offences he did not know what he was doing was wrong.  He  said  in
         terms 'I did not know I was committing an  offence'.   He  said  he
         pleaded guilty to the offences because only after he  was  arrested
         did he know that he had done anything wrong.  To put this  evidence
         into context, the appellant was convicted of:

          i) having and using a false  British  birth  certificate  in  his
             name;

         ii) having and using a false Italian driving license in his name;

        iii) a national insurance card in his name for  use  in  connection
             with fraud;

         iv) having and using a false British driving license (obtained  by
             fraud) which he used to open 3  bank  accounts  and  obtain  3
             credit cards;

          v) obtaining a mortgage by fraud."

 6. At paragraph 13 the judge noted the sentencing  remarks  of  the  judge
    which showed that there were a number of aggravating features.  One  of
    the benefits gained was a ï¿½190,000  mortgage.   Judge  Brewer  recorded
    that from both the nature of the offences and  the  sentencing  judge's
    remarks that the appellant did know that he was acting  illegally  from
    the outset of his criminality which "stretched over a period of some  8
    years commencing in 2008".

 7. In relation to any fear of returning to India owing to persecution,  Mr
    Malik in his submissions said this was simply not plausible and he  was
    not relying on it.

 8. The judge set out paragraph  23  of  KO  (Nigeria)  which  specifically
    states in relation to Section 117 is that the public  interest  in  the
    deportation of foreign criminals:

         "One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond  what  would
         necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation of
         the parent.  What it does not require in my view  (and  subject  to
         the discussion of the cases in Page  11  the  next  section)  is  a
         balancing of relative levels of severity of the  parent's  offence,
         other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn  by  the  section
         itself by reference to length of sentence."

 9. The judge also directed himself as to the test  of  'unduly  harsh'  in
    line with the case of MK (Sierra Leone) [2015] UKUT 223.

10. The judge's factual findings were as follows:

      1) The appellant was less than honest about his relationship with  his
         children.  At first, the  appellant  and  his  wife  suggested  the
         children could not speak Punjabi but that, it then transpired, that
         the appellant has little English and  the  children  therefore  did
         speak Punjabi and in the circumstances the judge  found  it  highly
         unlikely that the appellant assists the  two  older  children  with
         their homework, which is in English.  [Paragraph 26].

      2) Considering the children's best interests, the two  older  children
         are aged 8 and 6;  both attended school, lived with  their  parents
         and had friends.  The youngest was 2 and not at  school  but  lived
         with his family.  The children were deprived of  their  father  for
         around fourteen months when he was in prison,  and  throughout  his
         criminal offending career the  appellant  ran  the  risk  that  his
         children could be deprived of his presence if he  was  apprehended.
         Nevertheless, on the basis of the evidence  before  him  the  judge
         concluded that it was in the best  interests  of  the  children  to
         remain with their parents.

      3) At paragraph 29 the judge stated:

             "The  issue  therefore  is  whether,  if  the  appellant  were
             deported there would be  unduly  harsh  consequences  for  the
             children.  In my view there is nothing preventing family  life
             continuing in India.  I see no reason why the appellant's wife
             and children would not and could not return to India with him.
              They all speak Punjabi, and  although  there  would  be  some
             disruption to the children's education, the fact is their best
             interests are a primary, but not the only concern, and in  all
             the circumstances I cannot find that the consequences for them
             would be unduly harsh."

      4) The judge then went on at paragraph 30 to state:

             "I take into account the significant weight to be given to the
             public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals and in
             that context, I note that the appellant's offending history is
             in fact a history of serious offending and, as I have found, a
             lack of remorse.   He  has  maintained  his  account  that  he
             thought his behaviour was 'innocent' until his criminality was
             pointed out to him notwithstanding the crimes for which he was
             convicted (which includes  the  relevant  mens  rea)  and  the
             judge's sentencing remarks that he was aware of his  offending
             throughout."

      5) At paragraph 31 the judge observed

             "I also  note  here  that  there  was  no  suggestion  by  the
             appellant that beyond the question of whether his  deportation
             would be unduly harsh on his children,  there  were  no  other
             very compelling circumstances in his case."

      6) The judge recorded a key submission made by the appellant that  the
         appellant's Counsel chose to concentrate on the key aspect of  this
         case which is Exception 2 in Section 117C of the 2002 Act in  short
         "He says it would be unduly harsh on the children if the  appellant
         was deported".

      7) The judge's assessment  of  that  submission  for  the  purpose  of
         Section 117C(5) is found at paragraphs 20 to 40 under  the  heading
         Discussion.   The judge stated:

             "I take into account the significant weight to be given to the
             public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals and in
             that context, I note that the appellant's offending history is
             in fact a history of serious offending and, as I have found, a
             lack of remorse.   He  has  maintained  his  account  that  he
             thought his behaviour was 'innocent' until his criminality was
             pointed out to him notwithstanding the crimes for which he was
             convicted (which includes  the  relevant  mens  rea)  and  the
             judge's sentencing remarks that he was aware of his  offending
             throughout."

11. Ground 1 of the appeal asserted that  this  was  inconsistent  with  KO
    (Nigeria) when making the assessment under Section 117C(5).  The  judge
    was obliged to disregard the seriousness of  the  appellant's  criminal
    offending.

12. In terms of Ground 2 the appellant has three children who do  not  hold
    Indian citizenship.  The judge found that in his view there was nothing
    preventing him forming  a  continued  life  continuing  in  India.  The
    Secretary of State produced no evidence as to India's domestic  law  to
    support her case that the children will be permitted to enter or reside
    in India with the appellant.  In the absence of such evidence the judge
    was obliged to find that relocation to India was not possible.

13. In CS and Others (Proof of Foreign Law) held that "The content  of  any
    material foreign law is a question of fact normally determined  on  the
    basis of expert evidence."  The Secretary of State's  case  in  CS  was
    that the family could return to India and the Upper Tribunal in  CS  at
    paragraph 22 noted that the Secretary of State sought to  persuade  the
    panel that the effect of the  Indian  immigration  laws  was  that  the
    family would at some unspecified date, be reunited on Indian soil.

14. The judge should have found, in line with   CS  and  Others  (Proof  of
    Foreign Law), in the absence of any evidence on  India's  domestic  law
    adduced by the Secretary  of  State  that  the  main  pillar  that  the
    Secretary of State sought justify (family could be reunited  on  Indian
    soil) was devoid of foundation.  The  burden  of  proof  under  CS  and
    Others (Proof of Foreign Law) was on the Secretary of State.  The judge
    misunderstood the position.  It was  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    justify the interference with the rights protected under Article 8.

15. Ground 3 argued that  the  British  citizenship  of  the  children  was
    particularly relevant to assessing whether they should leave the United
    Kingdom with a parent who had no  right  to  be  in  this  country,  ZH
    (Tanzania) v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 AC
    166 paragraph 32  and  Zoumbas  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] UKSC 34.  It was a complete failure on  the  part  of
    the judge to appreciate the importance of the  British  citizenship  of
    the appellant's children.  The  judge  held  that  the  children  might
    return to India but failed to have regard to the loss of  benefits they
    might endure.  The appellant accepts British citizenship  was  [not]  a
    trump card but failure to attach due weight amounted  to  an  error  of
    law.

16. The Secretary of State in her Rule 24 notice response  to  the  grounds
    submitted that the judge had  directed  himself  appropriately  and  in
    accordance with NA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 662 and KO (Nigeria); the
    judge did consider the unduly harsh test but then moved on to  consider
    the wider assessment.  The key aspect of the case was Exception  2  and
    Section 117C(5).  In relation to the evidence on settlement in India it
    was not clear this point was taken. On the issue of British citizenship
    and the relationship between the appellant and his children, the  judge
    on the findings would have found that it would not be unduly harsh  for
    the children to remain in the UK without the appellant.

17. At the hearing before  me,  Ms  Cunha  accepted  that  the  judge  when
    considering whether it was unduly harsh for the children to relocate to
    India had referred  to  the  appellant's  offending.   She  resubmitted
    however that it was not material.

    Analysis

18. The Judge set out KO (Nigeria) but failed to apply that authority.  The
    Judge proceeds seamlessly, when considering the undue harshness of  the
    appellant's  children  relocating  to  India  at  [29],  to  include  a
    consideration of the  appellant's  'offending  history'  at  [30];  his
    finding  is  cited  at  10(7)  above.  The  juxtaposition  of  the  two
    paragraphs shows the Judge unquestionably imported a  consideration  of
    'offending history' into his consideration of 'unduly harsh'; he stated
    so in terms. That is a material error of law.   What  the  Judge  might
    have done under Section 117C(5) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002  with  regards  the  consideration  of  the  children
    remaining in the United Kingdom, separated from the appellant, was  not
    explored by him.

19. With regard the ability  to  settle  in  India  it  is  for  the  party
    asserting the fact to prove it.  The analysis, however, did not address
    the question of the children remaining in the  United  Kingdom  without
    the appellant.

20. Further,  I pointed out that  the  judge  had  failed  to  address  the
    question of the British citizenship and its relevance  and  importance'
    when considering the removal of the family  from  the  United  Kingdom,
    further to Patel (British citizen  child  -  deportation)  [2020]  UKUT
    00045.   Ms Cunha agreed that that was indeed material and  I  consider
    that to be a sensible concession particularly as the  Judge  failed  to
    consider  the  children  remaining  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  thus
    separation from  the  appellant.   She  requested,  however,  that  the
    findings on credibility be maintained.

21. Mr Malik submitted that the decision overall  legally  flawed  accepted
    the credibility findings might be maintained.

22. I find material errors of law for the reasons given above and set aside
    the conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal decision save for the  parts
    preserved as indicated.

23. I have considered the evidence given  and  although  I  set  aside  the
    conclusions of the decision, I preserve  the  record  of  the  evidence
    given from 9 to 18 on to the findings made by the judge  and the record
    of the submissions made by Mr Malik thereon.

24. I find that there are relevant and important findings  which  have  not
    been made in respect of the children removing to India or indeed to  be
    remaining in the United  Kingdom  without  the  appellant,  further  to
    Section 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    and for that reason and because  of  the  nature  and  extent  and  the
    findings to be made, this matter should be remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
