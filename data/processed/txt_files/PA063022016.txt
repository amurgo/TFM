Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Harleen Masih (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chohan, promulgated on 19th December 2016, following the  hearing
    at  Birmingham  Sheldon  Court  on   9th   December   2016.    In   the
    determination,  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,
    whereupon the Appellant subsequently  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.





The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 2. Mr Mills conceded on behalf of the Respondent that, as indicated in the
    Rule 24 response dated 14th March 2017, the Respondent Home Office  did
    not oppose  the  Appellant's  application  for  permission  to  appeal.
    However, the Rule 24 response was to the effect that the Respondent now
    invites the  Tribunal  to  determine  the  appeal  with  a  fresh  oral
    (continuance) hearing to solely  consider  whether  the  Appellant  can
    relocate to Baghdad taking into account, for example,  that  he  is  of
    Kurdish  ethnicity,  cannot  speak  Arabic,  and   has   converted   to
    Christianity.

 3. Mr Mills, on the other hand, now proposed that the background  evidence
    about the safety  of  Christians  in  Baghdad  was  such  that  it  was
    reasonable to assume that if he were to be returned there,  that  given
    his lack of support, he will  be  targeted  and  be  at  risk  of  ill-
    treatment as  a  Christian.   The  issue,  therefore,  is  whether,  if
    returned to Baghdad, he can then make his way from there  to  the  IKR,
    which is the autonomous Kurdish  governed  area  of  Iraq,  which  does
    provide essentially for many minorities, including Christians, where it
    was arguable that the Appellant may be safe.

 4. In addition,  argued  Mr  Mills,  it  was  also  conceivable  that  the
    Appellant may well be able to return to his  home  area  in  the  Mosul
    Province, which was jointly administered both by the IKR and  with  the
    Iraqi government,  so  that  the  Makhmour  District,  from  where  the
    Appellant came, may well also additionally be safe  for  him,  although
    there was an issue here of his being in difficulty on  account  of  his
    father's activities.

 5. What was  clear,  however,  was  that  the  issue  could  not  just  be
    determined on the basis of whether the Appellant could be  returned  to
    Baghdad, because even the seminal case of AA (Article  15(c))  Iraq  CG
    [2015] UKUT 544 makes it clear that, provided one can  be  returned  to
    Baghdad, it is a relatively straightforward matter,  to  then  take  an
    internal flight at a cost of some 100 dollars directly from Baghdad  to
    the IKR (see paragraph 80 of AA.  Given that  part  of  the  relocation
    package offered by the British government is that a returnee  would  be
    given ï¿½1,500, the Appellant would have the financial means to make that
    journey from Baghdad to the IKR.

 6. For her part, Ms Masih submitted that the Rule 24 response had conceded
    that the Appellant's appeal was not being opposed and that the Tribunal
    was  being  invited  to  determine  the  appeal  with  a   fresh   oral
    (continuance) hearing.  The sole purpose of this was to decide  whether
    the Appellant could be relocated to Baghdad.  What  Mr  Mills  was  now
    asking for was much more extensive than that, submitted Ms  Masih.   In
    order to go into those matters,  it  may  well  be  necessary  for  the
    Appellant to call expert evidence to show whether it was  feasible  for
    him to relocate to the IKR as a Christian Iraqi.

 7. As for the issue regarding whether the Appellant could  return  to  his
    own home area in the Makhmour District of the province  of  Mosul,  the
    judge below had made no findings of fact  as  to  whether  this  was  a
    matter that would pose a risk  to  the  Appellant  given  his  father's
    activities there because it was the Appellant's case that he  would  be
    subject to attacks if he were to return to his own area.

 8. The effect of the Rule 24 response being now departed from was  to  put
    Ms Masih in an invidious position because this was not  the  case  that
    she had come to argue.  If one were to go with  the  Rule  24  response
    alone, then, given that Mr  Mills  had  conceded  that  the  background
    evidence was compelling that Christians would be at  risk  in  Baghdad,
    then the Appellant would succeed in this continuance hearing.  An added
    complication, however, was that there was no interpreter present at the
    hearing, so that the Appellant could not give evidence in  relation  to
    these wider issues that Mr Mills was bringing to bear upon the Tribunal
    today.

Conclusions and Reasons

 9. I accept that the effect of Mr Mills' submissions today  is  to  depart
    from the Rule 24 response of the Respondent  Secretary  of  State,  and
    that this puts Ms Masih in  an  untenable  position,  with  regards  to
    proceeding with the hearing today.  It is clear,  on  the  other  hand,
    that  Mr  Mills  concedes  that  there  is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    determination below, and I make such a finding myself because there was
    no specific decision reached in the Tribunal below as  to  whether  the
    Appellant would be  at  risk  in  his  home  town  on  account  of  the
    activities of his father.  There is also an error in the  finding  that
    the Appellant was able to relocate to Baghdad because such a conclusion
    gave insufficient regard to the objective evidence as to risks faced by
    Christians in Baghdad.  The Appellant is in a doubly difficult position
    in this respect also if he cannot speak Arabic, has  no  family  there,
    and has no documentation.  The issue  then  is  whether,  as  Mr  Mills
    contends, the Appellant can go to the IKR on a short  internal  flight,
    and for this evidence must be heard and Ms Masih must be given adequate
    notice to be able to prepare the appeal from this perspective.

10. Accordingly, I give the following directions.  First, that this  matter
    not be listed before the First-tier Tribunal for at least six weeks  to
    enable consideration to be given to whether or not an expert report  is
    to be commissioned  in  relation  to  relocation  to  the  IKR  of  the
    Appellant.  Second, a Kurdish Sorani interpreter  is  to  be  provided.
    Third, the normal skeleton arguments are to be furnished in  a  timeous
    manner.  Finally, the hearing is to be set aside for two hours.

Notice of Decision

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the  extent
    that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal with no findings of fact
    preserved.

12. No anonymity direction is made.
