                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal against the decision of an adjudicator,  Mr
   D M Wynn-Simpson, sitting at Cardiff  on  25  June  2004,  allowing  the
   appeals of two citizens of Iran, husband and wife,  against  refusal  of
   visas as returning residents.  The  grounds  of  appeal  relate  to  the
   interaction of paragraphs 18 and 19 of the rules.  As the grounds  point
   out, the discretionary exception in paragraph 19:

   A person who does not benefit from the  preceding  paragraph  by  reason
   only of  having  been  away  from  the  United  Kingdom  too  long,  may
   nevertheless be admitted as a returning resident if for example, he  has
   lived here for most of his life.


    relates only to the requirement at paragraph 18(2) that the person "has
   not been away from the United Kingdom for more than two years". It  does
   not relate as has  often  been  pointed  out  by  the  Tribunal  to  the
   requirement that that person should have "had indefinite leave to  enter
   or remain in the United Kingdom when he last left".


2. The immigration history in this case, so far as relevant, is as follows.
    The husband arrived in 1978, and on 1 July 1988 a letter was issued  to
   him by the Home Office, granting him indefinite leave to remain  in  the
   following terms.


   ... there are no longer restrictions on the period in which you remained
   in the United Kingdom.  Your passport which is enclosed has been stamped
   to show this.    You can now remain indefinitely in the United  Kingdom.
   ...  As a visa national, you still need a visa every time you enter  the
   United Kingdom and you may be refused entry if  you  do  not  have  one.
   You may get a re-entry visa  at  any  British  Passport  in  the  United
   Kingdom or at a British Embassy High  Commission  or  Consulate  abroad.
   [There is then a reference to the requirements of paragraph 18(2) of the
   rules:]  If you leave the  United  Kingdom  you  will  normally  be  re-
   admitted at any time within 2 years of your departure.


   That letter was still in force, in  the  sense  that  it  had  not  been
   cancelled or withdrawn, at the time that the husband and wife left  this
   country on 16 May 1993. It is not clear that there was any such grant to
   the wife; but all concerned have  worked  on  the  assumption  that  her
   status followed his.

3. This appeal turns on the claimants' subsequent  visit  to  this  country
   between July 2000 and  July  2003.    That  visit  was  undertaken  with
   limited  leave  only:  the  reasons  for  that  are  discussed  in   the
   explanatory statement, on the second page: unfortunately, the paragraphs
   are not numbered.   However, those reasons can only be relevant  to  the
   exercise of discretion under paragraph 19, and not to  the  question  of
   whether there is an absolute bar  to  their  re-admission  as  returning
   residents under paragraph 18(1).

4. The evidence from that passport page produced shows that the husband  at
   least was re-admitted on 29 July 2000, with 6 months' leave,  apparently
   as a visitor.   The wife had certainly no better leave than he did;  and
   the original grant of  indefinite  leave  was  addressed  to  him  only.
   They both left in July 2003 and the positions of the two  sides  are  as
   follows.  Mr Warburton says that nothing had happened to bring the grant
   of indefinite leave (at least to the husband, made on 1 July 1988) to an
   end.  It follows that, although he was re-admitted in 2000, as a visitor
   only according to the stamp on his passport, in  law  the  position  was
   that his indefinite  leave  continued;  and,  on  the  occasion  of  his
   departure in July 2003, he must be  regarded  as  a  person  still  with
   indefinite leave.

5. Miss Gill on the other hand points to the terms of the letter of 1  July
   1998, to which we have already referred, and  to  the  actual  basis  on
   which both husband and wife were re-admitted in 2000-2003.  This  appeal
   turns solely on the question of law as to which of them is  right  about
   the true construction of paragraph 18(1) of the Rules, as applied to the
   claimant's last visit to this country.

6. There is a superficial attraction in Mr  Warburton's  argument,  on  the
   basis that indefinite leave, "without restrictions" as  the  letter  put
   it, means exactly what it says, and continues until it is brought to  an
   end.   However, clearly paragraphs 18 and 19 of the  rules  have  to  be
   read together; and decision-makers are directed to consider the position
   under paragraph 18(1) as  it  was  when  the  claimant  last  left  this
   country.  If Mr Warburton is correct, then the  reference  to  "when  he
   last left" is completely superfluous. Clearly the immigration  rules  do
   not fall to be construed as precisely as a statute; but still  we  ought
   to make sense of them if we can.

7. What is clear is that a person who gets indefinite leave  in  the  terms
   that the husband did in this case does so  on  the  basis  that  he  can
   remain in this country for as long as he wants, with no restrictions  at
   all.  (There are means of bringing such grants of leave to an  end;  but
   we are not concerned with them in this  case.)  However,  the  grant  of
   indefinite leave is clarified further on in the letter,  with  reference
   to what may happen if the claimant leaves this country.   He is  clearly
   given notice, in the paragraph we have read out, that he will  "normally
   be be re-admitted at any time within two years of his departure".   That
   as we have said accurately reproduces the provisions of paragraph 18  of
   the Rules.

8. What then is the position of someone  who  does  not  seek  re-admission
   within two years of his departure?   Plainly  he  has  to  rely  on  the
   discretionary provisions of paragraph 19.   In our view it  cannot  then
   be said that the leave which he once had is still  to  be  described  as
   indefinite.  It is subject to the clear restriction imposed by paragraph
   19, if to nothing else. (We shall have to leave for another occasion the
   question as to what might happen if somebody, within two  years  of  his
   departure with indefinite leave, made  an  intermediate  visit  to  this
   country with only limited leave; but we do not at present see why anyone
   should do that, at least if returning for settlement).

9. Our view is that a person who at  one  point  had  indefinite  leave  to
   remain in this country, but did not seek re-admission within  two  years
   of last being here on that basis, could no longer be said to be a person
   with indefinite leave to remain when he revisited the  country  on  some
   other basis.   That is this case, so far as the  husband  is  concerned,
   and a fortiori in the case of the wife. It follows  that  the  claimants
   were not persons who had indefinite leave to enter  or  remain  in  this
   country when they last left it in July 2003.  The  adjudicator  was  not
   entitled to consider the case  under  the  discretionary  provisions  of
   paragraph 19, and the Home Office appeal must be allowed.
