Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. V. Aning, Immigration Advisory Service
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Ms  Donkor  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Kainth,  promulgated  on  4  July  2017,  in  which  he
    dismissed Ms Donkor's appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse her  application  for  leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "The grounds assert that the Judge erred in that his assessment  of
         proportionality was flawed in that he focused on the refusal  under
         paragraph  320(11)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  should   have
         considered whether this justified permanent exclusion.


         At paragraph 21 the Judge found that  given  the  passage  of  time
         since the behaviours in issue "the respondent would  no  longer  be
         able to cite paragraph 320(11)".  Given  that  this  was  the  only
         basis for the refusal of entry clearance it is  arguable  that  his
         assessment of the proportionality of the refusal was flawed."


         The grounds disclose arguable errors of law."

 3. The Sponsor attended  the  hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives.  I stated that I found that the grounds were made out,
    and that the decision involved the making of a material error  of  law.
    I set the decision aside to be remade.

Error of law

 4. In what is, as accepted by Mr. Nath, a slightly confusing decision, the
    Judge found at [21] that:

         "In my assessment of  the  evidence,  and  in  consequence  of  the
         passage of time, the respondent would no longer  be  able  to  cite
         paragraph 320(11)."

 5. There was no cross appeal by the Respondent, and  consequently  it  was
    accepted by Mr. Nath that the finding that the application  should  not
    have been refused by reference to paragraph 320(11) stood.

 6. It is not in dispute  that  this  was  the  only  basis  on  which  the
    application was refused.  The notice of  decision  is  clear  that  the
    suitability, relationship, financial and English-language  requirements
    of Appendix FM of the immigration rules were  all  met.   Having  found
    therefore  that  the  application  should  not  have  been  refused  by
    reference to paragraph 320(11), the Judge had found that the  Appellant
    met the requirements of the immigration rules for  entry  clearance  as
    the spouse.

 7. At [22] onwards the Judge considers Article 8.  At [26] he states:

         "Before I consider proportionality itself, I must  examine  whether
         there is justification for  the  decision  appealed.   I  begin  by
         considering this in light of the public interest considerations set
         out in Section 117A and Section 117B of the 2002  Act  as  amended.
         The maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the  public
         interest and therefore refusing entry to a person who albeit  meets
         the requirements of the Immigration Rules has provided  no  grounds
         to suggest that Article 8 should be invoked  in  their  favour,  is
         sufficient reason and justification for exclusion."

 8. The Judge has given no  reasons,  nor  cited  any  authority,  for  his
    finding that  this  is  the  case.   There  is  no  indication  in  the
    immigration rules or elsewhere that an applicant  has  to  do  anything
    more than meet the requirements of the immigration rules  in  order  to
    gain entry clearance.  An application made under Appendix FM is made on
    the basis of family life, Article 8.

 9. At [29] the Judge turns to consider proportionality.  It was  submitted
    in the Rule 24 response that the Judge was entitled to  find  that  the
    personal circumstances  did  not  outweigh  the  need  for  the  public
    interest to be upheld "given the Appellant's  previous  conduct".   The
    Rule 24 response referred to [29].

10. There is no consideration at [29] of the Appellant's previous  conduct.
    The Judge has dealt with the issue of the Appellant's previous  conduct
    in his consideration of paragraph 320(11).  He has found that paragraph
    320(11) is not relevant to the Appellant's application.  He deals  with
    the circumstances of the Sponsor at [29], not the Appellant's  previous
    conduct.  Paragraphs [30] and [31], which contain the remainder of  the
    proportionality assessment, equally do not deal  with  the  Appellant's
    conduct.  The Judge has considered only the Sponsor's situation.

11. At [30] the Judge quotes from the case of Mostafa (Article 8  in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC), where it states that  an  Appellant's
    ability to satisfy the rules "is capable of being a weighty, though not
    determinative,  factor  when   deciding   whether   such   refusal   is
    proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control".

12. At [31] the Judge states "The Appellant meets  the  requirements  under
    the immigration  rules  as  a  partner.   That  is  considered  by  the
    Respondent within the reasons for refusal  letter."   Although  he  has
    only just quoted from a case  which  states  that  this  is  a  weighty
    factor, he has given no weight at all to the fact  that  the  Appellant
    meets the requirements of the immigration rules.  Immediately he  turns
    again to consideration of the Sponsor's ability to relocate to Ghana.

13. I find that the Judge has erred in failing to give any weight at all in
    the proportionality assessment to the fact that the Appellant  met  the
    requirements of the immigration rules, as conceded by  the  Respondent.
    He had found that the Respondent was wrong to apply paragraph  320(11),
    but he has given no weight to the fact that the Appellant has satisfied
    of the requirements necessary to be granted entry clearance.

14. The Judge has failed to give any weight to the fact that the  Appellant
    met the requirements of the immigration rules.  While he  has  referred
    to section 117B, he has not considered section 117B(2) and  117B(3)  in
    relation to  the  Appellant's  English-language  skills  and  financial
    independence.  He has purported to consider section  117B(1),  but  has
    not made any reference  to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    requirements of the  rules  stipulated  by  the  Respondent  for  entry
    clearance.

15. I find that the Judge has erred in his consideration of Article  8.   I
    find that this is a material error of law.

Remaking

16. I have considered the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 in  accordance
    with the steps set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  It  was  accepted  by
    the Respondent in the notice of decision that  the  Appellant  met  the
    relationship requirements of the immigration rules.  I  find  that  the
    Appellant and Sponsor lived as unmarried partners in the United Kingdom
    about seven years prior to her removal  to  Ghana.   I  find  that  the
    Sponsor has visited the Appellant in Ghana annually  since  her  return
    there.  I find that the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  have  a  family  life
    sufficient to engage the operation of  Article  8.   I  find  that  the
    decision would interfere with that.

17. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.

18. In carrying out the proportionality exercise, I adopt  the  finding  of
    Judge Kainth, which was not opposed by Mr. Nath, that  the  Appellant's
    application should not have been refused with  reference  to  paragraph
    320(11).  The Appellant's application was not refused with reference to
    the  suitability  requirements.  The  Respondent  accepted   that   the
    Appellant met the requirements  of  the  immigration  rules  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse.

19. I have also taken into account the factors set out in section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act, insofar as they are relevant.  Section  117B(1)  provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.  Given that the  Appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules, there will be no compromise of  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls by a grant of entry clearance.

20. The Respondent accepted that the  Appellant  met  the  English-language
    requirements of Appendix FM (117B(2)).  The  Respondent  also  accepted
    that the Appellant  met  the  financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM
    (117B(3)).  Sections 117B(4) to (6) are not relevant.

21. I have taken into  account  that  this  is  the  third  time  that  the
    Respondent has refused an  application  made  by  the  Appellant  under
    paragraph 320(11).  It has now been  found,  and  accepted,  that  this
    paragraph is not relevant to the Appellant's  application.   Therefore,
    there being no further requirements under  the  immigration  rules  for
    entry clearance as a spouse, I find that there is no public interest in
    the continued exclusion of the Appellant.

22. Taking into account all of my findings above, given that the  Appellant
    meets the requirements of the immigration rules, as was accepted by the
    Respondent in her decision, I find  that  the  balance  comes  down  in
    favour of the Appellant, and the decision is not proportionate.  I find
    that the Appellant has shown on the balance of probabilities  that  the
    decision is a breach of her rights, and those  of  the  Sponsor,  to  a
    family life under Article 8.

23. I do not make an anonymity direction.

Decision

24. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.

25. I remake the decision, allowing the Appellant's appeal on human  rights
    grounds, Article 8.  The Appellant meets the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM for entry clearance as a spouse.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal, I  have  considered  whether  to  make  a  fee
award.  The Respondent refused the application with reference  to  paragraph
320(11), as she had done on two previous occasions.  She accepted  that  the
requirements of the immigration rules for entry clearance as a  spouse  were
met.  The decision quotes from a decision of the  Tribunal  from  2011,  and
while stating that "all of the circumstances" of the application  have  been
taken into account, refused the application with reference to  the  concerns
"as previously indicated".  The  Respondent's  decision  is  dated  February
2016, a considerable amount of time after the Tribunal decision.   There  is
not on the face of the Respondent's  decision  any  consideration  of  these
circumstances or  these  concerns.   It  was  found  by  Judge  Kainth  that
paragraph 320(11) could not be relied on "in consequence of the  passage  of
time".  This has been accepted by the Respondent.  In  the  circumstances  I
make a fee award for the full amount paid, �140.
