1. Each application on  behalf  of  the  respondent  for  the  section  108,
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, 2002  procedure  to  be  invoked
   must be decided on its own merits.
2. Immigration Judges should first consider  whether  it  is  being  alleged
   that the document concerned  is  a  forgery,  or  whether  it  is  simply
   asserted that it is a document which cannot be relied upon (Tanveer Ahmed
   [2002] UKIAT  00439*).
3. Applications must be heard in camera, in the  absence  of  the  appellant
   and the appellant's representatives.
4. The Home Office Presenting Officer should be ready to identify  precisely
   what documents the respondent contends are forged and the evidence  which
   it is claimed relates to the detection of the forgery and which is to  be
   the subject of the section 108 application.  Explaining why disclosure of
   this evidence would be contrary to the public interest.
5. A careful note should be taken by the judge.  The respondent may,  if  he
   wishes to, withdraw the allegation and in doing so withdraw the  evidence
   relied upon.
6. Clear evidence will be  necessary;  if  RP  (Proof  of  Forgery)  Nigeria
   [2006] UKAIT 00086 is not satisfied, then the application will fail.
7. If the judge grants the application, he  should  say  so  in  public  and
   clearly identify which document or documents or  other  evidence  is  the
   subject of the section 108 application.



Representation:
For the Appellant:         Miss T Fajobi, the appellant's sponsor
For the Respondent:             Mr R De Kerbrech, Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is the reconsideration of a  determination  of  Immigration  Judge
    Field, promulgated on 2nd May, 2007,  following  a  hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross on 30th April, 2007, in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal
    against the decision of the respondent, taken on 22nd  November,  2006,
    to refuse to grant entry  clearance  to  the  appellant  as  a  working
    holidaymaker.

2.   In the respondent's Notice of Decision  of  22nd  November,  2006,  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the appellant:


        (i)  had the means to pay for his return or onward journey;
        (ii)      was able and intended to maintain and accommodate himself
             without recourse to public funds; and
        (iii)     intended to leave the United Kingdom at the  end  of  his
        working holiday.


3.   In a review of the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  by  the  Entry
    Clearance  Manager,   the   Entry   Clearance   Manager   referred   to
    'verification reports' in respect of a bank statement from United  Bank
    for Africa Plc (UBA) and for First Bank, produced and relied on by  the
    appellant, in which both statements were said to contain  discrepancies
    such that it proved that the statements were  forgeries.   The  use  of
    such documents was said by the Entry Clearance Officer to undermine the
    intentions of the appellant.

4.    In  his  determination,  Immigration  Judge  Field  acceded   to   the
    Presenting  Officer's  application  pursuant   section   108   of   the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  ("the  Act")   that
    disclosure of the verification report would be contrary to  the  public
    interest  and  should  be  considered  by  the  judge  in  private.  He
    investigated the allegations in  private  and  concluded  that  he  was
    satisfied that the respondent had shown that the  bank  statement  from
    UBA and First Bank were not genuine.

5.   On the basis of that finding, Immigration Judge  Field  concluded  that
    the  appellant's  reliance  upon   those   documents   undermined   his
    credibility and also his asserted intention to leave the United Kingdom
    at the end of his working holiday.   Judge Field was not satisfied that
    the appellant intended to take up employment only as an incidental part
    of a working holiday and was not prepared to accept the evidence of the
    sponsor's financial circumstances. He  concluded  that  he  could  not,
    therefore, be satisfied that the appellant was able to maintain himself
    without recourse to public funds.

6.   Lengthy grounds were submitted by barristers and  solicitors  based  in
    Nigeria.  In making the order for reconsideration,  Senior  Immigration
    Judge Gill said in her order of 13th June 2007:

        'Paragraph 7 of the determination  confirms  that  the  Immigration
        Judge acceded  to  the  request  made  by  the  Presenting  Officer
        pursuant to section 108 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
        Act 2002, for the Immigration  Judge  to  investigate  the  forgery
        allegation in private.


        It is arguable that this gives rise to  a  procedural  irregularity
        amounting to an error of law.  In reaching this decision, I rely on
        the following separately and cumulatively:


        (a)  that the record of proceedings does  not  appear  to  indicate
             that the Immigration Judge recorded the proceedings in private,
             nor is there any indication that he recorded his reasoning  for
             reaching his finding that the bank statement was  not  genuine.
             The effect of the procedure the Immigration Judge  has  adopted
             (if upheld as permissible and not wrong in  law)  is  that  his
             finding is not subject to any judicial scrutiny;


        (b)  that the Immigration Judge may have erred in law by failing to
             consider whether it was necessary to exclude  the  sponsor  who
             had attended on the appellant's behalf, as well as the  public.
             Rule  54(2)(b)  of  the   Asylum   and   Immigration   Tribunal
             (Procedure) Rules 2005, gave the Immigration Judge a discretion
             to exclude a party or a representative.  It  is  arguable  that
             the discretion must be exercised judicially.   The  failure  to
             consider whether the discretion should be exercised and to give
             reasons (to the extent one is able to do so), arguably  amounts
             to an error of law;


        (c)  that it appears that the appellant was not given  notice  that
             this procedure would be invoked.   It is arguable that this  is
             important in entry clearance cases, because a sponsor  may  not
             have been "briefed" on what to say in  the  event  of  such  an
             application.    Accordingly,  it  may  be  arguable  that   the
             appellant has not had a fair opportunity to make  arguments  to
             the Immigration Judge.  Although it would have  been  necessary
             for the appellant to advance his arguments in ignorance of  the
             evidence, and arguments to  be  advanced  on  the  respondent's
             behalf during the private investigation, this is arguably not a
             reason to deny him the  opportunity  of  making  his  arguments
             nevertheless.'

7.   The sponsor appeared before us unrepresented  and  explained  that  she
    was the appellant's  aunt.   She  also  confirmed  that  she  had  also
    appeared before Immigration Judge Field.

8.   Mr De Kerbrech confirmed that  there  had  been  an  application  under
    section 108 of the Act by the Presenting Officer  appearing  before  Mr
    Field.   The sponsor agreed and confirmed that she was asked  to  leave
    the hearing for a short while by the judge.

9.   We explained, in simple terms, the effect of the provisions of  section
    108 to the sponsor.  She  confirmed  that  she  understood.   She  also
    confirmed that the appellant had been to the United Kingdom on at least
    one and possibly two previous occasions.

10.  We pointed out to the Presenting Officer that section 108  of  the  Act
    relates to a document which, it is alleged, is a forgery.  But,  having
    read the respondent's Notice of Decision, the Tribunal were not able to
    find any allegation of forgery contained within  it.   Mr  De  Kerbrech
    accepted that there  was  no  allegation  within  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's Notice of Decision of 22nd November, 2007.

11.  We explained to the sponsor that we first wished to  hear  from  Mr  De
    Kerbrech with his submissions on whether or not it  is  in  the  public
    interest for the verification report to be considered by us in private.
     We asked her  to  leave  whilst  we  heard  the  Presenting  Officer's
    submissions.

12.  We passed a copy of the verification report to Mr De  Kerbrech,  having
    read it ourselves.  We asked him why it is not in the  public  interest
    that the document should be disclosed.  He agreed that there is nothing
    in the report that is, in itself secret, but suggested that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer would not wish to advertise the fact that  there  are
    anomalies within the bank statements, which mean that  they  cannot  be
    relied on as being genuine.  We asked the Presenting  Officer  to  note
    that the information being  used  within  the  verification  report  is
    information which is within the public domain; it is  simply  that  the
    information is not widely known.

13.  We invited the sponsor to rejoin  the  hearing  and  we  explained  the
    nature of the submissions that we had heard.  We told her that we  were
    now going to hear arguments on whether or not the documents in question
    were forgeries and asked her to leave us again.

14.   The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  it  was  implied  that  the
    documents submitted could not be relied  on  as  being  genuine,  as  a
    result of checks  made  by  a  forgery  officer.   On  that  basis  the
    documents are, he submitted, forgeries.

15.  Having examined the  documents  in  question  and  carefully  read  the
    verification report, we pointed out to Mr De Kerbrech that we would  be
    in some difficulty in saying that the documents in question should  not
    be disclosed in the public interest and that  in  the  absence  of  any
    expert evidence, we believed that the  Immigration  Judge  had  made  a
    finding which was not open to him to make.  He gave no reasons for  his
    findings.   And a further difficulty which appeared to us was that  the
    judge appeared to accept the evidence of  the  Forgery  Officer  as  to
    Nigerian tax law, despite the fact that the  Forgery  Officer  did  not
    make any claims to be knowledgeable on  issues  of  Nigerian  law.   We
    enquired whether  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  might  wish  to  take
    instructions on whether the evidence in question should be withdrawn.

16.  We invited the sponsor to rejoin the hearing and explained to her  that
    as a result of  submissions  we  have  received,  we  had  invited  the
    Presenting Officer to take instructions.

17.   We  adjourned  briefly  to  enable  Mr  De  Kerbrech  to  take   those
instructions.

18.  Following resumption of the hearing, the  Presenting  Officer  told  us
    that he did not, any longer, rely on the verification report and wished
    to withdraw it.

19.  We explained the significance of this to the sponsor and told her  that
    we would take both of the bank statements into account in deciding  the
    appeal before us.  The sponsor told us that the appellant would come to
    the United Kingdom to live with her, at least initially.  She explained
    that she worked as a child protection officer with families with mental
    health problems for Essex County Council, earning  �26,000  per  annum.
    She lives with her partner and one child.  She has two  other  children
    who are at boarding school in Uganda.  Her partner is  a  photographer.
    She owns the family house in which they live.

20.   The  sponsor  explained  that  she  would  support  and  maintain  the
    appellant until he was able to obtain work. He wanted to travel  within
    the United Kingdom and has been to the United Kingdom on, she believed,
    at least two previous occasions.   He has stayed at her home before and
    has just completed university in Nigeria.  He is now embarking  on  his
    National Youth Service.  The sponsor  confirmed  that  she  had  modest
    savings of some �7000.

21.  We reserved our determination.

22.  In the Entry Clearance Officer's Notice of Decision of  22nd  November,
    2006, the Entry Clearance Officer gives as his reasons, the following:

        'You have little idea about the likely costs of  travelling  around
        the UK for the time you propose. You have been unable  to  describe
        what type of incidental employment you would seek or how you  would
        obtain it.   I am not satisfied you  are  genuinely  seeking  entry
        clearance to the UK in  the  spirit  of  the  working  holidaymaker
        scheme which leads me to further doubt you  will  ultimately  leave
        the UK at the end of any period of leave granted to you.


        You have failed to provide satisfactory evidence of your ability to
        maintain and accommodate in the United Kingdom the  United  Kingdom
        without recourse to public funds.  Neither have  you  satisfied  me
        that you have the means to pay for your return or onward journey.


        You have submitted a WEMA bank statement in your mother's name  and
        a UBA bank statement in your  name  to  support  your  application.
        Anomalies and inconsistencies  in  this  document  has  led  me  to
        conclude on the balance of probabilities that the  document  cannot
        be relied upon as satisfactory evidence of your or  your  sponsor's
        circumstances here in Nigeria. This therefore leads me to doubt you
        are genuinely seeking entry to the UK as a working holidaymaker and
        that you will ultimately leave the UK at the end of  your  proposed
        holiday.

        You have not submitted satisfactory evidence to support your claims
        concerning your family circumstances in Nigeria and  that  of  your
        sponsor.  In the absence  of  this  information,  I  am  unable  to
        establish whether or not you are a genuine working holidaymaker who
        intends to leave the UK at the end of your visit.'

23.  The Presenting Officer who  appeared  before  Immigration  Judge  Field
    made application for an investigation into the allegation  relating  to
    the UBA bank statement to be conducted in private pursuant  to  section
    108 of the 2002 Act.

24.  Section 108 provides as follows:

        "108. Forged documents : Proceedings in Private:

             (1)   This section applies where it is alleged -


                  (a)      that a document relied  on  by  a  party  to  an
                       appeal under section 82, 83 or 83A is a forgery, and


                  (b) that a disclosure to that party of a matter  relating
                       to the detection of the forgery would be contrary  to
                       the public interest.


             (2)   The Tribunal


                    a) must investigate the allegation in private, and
                    b) may proceed in private so far as necessary to prevent
                       disclosure of the matter referred  to  in  subsection
                       (1) (b)."

25.  Rule 51 (6) and (7) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)
    Rules, 2005, (the Rules) provides that:
             "(6) In an appeal to which section 85(5) of the 2002 Act
             applies, the Tribunal must only consider evidence relating to
             matters which it is not prevented by that section from
             considering.
             (7) Subject to section 108 of the 2002 Act, the Tribunal must
             not take account of any evidence that has not been made
             available to all the parties."
     So that the Tribunal may consider only the  circumstances  appertaining
    at the time  of  the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse,  namely  22nd
    November, 2006.

    And 54(4) of the Rules provides that:


        "The Tribunal may also, in exceptional circumstances,  exclude  any
        or all members of the public from any hearing or part of a  hearing
        to ensure that  publicity  does  not  prejudice  the  interests  of
        justice, but only  if  and  to  the  extent  that  it  is  strictly
        necessary to do so."

26.  Section 108(1) (b) of the Act makes it clear  that  the  section  deals
    with the detection of forgery.  In RP (Proof of Forgery)  [2006]  UKIAT
    00086, the Tribunal emphasised that any allegation of forgery  must  be
    proved by the person making the allegation.  The standard to which  the
    allegation must be proved  is  the  civil  standard  of  a  balance  of
    probabilities but, due to the seriousness of the matter in issue, it is
    at the upper end of the scale.  Whether the  document  in  question  is
    proved to be a forged document will have to be decided on the  evidence
    as presented in the case as a whole.  It will not be determined  solely
    on the basis of the evidence (if any) which shows whether the  document
    is a forged one.  Even if the allegation of forgery is not proved, this
    will not be the end of the matter because the appellant will still need
    to prove that the requirements of  the  rules  are  satisfied,  on  the
    balance of probabilities.

27.  These general  principles  apply  in  cases  in  which  the  respondent
    invokes the section 108 procedure.

28.  However the general requirements  of  fairness  require  that  evidence
    considered by the Tribunal should be made available to both parties who
    should both have a proper opportunity to address the  Tribunal  on  it.
    That principle is, of course, also embodied  in  Rule  51  (7)  of  the
    Tribunal's Procedure Rules.  The procedure provided for in section  108
    of the Act is a departure from a very important  principle.   Any  such
    departure should not be agreed to lightly by Immigration Judges.

29.  On the other hand, there is a need to ensure that the disclosure  to  a
    party of a matter relating to the detection of a forgery should not  be
    made public if it would be contrary to the public interest  to  do  so.
    It is only if the disclosure of such evidence relating to the detection
    of forgeries is kept private, that the respondent is likely  to  adduce
    such evidence.  If, for example, the respondent is given information by
    informants about particular forged documents being used in a particular
    application, then the respondent may understandably wish to ensure that
    the informant's identity is  not  revealed  and  that  neither  is  any
    information  revealed  which  would  lead  to   the   informant   being
    identified.  The identity of the informant would clearly be  "a  matter
    relating to  the  detection  of  the  forgery".   The  desirability  of
    ensuring that:

         -    informants are protected in order to protect their safety;
         -    the respondent's methods of detection are protected;  as  well
    as
         -    ensuring that the sources of information do not dry up;


    are sufficient to satisfy the public interest element  in  section  108
    (1) (b) of the Act. The section 108 procedure is not, of course, solely
    limited to the protection of identity of informants; it can  relate  to
    any "matter relating to  the  detection  of  the  forgery"  and  it  is
    important that this be borne in mind.

30.  Immigration Judges must consider  each  request  for  the  section  108
    procedure to be invoked on its own merits.

31.  Where an application is made under section 108 of  the  Act,  then  the
    Immigration Judge should explain to the appellant's representative that
    this means that the application will have to be heard in the absence of
    the appellant and the  appellant's  representatives.   The  Immigration
    Judge should then explain that before reaching his  decision,  he  will
    bear in mind the importance of the general principle that all  evidence
    considered by the Tribunal should be made available to both parties and
    that the section 108 procedure  represents  a  departure  from  a  very
    important principle.  Any  representations  which  representatives  may
    wish to make should be heard by the Immigration Judge  at  this  stage,
    although  it  will,  understandably,  be   very   difficult   for   the
    representative to  make  any  meaningful  representations  without  any
    knowledge  of  the  basis  of   the   application.    The   appellant's
    representatives should then be invited to withdraw  from  the  hearing.
    The next  part  of  the  hearing  should  be  taken  in  camera,  on  a
    provisional basis; at least until the Immigration Judge decides whether
    or not to accede to the request to involve the section 108 procedure.

32.  During the  proceedings  which  are  held  in  camera,  the  Presenting
    Officer should be  ready  to  identify  precisely  what  documents  the
    respondent contends are forged and the information  or  evidence  which
    relates to the detection of the forgery which the  respondent  requests
    should be the subject of  the  section  108  procedure  and  should  be
    withheld from the appellant and why disclosure of this  matter  to  the
    appellant would be contrary to the public interest.  A  careful  record
    of these proceedings should be taken by the Immigration Judge  so  that
    there can be judicial scrutiny of the process and  of  the  Immigration
    Judge's decision on the application.

33.  If, having heard submissions, an Immigration Judge decides to grant  an
    application to invoke the section 108 procedure, he should  say  so  in
    camera and again in public after reopening the hearing to  the  public.
    He should explain that he has decided to grant the application, because
    there was evidence about a matter or matters relating to the  detection
    of forgery which it  would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest  to
    disclose.  The appellant should  be  told  clearly  which  document  or
    documents are the subject of the section 108 application.   Immigration
    Judges should, at this stage, avoid reaching any concluded view  as  to
    whether the document in question is forged, because that should only be
    assessed after all the evidence has been given and  submissions  heard.
    It is, therefore, unlikely that an  Immigration  Judge  would  be  able
    properly to form a view as to whether the documents  are  forged  until
    after the hearing has concluded.  The  parties  should  be  invited  to
    address the Immigration Judge in the alternative.

34.  In his written determination,  the  Immigration  Judge  should  clearly
    explain that he has been requested by  the  respondent  to  invoke  the
    section 108 procedure.  Obviously  it  would  be  undesirable  for  the
    Immigration Judge to explain in the determination  the  nature  of  the
    evidence relied on by the respondent and which is the  subject  of  the
    section 108 procedure and his reasons  for  granting  the  application.
    However, in order to ensure that the judge's consideration of the issue
    itself is subject to judicial scrutiny, the  Immigration  Judge  should
    disclose as much as he feels properly able to do in the  determination.



35.  It  is  suggested  that  (either  as  an  addendum  to  the  Record  of
    Proceedings,  or  as  a  separate  part  of  it,  clearly  headed  "The
    respondent's section 108 application - not  to  be  disclosed")  judges
    should describe fully the application made, the document  or  documents
    which are alleged to  be  forgeries,  the  precise  matter  or  matters
    relating to the detection of  forgery  which  is  the  subject  of  the
    section 108 procedure and the reason or reasons why the  disclosure  of
    the matter or matters to the appellant would be contrary to the  public
    interest.  The Immigration  Judge  should  also  explain  whether  this
    evidence was relevant to his overall decision on the appeal and, if so,
    to what extent.

36.  It should be remembered that in all cases there does need to  be  clear
    evidence:  if the respondent cannot, or for whatever reason  does  not,
    adduce evidence which can satisfy the higher standard applicable,  then
    an application under section 108 will fail.  If a report, for  example,
    relies  on  something  within  a  document  adduced  on  behalf  of  an
    appellant, that would need  to  be  proved  by  the  giving  of  expert
    evidence, then it would be wrong for the Immigration  Judge  to  assume
    that the forgery expert is an expert on other matters  as  well,  apart
    from the detection of forged documents.

37.  Immigration Judges must take care to ensure that the  strength  of  the
    evidence on which the respondent  seeks  to  rely,  and  which  is  the
    subject of the section 108 procedure, is not  relied  on  in  order  to
    decide whether to grant the application.   It  may  be  that  what  the
    respondent seeks to withhold from the  appellant  is  of  such  dubious
    reliability that it is unlikely to be of any great  value  in  deciding
    whether the document relied on by the appellant is a  forgery  or  not,
    but the respondent may still wish to avoid disclosure  of  material  or
    information.  For example, a particular informant might  be  unreliable
    or he or she may not be in a position to give evidence as to whether  a
    document is forged or not.  The respondent may, nonetheless, still wish
    to conceal the identity of the informant.  Not to  do  so  would  deter
    other informants and in  such  cases  an  Immigration  Judge  would  be
    entitled to grant the application to invoke the section  108  procedure
    to protect the information, whilst still proceeding  to  determine  the
    appeal before him on the  ground  that  the  high  standard  which  the
    respondent had to discharge,  in  order  to  prove  the  allegation  of
    forgery, was not met.

38.  If on the other hand, the  Immigration  Judge  decides  to  refuse  the
    application to invoke the section 108 procedure, then he should  reopen
    the hearing to the public and announce his decision, for reasons to  be
    given in his written determination.   The  appellant's  representatives
    should then be made fully aware of the nature of  the  application  and
    the basis upon which it was made before the hearing proceeds.  All  the
    material which was disclosed to the Immigration Judge during the closed
    session should then be disclosed to  the  appellant,  unless  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer seeks to withdraw his allegations (or part of
    them) in order to preserve the confidentiality.  However, the mere fact
    that the material is not the subject of the section 108 procedure  does
    not mean that it cannot be relied on by the  respondent,  nor  does  it
    mean that the value of the evidence is  reduced.   The  fact  that  the
    section 108 procedure is not being used simply means  that  the  public
    interest requirement in preventing disclosure is not satisfied. It does
    not mean anything else.

39.  We have concluded that, faced with an  application  by  the  Presenting
    Officer, Immigration Judge Field should first have  considered  whether
    it was being alleged that the document  concerned  was  a  forgery,  or
    whether it was simply be asserted that the document could not be relied
    upon (see Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439*).

40.  We find that  Immigration  Judge  Field  materially  erred  in  law  in
    finding himself satisfied, in respect of each bank statement, that  the
    respondent had shown that the bank statement was not genuine.   He  did
    not have any expert evidence before him on which he could reach such  a
    conclusion.  He was relying on evidence from the forgery  officer,  who
    was himself purporting to give expert evidence on a matter outside  his
    knowledge of expertise.

42.  The appellant's application was under  Paragraph  95  of  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395, as  amended.   This  provides  as
    follows:

         "Requirements for leave to enter as a working holidaymaker

             95. The requirements to be met by a person  seeking  leave  to
             enter the United Kingdom as a working  holidaymaker  are  that
             he:
                  (i) is a national  or  citizen  of  a  country  listed  in
                  Appendix 3 of these Rules, or a British Overseas  Citizen;
                  a British  Overseas  Territories  Citizen;  or  a  British
                  National (Overseas); and
                  (ii) is aged between 17 and 30 inclusive or was so aged at
                  the date of his application for leave to enter; and
                  (iii)    (a) is unmarried and is not a civil partner, or
                      (b) is married to, or the civil partner of, a  person
                      who meets the requirements of this paragraph and  the
                      parties to the marriage or civil  partnership  intend
                      to take a working holiday together; and
                  (iv) has the  means  to  pay  for  his  return  or  onward
             journey, and
                  (v) is  able  and  intends  to  maintain  and  accommodate
                  himself without recourse to public funds; and
                  (vi) is intending only to take employment incidental to  a
                  holiday, and not to engage  in  business,  or  to  provide
                  services as a professional sportsperson, and in any  event
                  not to work for more than 12 months during his stay; and
                  (vii) does not have dependent children any of whom  are  5
                  years of age or over or who will  reach  5  years  of  age
                  before the applicant completes his working holiday; and
                  (viii) intends to leave the UK at the end of  his  working
             holiday: and
                  (ix) has not  spent  time  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a
                  previous working holidaymaker entry clearance; and
                  (x) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance,  granted
                  for a limited period not exceeding 2 years, for  entry  in
                  this capacity."
43.  The appellant's application was refused under sub-paragraphs (iv),  (v)
    and (viii) of paragraph 95  of  Statement  of  Changes  in  Immigration
    Rules, HC 395, as amended.  However, when one takes  into  account  the
    fact that the appellant has visited the United Kingdom on two occasions
    previously and there is no suggestion that he failed to comply with the
    requirements of his visa on those two occasions and that at the date of
    the Entry Clearance Officer's decision, the appellant had  in  his  UBA
    account a balance of 292,162.58 Nigerian Naira, in addition to the  sum
    of 2,014,345.92 Naira in his Wema Bank account, then it is clear  that,
    with the  sponsor  providing  accommodation  for  the  sponsor  on  his
    arrival, he does meet all of the requirements of Paragraph 95.
44.  For the reasons we have set out above, we find that  Immigration  Judge
    Field did materially err in law in his determination and we  substitute
    our decision for his: this appeal is allowed.

              This appeal is allowed
