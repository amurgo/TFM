Representation:

For the Appellant:     No Appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 22 November  1986.   He
    appealed against the decision of  the  respondent  dated  7  July  2016
    refusing to grant him a residence card as  an  extended  family  member
    (unmarried) of an EEA national in accordance with Regulation 8  of  the
    Immigration EEA Regulations 2006 as amended.

 2. The appeal was heard by Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Colvin  on  23
    August 2017 and dismissed  for  want  of  jurisdiction  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 25 August 2017.  The case was  dismissed  based  on  the
    case of Sala [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC).


 3. The Sala decision has been found to be wrong and permission  to  appeal
    was granted by Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Swaney  on  1  February
    2018.  This states that in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal
    in Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755  the  grounds  disclose  an  arguable  and
    material error of law in the Judge's decision.


 4. There was no Rule 24 response.


 5. There was no appearance by the appellant or  a  representative  on  his
    behalf.  Neither did his sponsor and partner Miss Justyna Zycka appear,
    however the Presenting Officer submitted that there is a material error
    of law as a result of the decision in the said case of Khan.   He  also
    submitted that as there has been no decision  to  remove  there  is  no
    human rights appeal.


Decision


 6. As the case of Sala has been overturned the appellant's claim  requires
    to be re-heard as this has resulted in there being a material error  of
    law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision,  promulgated  on  25  August
    2017.


 7. I direct that this claim is remitted to the First-Tier Tribunal for re-
    hearing and that Judge Colvin's decision promulgated on 25 August  2017
    must be set aside.  None of its findings are to stand other than  as  a
    record of what was said on that occasion.  It is appropriate  in  terms
    of Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case  to  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  for  an  entirely  fresh
    hearing.


 8. Members of the First-Tier Tribunal chosen to consider the case are  not
    to include Judge Colvin.


 9. Anonymity has not been directed.
