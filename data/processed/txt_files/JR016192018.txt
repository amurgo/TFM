                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
Anonymity Order

Pursuant to Rule 14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
2008, I order that unless the Upper Tribunal or a Court  directs  otherwise,
no report of these proceedings or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
disclose or identify any document, information  or  matter  likely  to  lead
members of the public to identify the applicants or  either  of  them.  This
order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure  to  comply  with
this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

JUDGE GLEESON:    The applicants, a 17 year old Eritrean man and  his  aunt,
a British citizen of Eritrean origin, have been granted permission  to  seek
judicial review of  the  respondent's  ongoing  failure  to  make  a  lawful
decision and/or admit the applicant to  the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance
with his rights under the  Dublin  III  Regulation  and/or  Article  8  ECHR
and/or the respondent's policy.

 2. The principal applicant is referred in  the  application  for  judicial
    review throughout as the applicant.  No remedy is sought on  behalf  of
    the  second  applicant,  either  in  the  grounds  for  review  or  the
    application form itself.  For clarity, in this judgment I refer to  the
    principal applicant as such, and to the second applicant as 'the  aunt'
    or 'his aunt'.


Background


 3. The following account emerges from the documents before me.   There  is
    no direct record  of  the  principal  applicant's  account.   What  the
    Tribunal has is a proof of evidence recorded in witness statements from
    Hamish Arnott, his solicitor (there is no evidence that  the  principal
    applicant has approved it or read it in his own language); the  history
    he gave  to  Helen  Cusack  O'Keeffe,  an  independent  social  worker,
    recorded in her report; and the French age assessor's interview record.




 4. These documents show that the principal applicant,  a  young  man  from
    Eritrea, has consistently told the French authorities and his solicitor
    that he was orphaned very young and  brought  up  by  his  grandmother,
    along with his younger brother, who is still in Eritrea.   He  has  had
    about 5 years' schooling and can write Tigrinya, but speaks hardly  any
    English or French. In 2015, the principal applicant  left  Eritrea  and
    travelled  up  through  Africa,  across  the  Sahara,  and  across  the
    Mediterranean, reaching Europe by way of Italy, then travelling  on  to
    France and the Calais camps, where he set about  trying  to  reach  his
    aunt in the United Kingdom.


 5. The most direct account we have of the  principal  applicant's  reasons
    for his journey was given in the French age assessment interview on  21
    March 2017, when the applicant said he left Eritrea to  avoid  military
    service and that he had always intended to join  his  aunt  (a  British
    citizen of Eritrean origin)  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  aunt  had
    supported him and his brother by  sending  money  to  his  grandmother,
    after her half-brother  (the  principal  applicant's  father)  and  his
    mother had both died.  The  applicant  produced  a  medical  card  from
    Eritrea with a birth date of 14 September 2000  which  would  make  him
    almost 18 years old now.


 6. In October 2016, the French  authorities  forcibly  closed  the  Calais
    camps, and all those who appeared to  be  unaccompanied  asylum-seeking
    children were taken into care and looked after at special reception and
    orientation centres for  unaccompanied  minors  across  France  (Centre
    d'Accueil et d'Orientation pour  Mineurs  Isolï¿½s,  hereafter  'CAOMI').
    The principal applicant was placed in a CAOMI in Grambois, near Aix  en
    Provence in southeast France.


 7.  The  United  Kingdom  authorities  sent  teams  of   caseworkers   and
    interpreters to the CAOMIs, to identify children with relatives in  the
    United Kingdom for possible admission.  This expedited process resulted
    in very brief decisions, communicated by the United Kingdom authorities
    to the French authorities in the form of  a  spreadsheet,  and  by  the
    French authorities to the children, orally.  The children who were  not
    admitted became disappointed, upset and unruly in the CAOMIs:  many  of
    them left the CAOMIs and headed back to Calais to try crossing  to  the
    United Kingdom again.


 8. A second consideration  of  those  who  were  not  admitted  under  the
    expedited process (the filtration process) took place at the insistence
    of the French authorities, between January and  March  2017,  when  the
    filtration process closed.  In total, approximately 800  children  were
    admitted to the United Kingdom to join relatives here  and  make  their
    claims in the United Kingdom. The principal  applicant  was  not  among
    them.


 9. No reasoned decision was provided to the principal applicant for either
    of  those  decisions.   There  is  no  witness   statement   from   the
    respondent's caseworker who interviewed the principal applicant at  the
    reception centre in Grambois, nor from  the  caseworker  who  made  the
    decisions at the United Kingdom end to refuse him admission  under  the
    expedited process  and/or  the  filtration  process  for  unaccompanied
    asylum-seeking children.


10. There is a statement from Andrew Jones, a  senior  caseworker  and  the
    Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children Lead at the European Intake  Unit
    (EIU), created in June 2016.  The  EIU  deals  with  requests  for  the
    United Kingdom  to  accept  responsibility  for  unaccompanied  asylum-
    seeking children  transferring  from  a  participating  European  Union
    Member State or associated country.  Mr Jones joined the unit  in  July
    2016 and was deployed to France between 10 October 2016 and 25 November
    2016 for Operation Purnia, the expedited process, interviewing first in
    the Calais camp, then as part of the  mobile  interview  teams  in  the
    CAOMIs.  He did not interview this applicant: the  caseworker  who  did
    has left the respondent's employment.


11. Once back  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Mr  Jones  reviewed  and  checked
    caseworker decisions made under the expedited process  and  helped  the
    caseworker tasked with examining  the  principal  applicant's  case  to
    search GCID for the aunt's details.  Mr  Jones  approved  the  decision
    that the principal  applicant  did  not  qualify  under  the  expedited
    process.  His evidence is that the United  Kingdom  caseworker  has  no
    memory of any details about the principal applicant's case.


12. Between October 2016 and March 2017, the applicant  was  treated  as  a
    child by both the French and  United  Kingdom  authorities.   Ms  Julia
    Farman's statement of 1 June 2018  says  that  to  her  knowledge,  the
    aunt's written confirmation that she would be willing for the applicant
    to join her, and her copy passport, never reached  the  United  Kingdom
    authorities,  though  she  recognised  that  the  existence  of   these
    documents appeared on a spreadsheet prepared by  Cameron  Bryson  (from
    whom we have no witness statement):


    "12. On 6 February 2017, documents from  the  first  filter  list  were
    provided to United Kingdom officials by the French officials,  via  our
    United Kingdom French liaison officer  Cameron  Bryson.   Cameron  also
    produced his own internal spreadsheet on 10 February 2018, setting  out
    where we were with documents. ... I acknowledge this spreadsheet refers
    to a passport and letter.  the spreadsheet reflected  what  the  French
    authorities told us would be provided, rather than  what  actually  was
    provided, and copies of the passport for [the principal applicant] were
    never provided."


The date of 10 February 2018 in  Ms  Farman's  witness  statement  must,  in
context, refer to 10 February 2017.


13. Mr Bryson's spreadsheet says under the heading, Review of case  details
    - initial that 'Address and contact number  now  provided';  and  under
    Additional Documentation 'passport and sponsor  letter'.    The  aunt's
    witness statement shows that she did produce both  those  documents  to
    the French authorities when requested. I note that there is no  witness
    statement or contemporaneous note from Mr Bryson about what happened.


14. At [13] in her June 2018 statement, Ms Farman confirmed that on 8 March
    2017,  a  complete  list  of  overall  responses  was  sent  to  French
    officials, reaffirming the respondent's position of 27 January 2017  in
    respect of the principal applicant:


    "...for this case to progress  towards  a  take  charge  request  under
    Dublin III if the child engaged with the French asylum  process.   This
    can be found on the second tab labelled 'French Filter List One and  he
    is at line 110.  This again confirms that there was merit in pursuing a
    take charge request, and also that we  had  received  no  documents  in
    relation to the case."


15.  After  the  respondent's  decision  in  the  expedited   process   was
    communicated to him orally by the  French  authorities,  the  principal
    applicant left the Grambois CAOMI.  He made his way  north-west  across
    France, via Paris, back in the direction of Calais.  In Paris, he lived
    rough for a time.  He had suffered physical abuse on the way and in the
    camps. The principal applicant contracted  tuberculosis  and  pneumonia
    and became extremely ill.


16. On 21 March 2017, the French authorities in the Calais area interviewed
    the principal applicant about his age, with  the  help  of  a  Tigrinya
    interpreter on the telephone.  The principal applicant had stitches  on
    his right eyebrow, which needed monitoring.   The  principal  applicant
    recounted his history before coming to France.  He said that he  was  a
    Muslim, and gave his date of  birth  as  September  2000,  producing  a
    medical card which recorded his date of birth  as  14  September  2000.
    The principal applicant had no birth certificate: he said that  Muslims
    do not have them in Eritrea.


17. The principal applicant told the interviewer that he had  left  Eritrea
    to avoid military service, with the intention of joining  his  aunt  in
    the United Kingdom, and that she was willing  to  care  for  him.   His
    uncle had funded his journey. The aunt had been sending  money  to  his
    grandmother to help with the upbringing of her half-brother's two  sons
    after their parents died.  The interviewer  found  that  the  principal
    applicant had no parental support in French  territory  and  should  be
    considered as an isolated migrant.


18. The  principal  applicant  was  again  unable  to  provide  his  aunt's
    telephone number at that age assessment interview in  March  2017:  the
    interviewer said that 'leaves us  dubious'.   The  principal  applicant
    told the interviewer that he thought that his inability to provide  the
    telephone number was the reason why he had not been  allowed  to  enter
    the United Kingdom under the expedited process.  There were a number of
    other discrepancies which troubled the age  assessor.  The  French  age
    assessor concluded, having interviewed  him,  that  the  applicant  had
    understated his age and assessed him as an adult.


    "When the interview comes to an end, we are facing a person  whose  age
    seems to be clearly reduced, compared to  his  behaviour  and  physical
    appearance.  This claim for protection as a minor represents  his  last
    chance  to  access  the  English  territory.  With  this   stake,   the
    inconsistencies noted in the account of [the  principal  applicant]  do
    not lead to belief in the sincerity of the statement."


19. The Tribunal de Grande Instance in St Omer on 24 March 2017 found  that
    as he was an  adult,  the  principal  applicant  was  not  entitled  to
    educational assistance in France.


20.  The  principal  applicant  was  hospitalised  for  treatment  of   his
    tuberculosis and pneumonia.  He had an operation to remove  fluid  from
    his lungs, and was treated in hospital until he was considered to be no
    longer contagious, on 2 October 2017.  He had lost a lot of weight.


21. After his release from hospital, the principal applicant was once again
    taken into the care of the French authorities and accommodated  at  the
    Hotel Sunset Price in Fouquiï¿½res-les-Bethune in the Pas de Calais.   He
    was placed there by Habitat Insertion (HI), a  French  non-governmental
    organisation which deals with child migrants.  The Hotel  Sunset  Price
    houses 30 child migrants, including the applicant, and about  40  adult
    migrants, whose care is managed by a different organisation, Adomo.  HI
    workers Typhaine Delhaye and Sueva Sevron (neither of whom is, or  ever
    has been, his key worker) filed statements explaining  the  applicant's
    difficulties  with  eating  and  socialising,  and  how  the  principal
    applicant reacted to meeting his aunt at the hostel on 17 April 2018.

22. Until he met his aunt, the principal applicant stayed in  his  room  in
    the dark, and barely ate.  He spoke almost no French  or  English,  and
    did not engage with other staff or residents.  After his aunt's  visit,
    at which  they  were  visibly  delighted  to  meet  and  the  principal
    applicant was very upset when his aunt left, he was  trying  harder  to
    eat and socialise and seemed more hopeful.

23. The principal applicant continues to be treated  for  his  tuberculosis
    and pneumonia under the supervision of the Hospital Centre  in  Calais.
    He is still taking medication and  having  difficulty  in  eating.   He
    continues to lose weight.  His independent social worker, Ms  O'Keeffe,
    says in her report that  the  principal  applicant  has  post-traumatic
    stress disorder and would benefit from being able to rejoin his aunt in
    the United Kingdom.  His aunt remains very willing to have him join her
    here.


Judicial review grounds


24. In their judicial review application,  issued  on  2  March  2018,  the
    applicants sought the following orders and remedies:

 i) An order quashing the respondent's decision to refuse to  transfer  the
    principal applicant to the United Kingdom under 'the  expedited  Dublin
    III process'; and either

     ii) (a)  A mandatory order  requiring  the  respondent  to  accept  the
         principal applicant for transfer to the United Kingdom, communicate
         that decision to the French authorities, and  to  liaise  with  the
         French  authorities  to  arrange  and   facilitate   his   transfer
         forthwith; alternatively

         (b)  A mandatory order that the respondent within 72 hours  take  a
         fresh and lawful decision on whether  the  United  Kingdom  is  the
         responsible Member State under Article 8 Dublin III  (treating  the
         principal applicant as if he is under 18 years old),  and  if  that
         decision is positive, that the respondent  immediately  communicate
         that decision to the French authorities and  liaise  with  them  to
         arrange and facilitate his transfer; and

iii) A declaration that the respondent has breached Article 8 ECHR;

iv) Damages for breach of Article 8 ECHR; and

 v) Further or other relief deemed appropriate by the Upper Tribunal.


Permission to seek judicial review

25. On 16 April 2018, Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede  granted  the  applicants
    permission to seek  judicial  review  of  what  was  described  as  the
    respondent's continuing refusal to transfer the principal applicant  to
    the United Kingdom:

    "(3) ... I grant permission on the basis that the respondent's  failure
    to transfer the  first  applicant  to  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
    expedited  process  was  arguably  unlawful  under  Dublin  III  and/or
    arguably in  breach  of  Article  8  ECHR.   Although  I  have  granted
    permission, the question of the timeliness of the applicant's  judicial
    review claim and whether or not the claim should be admitted, remains a
    matter for determination at the substantive hearing."

Judge Kebede refused the respondent's application for a stay of  proceedings
pending the decisions of the Court of Appeal  in  Citizens  UK  and  AM  and
others, as an order for expedition had been made and it was not  then  known
when the Citizens UK / AM and others judgments would be handed down.

Extension of time

26. Judge Kebede purported  to  reserve  to  the  substantive  hearing  the
    question whether time for seeking judicial review  should  be  extended
    and/or whether there was an alternative  remedy  such  that  permission
    should not be granted.

27. I heard submissions from both parties as to whether it remained open to
    the Upper Tribunal, once permission had been granted,  to  consider  at
    the substantive hearing whether time should be extended.

28. I am satisfied that the correct approach is that  once  permission  has
    been granted, the question of  extension  of  time  as  a  bar  to  the
    substantive hearing of the appeal is settled in the applicant's favour.
     Questions of time and/or alternative remedy go only to the question of
    remedy: it is not possible to grant permission only  conditionally,  as
    Judge Kebede's order seeks to do.

29.  I  therefore  proceed  to  consider  the  substantive  issues  in  the
    applicant's application on 2 March 2018.


Upper Tribunal hearing


30. The applicants' application was heard in the Upper Tribunal over  three
    days, with oral submissions for two days on the applicant's grounds for
    review on 25-26 June 2018 and a further day on 27  July  2018  to  deal
    with an application by the respondent  to  adduce  additional  rebuttal
    evidence, after submissions had closed and I had reserved my  judgment.




31. The lengthy  oral  submissions  at  the  June  hearings,  backed  by  a
    significant quantity of documents, were directed to the fairness of the
    expedited and filtration processes operated by the  respondent  between
    October 2016, when the French authorities forcibly  closed  the  Calais
    migrant camps, relocating any unaccompanied asylum-seeking children  to
    CAOMI hostels around France,  and  March  2017,  when  those  processes
    ended.


32. The 27 July 2018 hearing concerned a further  witness  statement  which
    had been sent to the Tribunal initially without permission, followed by
    an application from the respondent to admit it. At the  hearing  on  27
    July 2018, the respondent also sought to  adduce  a  number  of  emails
    which had not previously been disclosed,  but  could  and  should  have
    been, the respondent's deadline for evidence under the Upper Tribunal's
    directions being 1 June 2018.  I refused to admit the witness statement
    or additional documents, as they  did  not  add  significantly  to  the
    evidence  already  presented  and  I  was  not   satisfied   with   the
    respondent's explanation for the delay.


33. The 27 July 2018 hearing fell just 4 days before the  expected  handing
    down of judgments of the Court of Appeal in  Citizens  UK,  R  (On  the
    Application Of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 1812 and Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  AM  &
    Ors, R. (On the Application of) [2018] EWCA Civ 1815.  Those  judgments
    are determinative of most of the issues in the grounds for review. Much
    of the argument before me in June 2018  has  been  overtaken  by  those
    judgments, and the same applies to the basis  of  the  judicial  review
    grant of permission.


34. I  invited  Counsel  for  both  parties  to  make  written  submissions
    following the Citizens UK / AM and others  judgments  and  I  have  had
    regard to those submissions,  and  to  the  pleadings,  documents,  and
    argument before me at the June hearings, to the extent that it  remains
    relevant to this application now.


The legal framework

35. The applicants assert  that  the  expedited  Operation  Purnia  process
    undertaken between October-December 2016, and the filtration review  of
    that process in January and February  2017,  amount  to  a  Dublin  III
    application by the principal applicant, requiring the United Kingdom to
    consider his international  protection  claims.   Both  processes  have
    ended and no further applications are being accepted.

36. The applicants rely on Article  8  of  Dublin  III  for  the  principal
    applicant's asserted right to admission to the United Kingdom:

         "1.   Where the applicant is an unaccompanied  minor,  the  Member
         State responsible shall be that where a family member or a  sibling
         of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, provided that it  is
         in the best interests of the minor. ...

         2.   Where the applicant is  an  unaccompanied  minor  who  has  a
         relative who is legally present in another Member State  and  where
         it is established, based on an  individual  examination,  that  the
         relative can take care of him or her, that Member State shall unite
         the minor with his or her relative and shall be  the  Member  State
         responsible, provided that it is  in  the  best  interests  of  the
         minor.

         3.   Where family members, siblings or relatives as referred to in
         paragraphs 1 and 2, stay in more than one Member State, the  Member
         State responsible shall be decided on the basis of what is  in  the
         best interests of the unaccompanied minor.

         4.   In the absence of a family member, a sibling or a relative as
         referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2,  the  Member  State  responsible
         shall be that where the unaccompanied minor has lodged his  or  her
         application for international protection, provided that  it  is  in
         the best interests of the minor."

Article 8 Dublin  III  reunification  is  available  only  to  unaccompanied
minors who have lodged an application for international protection.

37.  Article  17(2)  of  Dublin  III  provides  for  discretionary   family
    reunification outside the Article 8 provisions.  Article 17(2) requires
    an application for international protection to have  been  made  in  an
    European Union Member State, followed  by  a  take  charge  request  to
    another Member State:

         "Article 17:  Discretionary clauses

         ...2.    The Member State in which an application for international
         protection is made  and  which  is  carrying  out  the  process  of
         determining the Member  State  responsible,  or  the  Member  State
         responsible, may, at any time before a first decision regarding the
         substance is taken, request another Member State to take charge  of
         an applicant in order to bring together any  family  relations,  on
         humanitarian grounds based in  particular  on  family  or  cultural
         considerations,  even  where  that  other  Member  State   is   not
         responsible under the criteria laid down in Articles 8  to  11  and
         16. The persons concerned must express their consent in writing."

38. The respondent's approach to the exercise of that discretion is set out
    in the Home Office's internal 'Adult Provisions' memo of October  2016,

         "4.  Discretionary
         If there are other family relations, that do  not  meet  the  above
         criteria [relating to joining a spouse, unmarried  partner,  child,
         sibling or parent], and the parties consent, we can use  discretion
         to bring together family on humanitarian grounds.  This can include
         wider  family  relations  including  nephews...  All  parties  must
         consent in writing.  The relevant  Article  in  Dublin  is  Article
         17(2):

         Qualifying example:  An unmarried adult female in France.  She  has
         an uncle and cousins in the United Kingdom.  The uncle  and  female
         in France consent in writing to the transfer taking place, with the
         uncle committing to supporting her.  It is considered that  she  is
         potentially vulnerable, isolated from any  family  members  and  it
         would be in their interests to bring  the  family  together  as  no
         other family members  appear  to  be  resident  in  another  Member
         State."


The circumstances in the qualifying example are very similar to the  factual
matrix of these applicants.


39. In RSM v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 18,
    Lady Justice Arden, with whom  Lord  Justice  Peter  Jackson  and  Lord
    Justice Singh agreed, said this about Article 17 of Dublin III:


         "125.    To conclude, in my judgment, for the reasons given  above,
         it follows that the responsibility of the UK under Article 17.1  is
         not engaged unless an application is lodged in the  United  Kingdom
         by  the  asylum  seeker  in  accordance  with  section  1  of   the
         Immigration Act 1993 and Immigration Rule 327. ...That means  that,
         when the respondents' solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State in
         this case in September 2016, she had then no discretion because RSM
         had not lodged any asylum application within the UK as required  by
         Article 17.1 of Dublin III. That remained the position until  after
         the Upper Tribunal made its mandatory order. Therefore,  there  was
         no discretion available to her to exercise and no basis for holding
         that she had failed to exercise  it.  Moreover,  even  if  she  had
         failed to exercise a discretion, the normal course would have  been
         to remit the matter back to her so that she  could  reach  a  fresh
         decision, and not to make a mandatory order.


         126.          In my judgment, Article 17.2 has no application where
         the responsible member state, that is, the  state  responsible  for
         determining which state should determine the asylum claim, has  not
         issued a TCR."


40. The Court in RSM held that a  mandatory  order  for  admission  to  the
    United Kingdom made by the Upper Tribunal  was  flawed  because  (among
    other things) it was unclear in its terms, as it  was  not  limited  to
    steps  which  the  Secretary  of  State  (the  respondent  in  the  RSM
    proceedings) could take, having regard to the fact that  the  applicant
    was in Italy and under the guardianship  of  the  Italian  authorities.
    Lord Justice Singh in the Court of Appeal in AM  and  others  expressly
    marked his disapproval of the mandatory  admission  orders  (which  had
    been obeyed) concerning those applicants, which he said  were  'wrongly
    made'.


41. The principal applicant does not have the benefit of Section 67 of  the
    Immigration Act 2016 (sometimes called 'the Dubs amendment') which made
    provision for the admission to  the  United  Kingdom  of  a  number  of
    unaccompanied asylum-seeking children within  Europe,  specifically  in
    Greece, Italy and France, whose protection claims had  been  registered
    in Europe before 20 March 2016 and  for  whom  it  was  in  their  best
    interests to  be  resettled  in  the  United  Kingdom  (see  R  on  the
    application of  Help  Refugees  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and Another [2017] EWHC 2727 (Admin), 4 WLR 2013).

42. The principal applicant has yet to register  an  asylum  or  protection
    claim in  France,  and  the  expedited  process  which  took  place  in
    October/November 2016, even if it engaged the  Dublin  III  Regulations
    (which it did not), does not fit the section 67 criteria.


43. The fairness of the expedited and filtration processes, and the  weight
    to be given to information  collected  thereunder,  was  considered  in
    Citizens UK and AM and others, then listed for hearing  in  June  2018.
    Judgment in both those appeals were handed down on 31 July 2018  and  I
    gave the parties an opportunity to make  written  submissions  thereon,
    which I have taken into account in reaching this decision.


The Citizens UK and AM and others judgments


44. The Citizens UK judgment concerned an appeal from the  decision  of  Mr
    Justice Soole in the High Court,  who  had  found  that  the  expedited
    process was 'fair  and  reasonable  and  that  there  was  no  systemic
    failure'. At [282] in his judgment,  Soole  J  qualified  his  finding,
    stating that:


         "282.          My  conclusion   is   subject   to   one   important
         qualification. Since the expedited process was without prejudice to
         Dublin III applications, I consider it must follow that no  account
         should be  taken  in  any  such  future  applications  of  material
         obtained  in  the  course  of  this  expedited  process,  e.g.   of
         inconsistencies in information received. The scope for error in the
         expedited process is  acknowledged.  In  the  absence  of  a  clear
         commitment to that effect I would make an appropriate order."


45. In Citizens UK in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Singh, Lady Justice
    Asplin and Lord Justice Hickinbottom each  expressed  in  robust  terms
    their concern  about  major  omissions  from  the  evidence  which  the
    respondent put before the High Court,  such  that  the  respondent  had
    breached his duty of  candour  to  the  Court  and  Soole  J  had  been
    materially misled.   Singh LJ made the following findings of  fact  and
    law:


         "168.    In my view, there was a serious  breach  of  the  duty  of
         candour and co-operation in the present proceedings. ... I dare say
         this was not deliberate. ... Nevertheless, the effect, even  if  it
         was unintentional, was that significant evidence was not brought to
         the attention of the High Court.  ...


         170. The most serious omission, in my  view,  was  the  failure  by
         those presenting evidence on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  to
         inform the High Court that  the  reason  why  the  reasons  for  an
         adverse decision in the expedited process  were  "sparse"  (to  use
         Soole J's phrase) was not because of the urgency  nor  because  the
         French authorities demanded that (as he thought  and  said  in  his
         judgment) but because the British authorities did not wish to  give
         more reasons and that this was because of a perceived risk of legal
         challenge to the decisions.


         171.     As I have said earlier in reviewing the  main  authorities
         on the duty to act fairly, one of the rationales for that  duty  is
         precisely to permit a person to know whether they  have  any  basis
         for mounting a legal challenge to a decision; and to enable a court
         or tribunal to assess  whether  a  decision  is  wrong.  These  are
         elementary but fundamental  features  of  the  rule  of  law.  They
         explain why reasons for a decision should be given;  they  are  not
         reasons for why they should not be given.


         172.     For those reasons I conclude that:

             (1)  there was a serious breach of the duty of candour and co-
             operation by the Secretary of State in this case; and
             (2)   the  evidence  now  before  this  Court   supports   the
             fundamental submission made by Citizens UK  that  the  process
             adopted in this case was unfair and unlawful as  a  matter  of
             common law."

46. In her concurring judgment in Citizens UK, Lady Justice  Asplin  agreed
    that the respondent's breach of his duty  of  candour  had  been  'very
    serious', that the Court below was  materially  misled,  and  that  the
    breach was aggravated since the relevant evidence only came to light by
    chance  in  other  proceedings.   Lord   Justice   Hickinbottom,   also
    concurring, said at [185]:


         "185.         For the reasons given by my Lord,  Singh  LJ  -  with
         which I entirely agree - in my view, the procedure set  up  by  the
         Secretary of State  to  assess  the  eligibility  of  unaccompanied
         children to be transferred to the United Kingdom so that they could
         be reunited with their close families and their asylum claims could
         be determined here was procedurally unfair  because,  systemically,
         no or no more than inadequate reasons were  given  for  a  negative
         decision. ..."


47. The appropriate remedy for the unfairness of the expedited procedure in
    Citizens UK was declaratory only:  Singh LJ stated at [175] that as the
    Citizens UK application was a generic challenge by  a  non-governmental
    organisation, and the expedited process was now long in  the  past,  no
    other remedy was necessary or  appropriate,  and  both  Asplin  LJ  and
    Hickinbottom LJ concurred.


48. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v AM & Ors,  R.  (On  the
    Application of) [2018] EWCA Civ 1815, handed down on the same day,  the
    same constitution of the Court of Appeal considered  the  Secretary  of
    State's challenge to the Upper Tribunal's decision regarding  a  number
    of  individual  applicants  processed  under  the  expedited/filtration
    process,  who  had  been  admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom  following
    mandatory orders by the Upper Tribunal. The  Upper  Tribunal  had  held
    that the expedited process was unlawful on any or all of  three  bases:
    breach of European Union law, in  particular  failure  to  comply  with
    procedural protections in the Dublin III  Regulations;  breach  of  the
    procedural protections afforded  by  Article  8  ECHR  as  set  out  in
    schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998; and breach of the  common  law
    requirements of fairness.


49. Lord Justice Singh, giving the judgment  of  the  Court,  Lady  Justice
    Asplin and Lord Justice Hickinbottom concurring, allowed the  Secretary
    of State's appeal against the Dublin III and Article  8  findings,  but
    not against the common law fairness argument.  Singh LJ relied  on  the
    finding  of  the  Court   of   Appeal   in   Citizens   UK   that   the
    expedited/filtration process was unfair at common law.   He  set  aside
    the mandatory orders made by the Upper Tribunal to admit the individual
    appellants to the  United  Kingdom  (although  those  orders  had  been
    obeyed), stating that it was important  to  'mark  the  fact  that  the
    orders in these cases were wrongly made as a matter of law'.


50. That is the legal and  jurisprudential  background  against  which  the
    present application must now be considered.


The principal applicant's age


51. One effect of the delay in issuing these proceedings is that on 3 March
    2018, the United Kingdom and French  authorities  had  taken  divergent
    positions on the principal applicant's age:


      1) On 21 March 2017 (almost  a  year  before  these  proceedings  were
         issued), the French authorities assessed the principal applicant as
         having understated his age and that he was an adult,  not  entitled
         to  educational  support  in  France.   The  applicant  failed   to
         challenge that decision within the permitted period of 1  month  or
         at all; but


      2) The United Kingdom authorities accepted the  principal  applicant's
         asserted birth date of 14 September 2000, such that he would remain
         a minor until 14 September 2018.


52. For the purpose of any application of the Dublin III Regulations to the
    principal applicant, the French authorities would not treat him  as  an
    unaccompanied asylum-seeking  child,  following  the  unchallenged  age
    assessment on 21 March 2017 that he is an adult.


Discussion


53. I have had regard to the further submissions received from both parties
    regarding the significance of Citizens UK and AM and others in relation
    to the matters at issue in this application.  The  remedies  sought  by
    these applicants  divide  into  two  groups;  those  sought  under  the
    expedited/filtration process and/or Dublin III; and those sought  under
    Article 8 ECHR.


The expedited/filtration process and/or Dublin III


54. Following the principal applicant's non-admission to the United Kingdom
    under the discredited expedited/filtration  processes,  the  applicants
    seek an order quashing the respondent's decision to refuse to  transfer
    the principal applicant to the United Kingdom  pursuant  to  what  they
    describe as 'the expedited Dublin III process', and either  an  AM  and
    others mandatory order requiring the respondent to accept the principal
    applicant for transfer to the United Kingdom, or a mandatory order that
    within 72 hours the respondent take a  fresh  and  lawful  decision  on
    whether the United  Kingdom  is  the  responsible  Member  State  under
    Article 8 Dublin III (treating the principal  applicant  as  if  he  is
    under 18 years old).


55. In either case, the applicants ask the Tribunal to order the respondent
    immediately  to  communicate  any  positive  decision  to  the   French
    authorities  and  liaise  with  them  to  arrange  and  facilitate  the
    principal applicant's transfer to the United Kingdom for the processing
    of his asylum or humanitarian  protection  application.  The  principal
    applicant cannot make an international protection  application  in  the
    United Kingdom, as he is not here yet (see RSM).


56. The description of the expedited/filtration processes as an  'expedited
    Dublin III process' was decisively rejected by the Court of  Appeal  in
    Citizens UK/AM and others, when it held that  the  expedited/filtration
    processes, with all their procedural inadequacies, were  additional  to
    the Dublin III Regulation and the rights created once an  international
    protection application is made in the host country.   Accordingly,  the
    respondent made no  public  law  error  in  refusing  to  transfer  the
    principal applicant to the United Kingdom on Dublin III grounds.


57. Regarding the application for an  AM  and  others  mandatory  admission
    order, the Court of Appeal has made it clear that those orders made  by
    the Upper Tribunal were wrongly made.  It is not,  therefore,  open  to
    the Upper Tribunal to make a similar order in these proceedings.


58. The application to the Upper Tribunal to order the respondent to make a
    fresh decision, treating the principal applicant as a  child,  pursuant
    to Article 8 of Dublin III, is equally unsound: the  respondent  cannot
    make any such decision until Dublin III has been  triggered  in  France
    (where  the  applicant  has  been  assessed  as  an  adult  under   the
    unchallenged decision on 21 March 2017), and a take charge request  has
    been made and accepted.


59. Article 8 of Dublin III has never been open to the applicants in  these
    proceedings. On 2 March 2018, the unchallenged finding  of  the  French
    authorities was that the applicant was an adult, not  an  unaccompanied
    asylum-seeking child.  The applicant  will  also  become  an  adult  in
    United Kingdom terms on 14 September 2018.


60. The only  Dublin  III  provision  which  has  been  available  to  this
    applicant since 21 March 2017 is  Article  17(2).  There  has  been  no
    change in that situation since the issue  of  these  proceedings  on  2
    March 2018. It remains open to  the  principal  applicant  to  make  an
    application for international protection  in  France.   A  take  charge
    request for family reunification could  then  be  made  by  the  French
    authorities under Article 17(2), once Dublin III had been triggered.


Article 8 ECHR


61. The next question is whether the respondent has breached Article 8 ECHR
    and if so, whether the principal applicant is entitled to  damages  for
    such breach.   This  part  of  the  applicants'  argument  is  set  out
    concisely in the applicants' submissions following Citizens  UK/AM  and
    others:

         "Article 8 ECHR
         13. The Court of Appeal recognised  that  procedural  rights  under
         Article 8 of the ECHR might arise in this context, but that Article
         8 would not give greater rights than those  under  the  common  law
         (ï¿½ï¿½103, 173 CUK). However, in establishing a requirement  to  admit
         through Article 8 ECHR, the "exceptional circumstances" test in ZAT
         (Syria) applied (see ï¿½ï¿½34, 66, 88-89 AM & Others). JMB submits that
         the impact on his mental health of the unfairness in the  expedited
         process and the long delay in resolving it in his  case  caused  by
         the SSHD's  misleading  of  the  Courts  means  he  does  meet  the
         ZAT(Syria) threshold."

62. The respondent's updated submissions on Article 8 ECHR were as follows:

         "ARTICLE 8
         9. In so far as the Claimant seeks to rely  upon  Article  8,  this
         ground of challenge must
         also fail.


         10. First, as affirmed in AM at [88]:

             "... Article  8  will  only  have  a  role  to  play  in  very
             exceptional circumstances. In particular it must be shown that
             the French legal system had systemic deficiencies in it, which
             rendered it incapable of providing an effective remedy to  the
             Respondent children: see ZAT (Syria),  at  para.  95  (Beatson
             LJ); and also the judgments of this Court in  RSM,  at  paras.
             132-144 (Arden LJ) and 173-175 (Singh LJ)."


         There is no evidence before this Court  of  any  "very  exceptional
         circumstances" or "systemic deficiencies" sufficient  to  meet  the
         Article 8 test. On the contrary, the Claimant has  been  aware  for
         some considerable time that he  has  had  the  option  of  claiming
         asylum in France but has declined to do so.

         11. Second, if the Claimant's procedural case fails at  common  law
         it also fails under Article 8. As affirmed in CUK  at  [103]:  "the
         procedural requirement that might arise under Article 8  ...  could
         not give greater rights that the common law in a  context  such  as
         this"."

63. In ZAT, Lord Justice Beatson, with whom Lord Justice Longmore and  Lord
    Justice Moore-Bick agreed, set  out  the  basis  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal at [57] thus:


         "57.   The central ground of appeal has two  limbs.  The  first  is
         that  the  tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  recognise   that   the
         appropriate mechanism  for  a  young,  would-be  asylum  seeker  in
         France, who claims to have family in the United Kingdom and  wishes
         to claim asylum and to join his family is to seek asylum in  France
         and have the claim dealt with by the operation of  the  Dublin  III
         Regulation. The second  limb  is  that  there  is  nothing  in  the
         requirements of ECHR Article 8 that requires the United Kingdom  to
         admit such individuals in the  absence  of  the  operation  of  the
         Dublin III Regulation, and in the absence  of  an  application  for
         entry clearance."


64. At [95], he responded to the Secretary of State's appeal thus:


         "95. I consider that applications such as the ones  made  by  these
         respondents [the appellants before the Upper Tribunal] should  only
         be made in very exceptional circumstances where they can show  that
         the system of the Member State that they do not  wish  to  use,  in
         this  case  the  French  system,  is  not  capable  of   responding
         adequately to their needs. It will, in my  judgment,  generally  be
         necessary for minors to institute the process  in  the  country  in
         which they are in order to find out and be able to  show  that  the
         system there is not working in their case. This is subject  to  the
         point that, as I have  stated,  these  cases  are  intensely  fact-
         specific. There will  be  cases  of  such  urgency  or  of  such  a
         compelling nature because of the  situation  of  the  unaccompanied
         minor that it can clearly be shown that the Dublin  system  in  the
         other country does not work fast enough. The  case  of  the  Syrian
         baby left behind in France when the  door  of  a  lorry  bound  for
         England closed after his mother got onto the lorry referred  to  in
         Mr Scott's fourth statement is an example. But save in such  cases,
         I consider that those representing persons in the position  of  the
         respondents should first seek recourse from the authorities and the
         courts of the Member State in which the minor is. Only after it  is
         demonstrated that there is no effective way of proceeding  in  that
         jurisdiction should they to turn to the authorities and the  courts
         in the United Kingdom."


65. The applicants' approach to ZAT  exceptionality  is  misconceived:  the
    exceptionality there contemplated relates to  the  French  authorities'
    approach to their Dublin III responsibilities and to the processing  in
    France of asylum and humanitarian protection claims.  I  have  seen  no
    evidence upon which an allegation of systemic  failure  in  the  French
    asylum system at the ZAT  (Syria)  level  could  properly  be  founded.
    Indeed, the evidence appears to be that  the  French  authorities  were
    seeking to apply a higher standard of fairness and transparency in  the
    CAOMI centres and the expedited process than the respondent.


66. The difficulty remains that the principal applicant in this application
    has not made any application for asylum or humanitarian  protection  to
    the French authorities, although he has been aware that he could do  so
    since, at the latest, the beginning  of  2017.   Mr  Kellar's  skeleton
    argument summarised the position of the United Kingdom  authorities  in
    relation to a take charge request, should the French  authorities  make
    it:


         "The French authorities indicated to the UK authorities  that  they
         had located contact details for the Applicant's aunt.  In  response
         to the same the UK authorities indicated that a TCR would be likely
         to be successful."


That is an accurate summary of the evidence before  me.   However,  no  take
charge request can yet be made, because the principal applicant has not  yet
made an asylum or  humanitarian  protection  claim  which  could  trigger  a
Dublin III take charge  request  from  the  French  to  the  United  Kingdom
authorities.


67. I remind myself of the respondent's  guidance  on  the  application  of
    Article 17(2) and the qualifying example:


         "Qualifying example:  An unmarried adult female in France.  She has
         an uncle and cousins in the United Kingdom.  The uncle  and  female
         in France consent in writing to the transfer taking place, with the
         uncle committing to supporting her.  It is considered that  she  is
         potentially vulnerable, isolated from any  family  members  and  it
         would be in their interests to bring  the  family  together  as  no
         other family members  appear  to  be  resident  in  another  Member
         State."


The circumstances in that example are strikingly similar  to  those  of  the
principal applicant and the aunt in this application.


68. The aunt and the principal  applicant  were  strangers  until  December
    2016, and met for the first (and only) time in  April  2018.   That  is
    unarguably insufficient to amount to family or private life between the
    adult second applicant and the principal applicant, who  are  aunt  and
    nephew and have never lived together. There was no relationship at  all
    between the principal applicant and his aunt before December 2016, when
    the French authorities contacted her and she says she began telephoning
    him.


69. The respondent's refusal to admit the applicant under the expedited and
    filtration processes is not the reason why a take  charge  request  has
    not yet been made: the reason for that  is  the  principal  applicant's
    refusal to make an asylum or protection claim to the French authorities
    against which Dublin III Article 17(2) can be triggered.


70. The principal applicant, when the respondent made his  decisions  under
    the flawed expedited and filtration processes, was a child  in  France,
    in the care of the French authorities.  He is now a young adult, so far
    as the French authorities are concerned, and on 14 September  2018,  he
    will be an adult in United Kingdom terms also.


71. The French authorities have shown a willingness to provide  appropriate
    care for the principal applicant, both when they considered him to be a
    child, and after March 2017, when they assessed him as  an  adult.   He
    has received care and support, including  hospital  treatment  for  his
    health and specialised  accommodation,  with  counsellors  and  support
    workers who were willing to help persuade him to eat, and to  encourage
    him to integrate socially.  The evidence before me from Ms O'Keeffe and
    the witnesses at the Hotel Sunset Price is that he continues to receive
    medication and treatment from the tuberculosis and  pneumonia  team  at
    Calais Hospital, and that they consider  that  he  would  benefit  from
    rejoining his aunt in the United Kingdom.


72. I find, therefore, that this application also  fails  under  Article  8
    ECHR.


73. For the reasons I have given, the decision of the Upper Tribunal is  as
    follows:

     1) I declare that in the expedited  process,  and  in  the  subsequent
        filtration process, the respondent breached her common law duty  to
        act fairly towards the principal applicant;

     2) I declare that the respondent has not breached European  Union  law
        in relation to the applicants or either of them;

     3) I declare that respondent is not in breach of her obligations under
        Article 8 ECHR towards the applicants, and that no award of damages
        for breach is appropriate;

     4)  I  refuse  the  applicants'  application  for  a  mandatory  order
        directing the respondent, to admit the applicant without his making
        an application for asylum and/or  humanitarian  protection  to  the
        French authorities; and

     5)  I  refuse  the  applicants'  application  for  a  mandatory  order
        directing  the  respondent  to  make  a  further  lawful   decision
        (treating the applicant as a minor) under the  expedited  procedure
        or the filtration process.


     74. All ancillary matters are reserved to the hearing listed on 20
                               September 2018.
