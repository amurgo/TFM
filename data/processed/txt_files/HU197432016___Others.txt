Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr G Lee, Counsel instructed by M Reale Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. There are four appellants in this appeal, all of whom are citizens of
    Brazil.  The first appellant was born on 3 January 1979.  The second
    appellant is his partner who was born on 19 June 1987.  The third and
    fourth appellants are their children who were born respectively on 27
    May 2009 and 21 April 2011.

 2. The appellants are appealing against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Barker promulgated on 29 January 2018 whereby their
    appeals against the decision of the respondent to refuse their
    application to remain on the basis of human rights was dismissed.

 3. The first appellant entered the UK in August 2007.  The second
    appellant entered in December 2007.  The third and fourth appellants
    were born in the UK.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The central issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether it would
    be reasonable (applying Rule 276ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules and
    Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002)
    for the third appellant to be expected to leave the UK and travel to
    Brazil with his parents and sibling, given that he had resided in the
    UK for eight years and seven months.

 5. The judge directed herself that the concept of reasonableness needed to
    be interpreted in line with the Court of Appeal decision in MA Pakistan
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705.  The judge stated at paragraph 33 that

         "The best interests of the child must therefore be the starting
         point and treated as a primary consideration.  49 of the case MA
         states, 'The fact that a child has been in the UK for seven years
         would need to be given significant weight in the prepared
         proportionality exercise for two related reasons.  First, because
         of its relevance in determining the nature and strength of the
         child's best interests; and second, because it establishes as a
         starting point and these should be granted unless there are
         powerful reasons to the contrary.'"

 6. The judge found that it would be reasonable to expect the third
    appellant to leave the UK even though it would be in his best interests
    to remain in the UK.  At paragraph 37 the judge set out her analysis as
    to how this conclusion was reached

         "The appellants have some link with relatives in Brazil and have
         kept contact with Brazilian nationals in the UK.  I do not accept
         that they have lost contact with the way of life in Brazil.  The
         parents have not learned English to any substantial degree and
         still speak Portuguese.  The children were born to parents who had
         remained illegally in the UK, have no status and are not British
         citizens and are nationals of Brazil.  There have been no criminal
         offences committed by the appellants and some supporting letters
         have been provided giving positive comments about the character of
         the appellants.  I accept that the appellants would have no jobs
         and no accommodation but they have demonstrated that they are able
         to resolve such issues in the UK and have relatives in Brazil who
         could possibly provide help.  The adult appellants maintain that
         their relatives could not help but have given no evidence as to why
         this was the case.  The older child is 8� and is at a stage where
         he is capable of adapting to life elsewhere and his social life is
         still dominated by his life with his parents and younger sister.
         He is a little over half way through his primary education and is
         not as at a stage of important exams.  The family have been praised
         for their love and care and support and appear to be a united unit.
          No health issues or other issues have been raised.  Removal from
         the UK would be with parents to a country where there are a number
         of relatives.  The level of contact is uncertain and the evidence
         of the appellants vague.  Whilst the adult appellants have stated
         that they would have no jobs and no accommodation they have worked
         in Brazil previously and rented accommodation in the past.  Taking
         into account all the factors and the fact that some links with
         Brazilian culture and people from Brazil in the UK have been
         maintained I find no reason why it would be unreasonable to expect
         the qualified child together with the younger child to accompany
         the parents back to Brazil".

Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

 7. The grounds of appeal challenge the decision on the basis that the
    judge failed to conduct the analysis of the reasonableness of the third
    appellant leaving the UK "through the lens of the question of whether
    there are powerful reasons to displace the presumption that leave be
    granted in these circumstances."

 8. The grounds state that the judge failed to frame the question of
    reasonableness in the way set out by MA and consequently it is
    unsurprising that there was no indication as to whether the factors
    which are said to support the conclusion that removal would be
    reasonable amount to "powerful reasons".

 9. Before me, Mr Lee argued that the recent Upper Tribunal decision in MT
    and ET (child's best interests; ex tempore pilot Nigeria) [2018] UKUT
    00088 (IAC) shows how the judge has failed to properly consider whether
    there are powerful reasons to justify removal.  He noted that in MT and
    ET the Upper Tribunal stated that they needed to look for "powerful
    reasons" why a child who had been in the UK for so long should be
    removed and concluded that there were no such powerful reasons even
    though her mother committed fraud.  He contrasted the criminal conduct
    of the appellant in MT and ET to the appellant in this appeal, who had
    no such history, and argued that the judge only reached the conclusion
    that removal was reasonable because she failed to ask the right
    question, which is whether there were powerful reasons why the third
    appellant should be removed from the UK.

10. The response of Mr Jarvis was that it is not sustainable to argue that
    the judge failed to consider the case through the lens of whether there
    are powerful reasons as the judge at paragraph 33 of the decision
    clearly directed herself to this consideration.  The decision only
    contains a small quote from MA and that quote is of the paragraph where
    it is stated that there must be powerful reasons.

11. Mr Jarvis argued that the judgment in MA requires that a fact specific
    nuanced approach is taken on a case by case basis to assess whether
    removal is reasonable.  He referred to the assessment in MA at
    paragraphs 61 to 74 of the circumstances of the appellant MA and
    highlighted the similarities to this appeal.

12. With regard to MT and ET, Mr Jarvis argued that to the extent the
    approach in that case differs to MA I am bound by MA.  He also observed
    that MT and ET concerned a teenager aged 14 whose private life was far
    more entrenched than that of the third appellant who was only 8� at the
    time of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Analysis

13. The judge correctly identified the issue in contention, which is
    whether it would be reasonable to expect the third appellant to leave
    the UK.  She also correctly identified that the Court of Appeal in MA
    explained how reasonableness is to be determined and at paragraph 33 of
    the decision (cited above) quoted one of the most significant passages
    from that case.  After accurately setting out the law and summarising
    the relevant recent Court of Appeal judgement, the judge proceeded to
    consider a range of factors relevant to the reasonableness of expecting
    the third appellant to leave the UK, including his family's contact
    with Brazil, his linguistic ability, his stage of education, his age
    and the circumstances he is likely to face on return to Brazil.

14. Having considered the aforementioned factors the judge reached the
    conclusion that there was no reason why it would be unreasonable to
    expect the appellant, accompanied by his parents and sister, to leave
    the UK and reside in Brazil, which is the country of his and his
    family's nationality.

15. The judge has not ignored that the third appellant has lived for over
    seven years in the UK or that this is a powerful reason weighing
    against removal.  On the contrary, the judge explicitly recognised this
    at paragraph 33.  However, the judge has found that it would be
    reasonable to expect the third appellant to leave the UK
    notwithstanding the significance of the time spent in the UK.

16. As highlighted by Mr Jarvis, this is the same conclusion that was
    reached in MA where the factual matrix was broadly similar.  MA
    concerned an eight year old where it was found that the child's life
    was dominated by his parents and younger brother, that his parents
    provide a loving and safe environment, that there were no safeguarding
    issues, that there were no health issues and that the return would be
    to a country where the family have close adult relatives.  I agree with
    Mr Jarvis that if the Court of Appeal in MA found it was open to the
    judge to conclude that removal was reasonable, it is difficult to see
    how it could be unreasonable in this case.

17. I have considered the case of MT and ET.  The stark difference between
    MT and ET on the one hand and this appeal and MA on the other is that
    the third appellant in this case and the child in MA were 8 years old
    at the time of the hearing, whereas the appellant in MT and ET was 14
    years old.  In MT and ET great emphasis is placed on the fact that she
    is 14 and it is stated at paragraph 30:

         "She is well advanced in her education in this country.  As a 14
         year old she can plainly be expected to have established
         significant social contacts involving friends in school and outside
         such as a church.  She has embarked on a course of studies leading
         to the taking of GCSEs".

18. The Upper Tribunal in MT and ET made clear that the age of the child is
    a significant factor, stating at paragraph 31:

         "A much younger child, who has not started school or who has only
         recently done so will have difficulty in establishing that her
         Article 8 private and family life has a material element which lies
         outside her need to live with her parent or parents wherever that
         may be.  This position however changes over time with the result
         that an assessment of best interests must adopt a correspondingly
         wider focus examining the child's position in the wider world of
         which the school will usually be an important part".

19. After hearing this appeal but before promulgation of my decision, the
    judgment of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 was reported. In this
    judgement, the Supreme Court    determined that "reasonableness" must
    be assessed with reference only to the child. This differs to MA, where
    the Court of Appeal found that the conduct of the parents (including
    their immigration history) was a factor to be considered in assessing
    "reasonableness" under Section 117B(6).  I have carefully considered
    whether the decision contains a material error of law because it is not
    consistent with KO. As is clear from the judge's findings at paragraph
    37 (quoted above), having analysed the circumstances of the third
    appellant in the UK and the likely circumstances he would face in
    Brazil, the judge reached the conclusion that it would be reasonable to
    expect him to leave the in the UK in context of his parents also being
    required to leave the UK. Although the judge had regard to the parents'
    immigration history (correctly, at the time, following MA), it is
    clear, when reading the decision as whole (and in particular paragraph
    37) that the decision as to reasonableness did not depend on the
    conduct or immigration history of his parents. The decision was
    therefore consistent with KO and consequently I am satisfied that it
    does not contain a material error of law.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not
contain a material error of law and stands.

No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal and none was
applied for at this hearing.  I therefore do not make an anonymity
direction.
