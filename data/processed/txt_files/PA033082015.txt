Representation:

For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Albania born in the United Kingdom on  [
    ] 1999.  On 13 May 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn  dismissed  his
    appeal against a decision made by the respondent on  17  November  2015
    refusing his claim for international protection.  In his  decision  the
    judge noted that the respondent had accepted that:

    (i)  the  appellant  had  given  a  credible  account  of  his  adverse
         experiences in Albania at the hands of an abusive father;


    (ii) he had a well-founded fear of persecution from his father so  long
         as he was a minor;


    (iii)    there was a Convention reason  for  this  persecution,  namely
         that the appellant was a member of a particular social group  based
         on the immutable characteristic of age; and


    (iv) he was not in a position to access or receive effective protection
         for so long as he was a minor.


    The judge decided to dismiss the appeal nevertheless  because  "I  take
    the view that the appellant's removal (once he is 18) would  not  cause
    the United Kingdom to e in breach of its  obligations  under  the  1951
    Convention" (paragraph 46).  What appeared to have been in the mind  of
    the judge was that the appellant had been given limited leave to remain
    until 8 April 2017 when he turned 17ï¿½ and that  he  would  not  be  the
    subject of  a removal decision until he turned 18  (see  paragraphs  32
    and 40).


2.   As has been conceded by the respondent,  this  approach  was  wrong  in
    law.  The judge was obliged to  decide  whether  the  appellant  was  a
    refugee at the date of  the  hearing  before  him.   That  is  a  well-
    established principle of case law: see KA (Afghanistan)  and  Others  v
    SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1914.

3.   At the date of the hearing the appellant was still a minor  (indeed  he
    is still a minor today).  The judge's error could not  have  been  more
    material since if he had decided it on the basis of the facts  as  they
    stood at the date of hearing, he would have been bound (given his  main
    finding) to find that the appellant was a refugee.

4.   Accordingly the judge materially erred in law and his decision  is  set
    aside.

5.   I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.   Although  I  have  set
    aside the judge's decision, the respondent has raised no  challenge  to
    his key findings as set out in (i) - (iv) above.  On the basis of those
    findings, the appellant qualifies as a refugee for as long as he  is  a
    minor.  At the date of hearing before me,  the  appellant  is  still  a
    minor.  Accordingly he meets the requirements of the refugee definition
    as  set  out  in  the  Immigration  Rules  and  Article  2(d)  of   the
    Qualification Directive.

6.   For the above reasons:

    The judge materially erred in law and his decision is set aside.


    The decision I re-make is to allow the appellant's appeal.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
