                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Slamat Ali Khan, was born on  15  June  1979  and  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against the decision of the respondent (the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    Islamabad) who refused to grant  him  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  That decision was made on 9 October 2012.

 2. The application was subject to the requirements of paragraph 281 of  HC
    395 (as amended). There are three grounds of appeal.  The  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal as  regards  the  maintenance  requirement  are
    summarised in the grounds [3.2-3.3]:

         "[22]    The FTT noted the sum of  sum  of  �205.84  per  week  was
                required to reach the level  of  adequacy  for  maintenance.
                This comprised �111.45 (income support for a couple); �64.99
                (for a child); �17.40 (family premium); �12 (council tax).

         [23] The FTT noted that the income of the  sponsor  (�141.07)  fell
                short by �64.77

         At [25]  The FTT accepted the sponsor had savings  of  �3678.81  at
                the date of the decision.

         At [26]  The First-tier Tribunal divided this amount by  104  weeks
                (equivalent to �35.37 per week) but found nevertheless  that
                the revised weekly figure of �176.44  was  still  below  the
                level needed to satisfy  the  income  support  threshold  of
                �205.84."

 3. The grounds go on to assert  that  the  appellant  had  applied  for  a
    transfer of the conditions of a previous visa which had  been  endorsed
    in a passport which the appellant had lost in the United Kingdom.   The
    appellant and his United Kingdom  spouse  suffered  problems  in  their
    marriage and the appellant had  returned  to  Pakistan.   However,  the
    couple had reconciled and the appellant then  sought  to  transfer  the
    conditions of his visa (which expired on 26 August  2012)  to  his  new
    passport.  However, the decision on the appellant's application was not
    taken by the ECO until 9 October 2012; as the respondent states in  the
    Rule 24 response of 12 September 2013 "any transfer would have been  of
    no value to the appellant.  The ECO then triggered the application as a
    fresh application for a settlement visa."

 4. The grounds assert that there was  no  reference  to  the  transfer  of
    conditions application in Judge  Reed's  determination.   That  is  not
    accurate.  At [4] the judge noted that "the  appellant  had  wanted  to
    transfer his conditions to a new passport."  The  grounds  assert  that
    the guidance for  those  wishing  to  transfer  the  conditions  on  an
    existing visa to a new  passport  "only  mentions  that  the  applicant
    should complete the form and submit it with the full fee.  It does  not
    mention that supporting documents should be provided  (as  in  a  fresh
    settlement application)."  If the ECO required  additional  information
    from the appellant, it should have been requested.

 5. It is not entirely clear to me exactly what error  Ground  One  submits
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge perpetrated.  If it was  that  the  judge
    had failed to understand the nature of the application,  then  that  is
    not the case for the reason I have given.  If it is then the ECO should
    have asked for additional information to support the application, I  do
    not see why that would indicate an error of law in the determination.

 6. Ground Two has more substance.  Because the appellant had eight  months
    of leave on his  initial  visa  remaining  at  the  time  he  made  his
    application for a transfer of conditions,  it  is  submitted  that  the
    sponsor's savings should have been spread over the eight  month  period
    rather  than  over  a  period  of  104  weeks,  that  is  the   initial
    probationary period of any new  grant  of  leave  to  remain.   As  the
    grounds assert:

         Undertaking this calculation [over a period of eight months] it  is
         clear  that  the  appellant  was  able  to   demonstrate   adequate
         maintenance: �3,678.81 � 34 = �108.20.  This  would  be  more  than
         sufficient to cover this shortfall of �64.67 identified by the  FTT
         at [22].

 7. The grounds are correct in stating  that  in  stating  that  the  judge
    spread the sponsor's savings of �3678.81 over a  period  of  104  weeks
    [26].  The resulting notional income figure  amounted  to  �176.44  per
    week which, as the judge noted, was still "well below the  figure  that
    will be given by way of income support such a couple with a child  once
    their housing costs had been met (which as I set at above works out  in
    total at �205.84)."  The appeal was dismissed  under  paragraph  281(v)
    accordingly.

 8. The grounds do not assert that there was an  undue  delay  between  the
    appellant making his application for a transfer of conditions  and  the
    decision of the ECO.  I find that  any  delay  was  reasonable  in  the
    circumstances, given that the appellant's relationship with the  United
    Kingdom sponsor appeared to have broken down only for  there  to  be  a
    subsequent reconciliation.  As the  Rule  24  response  notes,  it  was
    necessary for the ECO to consider the  application  "after  undertaking
    due diligence in the light of [those] circumstances."  I  consider  the
    point is well made in the Rule 24 statement that the application for  a
    transfer of conditions was meaningless after the  appellant's  existing
    visa  expired  on   26   August   2012.    Further,   the   appellant's
    representative did not disagree with me when I suggested to  him  that,
    had the ECO granted the appellant's  application,  then  the  resulting
    visa would have been for a two year period and not simply the remaining
    period  of  his  previous  visa.   It  would,  therefore,   have   been
    meaningless for the judge to have calculated the available income  over
    any period other than that of two years because (a) there was  no  visa
    to which the conditions might be transferred after August 2012 and; (b)
    the transferred or new conditions would be contained in a  visa  having
    an  expiry  date  two  years  from  the   ECO's   decision.    In   the
    circumstances, I find that the judge  has  not  erred  in  law  in  his
    approach to the evidence and in his calculations.

 9. Ground Three asserts:

         The FTT also missed the fact that  the  sponsor  has  a  child  and
         receives child benefit or �20.30 per week.  This ought to form part
         of the maintenance calculations.

10. In the light of the calculations of Judge Reed which  I  have  set  out
    above and which I find to be accurate, a further addition to the income
    of the sponsor of �20.30 per week would still not carry  the  appellant
    above the threshold of �205.84.

11. Judge Reed went on to dismiss the appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    also.  However that part of the determination has not been  challenged.



12. For the reasons I have stated above, this appeal is dismissed.
