Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by Eden Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant entered  the  United  Kingdom  using  his  own
           Indian passport with the benefit of  entry  clearance  as  a
           Tier 4 student on 9 January 2010. That  leave  was  extended
           twice, so that it expired on 1 December 2014.
        2. On 1 December 2014 the Appellant made an application  for  a
           further variation of his leave to remain as the spouse of  a
           person settled in the UK. His application was refused on  29
           June 2015.
        3. The Appellant appealed to the Tribunal, and his  appeal  was
           heard on 18 November  2015,  and  dismissed  in  a  decision
           promulgated on 22 December 2015.
        4. The Appellant's application to the First Tier  Tribunal  for
           permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  Designated   Judge
           Appleyard on 26 August 2016 on the two  limbs  he  distilled
           from the grounds. First that it was arguable the  Judge  had
           erred by relying upon generic evidence that his ETS language
           test had been undertaken by a proxy, and second, that he had
           failed  to  undertake  a   proportionality   analysis   when
           considering the Article 8 appeal.
        5. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 Notice on 27  September  2016
           in which she pointed out that the  same  "generic"  evidence
           was before the Judge as  was  considered  by  the  Court  of
           Appeal in Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 to  be  sufficient  to
           discharge the legal  burden  of  proof  that  lay  upon  the
           Respondent, and that it therefore fell to the  Appellant  to
           discharge the evidential burden of proof to show that  there
           was some innocent explanation for what had occurred.  As  to
           the Article 8 challenge it was noted that there had been  an
           assessment of the  proportionality  of  the  decision  under
           appeal.
        6. Thus the matter comes before me.


      Jurisdiction to hear an in-country appeal
        7. If the decision under appeal dated 29 June 2015 was simply a
           decision to remove by reference to s10 of the  1999  Act  it
           would  not  carry  an  in-country  right  of  appeal,  as  a
           consequence of s92 of the 2002 Act. Although there is a  s10
           removal decision of 29 June 2015, the reasons given for  the
           decision to refuse to vary the Appellant's leave  to  remain
           make  it  clear  that  the  Respondent   has   treated   the
           Appellant's application as a human  rights  application  for
           leave to remain on the basis of the "family life" enjoyed by
           the Appellant with his  spouse,  the  sponsor.  It  was  not
           suggested in the First tier Tribunal, or before me, that the
           Appellant had no in country  right  of  appeal,  and  in  my
           judgement he clearly did.


      The language test
        8. It is  common  ground  that  the  Appellant  relied  in  his
           application for a further grant of leave to remain  upon  an
           English language test certificate issued by ETS in his  name
           in relation to a test that had been undertaken on  27  March
           2013 at South Quay College.
        9. It is also common ground  that  ETS  subsequently  cancelled
           that certificate as  being  one  that  had  been  issued  in
           relation to test  results  which  they  had  concluded  were
           invalid. In short ETS had concluded that the  Appellant  had
           not himself undertaken the test, but it had been  undertaken
           in his place by a proxy. The Respondent in turn relied  upon
           the decision by ETS to cancel the certificate,  and  refused
           the Appellant's application as a result, concluding that the
           Appellant had sought leave by deception.  As  a  result  she
           concluded that the Appellant did not  meet  the  suitability
           requirements set out in Appendix FM.
       10. That there has been widespread fraud in the conduct  of  ETS
           language  tests  was  not  in  dispute;  the  practice   was
           highlighted in a BBC Panorama programme on 10 February 2014.
           The proper approach to be taken in cases where ETS (which is
           not a party to the proceedings) had concluded that there had
           been deception and cancelled  the  test  certificate,  which
           decision has in turn been relied upon by the Respondent, has
           generated a significant quantity of jurisprudence. The Court
           of Appeal considered the matter in  R  (Sheraz  Mehmood  and
           Shahbaz Ali) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 744,  R  (Sood)  v  SSHD
           [2015] EWCA Civ 831, and again in SSHD v Shehzad  &  Another
           [2016] EWCA Civ 615.
       11. It is not in dispute before me that the  "generic  evidence"
           of deception  relied  upon  by  the  Respondent  before  the
           Tribunal in this appeal included the material upon which she
           had relied in Shehzad, thus the evidence of Peter Millington
           and Rebecca  Collings  was  relied  upon,  which  the  Judge
           reviewed at paragraphs 5.1-5.14 of his decision.
       12. This was however not the only evidence relied  upon  by  the
           Respondent. In addition the Respondent relied upon a witness
           statement from Hilary Rackstraw enclosing a copy of the "ETS
           Lookup Tool" showing the Appellant's test result was invalid
           rather than questionable, and, a report dated  15  May  2015
           entitled Project Faï¿½ade, upon enquiries into the South  Quay
           College in London where the Appellant had  claimed  to  have
           undertaken his test  legitimately.  This  report  is  in  my
           judgement illuminating. In the period reviewed of just  less
           than two  years,  which  included  the  date  the  Appellant
           claimed to have  sat  his  test,  1969  of  the  2939  tests
           undertaken at the College in the period were found  to  have
           been invalid as result of the use of a proxy, with a further
           970 found to be  questionable.  On  one  sample  date  every
           candidate sitting the test at the College was found to  have
           used a proxy. The college director initially admitted  using
           proxies in tests, but later denied it.  The  conclusion  was
           that there was organised and widespread fraud  taking  place
           at the test centre.
       13. As noted in Shehzad  [23]  there  is  a  range  of  evidence
           potentially open  to  an  individual  to  place  before  the
           Tribunal  including  an  independent   comparison   of   the
           individual's voice as compared with the voice tested by ETS,
           evidence of attainment of English  language  skills  through
           educational achievement, and objective evidence of  fluency.
           In this case  the  Appellant  relied  upon  his  educational
           achievements in India, and the other  fluency  test  results
           obtained in the UK which had  not  been  challenged  by  the
           Respondent as invalid.
       14. I note that the evidence placed before the Tribunal  by  the
           parties in this appeal was therefore  quite  different  from
           that which was before the President in the appeal of MA (ETS
           - TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT 450.
       15. The Judge did not have the benefit of the Court of  Appeal's
           decision in Shehzad or the  President's  decision  in  SM  &
           Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof)  [2016]  UKUT  229,
           when he heard the appeal.  Nor  did  he  have  any  evidence
           before him to demonstrate any shortcomings in  the  evidence
           relied upon by the Respondent.
       16. It is however plain in my judgement that in  the  course  of
           his decision he did identify the need for the Respondent  to
           discharge the legal burden of proof, and, the need  for  the
           Appellant to address the evidential  burden  of  proof  that
           would  shift  to  the  Appellant  in  the  event  that   the
           Respondent had done  so.  In  my  judgement  the  only  fair
           reading of his decision shows that he was satisfied that the
           Respondent had discharged the legal burden of proof that lay
           upon her, and, that he was not satisfied that the  Appellant
           had  established  an  innocent  explanation  for  what   had
           occurred.
       17. The Judge was entitled in my judgement to consider that  the
           fact that the Appellant could not initially recall the  name
           of the college where he had claimed to  have  been  studying
           accountancy in the UK, although later he was able to do  so,
           was worthy of comment and something to bear in mind  in  his
           analysis of the weight he  could  give  to  the  Appellant's
           evidence.
       18. It appears clear however that the  Judge  placed  particular
           weight upon his conclusion that although the  Appellant  had
           known for some time that he  was  alleged  to  have  used  a
           proxy, he had  done  nothing  to  provide  any  evidence  to
           support his bald assertion that he had  not  done  so.  Thus
           upon his review of the evidence as a whole the Judge was not
           satisfied that he could accept as reliable  the  Appellant's
           assertion that he had himself taken the language test on  27
           March 2013 without a proxy. That was a conclusion  that  was
           open  to  him  upon  the  evidence,  and  it  was  perfectly
           adequately reasoned.
       19. There is therefore no error of law in the  Judge's  approach
           to the allegation of deception, and the  decision  discloses
           no error of law in his conclusion that the Appellant did not
           meet the suitability requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
           at the date of the decision under appeal.


      The Article 8 appeal
       20. That the Appellant did not meet the suitability requirements
           because of his use of deception, was  therefore  the  proper
           context in which the Judge had to  approach  the  Article  8
           appeal.
       21. The Judge, correctly, approached the Article 8 appeal on the
           basis that the Appellant was married to the sponsor, who  he
           noted, at the date of the hearing held ILR.  He  noted  that
           they had married on 21 October 2014, and thus had married at
           a time when  they  both  knew  the  Appellant's  status  was
           lawful, albeit precarious. (He did not comment upon, but  it
           is disclosed in the application, that the couple  first  met
           only one month prior to their marriage.) Although  there  is
           no specific finding that their Article 8 rights were engaged
           by the decision under appeal, it is in my judgement  clearly
           implicit from the terms  of  the  decision  that  the  Judge
           concluded that they were.
       22. The Judge referred himself to s117B in full [5.17],  and  in
           doing so he clearly had in mind the public interest  in  the
           maintenance of effective immigration controls. He noted that
           the Appellant and the sponsor had each grown up to adulthood
           in India, where they had been  educated.  Indeed  as  Indian
           nationals they had spent by far the majority of their  lives
           there, and they both spoke Punjabi fluently  (the  Appellant
           declared himself in  his  application  form  to  also  speak
           Hindi). The Judge noted that there was  no  evidence  before
           him to suggest that there were any insurmountable  obstacles
           to them continuing their married life together in India.
       23. In the circumstances the Judge's conclusion on the Article 8
           appeal was well open to him on  the  evidence,  and  it  was
           adequately reasoned.  Notwithstanding  the  terms  in  which
           permission to appeal was granted there  was  no  failure  to
           assess the proportionality of  the  decision  under  appeal.
           There is therefore no error of law in the  Judge's  approach
           to the Article 8 appeal.


      Conclusion
       24. There is  therefore  no  error  of  law  that  requires  the
           decision to be set aside and remade.





   DECISION


      The decision of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
      22 December 2015 contains no error  of  law  in  the  decision  to
      dismiss the Appellant's appeal which requires that decision to  be
      set aside and remade, and it is accordingly confirmed.
