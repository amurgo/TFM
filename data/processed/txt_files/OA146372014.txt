Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan born on the 17th January 1992.
     On the 14th May 2015 her appeal against a refusal of  entry  clearance
    as a spouse was allowed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chambers.  The
    Entry Clearance Officer in  Islamabad  now  has  permission  to  appeal
    against that decision[1].










    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The wedding  took  place  on  the  5th  March  2012  in  Pakistan.  The
    Respondent's husband is a Mr Sohail Ali, a British  national.   In  the
    three and half years since she was  married  the  Respondent  has  been
    trying  to  join  him  in  the  United  Kingdom.  She  made  her  first
    application for entry on the 27th September 2012. That was  refused  on
    the 7th November 2012 for a failure to provide the documentary evidence
    specified in Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration  Rules.   This  decision
    was upheld by an Entry Clearance Manager on the 31st May 2013.  On  the
    28th March 2014 the Respondent made  a  second  application.  This  was
    refused on the 2rd November 2014, again because the application was not
    supported by all of the relevant financial documents.  The  Sponsor  Mr
    Ali had claimed to be earning �27,300;  he  had  submitted  wage  slips
    reflecting this figure but had not supplied  bank  statements  covering
    the same period which showed  that  money  being  deposited.  An  Entry
    Clearance Manager upheld that decision on the 7th January 2015 and  the
    matter duly came before the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Before Judge Chambers the parties agreed that  between  September  2013
    and March 2014 (the period covered by the payslips) the Sponsor Mr  Ali
    had  only  deposited  �7710.  It  was  on  this  bases,  applying   the
    requirements in Appendix FM-SE, that the appeal was dismissed under the
    Immigration Rules. The fact that the Sponsor's payslips, P60 and letter
    from his employer showed him to be earning considerably more than  that
    was neither here nor there. The ECO, and  Judge  Chambers,  could  only
    count any salary that was evidenced by deposits in the bank statements.
       The determination goes on to  address  Article  8  'outside  of  the
    Rules'.  Having regard to the five stage  test  recommended  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27 the Tribunal was satisfied that there was a family  life
    between this husband and wife such that  Article  8  is  engaged:  "the
    Article was devised to  promote  family  life  not  to  frustrate  it".
    Turning to the question of proportionality the determination notes that
    the Sponsor "was however earning a high gross figure  well  beyond  the
    income bracket required although the application did not and cannot now
    technically succeed on the basis of the  somewhat  complicated  rules".
    Accepting the Sponsor  did  earn  well  over  the  required  amount  of
    �18,600, the Tribunal finds there to  be  no  public  interest  in  the
    continued exclusion of his spouse. The conclusion is found at paragraph
    13:


         "The Appellant and Sponsor married as long ago as  2012  and  they
         are being kept apart not as a result of having insufficient  money
         but as a result of not explaining in the application why they  had
         (as is the fact) more than sufficient money. I have  come  to  the
         conclusion that any further estrangement of the parties  would  be
         damaging to them and to their marriage and  to  the  wider  family
         life arrangements of those who have  an  interest  in  seeing  the
         couple united. I take account of  the  all  of  this  and  of  the
         interests of the Sponsor who  is  a  hard-working  United  Kingdom
         citizen and the expense and difficulty of maintaining  contact  by
         visiting and the delay and the expense entailed in  making  a  new
         application"

      The appeal was thereby allowed.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer has appealed  against  that  decision.  The
    grounds,  in summary, place reliance on the decision of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in SS (Congo) and Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387. It is submitted  that
    the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  flawed  for  failure  to
    consider whether Mr Ali could relocate to Pakistan  (ie  whether  there
    was an  interference  at  all)  and  for  a  failure  to  identify  any
    exceptional features which would render this decision disproportionate.


 5. Ms Faryl defended the decision on  the  basis  that  the  Tribunal  was
    correct to say that there was no  public  interest  in  refusing  entry
    where it was accepted  that  the  Sponsor  is  earning  well  over  the
    required amount of money.  It  is  accepted  that  this  is  a  genuine
    marriage and that the parties want to live together in  the  UK.  Their
    continued  separation  was  difficult  for  them  both  and  in   those
    circumstances it was reasonable for the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  have
    allowed the appeal with reference to Article 8.



    My Findings

 6. This was a case which turned, insofar as it fell to be considered under
    the Rules, on  whether  the  application  had  been  supported  by  the
    mandatory list of documents set out in Appendix  FM-SE.   It  does  not
    ever appear to have been in issue that the ECO was  correct  to  refuse
    entry with reference to those provisions. The bank statements  produced
    before the Tribunal fell well short of showing at least �18,600 paid in
    over the preceding year.


 7. This was then the case of a couple who could not presently be  together
    because of a failure to supply specified evidence. It was also  a  case
    which concerned two people from two different countries who had married
    knowing that the requirements of the Immigration Rules would have to be
    met if they were to live together in the United  Kingdom.   These  were
    precisely the facts considered by the Court of Appeal  in  SS  (Congo).
    Considering applications which failed under Appendix  FM-SE  the  Court
    said this: " in our judgement, the approach to Article 8 in  the  light
    of the Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as in respect of  the
    substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other words, the  same
    general position applies, that compelling circumstances would  have  to
    apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where the evidence Rules are not
    complied with".  The Court so found for two reasons. First,  that  that
    Rules as a whole pursued the legitimate objective of limiting the  risk
    that a person admitted to the UK would become a burden  on  the  public
    purse. The second reason was framed as follows [at 53]:

         "enforcement of the evidence rules ensures that  everyone  applying
         for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly  in  relation  to  the
         evidential requirements they must satisfy. As well as  keeping  the
         costs of administration within reasonable bounds,  the  application
         of standard rules is important as a means of minimising the risk of
         arbitrary differences in treatment of cases arising across  a  wide
         range of officials, tribunals,  and  courts  which  administer  the
         system of immigration controls.....Good reason  would  need  to  be
         shown why a  particular  applicant  was  entitled  to  preferential
         treatment with respect to  evidence  than  other  applicants  would
         expect to receive under the Rules".

 8. The Court of Appeal here finds that contrary to the submissions  of  Ms
    Faryl, and the findings of the First-tier Tribunal in this  case,  that
    there was a clear  public  interest  in  refusing  entry  clearance  to
    applicants who cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  Appeals
    of this nature can only be allowed where  the  Judge  identifies  "good
    reasons" [paragraph 53 SS] to grant entry notwithstanding  the  failure
    under the Rules, or put another way, where  "compelling  circumstances"
    are found [paragraph 51].


 9. Ms Faryl submits that this is what  the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  at
    paragraph 13 of the determination. The fact that the couple  have  been
    apart since their marriage in 2012, the fact that the  process  of  re-
    applying would cost them more money and cause  further  delay  and  the
    fact that their continued separation is no doubt upsetting for them and
    their families are all identified as good reasons why  entry  clearance
    should be granted.

10. Although all of these reasons are understandably  matters  causing  the
    Respondent and Sponsor concern, I am bound to find that  they  are  not
    matters which are capable of  constituting  "good  reasons"  why  entry
    should be granted to the Respondent over and above any other  applicant
    seeking settlement as a spouse from Pakistan. These  factors  apply  to
    all cases where families are waiting for a visa to be  together.  There
    is in paragraph 13 no "good reason"  why  the  evidential  requirements
    imposed on other applicants should not  apply  to  the  Respondent.   I
    would also agree with Mr Harrison that where the Tribunal has taken the
    length of separation into account, it appears to  have  overlooked  the
    fact that this is the second application refused for want of  specified
    documents. The Respondent and Sponsor can have been under  no  illusion
    as to how important these documents were.   As the Court of Appeal  has
    made clear in SS, it is only the exceptional case that will succeed  in
    their absence.  It follows that the decision is flawed for the  reasons
    identified in the grounds, and the determination must be set aside.

11. I heard  briefly  from  Mr  Ali,  and  had  regard  to  the  record  of
    proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal and his  witness  statement.
    He informed me that he is still working at the same place, where he has
    been a manager since 2010 (a reference  to  2011  in  the  evidence  is
    incorrect). He reiterated the evidence that he  had  given  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, which was that  he  has  not  paid  in  his  wages
    because he has kept some of the cash for his  own  expenses,  including
    sending some money to his wife, and then paid the  remainder  into  his
    account.   He acknowledged that there was no particular reason  why  he
    can't get to the bank or pay that money in; he simply hasn't  done  so.
    He has not seen his wife since 2013 when he last visited  Pakistan.  He
    is constrained from visiting her by expense and the fact that he cannot
    get time off work. He misses her and wants her to join him here as soon
    as possible.

12. I have a great deal of sympathy with the Respondent  and  her  husband.
    This is a genuine couple who obviously want to be  together.  As  Judge
    Chambers rightly noted, he is a hard-working British national who would
    like to be able to live with his  wife  in  his  own  home.  There  are
    however no features of  the  evidence  which  disclose  any  compelling
    circumstances in this case. There is nothing to separate  the  case  of
    the Respondent from that of any other applicant for  settlement.  I  am
    not  satisfied  that  there  are  "good  reasons"  why   the   evidence
    requirements can be dispensed with in this case.  The  appeal  must  be
    dismissed under Article 8 as well as the Rules.


    Decisions

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, insofar as it relates to human
    rights, has been set aside.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to
    dismiss the appeal under the immigration rules is upheld.


14. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:


    "the appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds".


15. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on  the  facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
