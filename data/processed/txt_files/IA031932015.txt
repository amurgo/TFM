                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1.  The  Secretary  of  State  appeals   with   permission   against   the
    determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Malley,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against her decision under to set removal  directions
    to India under section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality
    Act 2006 after refusing leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on
    private and family life grounds pursuant to Appendix FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended).

 2. The claimant is an Indian citizen from Tamil Nadu, and speaks Tamil  as
    a first language.  He has no dependants.  He entered the United Kingdom
    in April 2011 with entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General)  Student.  His
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 student  was  curtailed  to  expire  on  14
    October 2014.

 3. On 13 October 2014, he applied  to  the  Secretary  of  State  on  form
    FLR(FP) for leave to remain on the basis of his  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The  claimant  was  working  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    earning ï¿½800 per month.  He also receives  sums  in  support  from  his
    parents.

Rule 43 notice

 4. This decision was sent to the parties  in  April  2016,  but  contained
    errors which gave the impression that the  Upper  Tribunal  appeal  was
    that of the claimant. That error was caused in part by my  decision  to
    refer to the parties as they were in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  which
    created  confusion  in  the  drafting  and  also  in   the   claimant's
    understanding of the outcome of the appeal.

 5. Paragraph 43 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as
    amended) empowers the Upper  Tribunal  to  set  aside  and  remake  any
    decision which disposes of proceedings, if the Upper Tribunal considers
    it to be in the interests of justice to do so,  on  the  grounds  of  a
    procedural irregularity.   I so consider in this appeal:  the  decision
    in the form in which it was promulgated is unclear as  to  the  outcome
    and I will remake it.

 6. I now proceed to remake the decision.  I shall refer to the parties  as
    the Secretary of State and the claimant.

Respondent's decision

 7. The claimant applied under the 10-year rule, although he had spent only
    3 years,  all  lawfully,  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  he  made  his
    application.  He said  in  his  application  that  he  had  family  and
    friends, property and business interests in Tamil Nadu, India.  A cover
    letter accompanied  the  application,  but  is  not  mentioned  in  the
    respondent's refusal.

 8. The Secretary of State refused the claimant's application  for  further
    leave, on the basis that he could not bring  himself  within  paragraph
    276ADE(1) because he had been in the United Kingdom for  only  3  years
    and could not meet the 'very significant obstacles' test  in  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi), the only route available for those over  18  who  cannot
    show 20 years' continuous residence and have not spent at least half of
    their lives in the United Kingdom.

 9. The Secretary of State considered whether the claimant's desire to work
    gave rise to a legitimate expectation that he should be permitted to do
    so.  She refused permission because he could not bring  himself  within
    the Tier 2 points-based system route for migrants wishing  to  work  in
    the United Kingdom, and no other  exceptional  circumstances  had  been
    advanced.

First-tier Tribunal decision

10. Neither  party  appeared  or  was  represented  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The decision was made on the  papers  in  the  file.   After
    setting out the history and the grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the Judge noted that the claimant's application had been made
    on 11 October 2014 under the 10-year private life route.  The  covering
    letter which the claimant said accompanied his application when it  was
    sent to the Secretary of State was  not  included  in  the  papers  she
    supplied to the First-tier Tribunal for the appeal.

11. It was the claimant's case that the covering  letter  included  matters
    going to the question of significant obstacles to  his  integration  on
    return to India, and that the respondent had failed to consider what it
    said when reaching her conclusions.  He argued that no  proper  reasons
    had been given in respect of the 'significant obstacles to integration'
    part of her decision.

12. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that if such a cover letter  had  been
    sent, the Secretary of State should have engaged with it  and  that  as
    the decision under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) had turned on  the  question
    of significant obstacles, her failure to engage  with  the  information
    provided in the cover letter was irrational  and  unlawful.  The  Judge
    found  that  the  contents  of  the  cover  letter  should  have   been
    considered.

13. The appeal was allowed  to  the  limited  extent  that  the  claimant's
    application remained  before  the  Secretary  of  State  for  a  lawful
    decision, having regard to the cover letter and its contents.

14. The Secretary of State appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Grounds of Application

15. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal contended that on any  view,
    the claimant could not meet the requirements of paragraph  276ADE.  She
    relied on the passage in her refusal letter:

         "It is not accepted that there will be very  significant  obstacles
         to your integration into India, if you were required to  leave  the
         UK because you have lived in India for most of your life  and  have
         retained cultural and family ties.  Further  you  speak  the  Tamil
         language as your first language".

    She  contended  that  whatever  the  cover  letter  had  contained  was
    insufficient to oust that brief reasoning and that the appeal had  been
    bound to fail.

16. In addition, the Secretary of State argued that the First-tier Tribunal
    had erred in law in finding that she had failed to consider  supporting
    evidence supplied by the claimant to the case worker, arguing that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had failed adequately to reason that  part  of  the
    decision and the respondent did not understand  why  her  reasons  were
    deemed inadequate.  The Secretary of State sought an  oral  hearing  of
    the appeal.

17. On 15th February 2016, permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that

         '...it is arguable that the Judge failed to give  adequate  reasons
         and/or erred in finding at [25] that the [Secretary of  State]  had
         not considered [the claimant's] application in accordance with  the
         law, particularly since [the claimant] had not adduced  by  way  of
         evidence a copy of his covering letter  which,  it  is  said,  [the
         Secretary of State] had failed to take into account.'

18. That is the basis on which the appeal came before me.

Submissions

19. The Secretary of State did  arrange  representation  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Mr Walker relied on the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  of
    appeal and repeated them.  He contended that there was no proper  basis
    for a finding that the Secretary of State had not taken account of  the
    covering letter from the claimant.  Even if  she  had  not  taken  that
    letter into account, he argued that the reasons were adequate.  If  the
    Secretary of State were to consider the application again, it would  be
    refused again on the same basis. He asked me to allow the Secretary  of
    State's appeal and remake the decision, dismissing the appeal.

20. The claimant appeared in person at the hearing. He was  unable  to  say
    when he would be in a position to make a Tier  1  application,  stating
    that he was still waiting for his financial  situation  to  improve  so
    that he could make the application because he wants  to  work  in  this
    country.  He said that he had sufficient funds to start a business.  As
    he explained, "if I can get leave I can do something".

21. He asked me to uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

FLR(FP) Application covering letter

22. The covering letter to the Secretary of State upon which he  relies  is
    on the file of papers which I have.  The operative part of that letter,
    dated 11 October 2014, which accompanied the application  form  FLR(FP)
    is as follows:

         "Facts

          . I am currently a Tier 4 student migrant
          . Unfortunately, my college has been revoked from the Tier 4  list
            of sponsors
          . I came to the United Kingdom as an international student
          . I have successfully completed my Masters in the United Kingdom
          . I have an option of establishing my own business in  the  United
            Kingdom
          . I was on the verge of applying for Tier 1 entrepreneur route
          . Unfortunately, the recent change in the  Immigration  Rules  has
            affected my application severely
          . The change in the maintenance funds from ï¿½900-ï¿½945  is  from  90
            days was the first factor that affects my application
          . The funds I have are for  ï¿½200,000  route  and  they  are  in  a
            regulated financial institution
          . I am just waiting for my maintenance funds to mature in order to
            apply for my Tier 1 Entrepreneur route
          .  I  have  been  maintaining  and  accommodating  myself  without
            recourse to public funds
          . Due to the immediate changes in the Immigration Rules I have  to
            apply for  a  further  leave  to  remain  application  until  my
            maintenance funds are completed for the period of 90 days
          . I have the required business plan and I am going to register  as
            a new director of a new company
          . My future entrepreneur venture will provide  loads  of  business
            opportunities and job opportunities within the United Kingdom


         Grounds

          . I believe my application should be considered under Article 8 of
            the ECHR.
          . I have a well-established private life as well as social life in
            the United Kingdom my application  should  be  considered  under
            Article 8 of the ECHR
          . May I remind you that pursuant to  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998
            section 6(1) 'it is unlawful for a public authority to act in  a
            way which is incompatible with a Convention rights [sic]


         In lights of the above, I shall be grateful  if  you  could  kindly
         consider my application on  compelling  and  companionate  grounds,
         based on private and social life in the United Kingdom,  and  grant
         me leave to remain in the United Kingdom. "

Discussion

23. The Judge in the First-tier Tribunal did refer to the covering  letter,
    albeit briefly, at  paragraph  25.   He  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    information therein had been taken into account in the brief  paragraph
    in the refusal letter, which reads as follows:

         "Consideration has been given to your claim that you should have  a
         legitimate expectation that you would be able to work in the United
         Kingdom.  This would undermine the  purpose  of  Immigration  Rules
         relating to Tier 2 applications should  you  be  granted  leave  to
         remain outside Immigration Rules purely for the reason  you  cannot
         satisfy the requirements of Tier 2.  Exercising discretion in  your
         favour in this respect would be to treat you in a  more  favourable
         manner when compared to other persons who are either in  a  similar
         position or who can meet the requirements for leave under the  Tier
         2 points-based system".

24. It does not appear from that paragraph that the claimant's intention to
    apply for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  status  has  been  considered,
    which supports the claimant's assertion that  the  Secretary  of  State
    overlooked his covering letter and its contents. In relation  to  Nagre
    exceptional circumstances,  the  respondent  has  considered  only  the
    'legitimate expectation' of a right to work, not the claimant's generic
    Article 8 ECHR claim.  However, the particulars given in  the  covering
    letter  are  not  such  as  to  amount  to   compelling   compassionate
    circumstances for which the Secretary of State should  have  considered
    granting leave outside the Rules:  the claimant  asserts  that  he  has
    private life and social life, but both are of relatively short duration
    and incapable of amounting to Nagre exceptionality.

25. The reasons given by the Secretary of State are therefore  adequate  to
    support the conclusions she reached and I am satisfied that the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in law in placing the weight it did on the covering
    letter, which, even if it was overlooked by  the  Secretary  of  State,
    really takes matters no further.  It remains open to  the  claimant  to
    return to Tamil Nadu and make an application under Tier 1, or any other
    appropriate Immigration Rule, when he is in a position to do so.

26. The claimant's appeal had no prospect of success.

Notice of Decision

27. The decision of the First Tier involved the making of an error of  law.
    I set aside the decision of the original decision and remake it.

28. I remake the decision by dismissing the claimant's appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision.

29. No anonymity direction is made.
