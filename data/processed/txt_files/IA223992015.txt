Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Gondal a Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Staunton a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
         remain as a student. He was required to leave the  United  Kingdom.
         His appeal was dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Courtney
         ("the Judge") following a hearing on 10 February 2016.

The grant of permission

      2. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Perkins  granted  permission  to  appeal  (3
         November 2016). He said it is arguable that the Judge erred in that
         the Appellant qualified for 60 days leave to remain to find another
         college after his had closed down. He  invited  the  Respondent  to
         consider her position on this.

Respondent's position

      3. Mr Staunton conceded that the appeal should have  been  allowed  to
         the limited extent that it should have been remitted to her for the
         grant of 60 days leave to remain to find another college and have a
         Certificate of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) issued.

Appellant's position

      4. Mr Gondal agreed with Mr Staunton.

Discussion

      5. I agree with Mr Staunton and Mr Gondal. There was a material  error
         of law by the Judge in not  allowing  the  appeal  to  the  limited
         extent identified.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I remake the decision. I allow the appeal to the limited extent that it
    should have been remitted to her for the grant  of  60  days  leave  to
    remain.
