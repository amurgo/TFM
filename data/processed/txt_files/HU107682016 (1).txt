Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge J. H. H. Cooper promulgated on 26 October 2017 following
    a hearing at Taylor House on 2 October 2017 in  which  he  allowed  the
    appeal of Mr Shaiham in what we now know to be an ETS appeal.  I  shall
    refer to Mr Shaiham as the  appellant  as  he  was  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was  born  on  3  November
    1987.  He was refused leave  to  remain  by  a  decision  made  by  the
    respondent, the Secretary of State, on 12 April 2016 and that  followed
    an initial grant of leave that was made on 15 November 2009  which  was
    subsequently extended in the same category.  Finally, leave  to  remain
    as a spouse was granted on 17 October 2013 which  was  valid  until  17
    April 2016.  That of course postdates  the  decision  under  challenge.
    Consequently it appears to me that the appellant is one  of  those  who
    has had continuous valid leave since 2009.

 3. The issue arises in relation to an earlier grant of leave when  it  was
    said that in his application of 17 October 2013 the appellant submitted
    a TOEIC certificate produced by ETS (Educational Testing Service) which
    was, on review by ETS, found to be an invalid test result as  a  result
    of the use of a proxy test taker.  The scores that were considered were
    those produced at a test that was taken on 27 February 2012 at Westlink
    College.  Those results were analysed by two  individuals  and  it  was
    found that a test taker was likely to have been used.

 4. The appellant was interviewed on 4 April 2016 by an official  from  the
    Home Office and  the  results  of  that  interview  (according  to  the
    decision letter) were that the  appellant  could  not  explain  details
    about the tests taken.  Unfortunately,  the  interview  notes  are  not
    amongst the papers in the appeal before me nor were they apparently  in
    amongst the papers before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   Consequently
    whatever the appellant said in interview  which  might  adversely  have
    affected the Secretary of  State's  decision,  those  matters  are  not
    available to us.  Indeed, the answers that are  recorded,  are  answers
    that are generally helpful to the appellant.

 5. Consequently there was then before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  the
    basic generic evidence with which we are all familiar  in  these  cases
    provided by Mr Millington and Ms Collings.  In addition to  that  there
    was also the evidence of Professor Peter French.  He was the individual
    who looked at the report of Dr Harrison which had rather indicated that
    the tests were subject to a  considerable  amount  of  frailty  whereas
    Professor  French  took  the  view  that  the  false   positives   were
    considerably less than had been proposed by Dr Harrison.  So  that  was
    the generic evidence as it stood at that stage but there was  also  the
    evidence which came directly from an examination of  Westlink  College.
    That was part of a document called  Project  Fa�ade,  Criminal  Inquiry
    into the abuse of the TOEIC and Westlink College was a college that was
    identified in the  report  dated  15  May  2015  by  Andrew  Carter,  a
    Detective Inspector.  He was able to say that between 18  October  2011
    and 18 April 2012 Westlink College undertook  915  TOEIC  speaking  and
    writing tests and that of those 661 were said to be invalid.   That  is
    some  72%.   That  obviously  leaves  a  further  28%  which  were  not
    classified as invalid but I suspect that where such a  high  percentage
    of invalid tests were taken, it inevitably sheds  light  on  the  other
    tests that were taken rendering  254  of  them  questionable  for  that
    reason alone.  Of course that does not establish  that  any  individual
    test taken was valid or invalid.   What  it  says  is  that  there  are
    mistakes that can be made and that the invalidity test, although it  is
    pretty accurate, cannot be completely accurate.

 6. The other material that was before the Home Office was a printout  from
    the day in question, that is 22 February 2012.  Of the  32  tests  that
    were taken some 75% were invalid.  That is  a  slightly  higher  figure
    than the figure for the college as a whole and that may well  have  fed
    into the conclusion of the college that  some  25%  were  questionable.
    The evidence in relation to the appellant himself is that his test  was
    declared to be invalid, not questionable, and  that  was  from  a  test
    taken on 22 February 2012 where he was  adjudged  to  have  a  speaking
    score of 200 and a writing score of 170.

 7. The evidence which I have referred to postdating the  generic  evidence
    which was before the Tribunal in QM and  Qadir  was  dealt  with  in  a
    witness statement by Rema Bassi.

 8. All of these documents were referred to by the judge  in  paragraph  29
    and in particular I note that the judge must have looked at the Project
    Fa�ade investigation because the relevant  passages  to  which  I  have
    referred were highlighted in the document by a highlighting pen.

 9. The judge then went on to look at the decision of the Upper Tribunal in
    SM and Qadir [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).  That decision, as we well  know,
    stated that the Secretary of State's generic evidence was sufficient to
    discharge  the  initial  evidential  burden   of   proving   that   the
    certificates were procured by dishonesty.  However, things did not  end
    there and the frailties in the generic  evidence  were  such  that  the
    appellants might be placed in the position  by  adducing  evidence  and
    making submissions that the Secretary of State had, on balance,  failed
    to establish the legal burden.  That was a burden upon them to  comment
    upon the Secretary of  State's  evidence  and  to  establish  that  the
    reasons advanced by the Secretary of State were  insufficient  to  make
    out the use of fraud in the circumstances of the appellant's case.  The
    way that this is worked through is seen very clearly in the decision of
    the Court of Appeal in Majumder v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    [2016] EWCA Civ 1167.    It is the case of SM and Qadir  on  appeal  to
    the Court of Appeal.  In that case Beatson LJ spoke of  the  evidential
    burden which was correctly identified by the Secretary of State and  by
    the Upper Tribunal and  which  had  been  established  by  the  generic
    evidence.

10. The Court of Appeal then went on to consider what  the  Upper  Tribunal
    said in relation to the evidence which had been  provided  both  by  Mr
    Majumder and by Mr Qadir.   In  the  review  of  the  evidence  it  was
    recorded that Mr Majumder gave evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.
     That evidence was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal.  There  was  no
    indication  of  invention,   exaggeration   or   evasiveness   and   he
    consistently presented himself as a witness of truth.  It was a similar
    but slightly different assessment that  was  made  in  relation  to  Mr
    Qadir.  It was therefore accepted by the Secretary of  State  that  the
    two appellants Mr Majumder and Mr Qadir had given credible evidence and
    that was conceded by Mr Kotas on behalf of the Secretary of State.   He
    conceded that the Secretary of  State  had  discharged  the  evidential
    burden but that she had not discharged the legal burden that  she  bore
    to show dishonesty.  He made it clear that he abandoned any  submission
    that the Tribunal in the present case did not treat the evidence of  Dr
    Harrison in a legitimate way.  It followed therefore that  one  of  the
    principal planks advanced by the Secretary  of  State  was  effectively
    withdrawn.

11. In short, what occurred was that  the  generic  evidence  was  balanced
    against the individual's evidence that was provided by the  appellants.
    The First-tier Tribunal Judge came to the conclusion that the Secretary
    of State had failed to establish the legal  burden.   In  other  words,
    having looked at the evidence  in  the  round,  having  looked  at  the
    generic evidence, the specific evidence in relation to Professor French
    and Dr Harrison the Upper Tribunal was entitled to  conclude  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal made no error in its conclusions about the totality
    of the evidence.

12. In this case, in paragraph 29, the judge refers to the Westlink College
    material  including  the  speaking  and  writing  tests  taken  by  the
    appellant on 22 February 2012, the scores and  the  analysis  of  those
    tests on 22 February 2012.  He took into account Project Fa�ade and the
    generic, as it were, overall impression that  Westlink  College  was  a
    factory of fraud.  He then applied SM and Qadir and did so  by  looking
    at the evidence of the appellant.  He said in  paragraph  33  that  the
    appellant had provided a detailed account  of  how  he  came  to  chose
    Westlink College, how he travelled there initially to book the test and
    subsequently to take the tests on two  different  days  and  what  took
    place during each of the tests.  He  was  cross-examined  by  the  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, Miss McKenzie and explained in  his  answers
    the anxieties that she raised and his evidence was clearly found by the
    judge to be a truthful account.

13. The judge then went on to make an assessment of the appellant's ability
    to speak English.  The test that was taken on 22 February 2012 predated
    another spoken English examination which the appellant took in February
    2016, that is exactly, or almost exactly, four years  later.   He  took
    into account the fact that if he had  been  proficient  in  English  in
    March 2016 that might shed light on his  proficiency  in  2012,  albeit
    with the passage of time.  He took into account the answers  that  were
    provided in interview and  the  record  of  the  interviewing  went  as
    follows:

         "Q:  Was the applicant  able  to  answer  the  questions  in  basic
             English?

         A:   Yes.

         Q:   Did the applicant answer in a fluent manner suggestive of  the
             fact that they had not  been  coached  in  providing  specific
             answers by rote?

         A:   Yes.

    It was said that the appellant did have very good  English  during  the
    interview and stated that he completed the A1 English language test  in
    March 2016.  The judge,  unsurprisingly,  found  that  the  appellant's
    English was quite competent and that was a factor that he was  entitled
    to take into account.  However, he also exercised a certain  amount  of
    caution.  That caution is effectively the subject  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal where the Secretary of State relies on MA (Nigeria) [2016]  UKUT
    450, at paragraph 57, where the Tribunal said:

         "... We acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had no reason
         to engage in the deception which we have  found  proven.   However,
         this has not deflected  us  in  any  way  from  reaching  our  main
         findings and conclusions.  In the abstract, of course, there  is  a
         range of reasons why persons proficient in English  may  engage  in
         TOEIC fraud.  These include, inexhaustively,  lack  of  confidence,
         fear of failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt  for  the
         immigration system.  These reasons  could  conceivably  overlap  in
         individual cases and there is  scope  for  other  explanations  for
         deceitful conduct in this sphere.  We are not required to make  the
         further finding of why the Appellant engaged in  deception  and  to
         this we add that this issue was not explored  during  the  hearing.
         We resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

14. This passage obviously offers us the simple truth that there may  be  a
    number of reasons why an individual who is proficient in English  might
    want to, as it were, hedge his bets by making sure that a  professional
    proxy taker makes sure of the result and so proficiency  can  never  be
    conclusive evidence of an absence of fraud but the  decision  maker  in
    this case was not saying that it was conclusive.  It is  true  that  he
    spends paragraphs 37 and 38 considering this matter but that is largely
    because there was a certain amount that he had to cover  including  the
    answers that were given in interview and the test that had  been  taken
    on another occasion.  Consequently, I do not think one can  infer  from
    the fact that rather more words were used in  paragraph  37  than  were
    used in paragraphs 33 or 34 means that the evidence was the subject  of
    undue consideration.  The difficulty that the Upper Tribunal  faces  in
    such cases is that this is an  evaluative  process  where  all  of  the
    factors had to be taken  into  account.   That  included  the  Westlink
    College material.  It included  the  witness  statement  evidence.   It
    included the reports of both Professor French and Dr  Harrison  and  it
    included the approach that was required to be adopted by the  case-law.
    Those matters are material which the Upper Tribunal itself can  form  a
    judgment about in relation to their strengths  and  weaknesses  because
    that evidence is exactly the same for me as  it  is  for  the  decision
    maker and for the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

15. What however the Upper Tribunal cannot do is make an assessment  as  to
    the weight that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  properly  able  to
    attach to the appellant's own evidence.  It is quite plain that he  was
    cross-examined on aspects of his evidence and gave an account which the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted as being truthful and accurate.   It
    is also fair to say that he took into account  the  answers  that  were
    provided by the appellant in interview which were not answers  that  in
    any way  undermined  the  truthfulness  of  the  appellant.   In  those
    circumstances it has to remain  the  legal  principle  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal applies that, absent an ability to assess the  impact  of  the
    appellant's own evidence given to the First-tier Tribunal Judge, it  is
    impossible for the Upper Tribunal to say that the ultimate decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal was not properly open to the judge.   In  those
    circumstances I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  a
    material error on a point of law and the determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal shall stand.

DECISION

      i) I dismiss the appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  against  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

     ii) The First-tier Tribunal's determination of the appeal shall stand.
