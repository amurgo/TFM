                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Norton-Taylor) which in a determination dated  2nd  May
    2014 dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
    dated 8th May 2013, refusing leave to remain in the  UK  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

Background

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 15th February 2009 as  a
    student. He was granted various extensions of leave and those grants of
    leave remained until 28th March 2013. On  7th  February  2013  he  made
    application as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur). This application was based on a
    partnership with a Mr Tariq Javed a  Pakistani  national.  The  company
    established by the partners is called Zarco  Consultancy  and  Business
    Management Limited (Zarco). The Appellant's partner  Mr  Javed  made  a
    similar application on the same day as the  Appellant.  The  Respondent
    refused both applications on 8th May 2013 and both applicants  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal. For some  reason  their  appeals  were  not
    linked. Mr Javed's appeal was heard by Tribunal Judge  Bryant  on  15th
    October 2013 and allowed on this basis;  whilst  he  had  not  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, the Respondent had failed to act
    fairly in deciding the application  under  the  Evidential  Flexibility
    Policy then in force. Therefore the decision was not in accordance with
    the law. The respondent duly reconsidered Mr Javed's application and he
    was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).

 3. By the time the Appellant's appeal came before Judge Norton-Taylor, the
    scope of the Evidential Flexibility Policy had been reduced  by  virtue
    of the clarification set out in the Court of Appeal's judgment in  SSHD
    V Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2. Judge Norton-Taylor set out  with  great
    clarity the three issues contained in the Respondent's refusal decision
    and which were now before him. This is set out below:

         "The Respondent's decision

             The Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had
             provided  relevant  information  with  his   application.   In
             particular, three issues are taken against the Appellant:

                             a) That he failed to provide evidence that  he
                                and  Mr  Javed  had  joint  funds   totally
                                ï¿½50,000 or more,  to  that  they  each  had
                                access to such funds  (in  other  words,  a
                                declaration containing this information was
                                missing);

                             b) The contract for service submitted did  not
                                contain the two partner' names or the  date
                                of the contract;

                             c)  The  advertising  material  submitted  was
                                missing their names, telephone  number  and
                                email address.

             In light of this, no points were awarded under  Appendix  A  to
             the Rules.  Paragraph  245DD(b)  was  not  satisfied,  and  the
             application fell to be refused.

             Points for English language and Maintenance were awarded".

 4.  The Judge then set out the evidence before him and noted that although
    the Appellant was present at the hearing and represented,  he  was  not
    called  to  give  oral  evidence.  The  hearing  proceeded  by  way  of
    submissions only.

 5. He noted that the Respondent's bundle contained at page 4, a copy of  a
    document entitled 'Declaration of Availability of Funds'. The Appellant
    claimed that this document, or "Declaration" as it is referred to,  was
    submitted to the Respondent, as part of the original application.

 6.  Two  important  points  were  noted  by  the  Judge  so  far  as  this
    'Declaration' is concerned.

      i)  It  was  claimed  by  the  Appellant's  representative  that   the
         'Declaration' had been submitted with the application form.

     ii) It was conceded by the Respondent's representative at the  hearing,
         that had  this  'Declaration'  in  fact  been  submitted  with  the
         application, it would be sufficient to satisfy the requirements  of
         Appendix A.

 7.  So far as paragraph 3 (b) above is concerned; the Judge noted that  in
    the terms of the contract for services, the Appellant's  name  was  not
    stated within the document. The document was signed  and,  contrary  to
    the assertion in the reasons for refusal letter of 8th May 2013, it was
    dated. He noted, however that the Appellant's name was not  printed  or
    written in an unmistakably legible form.

 8. Point (c) in paragraph 3 above appears to have fallen away  because  at
    [17] the Judge notes.

         "In respect of the advertising material, the pamphlet that had been
         submitted did contain the names of the two partners in it, and  the
         relevant contact details  were  also  present.  Mr  Irwin  did  not
         concede this issue, but he made no additional submissions on it".

         After considering all matters the Judge  went  on  to  dismiss  the
         Appellant's appeal.

 9. The  Appellant  sought  and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  that
    decision. It is right that I set out here the  relevant  parts  of  the
    grant of permission.

         "The grounds of application  claim  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge made arguable errors of law within the determination firstly,
         by failing to properly consider  the  evidence  with  regard  to  a
         "missing" declaration about the availability  of  joint  funds  for
         their business venture and secondly,  by  failing  to  give  proper
         reasons for upholding the  Secretary  of  State's  representative's
         reasons for refusing the application  because,  the  contract  upon
         which the Appellant (and his business partner) relied in accordance
         with the requirements for specified documents  to  be  produced  in
         accordance with the Immigration Rules did not identify their  names
         other than by the signatures...I am satisfied that  the  manner  in
         which the First-tier Tribunal Judge dealt with  the  issue  of  the
         signatures on the contracts and  the  name  of  the  Appellant  may
         disclose an arguable material error of law. For that reason I  find
         that the Appellant's application should be granted..."

10. The grant of permission appears to be quite specific in the  terms  set
    out in the last three lines of the grant.



Error of Law Hearing

11. Mr Aslam who appeared on behalf of the Appellant followed the lines  of
    the grounds  seeking  permission.  He  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge fell into error in his findings at [31] to  [39].  These
    are the findings which led the Judge to conclude that the Appellant had
    not met the  mandatory  requirements  of  the  specified  documents  in
    Appendix A 41-SD(a)(ii)(iv). The findings are not sustainable since the
    Judge's fact finding is flawed.

12. The second challenge advanced by Mr Aslam amounts to this. The contract
    for services was signed by the Appellant (and Mr Javed). The Judge  was
    wrong to say as he does at [45] that the omission of the  name  in  the
    contract means that the appeal must fail under the  Immigration  Rules.
    Nowhere in the Rule does it say that the Appellant's  name  has  to  be
    typed or printed. A signature on a contract shows the signatory's  name
    and  therefore  satisfies  the  Rule.  Even  if   the   signature   was
    insufficient for the Rule, this would mean that the document was in the
    wrong format and accordingly paragraph 245AA(c)  of  appendix  A  would
    come into play. The Respondent would be obliged to show  that  she  had
    exercised her discretion to reconsider the error or omission. This  she
    had not done and therefore her refusal  was  unlawful  for  failing  to
    follow her own policy. He submitted the matter should  be  remitted  to
    the Respondent to consider the terms of her own policy. This  would  of
    necessity result in her granting the application.

13. Mr Nath on behalf of the Respondent relied on  his  Rule  24  response.
    Firstly, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to  find  that  the
    declaration relating to the joint funds had not been submitted with the
    application. He gave very careful and detailed reasons at [31] to  [39]
    for coming to this conclusion. Those reasons were open to him. Likewise
    the Judge was entitled to find that the Appellant's name was not on the
    contract and has given adequate and proper reasons for coming  to  that
    conclusion. The Judge also addressed the Appellant's fairness  argument
    in [47], [48], [49], [50] and [51]. There is no error of law  disclosed
    in the determination and it should stand.

Has the Judge Erred ?

14. The first challenge to the Judge's determination amounts to  this.  The
    Appellant did submit with the application, the  necessary  evidence  to
    show that he had access  to  joint  funds  of  ï¿½50,000.  This  was  the
    document (a copy of which is  annexed  to  this  determination)  headed
    'Declaration of availability of funds'. The date on this declaration is
    5th February 2013. Against the Appellant is  the  Respondent's  refusal
    which declares that no such evidence was provided.

15. It is surprising, in view of the nature of  this  challenge,  that  the
    Appellant, who attended before the First-tier Tribunal Judge,  was  not
    called upon to give oral evidence on this point.

16. That being so, the Judge had to carry out the fact finding exercise  by
    reference to the available evidence before him. This he did. He looked,
    with care, at the surrounding  evidence  contained  in  the  documents.
    Having done so he set out full reasons why he did not accept  that  the
    declaration or rather evidence of joint access to the requisite ï¿½50,000
    had  been  submitted  with  the  Appellant's  Tier   1   (Entrepreneur)
    application. Those are the reasons set out by  the  Judge  in  [31]  to
    [40]. I find that those conclusions were fully open to the Judge on the
    evidence before him. He  considered  further  whether  paragraph  245AA
    could assist the Appellant but noted at [41],

         "Paragraph 245AA cannot assist the Appellant here, and Mr Ahmad did
         not seek to argue otherwise.  A  mandatory  item  of  evidence  was
         missing from the application. There was not  (sic)  duty  upon  the
         Respondent to request it".

    The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in  my  judgment,
    discloses no error of law on that point. That being so, the Appellant's
    appeal is bound to fail under the Immigration Rules.

17. So far  as  the  second  challenge  to  the  Judge's  determination  is
    concerned, the question is whether a signature can be said  to  provide
    sufficient information to meet the requirements of the  relevant  Rule.
    The Rule here is clear, Paragraph 41-SD(c)(iv) of the Rule states,

         Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A states:

         If the applicant is applying under the provisions in (d)  in  table
         4, he must provide:...

             (iv) one or more contracts showing trading. If  a  contract  is
             not an original the  applicant  must  sign  each  page  of  the
             contract. The contract must show:

          i) The applicant's name and the name of the business,

         ii) The service provided by the applicant's business; and

            iii) The name of the other party  or  parties  involved  in  the
                 contract and their contact details,  including  their  full
                 address, postal code, landline phone number and  any  email
                 address.

18. The Judge considered in [43] to [45] the purpose behind the  Rule.  The
    Judge acknowledged that the contract for services document,  which  was
    put forward with the application, contained the date and was signed  by
    both the Appellant and his partner. However the Judge  found  that  the
    signature by itself was insufficient to meet the Rule. He gave  reasons
    why he came to that conclusion. He  noted  at  [44]  that  the  purpose
    behind the Rule is to ensure that there is evidence showing  "that  the
    applicant themselves (sic) is engaged in the business". I would venture
    to add to that, it is so that the Respondent can be  satisfied  that  a
    valid contract is in existence. I see no reasons to disturb the Judge's
    findings on that point. Even if I am wrong about that, the fact remains
    that the Appellant's case falls down because  there  is  no  reason  to
    disturb the Judge's findings on the failure of the Appellant to provide
    the mandatory  information  about  the  availability  of  joint  funds.
    Therefore even if the Judge fell into error  on  the  second  challenge
    raised, it would not materially affect  his  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal.

DECISION

19. The determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor  discloses
    no error of law such that the determination should be  set  aside.  The
    decision dismissing the Appellant's appeal therefore stands.
