                            DECISION AND REASONS




        1. This has been a  remote  hearing  to  which  both  parties  have
           consented. A face to face hearing was not held because  it  was
           not practicable and all issues could be determined in  a  remote
           hearing. I did not  experience  any  difficulties,  and  neither
           party expressed any concern, with the process.

      Background

        2. The appellant is a citizen of  Afghanistan  born  on  1  January
           1992. He entered the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum in 2007.

        3. The appellant's claim, in summary,  is  that  faces  a  risk  of
           persecution or serious harm in Afghanistan  because  of  a  land
           dispute involving his family in which his father was killed. The
           claimed land dispute  is  in   Parwan  Province,  which  is  the
           appellant's home area. He claims that his cousins intend to kill
           him in order to prevent him from avenging his father's death. He
           also claims to be at  risk  because  of  (a)  the  deteriorating
           security  situation  in  Afghanistan;  (b)  being  perceived  as
           westernised; and (c) his health and suicide risk.

        4. The appellant's asylum application in 2007 was  refused  but  he
           was granted discretionary leave as a minor until June 2009.

        5. In June 2010 a further asylum application was  refused  and  the
           appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where  his  appeal
           was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nightingale  ("the
           previous judge"). In a decision promulgated on 31 January  2011,
           the  previous  judge  dismissed  his  appeal.   Despite   making
           allowances for the appellant's age, the previous judge found the
           appellant's account of events in Afghanistan  to  be  vague  and
           lacking any of the detail to be expected of a credible  account.
           The previous judge also found several parts of the claim  to  be
           "wholly inexplicable" and "wholly incredible".

        6. The appellant subsequently made further submissions, which  were
           refused. He then appealed, for a second time, to the  First-tier
           Tribunal where his appeal came before Judge  of  the  First-tier
           Tribunal Louveaux ("the judge").  In a decision  promulgated  on
           11 February 2020, the judge dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal.
           The appellant is now appealing against this decision.

      Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

        7. The judge stated that,  having  reviewed  the  previous  judge's
           "specific credibility findings" she could "find  no  fault  with
           her reasoning". She  also  stated  that,  having  given  anxious
           scrutiny to the evidence submitted by the appellant,  there  was
           no  basis  to  depart  from  the  previous  judge's  credibility
           findings.

        8. The appellant adduced two reports by an expert  on  Afghanistan,
           Dr Giustozzi. The judge found that the reports of  Dr  Guistozzi
           were cogent evidence that land disputes of the kind described by
           the appellant occur  in  Afghanistan,  but  that  they  did  not
           address the multiple points on which the  previous  judge  found
           the appellant's account of being the victim of such a dispute to
           be implausible.

        9. The appellant also relied upon  a  witness  statement  from  his
           uncle, who attended the hearing but did not give  evidence.  The
           judge stated that she did not draw an adverse inference from the
           appellant's uncle not giving oral  evidence,  but  that  in  the
           absence of oral evidence that was properly subjected to scrutiny
           she could give little weight to the  evidence.  The  judge  also
           found that the uncle's witness statement only addressed  one  of
           the many reasons given by the previous  judge  for  finding  the
           appellant's account not credible.

       10. The appellant adduced a report by a consultant psychiatrist,  Dr
           Buttan. Dr Buttan  expressed  the  opinion  that  the  appellant
           suffers from adjustment disorder  and  moderate  depression  and
           that he has a moderately high risk of suicide and self-harm.  Dr
           Buttan  stated  in  his  report  that  the  appellant  was   not
           displaying exaggerated responses and it was his opinion that  he
           was not exaggerating or feigning his  conditions.  At  paragraph
           21(iv) the judge stated:

                 "Clearly the appellant was able to persuade Dr Buttan  that
                 he was telling the truth in respect of  his  asylum  claim.
                 Given Dr Buttan's professional expertise, I do not set that
                 aside lightly. However, when considered against  the  clear
                 and multiple credibility findings by [the previous  judge],
                 I do not find the appellant's ability to convince Dr Buttan
                 is  capable  of  undermining  her   findings,   even   when
                 considered in the light of all the other evidence  in  this
                 case."

       11. With  respect  to  family  support  in  Afghanistan,  the  judge
           rejected the appellant's claim that his mother and  two  of  his
           brothers now live in the border region between  Afghanistan  and
           Pakistan. The judge noted that it was the appellant's case  that
           they lived in  the  border  region,  rather  than  in  Pakistan,
           because they lack the requisite refugee card and face arrest  by
           Pakistani security forces. At paragraph 40(ii) the judge  stated
           that the appellant's representative submitted that the Pakistani
           residence documents of the appellant's mother and  brothers  had
           been provided to the respondent and their authenticity  had  not
           been challenged. The judge stated that the  documents  were  not
           before her and therefore she could not make a finding as to  the
           location of the appellant's mother and two  brothers.  She  also
           stated  that  if  the  appellant's  mother  and  brothers   have
           Pakistani  documents  that  would  appear  to   contradict   the
           appellant's claim that they live in the border region because of
           lack of permission to reside in Pakistan. The judge also  found,
           at paragraph 40(iii), that the appellant's account  of  how  his
           mother had been located, after having lost contact with her, was
           implausible.

       12. The judge rejected the  appellant's  "westernisation"  argument,
           finding that the treatment the appellant would suffer on account
           of his westernisation would not amount to persecution.

       13. With respect to the appellant's mental health, the judge  stated
           at paragraph 27 that she gave Dr  Buttan's  report  considerable
           weight but that the report was of limited relevance  because  Dr
           Buttan  relied  on  the  appellant's  account,  which  was   not
           credible. The judge stated that she accepted that the  appellant
           suffers  from  moderate  depression  but  not  that  he  is   at
           moderately high risk of suicide and  self-harm  if  returned  to
           Afghanistan. The judge explained at paragraph 28 that the reason
           this was not accepted was that Dr Buttan's assessment of suicide
           risk in Afghanistan was predicated on  an  acceptance  that  the
           appellant's asylum claim was genuine.

       14. The judge found that it  would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
           appellant to relocate to Kabul because (a) the evidence  adduced
           by the appellant did not justify a departure from extant country
           guidance case law on the level of  indiscriminate  violence  not
           reaching the Article 15(c) threshold; (b)  the  appellant  would
           have  family  support  in  Afghanistan;  (c)  he  will   receive
           financial support from his brother  in  the  UK,  who  currently
           gives him ï¿½30 a week; (d) his mental health problems  would  not
           prevent him working or taking care of himself; and (e)  he  grew
           up in Afghanistan and speaks Pashto.

       15. The judge found that the appellant's removal  would  not  breach
           article 8 ECHR as there were not very significant  obstacles  to
           his integration in Afghanistan and his private life  in  the  UK
           should be given only little weight as it  was  established  when
           his immigration status was precarious.

      Grounds of Appeal

       16. The  appellant  advanced  four  grounds  of  appeal,  under  the
           headings: irrationality, procedural unfairness, failure to apply
           the law in respect of the protection claim, and failure to apply
           the law in respect of the article 8 claim. However,  within  the
           irrationality ground there are several distinct arguments and  I
           have found it convenient to  divide  the  appellant's  arguments
           into eight separate grounds. I have set them out below, and will
           refer to these eight grounds in the remainder of the decision.

       17. Ground 1: the judge erred  by  not  considering  Dr  Giustozzi's
           evidence  as  an  integral  part  of  the  assessment   of   the
           appellant's credibility.

       18. Ground 2: the judge  erred  by  treating  the  evidence  of  the
           appellant's uncle as "not impartial". It is also argued that the
           reasoning was inconsistent, as the judge stated that she did not
           draw an  adverse  inference  from  the  uncle  not  giving  oral
           evidence but then gave a his evidence only little weight because
           he did not give oral evidence.

       19. Ground 3:  the  judge  misapplied  Deevaselan  by  treating  the
           decision of the previous judge as a legal  straitjacket  and  by
           effectively ruling out the possibility  of  departing  from  the
           findings of the previous judge.

       20. Ground 4:  the  judge's  approach  to  Dr  Buttan's  report  was
           inconsistent as in paragraph 22(iv) the judge  stated  that  his
           opinion should be "set aside" but later in paragraph 27 she gave
           the report "considerable weight".  It  is  also  argued  that  a
           cogent reason based on evidence was not given for  rejecting  Dr
           Button's expert opinion, with reliance  placed  on  JL  (medical
           reports-credibility) China [2013] UKUT 00145 (IAC), the headnote
           to which states:

                 (4) For their part, judges should be aware that, whilst the
                 overall assessment of  credibility  is  for  them,  medical
                 reports may well involve assessments of  the  compatibility
                 of the appellant's account with physical marks or symptoms,
                 or mental condition: (SA (Somalia) [2006] EWCA  Civ  1302).
                 If the position were otherwise, the central tenets  of  the
                 Istanbul Protocol would be misconceived, whenever there was
                 a dispute about claimed  causation  of  scars,  and  judges
                 could not apply its guidance, contrary  to  what  they  are
                 enjoined to do by SA (Somalia). Even where medical  experts
                 rely heavily on the account given by the person  concerned,
                 that does not mean their reports lack or lose their  status
                 as  independent  evidence,  although  it  may  reduce  very
                 considerably the weight that can be attached to them.

           It is also submitted that the judge failed to  explain  why  the
           report  was  not  relevant  to  the  global  assessment  of  the
           evidence.

       21. Ground 5: it was speculative for the  judge  to  find  that  the
           appellant would have family support on return to Afghanistan, as
           the finding was not based on any evidence.

       22. Ground 6: the judge's assessment  of  relocation  to  Kabul  was
           unsafe because reliance was placed on a  country  guidance  case
           that  was  subsequently  set  aside:  AS   (Safety   of   Kabul)
           Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 118 (IAC).

       23. Ground 7: it was procedurally unfair for the judge  to  draw  an
           adverse inference from the appellant not  producing  his  mother
           and brothers ID cards at the hearing when these  documents  were
           submitted to the respondent, who failed to produce them  despite
           being requested to do so by the appellant's solicitors.

       24. Ground 8: the judge erred, when assessing whether there would be
           very significant obstacles to integration under  article  8,  by
           simply carrying over the findings made in  respect  of  internal
           relocation and not undertaking an assessment that was consistent
           with Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara  [2016]
           EWCA Civ 813, where it is stated:

                 In  my  view,  the  concept   of   a   foreign   criminal's
                 "integration" into the country to which it is proposed that
                 he be deported, as set out in section 117C(4) and paragraph
                 399A, is a broad one.  It  is  not  confined  to  the  mere
                 ability to find a job or to sustain life  while  living  in
                 the other country. It  is  not  appropriate  to  treat  the
                 statutory language as subject to some  gloss  and  it  will
                 usually be sufficient for a court  or  tribunal  simply  to
                 direct itself in the terms that Parliament  has  chosen  to
                 use. The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative
                 judgment to be made as to whether the  individual  will  be
                 enough of an insider in terms of understanding how life  in
                 the society in that other  country  is  carried  on  and  a
                 capacity to participate in it, so as to have  a  reasonable
                 opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate  on
                 a day-to-day basis in that society and to build up within a
                 reasonable time a variety of human  relationships  to  give
                 substance to the individual's private or family  life.

      Analysis

       25. I  reserved  my  decision  after  hearing  submissions  from  Mr
           Bandegani, on behalf of the appellant, and Ms Cunha,  on  behalf
           of the respondent.

       26. The appellant claims to be at risk because of  a  land  dispute.
           This claim was considered in detail by the previous  judge,  who
           gave  several  reasons  for  finding  the  appellant's   account
           implausible. The key findings on credibility/plausibility are in
           paragraphs 51-52 of the previous judge's decision  where,  inter
           alia, the previous judge found it implausible that:

              a. the appellant was able to hide in a three bedroom house for
                 two years when  men  intent  on  finding  him  came  to  it
                 regularly;

              b. the appellant's mother remained in the house where she  was
                 subjected to regular visits  and  physical  assaults  given
                 that she had sufficient resources to support her family and
                 had relatives in another province the men were unaware of;

              c. the men intent on finding the appellant could  have  easily
                 followed his mother to the  relatives  house  in  the  four
                 years that she travelled to visit him there; and

              d. the appellant's mother brought the  appellant  secretly  to
                 the family house for visits.

       27. In accordance with  the  guidelines  set  out  in  Devaseelan  v
           Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2002]  UKIAT  702,
           although the judge was not bound by the previous  decision,  she
           was required to treat it as her  starting  point.  Moreover,  as
           explained in paragraphs 37 and 41 of Devaseelan, it was not  the
           judge's role to consider arguments  intended  to  undermine  the
           previous judge's decision.

       28. The judge therefore was required to take as her  starting  point
           that the appellant's account of a land dispute was  rejected  as
           implausible by the previous judge and consider whether there was
           any evidence that  was  not  before  the  previous  judge  which
           justified reaching a different conclusion. Mr  Bandegani  argued
           that there was such evidence, in the form of the reports  by  Dr
           Giustozzi. He  submitted  that  Dr  Giustozzi's  view  that  the
           appellant's account was plausible needed to be an integral  part
           of the credibility assessment and could not be brushed aside.

       29.  The  difficulty  with  Mr  Bandegani's  argument  is  that   Dr
           Giustozzi's reports do not address any of the reasons  given  by
           the  previous  judge  for  finding   the   appellant's   account
           implausible. If the previous judge had rejected the  appellant's
           account because she did not accept that  land  disputes  of  the
           type the appellant described occurred  in  Afghanistan  then  Dr
           Giustozzi's evidence, which shows that such disputes  do  occur,
           would  have  undermined  the  previous  judge's   findings   and
           justified reaching a different conclusion. However, the previous
           judge did not find it implausible that a land dispute  occurred;
           rather, she found particular aspects of the appellant's  account
           (as set out  above  in  paragraph  26)  to  be  implausible.  Dr
           Giustozzi's report does not address any  of  these  points.  The
           judge therefore was correct - and did not fall into error  -  by
           finding at paragraph 21(i) that Dr Giustozzi's reports  did  not
           address the multiple points in respect  of  which  the  previous
           judge found this appellant's account to be implausible.

       30. For these reasons, the appellant cannot succeed on the basis  of
           either ground 1 or 3.

       31. The appellant relied on a witness statement from his uncle,  AN.
           It is apparent from the  decision  of  the  previous  judge  (at
           paragraph 26) that AN was in the UK at the time of the  previous
           hearing in 2011. There is no explanation as to why  AN  did  not
           submit a statement (or give evidence) at the  previous  hearing.
           In accordance with  paragraph  40  of  Devaseelan  his  evidence
           needed to be treated with "the greatest circumspection". In  any
           event, AN's statement did not address  several  of  the  reasons
           given by the previous judge for not  believing  the  appellant's
           account. Therefore, even  taken  at  its  highest,  it  was  not
           evidence that could justify a departure from the findings of the
           previous judge on the question of whether the appellant faces  a
           risk because of a land dispute. Ground 2 is therefore  not  made
           out.

       32. I now turn to Mr Bandegani's submission that the judge erred  in
           respect of Dr Buttan's evidence. There were two strands  to  his
           argument: first,  that  the  judge  erred  by  not  taking  into
           consideration the evidence of Dr Buttan as part  of  a  holistic
           credibility assessment; and second, that the judge's approach to
           Dr Buttan's  evidence  was  inconsistent  because  in  paragraph
           22(iv) she said  his  opinion  should  be  "set  aside"  but  in
           paragraph 27 she gave the report "considerable weight".

       33. Paragraph 22(iv) of the  decision  forms  part  of  the  judge's
           assessment of the appellant's credibility.  In  this  paragraph,
           the judge acknowledged that Dr Buttan expressed the opinion that
           the appellant was not exaggerating or feigning, but found  that,
           as Dr Buttan was  reliant  upon  what  the  appellant  told  him
           regarding events in Afghanistan,  this  did  not  undermine  the
           credibility  findings  of  the  previous  judge.  In   contrast,
           paragraph 27 forms part of the judge's  assessment  of  whether,
           because of the appellant's mental health condition, his  removal
           from the UK would violate article 3 ECHR. The judge accepted  Dr
           Buttan's opinion about the appellant's  current  mental  health,
           but found that Dr Buttan's opinion about the risk of suicide  on
           return to Afghanistan could not be relied upon  because  it  was
           premised on the appellant's (untruthful) account of events  that
           occurred there. In my view, paragraphs 22(iv)  and  27  are  not
           inconsistent,  and  what  Mr  Bandegani  characterises   as   an
           inconsistency is in fact a reflection of the careful and nuanced
           approach taken by the judge who drew a  distinction  between  Dr
           Buttan being able, based on  the  way  the  appellant  presented
           himself, to form an a reliable view of his present mental health
           condition and between Dr  Buttan's  (more  limited)  ability  to
           assess whether the appellant was being truthful in  his  account
           of a land dispute in Afghanistan many years earlier.  For  these
           reasons, the appellant cannot succeed under ground 4.

       34. A further challenge to the decision in the  grounds  relates  to
           the judge's finding that the appellant would benefit from family
           support in the event that he relocates to Kabul. I am  satisfied
           that the  judge  gave  adequate  reasons  to  support,  and  was
           entitled to reach, the conclusion  she  did,  for  two  reasons.
           First, it was open to the judge to  find  that  the  appellant's
           brother, who currently gives him ï¿½30 a week, would  continue  to
           support  him  financially  in  Afghanistan.  Second,  given  the
           significant adverse credibility findings in respect of the  core
           of  the  appellant's  claim,  as  well  as  in  respect  of  the
           appellant's claim that his mother and  brothers  reside  in  the
           border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan even though  they
           have Pakistani residence documents, it was open to the judge  to
           find that  the  appellant  had  not  discharged  the  burden  of
           establishing (to the lower standard) the absence of  family  who
           could support him in Afghanistan. Ground 5 is therefore not made
           out.

       35. Although the judge recognised in paragraph 32 (when  considering
           indiscriminate violence in Kabul) that AS had  been  overturned,
           it appears that she nonetheless applied the case  in  paragraphs
           42-43 when assessing the reasonableness of internal  relocation.
           Any error, however, was immaterial because the re-made  decision
           in AS (AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan  (CG)  [2020]  UKUT  130
           (IAC))  reached  the  same  conclusion  and  identified  similar
           factors relevant to assessing  the  reasonableness  of  internal
           relocation. It was consistent with the 2020 decision in  AS  for
           the judge to find internal relocation to  Kabul  was  reasonable
           for the reasons given in  paragraph  43  of  the  decision.  The
           appellant therefore cannot succeed under ground 6, as any  error
           was immaterial.

       36. In paragraph 40(ii) the judge stated that the identity documents
           of the appellant's mother and brothers  were  not  produced  and
           that because of this she could not make a finding based on them.
           The judge does not appear to have taken into consideration  that
           the documents were held (and not produced) by the respondent.  I
           agree with Mr Bandegani that an adverse inference should not  be
           drawn in circumstances where it was the respondent who failed to
           produce the documents. However, the  judge  found  in  paragraph
           40(ii) that the appellant's case was undermined  by  his  mother
           and  brothers  having  Pakistani  residence  documents  as  this
           contradicted his claim  that  they  were  unable  to  reside  in
           Pakistan. Therefore, any error  was  not  material  because  the
           documents would not have assisted the appellant. Ground  7  does
           not, therefore, identify a material error of law.

       37. The judge relied on her findings in respect of reasonableness of
           internal relocation to Kabul to support the conclusion that  the
           appellant would not face very significant obstacles  integrating
           in Kabul. The two test are  not  coterminous  and  it  does  not
           necessarily  follow  that   because   internal   relocation   is
           reasonable there would not  be  very  significant  obstacles  to
           integration. However, it is plain from a review of  the  factors
           set out in paragraph 43 of the decision that in  this  case  the
           reasons given for finding internal relocation to Kabul would  be
           reasonable  also  establish  that   the   threshold   of   "very
           significant obstacles" was not met. Therefore, ground 8 does not
           identify a material error of law.



      Notice of Decision

       38. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  involve  the
           making of a material error of law  and  stands.  The  appeal  is
           dismissed.
