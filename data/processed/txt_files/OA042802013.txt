                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Blake)  who   in   a   determination
    promulgated on 24th December 2013 allowed the appeal of the Respondent,
    against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse him entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom.

 2. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer to the parties as they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 21st August 1983.  On 9th
    November 2012 he made an application for entry clearance as  a  partner
    with reference to Appendix FM and paragraph EC-P.1.1 of the Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended).

 4. In the notice of immigration decision  dated  15th  January  2013,  the
    Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the grounds that  he
    had not provided evidence to demonstrate that the  Sponsor  could  meet
    the financial requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  the
    specified documents under the Rules had not been  provided.   Thus  the
    application was refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix  M  of
    the Immigration Rules.

 5. The Appellant appealed the decision and  the  appeal  came  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blake).  He had  the  advantage  of  hearing
    oral  evidence  from  the  Sponsor,  her  stepson  Roshan  and   having
    considered  two  bundles  of  documentary  evidence  provided  on   the
    Appellant's behalf.  It is common ground between the  parties  at  that
    hearing the Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules (at [26] and
    [43]).  However the case was advanced on Article  8  grounds  including
    submissions made concerning the decision of MM and Others v SSHD [2013]
    EWHC 1900 (Admin).

 6. It is plain from the determination that the judge had no difficulty  in
    accepting all of the evidence of the Sponsor and reached the conclusion
    that she was an honest and credible witness.  He  referred  himself  to
    the relevant case law when making an assessment of Article 8 principles
    including MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1182 and what  he  described  as
    the "European  jurisprudence  interpreted  by  the  UK  higher  courts"
    including Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11.   The  judge  applied  the  well
    established five stage test in Razgar and  reached  the  conclusion  by
    going through the steps that the questions resolved in  favour  of  the
    Appellant leading to the ultimate issue of proportionality.

 7.  In carrying out a balancing exercise, the judge reached the conclusion
    that the decision was not a proportionate one to the legitimate  public
    aim identified.  In this  respect  the  judge  took  into  account  the
    decision of MM (as cited) and in particular  the  financial  threshold,
    which it had been  conceded  that  the  appellant  could  meet,  was  a
    relevant consideration and further took into account from the  evidence
    before him, which he accepted, as to the effect of  the  decision  upon
    the Appellant's wife and family including the length of time  that  the
    parties were likely to be separated, the fact that the  Sponsor  was  a
    British citizen and could not be reasonably expected to live in Jamaica
    given her circumstances and the medical evidence  produced,  which  was
    not in dispute, concerning the effect upon  the  Sponsor's  health  and
    general wellbeing in the absence of the Appellant.  Thus he allowed the
    appeal.

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the Appellant could not satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  in
    allowing the appeal on Article 8  grounds  the  outcome  could  not  be
    considered as "unjustifiably harsh".  It was further submitted that the
    First-tier Tribunal had had particular regard to  the  decision  of  Mr
    Justice Blake in MM  (as  cited)  and  thus  whilst  noting  it  was  a
    persuasive authority, the judgment did not dispute the entitlement to a
    minimum incomes' threshold and that such a financial requirement was  a
    measure within the field of immigration control directly concerned with
    socio economic policy.  Thus it was submitted  that  in  MM  the  judge
    usurped the role of the democratically accountable  decision-maker  and
    that by relying on MM the  Tribunal  had  erred.   There  were  further
    criticisms made of the decision of MM.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Brennan) on 17th January 2014.

10. Thus the hearing came before the Upper Tribunal; the Secretary of State
    being represented by Miss Isherwood and the Appellant  by  Mr  Collins,
    who appeared as Counsel before the First-tier Tribunal.  Miss Isherwood
    relied upon the grounds reiterating that the Appellant could  not  meet
    the Rules and the decision of Gulshan which had been promulgated  after
    the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  made  it  clear  that  after
    applying the Rules an Appellant could only satisfy Article 8  if  there
    were "compelling circumstances."   In  this  case  the  judge  did  not
    consider whether there  were  such  "compelling  circumstances."   Miss
    Isherwood also submitted that it would be wrong to follow the  decision
    of MM (as cited) as it was not binding on this Tribunal.

11. A reply under Rule 24 had been submitted  in  advance  of  the  hearing
    having been drafted by Mr Collins.  In that response it  was  submitted
    that the Secretary of State appeared to be asserting that on the  basis
    of a lack  of  "exceptionality"  relying  on  Gulshan,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred  in  allowing  the  appeal  under  Article  8.   It  was
    submitted that that was solely misguided as this was  not  an  argument
    advanced before  the  judge,  it  purported  to  introduce  a  test  of
    exceptionality which was wrong (see MF (Nigeria)), Gulshan had not been
    promulgated at the date of  the  hearing  and  that  Gulshan,  was  not
    binding on the First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal  and  even  if
    correctly decided was not declaratory in nature.  It submitted that the
    judge properly directed himself  as  to  the  correct  approach  in  MF
    (Nigeria) and in any event permission was not granted on this ground.

12.   As to the grounds asserting that the judge erred by having regard  to
    MM and  Others,  it  was  submitted  this  was  misguided  and  was  an
    ineffectual critique of the judgment of Mr Justice Blake  in  MM.   The
    reply also  considered  the  grant  of  permission  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal where it was stated that "MM was not  binding  authority  that
    the judge was bound to follow".  The response goes  on  to  state  that
    that was a comment of concern as it did form part  of  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal and the judge did not approach MM as the only way binding on him
    and that the judge did not allow the appeal only on the basis of MM but
    addressed the other evidence and  conducted  a  proper  and  structured
    analysis of the proportionality  of  the  Appellant  continuing  to  be
    separated from his partner.

13.  Mr  Collins  replied  upon  the  response  that  he  had  drafted  and
    supplemented with his oral submissions  which  followed  those  in  the
    grounds.  He submitted that the grounds as they stood did not  disclose
    any error of law and that the judge  had  heard  the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses and had reached credible findings of fact.  Mr  Collins  took
    the Tribunal through the  particular  evidence  that  had  been  placed
    before the First-tier Tribunal which was contained in the  two  bundles
    of documentation.  He further submitted that in the grant of permission
    no submission was made on the grounds that the decision was  flawed  on
    MF (Nigeria) grounds.  He further submitted that Gulshan had  not  been
    promulgated at the time of the First-tier Tribunal's decision  and  was
    not binding as it was not a starred decision  nor  did  it  rank  as  a
    country guidance case.

14. He took the Tribunal  through  the  determination  and  reiterated  the
    evidence that the judge had heard including the  positive  findings  of
    fact made of the evidence of the Sponsor.  He submitted that the  judge
    in a balanced decision had accepted the evidence but  had  reached  the
    conclusion that the balance lay in favour of the Appellant.

15. Miss Isherwood maintained a position that there was not a fair  balance
    of proportionality.

16.   I reserved my decision.

17. The grounds advanced on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  by  Miss
    Isherwood are that the  judge  failed  to  carry  out  the  appropriate
    balancing exercise and after applying the requirement of the Rules  the
    judge was required to  consider  whether  there  were  any  "compelling
    circumstances" not sufficiently recognised under them.  In this context
    while she has relied upon  the  decision  of  Gulshan,  which  was  not
    promulgated at the time  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decided  this
    appeal, that is not, I think, inconsistent with  earlier  jurisprudence
    including R (on the application  of)  Nagre  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin).

18. There were major changes in July 2012 in the Immigration Rules covering
    applications for entry clearance and leave to remain as family members.
     Appendix FM is the route for those seeking to enter or remain  in  the
    UK on the basis of the family life of  the  person  who  is  a  British
    citizen, is settled in the UK or is in the UK with limited leave  as  a
    refugee or person granted humanitarian protection.  Section  R-LTRP.1.1
    of Appendix FM contains the requirements for limited leave to remain as
    a partner.  The financial requirements, which  were  relevant  in  this
    appeal are set out at E-LTRP.3.1.  They are set out within the decision
    letter.

19. Section FM at 1.0 of the October 2013 IDIs "partner and ECHR Article  8
    guidance" concerns family members applying after 9th  July  2012  under
    Chapter 8 Appendix F of the Immigration Rules.   The  guidance  of  the
    caseworkers therefore  is  appropriate  to  the  current  appeal.   The
    guidance states:-

         "It reflects the two stage  approach  to  considering  applications
         under the  family  and  private  life  Rules  in  Appendix  FM  and
         paragraph 276ADE-DH.  First caseworkers must consider  whether  the
         applicant reached the requirements of the Rules, and  if  they  do,
         leave under the Rules should be granted.  If the applicant does not
         meet the requirement of the Rules, the caseworker must move  on  to
         the second stage: whether, based on an overall consideration of the
         facts of the case, there are exceptional circumstances  which  mean
         refusal of the application  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences for the individual or their family such  that  refusal
         would not be proportionate under Article  8.   If  there  are  such
         exceptional  circumstances,  leave  outside  the  Rules  should  be
         granted.  If not the application should be refused."

19.  The guidance gives some indication of  what  exceptional  means  namely
    "circumstances if its  refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the individual or their family such  that  refusal  of
    the application would not be proportionate.  That is likely to  be  the
    case only very rarely."  Nonetheless the guidance makes it  plain  that
    there are cases which although they may not meet the Rules  may  result
    in what are described as "unjustifiably  harsh  consequences"  or  what
    Miss Isherwood has described as compelling circumstances.  As noted  by
    Mr Collins, that does not mean that there is any test of exceptionality
    that was expressly stated in MF (Nigeria).

20. It was common ground between the parties that the Appellant  could  not
    meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules  (see  paragraph  [43]).
    There has  been  some  discussion  before  the  Tribunal  concerning  a
    concession purportedly made by the Presenting Officer  at  the  hearing
    and referred to by the judge  at  paragraph  49.   The  judge  said  "I
    further note the concession made by the Home Office Presenting  Officer
    that  the  Appellant  would  meet  the  threshold  as  advised  by  the
    Honourable Mr Justice  Blake  in  MM  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    presented before me."

    I do not think that there can be any dispute as to what the judge meant
    by referring to this as a concession.  It is plain that the  Presenting
    Officer conceded that the earnings of the Sponsor, which Mr Collins has
    stated were �14,000 gross, met  the  threshold  identified  Mr  Justice
    Blake in MM which was �13,400 but it is clear from his  submissions  at
    paragraph 23 that he was not conceding the  appeal  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State.

21. It is plain that the judge did take into account  the  decision  of  MM
    which had been placed before him on behalf of the Appellant.   In  that
    case the conclusion of Blake J was that  the  combination  of  the  new
    Rules:-

         "... Amount together to a  disproportionate  interference  for  the
         rights of British citizen Sponsors and refugees  to  enjoy  respect
         for family life.  In terms of the Strasbourg approach they  do  not
         represent a fair balance between the competing interests  and  fall
         outside  the  margin  of  appreciation  or  discretionary  area  of
         judgment  available  in   policy   making   in   this   sphere   of
         administration."

    It is also plain from the determination that he accepted that the wider
    margin of appreciation was likely to be relevant  to  foreign  Sponsors
    who are voluntary migrants but not British citizens  or  refugees.   He
    went on to identify five measures which could be applied to cases which
    did not interfere with the right to respect for family  life  including
    the reduction of the minimum income required of the  Sponsor  alone  to
    �13,500 or thereabouts, permitting savings  over  �1,000  that  may  be
    spent on processing the application to be used to supplement the income
    figure, and permitting account to be taken of the earning  capacity  of
    the spouse after entry or the  supported  maintenance  undertakings  of
    third parties.  Furthermore he took into  account  reducing  to  twelve
    months the period for which the pre-estimate of financial viability was
    to be assessed.

22. Whilst the requirements of E-LTRP3.1-3.2 stand, Mr Justice  Blake  said
    that  they  could  constitute  an  unjustified   and   disproportionate
    interference with the ability of spouses to live together and suggested
    that rather than  �18,600  (the  amount  specified  in  the  Rules)  an
    appropriate figure may be around �13,500 and highlighted  the  position
    of young people and low wage earners caught by the higher figure in the
    Rules.

23. The judge had the advantage of hearing and  seeing  the  witnesses  who
    appeared before him.  There is no doubt  that  the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that the Sponsor was a credible and honest  witness  as  set
    out at paragraph 41 of his  findings.   To  that  end,  as  Mr  Collins
    submits, he accepted the evidence presented on  her  behalf  concerning
    the genuineness of the relationship between the Appellant and  Sponsor,
    the nature of that relationship, the medical  conditions  she  suffered
    from which were exacerbated by the separation of the family members and
    the effect upon the family as a whole, including a minor  child.   This
    was not a case in which it was argued that the Sponsor could reasonably
    live in Jamaica given her British citizenship but also because she  was
    responsible for undertaking the care of her 82  year  old  grandmother.
    The judge was specifically pointed to the likely effect  of  a  lengthy
    separation between the parties.  The  evidence  was  contained  in  the
    bundle and in the various witness statements produced and in  the  form
    of medical evidence.  There was also a letter from the Sponsor's Member
    of Parliament, Mr Barry Gardiner  setting  out  the  concerns  for  the
    family members as a whole who  were  likely  to  be  separated  by  the
    decision of the Secretary of State.  The importance of  evidence  heard
    by a judge should not be under estimated  and  it  is  plain  from  the
    findings of fact that the overall evaluation of the  evidence  by  this
    particular judge was firmly in favour of the Appellant and the Sponsor.

24. Whilst the judge did not expressly state that those facts that  he  had
    found were either "compelling factors" or  ones  that  would  make  the
    decision a "justifiably harsh" one and therefore  disproportionate,  it
    is implicit in his findings and his analysis of the issues  that  those
    were the factors that he considered to be the  relevant  considerations
    when carrying out the balance of proportionality, having found that the
    Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules.

25. In his consideration of this issue he also gave weight to the  decision
    of MM (as cited) and that the  Sponsor's  income  did  meet  or  indeed
    exceed the income threshold identified by Mr Justice Blake in  MM  (see
    paragraphs [47] and [49]).  There has been some criticism made  of  the
    decision of MM in the grounds.  However contrary to the submission made
    by Miss Isherwood, it is a binding authority it being a decision of the
    higher courts and remains good law unless and until it  is  overturned.
    The judge was therefore entitled to take that into  account  and  place
    that in the balance.  Although as Mr Collins submits, that was not  the
    only factor that led to the outcome in favour  of  the  Appellant  when
    carrying but the proportionality exercise.  The fact  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal may have reached a generous decision does not demonstrate
    that there had been any error of law.  The judge was entitled  to  make
    those findings concerning the circumstances of the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor  and  other  family  members,  the  effect  upon  them  of  the
    continuing separation, the length of the separation and the effect both
    in medical terms and otherwise upon the parties.  Those  findings  were
    sustainable in evidence based ones and the judge was entitled  to  take
    them into account.  He was further entitled to place reliance upon  the
    decision of MM when considering the balancing exercise as a whole which
    he found ultimately to be in favour of the Appellant.

26.  Accordingly the Secretary of State has not demonstrated that the First-
    tier Tribunal made an error of law in its  decision  and  therefore  it
    shall stand.

Decision

The decision does not disclose the making of an error of law.  The  decision
shall stand.

No anonymity direction was made.
