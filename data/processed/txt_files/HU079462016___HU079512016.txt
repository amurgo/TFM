Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Norman, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellants are nationals of Pakistan.  The First Appellant is the
       mother of the Second Appellant.  Both Appellants applied for leave to
       remain on 31 October 2015 on the basis of their family  life  in  the
       United Kingdom.  The  First  Appellant  applied  under  the  ten-year
       parent route and the private life  route  and  the  Second  Appellant
       applied under the ten-year child route and under the ten-year private
       life route.  The Respondent refused  both  those  applications  in  a
       decision letter dated 8 March 2016.  It was not  accepted  that  the
       first Appellant met the  eligibility  requirements  of  the  ten-year
       parent  route  under  paragraph  R-LTRPT.1.1.d(ii).   Whilst  it  was
       accepted that the  First  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
       parental relationship with the Second Appellant who entered the UK on
       25 August 2007 and had therefore been in the UK for over seven  years
       it was not accepted  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  for  them  to
       relocate to Pakistan as they would be travelling as  a  family  unit.
       It  was  also  not  accepted  that  the  First  Appellant   met   the
       requirements of paragraph EX.1.(a) because  even  though  she  had  a
       genuine and subsisting parental relationship with her  child  it  was
       not considered unreasonable for them to  relocate.   It  was  further
       concluded that the First Appellant did not meet the  requirements  of
       the private life route and it was not accepted that  there  would  be
       very significant obstacles to her  integration  into  Pakistan.   The
       Respondent also refused the Second  Appellant's  application  on  the
       same grounds, namely that it would be reasonable for her to  relocate
       to Pakistan notwithstanding the fact that she had been in the UK  for
       over seven years.

    2. The Appellants sought permission to appeal against  the  Respondent's
       decision and permission was granted by Designated Judge of the First-
       tier Tribunal Peart on 27 November 2017.  The reasons given for  the
       grant are that the  Judge  gave  either  no  analysis  or  inadequate
       analysis to the Second Appellant's formative years  spent  here.   He
       found it arguable that her  most  formative  years  were  spent  here
       rather than before she arrived in terms of the roots she  was  likely
       to have developed.

    3. The grounds in support of the application  assert  that  the  Judge's
       decision is an inadequate assessment of Article 8 rights and that the
       Judge had failed to give proper weight to the long residence  of  the
       Second Appellant.  It is said that the Judge's finding  at  paragraph
       11 of the decision that the Second Appellant's  formative  years  had
       been spent mostly outside the United Kingdom  was  irrational  and  a
       misreading of the Tribunal jurisprudence.  It is said that the  Judge
       had attached some special significance to  seven  years  between  the
       ages of 4 and 11 and thus unlawfully minimised  the  significance  of
       the Appellant's residence from the age of 9 onwards.  The Judge  had,
       it is said, also failed to consider what was said at paragraph 46  of
       MA (Pakistan) and Others, R (on the application of) v Upper  Tribunal
       and Others [2016] EWCA Civ 705 in relation to the application of  the
       reasonableness test.  It is further asserted that the Judge failed to
       give proper consideration to the private life built up by  the  First
       Appellant.

  The Hearing

    4. The appeal therefore comes before the  Upper  Tribunal  to  determine
       whether or not there is a material error in the decision of the First-
       tier Tribunal and if so what to do about it.

    5. I heard submissions from both representatives.   Ms  Norman  for  the
       Appellants  submitted  that  the  Judge  had  approached  this   case
       backwards and that the skeleton argument set out the  relevant  IDIs.
       At paragraph 13 the IDIs said strong reasons  would  be  required  to
       refuse a case where a child had accrued  seven  years  residence  and
       what the judge should be doing is starting with the presumption  that
       seven years required strong reasons for refusing a  grant  of  leave.
       The Judge  had  misunderstood  the  issue  of  age.   There  was  not
       something special about the seven years  from  the  age  of  4.   The
       relevance of the age of 4 was that  you  start  to  get  a  sense  of
       identity and the Judge had completely misunderstood the situation  in
       relation to age.  The Judge should have considered  that  there  were
       seven years after the age of  4.   The  approach  was  erroneous  and
       consequently the length of  residence  was  given  less  weight  than
       required.

    6. Mr Mills submitted that the decision was not  the  best  structurally
       but there were no material errors.  There  were  sufficiently  strong
       reasons to find that the Second Appellant's residence was  outweighed
       by the public interest.  The Appellant applied three  days  short  of
       her 18th birthday and she was almost 20 at the date of  the  hearing,
       and all of the circumstances were weighed in the balance.  As of  the
       First-tier hearing the Second Appellant was in a family consisting of
       her parents and other siblings, all of whom were here unlawfully  and
       in the round their immigration  history  was  a  sufficiently  strong
       factor to outweigh the interests of the  Second  Appellant  remaining
       here.  The Judge recognised that the  Second  Appellant's  length  of
       residence was a weighty factor and the decision was not  an  unlawful
       one and had reference to the test in MA (Pakistan).

    7. Ms Norman replied that the requirement to consider  powerful  reasons
       was not just the Secretary of State's own guidance but  was  endorsed
       in MA  (Pakistan).   At  the  date  of  the  hearing  there  were  no
       determinations in respect of the other  family  members.   The  older
       brother and father had now been granted leave.  The approach Mr Mills
       was taking was to ask for the case to be rejected because  it  was  a
       close call in relation to the second Appellant's age on application.

  Discussion

    8. In coming to my conclusions  I  have  taken  the  arguments  of  both
       representatives into  account.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  correctly
       addressed the best interests of the child as a primary  consideration
       and set out the relevant case law at paragraphs 7 to  14.   The  best
       interests of the Second Appellant were assessed on the basis that she
       was 17 at the time of the application which was the relevant date for
       the purposes of the Immigration Rules and  19 at  the  date  of  the
       hearing and therefore an adult.  At paragraph 11 of the decision  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  considered  the   relevance   of   the   Second
       Appellant's age to the best interests consideration.  I set  out  the
       impugned reasoning here:

           "11.   Umama was 9 years old when she came to the UK.   She  was
           born in Saudi Arabia where  she  spent  most  of  her  childhood
           although she is a Pakistani national.  In terms of her formative
           years - seven years from the age of 4 - these have  mostly  been
           spent outside the UK - with the  exception  of  the  latter  two
           years.  Since the age of 9, Umama has lived and studied  in  the
           UK.  She has made friends - many of whom  she  considers  to  be
           family and who were present in court to support her  application
           to remain in the UK."

    9. The reasoning that is impugned is in relation to the significance the
       Judge gave to what is said to have been her formative  years,  namely
       what are said by the Judge to be seven years from the age  of  4.   I
       agree  with  the  Appellant's   assertion   that   this   betrays   a
       misunderstanding of the significance of the seven years.   The  Upper
       Tribunal stated in Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 00197  that  seven  years
       from the age of 4 was likely to be more significant  than  the  first
       seven years of life as very  young  children  are  focused  on  their
       parents rather than their peers and are adaptable.  I  consider  that
       the Judge's conclusion that most of the second Appellant's  formative
       years were spent outside the UK, namely those from the age  of  4  to
       the age of  9,  meant  that  the  significance  of  the  seven  years
       residence was  not  given  sufficiently  significant  weight  in  the
       balancing exercise.  The fact that the Appellant spent  seven  years,
       or eight years in her case, in the UK from the age of 9  rather  than
       the age of 4 does not mean that less weight should be given to  those
       seven years because the purpose of  the  Rule  is  to  recognise  the
       development of social, cultural  and  educational  ties  that  it  is
       inappropriate to disrupt.  The older a child gets the more likely  it
       is that private life is established away from the  parents  and  with
       the peers.  Further the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not I conclude,
       recognise therefore that the seven years  residence  is  relevant  to
       determining the nature and strength of the child's best interests  as
       stated by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 49 of MA  (Pakistan).   In
       the circumstances I find that inadequate  weight  was  given  to  the
       length of residence of the Second Appellant  in  the  best  interests
       consideration and the fact that most  of  her  formative  years  were
       spent here rather than before she arrived in the UK in terms  of  the
       development  of  her  roots.    Given   that   the   best   interests
       consideration  was  flawed,  it  follows  that  the   assessment   of
       proportionality also cannot stand because the seven  years  residence
       is required to be given significant  weight  in  the  proportionality
       exercise because it establishes as a starting point that leave should
       be granted unless there were powerful reasons to the contrary.

   10. In the circumstances I find that there was a material error of law in
       the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  that  it  must  be  set
       aside.  Mr Mills agreed that if I were to find a  material  error  of
       law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal the appeal  should  be
       allowed in the light of the present circumstances and facts which are
       undisputed.  I have been served with a bundle of documents in respect
       of this hearing.  The Appellant's father was granted leave to  remain
       on 30 August 2018 and her younger brother, who is a year younger than
       her, was granted leave to remain on the same date.  Whilst the Second
       Appellant is now an adult it is accepted by the  Respondent  that  if
       she were to make an entry clearance application for leave  to  remain
       now she would be granted leave because she has spent more  than  half
       her life in the UK.  As such this is a weighty if  not  determinative
       factor in the proportionality exercise.  It is not  in  dispute  that
       the First and Second Appellant have family life with the  Appellant's
       father and brother who have both been in the UK since 2007.  Mr Mills
       has not sought to argue  that  it  would  be  proportionate  for  the
       Appellants to return to Pakistan without the father  and  brother  or
       for them to follow the Appellants to Pakistan.  In the  circumstances
       and in view of the fact that Mr Mills accepts that the appeals should
       be allowed, I find that the decision  to  remove  the  Appellants  is
       disproportionate.



Notice of Decision

There was a material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal and I set it aside.

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.



TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140 in respect of each Appellant as I have allowed the appeals  on
the basis of the evidence at the date of the decision.
