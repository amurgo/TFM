Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Pinder, instructed by Owens Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent is a citizen  of  Nigeria  born  on  13  December  1984.
    Having entered the United Kingdom with a student entry clearance on  16
    September 2008, he was granted extensions until 13 October 2012.  On 10
    October 2012 his solicitors on his behalf made an application for leave
    to remain as the spouse of a British  citizen.   This  application  was
    refused on 11 February 2013.  His  appeal  was  allowed  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Ghaffar on 25 July 2013.  The Secretary of State for the
    Home Department was given leave to appeal on 15 August 2013.

2.   The respondent formed a relationship with the lady who is now his  wife
    in 2010 and they were married in 2012.  She is 28 years old.  She is  a
    British citizen who has lived all her life  in  this  country  and  her
    whole family are here.  She retains close  ties  with  her  family  and
    would not want to be parted from them.  There  is  no  suggestion  that
    this is other than a genuine marriage and that both  husband  and  wife
    intend to live together permanently.

3.   The Rules lay down detailed  requirements  which  have  to  be  met  to
    justify leave to enter or to remain on  the  basis  of  marriage.   The
    relevant ones for the purposes  of  this  appeal  relate  to  financial
    assets available to the spouses and whether there is a  possibility  of
    maintaining family life  outside  the  United  Kingdom.   The  relevant
    financial provision is a requirement that there is  a  specified  gross
    annual income of at least  �18,600  (see  E-LTRP  3.2  of  the  Rules).
    Paragraph EX1 applied and, so far as material, it provides:-

         "(b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen... and there
             are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that  partner
             continuing outside the UK."


     This purports to deal with whether it would be proportionate  in  terms
    of Article 8 of the ECHR to refuse leave to  remain  in  the  UK  where
    family life has been established.

4.   The gross incomes of the respondent and his wife amounted  to  �17,836.
    Thus they failed by some �724 to meet the required sum of �18,600.  The
    refusal letter went on to consider family life within  Article  8  but,
    applying EX1, it was said that there was a failure to satisfy  the  EX1
    requirements because:-

         "...there are no insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that
         partner continuing outside the UK."


    The decision letter went on to consider whether the respondent had  any
    private life claim but, applying paragraph 276ADE of the Rules, decided
    that he failed to meet the requirements and  so  any  such  claim  must
    fail.   It  is  not  necessary  to  consider  private  life  since  the
    respondent has not based any claim upon it.  He relies  on  his  family
    life established here with his wife.


5.   The refusal of his application is  clearly  an  interference  with  his
    and, perhaps more importantly, his wife's right to  family  life.   The
    contrary has not been suggested by  the  appellant.   Thus  the  burden
    rests upon the appellant to justify that  interference.   Article  8(2)
    allows interference only if it is:-

         "...in accordance with the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic
         society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
         economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder
         or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
         protection of the rights and freedom of others."


6.   On the facts of this case, the only  material  ground  relates  to  the
    economic well-being of the country.  That  entitled  the  appellant  to
    ensure that there are  sufficient  funds  available  to  avoid  married
    couples where one party is not a British or UK citizen needing to  have
    recourse to any form of public  funding.   The  amount  of  �18,600  as
    income is designed to ensure that there is  no  such  recourse.   In  a
    recent decision R (MM & Others) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWHC  1900  (Admin)  Blake  J  considered  the  Rules
    relating to partners joining or remaining with  British  citizens.   He
    was persuaded that the figure of �18,600 was  not  justified.   It  was
    apparently  reached  following  advice  from  the  Migration   Advisory
    Committee as a figure which, albeit  significantly  in  excess  of  the
    minimum wage amounts, precluded any grant  of  public  funds  including
    housing benefit.  He decided that  the  combination  of  the  financial
    requirements set out in the Rule  was  beyond  a  reasonable  means  of
    giving effect to the legitimate aim provided for by Article 8.2.

7.   Blake J received some evidence from the appellant to  seek  to  explain
    why the amount of �18,600 was specified.  A level of income  above  the
    basic subsistence level for income support was needed  to  provide,  as
    the witness before Blake J stated, 'a reasonable  degree  of  assurance
    that  UK  based  sponsors  and  their  migrant  partner  could  support
    themselves and any dependants financially over the long-term  and  that
    the migrant partner's integration in the UK would not be  inhibited  by
    lack of financial resources'.

8.   The Supreme Court has made it clear in Quila v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2012] 1 AC 241 that  an  inability  of  a  British
    citizen to continue to reside in the UK because he or she  has  entered
    into a marriage or permanent relationship with a foreign citizen is  an
    interference with that citizen's right to family life and right to live
    in the country of his or her nationality.   Financial  self-sufficiency
    is, as Blake J indicated at paragraph 100 of his judgment, a legitimate
    consideration.

9.   In our view, the criticisms  levelled  by  Blake  J  at  the  financial
    requirements in the Rules are entirely persuasive.   However,  we  were
    informed that MM is under appeal.  As will become clear, it is  in  our
    judgment not necessary to determine this case by refusing to apply  the
    amounts in the Rule.

10.  The fundamental point is that it  is  not  for  the  appellant  in  the
    Rules, even though they are approved by Parliament, to dictate what  is
    proportionate within Article 8.2 for all cases.  The Tribunal  and  the
    courts will give considerable weight to the requirements set out in the
    Rules but they must decide for themselves whether on the  facts  of  an
    individual case a refusal to allow a genuine partner to remain  in  the
    UK is proportionate.  It may be that in many, probably the majority  of
    cases, a failure to meet the requirements of the Rules will mean that a
    refusal is proportionate.   But  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  judicial
    decision makers to consider whether on the facts of an individual  case
    such a refusal is indeed proportionate.

11.  We accept that, as the Tribunal recognised in MF (Nigeria) [2012]  UKUT
    00393 (IAC), the Rules can properly be said to indicate the view  taken
    of the public interest in relation to the interference with family life
    caused by the Rules.  This, as we accept, means that a failure to  meet
    the requirements of the Rule is a  very  significant  consideration  in
    reaching a conclusion on proportionality.   Nevertheless,  there  is  a
    duty to  consider  whether  a  refusal  is  in  all  the  circumstances
    proportionate.

12.  The second requirement which the respondent was said to have failed  to
    meet lay in the failure to show that there was an insuperable  obstacle
    to the couple residing in Nigeria.  We  are  far  from  satisfied  that
    there is a burden on an applicant  to  demonstrate  that  there  is  an
    insuperable obstacle.

13.  First, it is far from clear that that is  the  correct  test  to  apply
    when considering proportionality.  While there is some indication  that
    the ECtHR may be leaning towards that test, the decision of  the  House
    of Lords in Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 2
    AC 167 establishes the test to be applied in the UK.  In  paragraph  20
    of the committee's opinion delivered by Lord Bingham, this is said:-

         "In an Article 8 case... the ultimate question  for  the  appellate
         immigration authority is whether the refusal of leave to  enter  or
         remain, in circumstances  where  the  life  of  the  family  cannot
         reasonably be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere, taking full account
         of all considerations weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices
         the family life of the applicant in a manner  sufficiently  serious
         to amount to a breach of the fundamental right protected by Article
         8.  It is not necessary that the appellate authority... need ask in
         addition whether the case meets a test of exceptionality."


    Lord Bingham indicates that it was to be expected that  the  number  of
    claimants not covered by the Rules as they then existed would be a very
    small minority.


14.   An  'insurmountable  obstacle'  test  seems  to  go  beyond  what   is
    comprehended by a test based on whether family life can  reasonably  be
    expected to be enjoyed elsewhere.  However, it is not necessary for  us
    to decide whether the 'insurmountable  obstacle'  test  is  appropriate
    since  proportionality  can  be  decided  outside  the  Rules  if   the
    circumstances so dictate.

15.  There is however a second concern.  As we have said, it is  clear  that
    the burden rests on the appellant to show that  the  interference  with
    family life is proportionate.  To set financial  requirements  or,  for
    example, a need for an ability to  understand,  read  and  converse  in
    English to a particular level and to follow the requirements of society
    here, produces no difficulty.  However, merely to assert that there  is
    no insuperable obstacle putting the burden on an applicant to establish
    that there is seems to us to  impose  an  unjustifiable  burden  on  an
    applicant.  An applicant whether for leave to enter or  remain  has  to
    answer questions whether at interview  or  in  writing.   It  would  be
    simple for questions to be included which deal with  whether  there  is
    any such obstacle.  The appellant would then be able to  judge  whether
    the applicant qualified.

16.  As we have said, the decision letter stated:-

         "It  has...  been  determined  that  there  are  no  insurmountable
         obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside  the
         UK."


    On the facts of this case, both husband and wife were working  in  this
    country.  The respondent's wife (whose rights should  have  been  given
    separate consideration as a British citizen having not only a right  to
    enjoy family life but to be able to live in her native country) had  no
    knowledge of or connection with Nigeria.  Neither husband nor wife  had
    a job there so that it would,  apart  from  the  personal  difficulties
    created by that lack of employment and income,  not  be  unexpected  if
    Nigeria refused entry to the respondent's wife.  It clearly would if it
    applied  immigration  laws  which  were   anything   like   our   laws.
    Furthermore, the inability to live together here having regard  to  the
    respondent's wife's background and family ties would inevitably  put  a
    great strain on the marriage.


17.  Again, we do not need  to  decide  for  the  purposes  of  this  appeal
    whether the failure to obtain any information from the respondent  does
    show an unlawful imposition of a burden  on  the  respondent.   We  are
    content, despite our concerns, to approach this case, as Judge  Ghaffar
    did, on the  basis  that  there  was  a  failure  to  meet  the  lawful
    requirements of the Rules.

18.  Since the financial requirements are aimed at ensuring  that  there  is
    no likelihood of recourse to public funds, it is pertinent to  consider
    the full circumstances.  The respondent fell short of the �18,600 by  a
    relatively small amount.  The parties were both working and  there  was
    no suggestion that there had been any recourse to public funds nor that
    there was or would be a need for any such recourse.  Whatever may  have
    been the reasoning which  led  to  the  imposition  of  the  figure  of
    �18,600, it clearly was too high so far as this couple  was  concerned.
    Judge Ghaffar in our view correctly observed:-

         "The earnings of the couple amounts  to  adequate  maintenance  and
         this not a situation when the couple are  required  to  live  below
         what is generally acceptable standard - the income support level."

19.  Judge Ghaffar concluded that there were a number  of  positive  factors
    which persuaded him that refusal of the respondent's application  would
    be disproportionate.  We are satisfied that he was entitled to conclude
    as he did.  It was obvious albeit there was  no  evidence  which  dealt
    specifically with it that to make the couple live in Nigeria  (assuming
    that  was  possible)  would  create  serious   difficulties   for   the
    respondent's wife in particular and  would  inevitably  place  a  great
    strain on the marriage.  Even though great weight was to be accorded to
    the criteria set out in the Rules, this was an example of a  rare  case
    in which in all the circumstances to find that  the  Article  8  rights
    prevailed was justified.

20.   We  can  only  allow  an  appeal  if  persuaded  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision was vitiated by an error of  law.   While  we  have
    raised issues which in our view suggest that the Rules and practice  as
    they stand may be unsatisfactory, we have reached our  decision  taking
    the Rules at  face  value.   While  it  may  be  that  Judge  Ghaffar's
    reasoning and in particular his  reliance  on  MM  may  not  have  been
    entirely correct, we are  satisfied  that  the  decision  allowing  the
    respondent's appeal was not wrong in law.  Quite the contrary:  we  are
    satisfied that it was correct  and  we  would  have  reached  the  same
    conclusion.

21.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
