                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a national  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State  of  5th  January
    2016 to refuse his  application  for  a  permanent  residence  card  as
    confirmation of his  right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
    Regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.   First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Carlin  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a   decision
    promulgated on 19th May  2017.   The  Appellant  now  appeals  to  this
    Tribunal  with  permission  granted  by   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
    Nightingale on 30th November 2017.

Background

 2. The Appellant entered the UK on 26th March 2007. His wife is a national
    of Lithuania who was issued with a Worker  Registration  Card  on  10th
    October 2007. The couple married on 30 November 2007 in Lithuania.  The
    Appellant was granted a residence card on 5th July 2010, the  Secretary
    of State accepted that his EEA Sponsor had completed the twelve  months
    required  under  the  Workers'  Registration  Scheme.    The  Appellant
    applied on 3rd July 2015 for a permanent residence card as  the  family
    member of an EEA national who has  resided  in  the  UK  with  the  EEA
    national in accordance with  the  2006  Regulations  for  a  continuous
    period of five years.  The Secretary of State accepted in  the  reasons
    for refusal letter that the EEA Sponsor was  employed  from  30th  July
    2010 until 1st January 2013.  The Secretary of State noted that the EEA
    Sponsor claims to have become self-employed after this date but did not
    accept that the evidence provided with the application  was  sufficient
    to demonstrate that the EEA Sponsor had been economically active in the
    UK as a self-employed person.

 3.  In  his  decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Carlin  identified  at
    paragraph 20 that the issue to be  determined  was  whether  there  was
    evidence of the EEA Sponsor's self-employment during  the  period  from
    2nd January 2013 to 29th July 2015.  The judge considered a  number  of
    documents submitted by the Appellant and concluded  that  the  evidence
    did not demonstrate that the Sponsor had been self-employed during that
    period and therefore that  she  had  been  a  qualified  person  for  a
    continuous period of five years.

 4. It is contended in the Grounds of Appeal that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in misdirecting himself by failing to consider the evidence
    of self-employment in the round which would have led to the  conclusion
    that the EEA Sponsor was a qualified person during the relevant  period
    of time.  The grounds highlight that the judge considered the documents
    separately  without  considering  them  all  together.    In   granting
    permission First-tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale  considered  that  the
    grounds were arguable  because  the  judge  appeared  to  consider  the
    documents individually rather than in the round and that  it  was  also
    arguable that the judge overlooked some of the documents including HMRC
    records relating to the period of self-employment.

Error of law

 5. At the outset of the hearing before me Mr Clarke conceded that he could
    no longer defend the appeal.  This was because the EEA Sponsor has been
    granted permanent residence in the UK in a decision notified to her  in
    a letter dated 25th July 2017.  That letter noted that,  based  on  the
    information provided with her application, the EEA Sponsor  was  deemed
    to have acquired permanent residence in the UK on 15th  December  2015.
    Mr Lee submitted a copy of the letter from the Home Office along with a
    copy of the permanent residence card and other  documents  relating  to
    the Sponsor's self-employed status.

 6. I take into account Mr Clarke's concession. I have also considered this
    letter  along  with  the  evidence  which  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  In my view  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  his
    approach to the evidence as to the EEA Sponsor's self-employment.   The
    judge considered the documentation at paragraphs 20  to  31.   I  agree
    with the contention in the Grounds of Appeal that the judge appears  to
    have considered the documentation separately without  considering  them
    altogether in the round.  As properly identified the period in  dispute
    was 2nd January 2013 to 29th July 2015.

 7. The evidence before the judge included a letter  dated  3rd  July  2015
    from the EEA Sponsor's accountants detailing her net  profits  for  the
    years 2014/15 and  2015/16.   However  the  judge  did  not  find  this
    satisfactory as it did not cover the whole of the period in question as
    it did not cover the period up to  29th  July  2015.   The  judge  also
    looked at the tax returns for  the  years  2013/14  and  2014/15.   The
    profit and loss accounts were also considered.  In relation to each  of
    these pieces of evidence the judge noted  that  the  evidence  did  not
    confirm "continuous self-employment".  The judge also had a letter from
    Arrow Transport Limited dated 26th January 2016 stating  that  the  EEA
    Sponsor was subcontracting on a self-employed basis.   The  judge  also
    referred at paragraph 29 to evidence from  EDG  Transport  saying  that
    self-employment began on 4th March 2013 but the judge  considered  that
    there was no evidence to cover the period 2nd January 2013 to 3rd March
    2013.

 8. In my view it is clear  that  the  judge  considered  these  pieces  of
    evidence separately without looking at the cumulative effect of all  of
    these pieces of documentary evidence to see  whether,  when  considered
    altogether, that evidence was capable of  demonstrating  that  the  EEA
    Sponsor was self-employed during the disputed period.

 9. In my view the  judge's  failure  to  consider  all  of  this  evidence
    together in order to ascertain whether the relevant period was  covered
    amounts to an error of law.  As this error of law goes to the  core  of
    the Appellant's appeal I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal cannot stand and I set it aside.

Remaking the Decision

10. I attach significant weight to the letter from the  Home  Office  dated
    25th July 2017 indicating  that  the  EEA  Sponsor  acquired  permanent
    residence on 15th December 2015. The Home Office clearly  accepted  the
    evidence in relation to the EEA Sponsor's self-employment  up  to  that
    date.

11. I have also considered  the  evidence  in  the  Appellant's  First-tier
    Tribunal bundle.  I note the National Insurance contributions  document
    at page 2  of  the  bundle  which  confirms  the  payment  of  national
    insurance as a self-employed person from 28th  April  2013  until  11th
    April 2015.  I also take account of the documents at pages 4 and  5  of
    the Appellant's bundle which confirm the payment of  income  tax  as  a
    self-employed person for the tax year 2013/14 and 2014/15.  I also take
    into account the letter from Arrow Transport dated  26th  January  2016
    confirming that the Sponsor was working at that time as a self-employed
    driver from 12th May 2014.  I take  account  of  the  profit  and  loss
    account for the year 2013/14 and 2014/15 at  pages  60  to  63  of  the
    Appellant's bundle.  I have considered all  of  this  evidence  in  the
    round and I am satisfied that this evidence establishes on the  balance
    of probabilities that the  Sponsor  was  employed  as  a  self-employed
    person over the period between 2nd January 2013 until 29th July 2015.

12. The Secretary of State has not raised any issue as to the nature of the
    relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor nor is any  previous
    period of employment in dispute.

13. On the basis of all of the evidence before me I am satisfied  that  the
    Appellant has discharged the burden upon him to establish  that  he  is
    the family member of an EEA national under Regulation 15(1)(b)  of  the
    2006 Regulations as he has resided in the UK with the EEA  national  in
    accordance with the 2006 Regulations for a continuous  period  of  five
    years.

Notice of Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.  I set that decision aside.  I remake that  decision  by  allowing
    the Appellant's appeal under the 2006 Regulations.

15. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal.  I make a fee award of  any  fee  that  has  been
paid because the Appellant provided sufficient evidence to the Secretary  of
State to demonstrate that the Sponsor was exercising  treaty  rights  as  an
EEA national during the relevant period.
