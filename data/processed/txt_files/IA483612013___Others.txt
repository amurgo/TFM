                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth promulgated 2.10.14, allowing
    the claimants' appeals against the decisions of the Secretary of State,
    dated 6.11.13, to refuse their applications to vary leave to remain  as
    a Tier 2 (General) migrant and dependant wife and child, and to  remove
    them from the  UK  by  way  of  directions  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 24.6.14 and 9.9.14.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Froom  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.11.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 10.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Hollingworth should be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Froom found  it  arguable  that
    the judge erred by misdirecting himself in law in the manner  described
    in the grounds seeking permission  to  appeal,  all  of  which  may  be
    argued. In particular, it is arguable the judge failed to recognise the
    limited pull of private life factors in the case of appellants who were
    in the UK for temporary purposes, as explained in Patel and Nasim.

 6. I was presented at the hearing with a plethora of relevant case law:

      a) Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC);

      b) E-A (Article 8 -best interests of child) Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  315
         (IAC);

      c) Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74;

      d) EV (Philippines) & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874;

      e) R (on the application of Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v SSHD (Article
         8 - MM (Lebanon) and Nagre IJR [2014] UKUT 539 (IAC);

      f) JO and Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC).

 7. I have considered all of these case authorities  and  taken  them  into
    account, together with the  skeleton  argument  of  Mr  Hussain,  dated
    9.9.14, and the submissions of the representatives before me.

 8. For the reasons set out herein, I found that the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal was vitiated by errors such that it could not  stand  and
    had to be set aside and  remade.  Having  made  that  decision  at  the
    hearing  before  me  I  then  heard  further   submissions   from   the
    representatives of the appellant and the claimants. Mr Hussain did  not
    seek to adduce any further evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing I
    reserved my decision on the remaking of the appeal, which I now give.

 9. As the decision in the case, and indeed the conclusion of the  hearing,
    did not take place until September and  October  2014,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was required to take into account section  117B  of  the  2002
    Act.

10. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    first claimant  entered  the  UK  in  2005  as  a  student.  Leave  was
    subsequently extended on a number of occasions until 14.10.13. Two days
    before the expiry of leave the first claimant applied for further leave
    to remain as a Tier 2  (General)  Migrant,  with  his  wife  and  child
    applying as his dependants.

11. The application was  refused  on  6.11.13  because,  first,  the  first
    claimant failed to demonstrate and provide evidence that he  had  taken
    and completed a UK recognised degree qualification, or  equivalent,  as
    required by paragraph 245HD(d) of the  Immigration  Rules.  Second,  he
    failed to qualify for the necessary 30 points under Appendix A  because
    the educational sponsor providing the Certificate of Sponsorship  (COS)
    had not performed an appropriate resident labour market test as defined
    in Appendix A and the Codes of Practice under Appendix J.

12. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal raised only in general
    terms that the decision was not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration
    Rules; unreasonable; and contrary to the claimants' human rights.

13. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing  it  became  clear  that  the  first
    claimant was still studying, although he worked for a brief  period  of
    time. He claimed that he had been badly advised by  legal  advisers  in
    making a Tier 2 application. However, he had made no formal complaint.

14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge does not deal with the Tier 2 part of the
    application and reached no conclusion about the same. At �13 it appears
    that counsel for the claimants conceded that  they  did  not  meet  the
    Rules. I can only assume that means both those Rules in relation to the
    Tier 2 application and those in relation to  private  and  family  life
    contained in paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM.  The  judge's  attention
    was drawn to section 177B.

15. In considering the decision as a whole,  I  find  that  the  judge  has
    conflated the family and private life issues in the case,  and  in  the
    process failed to take sufficient account of the public interest in the
    article 8 private and family life assessment, having  decided  at  �19,
    following Gulshan, that  there  were  good  grounds  for  going  on  to
    consider article 8 outside the Rules on the basis that the decision was
    unjustifiably harsh.

16. Even before embarking on the article 8 assessment, the judge had At �17
    the judge purported to allow the appeal on the basis that the Secretary
    of State had not considered section 55 of the Borders  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 in respect of the two children of the family, then
    aged 5 (the third claimant) and 3,  but  not  a  claimant.  It  is  not
    necessary for the judge to make such a finding and allow the appeal  on
    that basis, as he can apply the  correct  law  and  consider  the  best
    interests of the children within the parameters of the  appeal  hearing
    before him, as he purports to have done at �27. If the judge was  going
    to allow the appeal on the basis that the decision of the Secretary  of
    State was not in accordance with the law,  then  the  correct  approach
    should have been to allow the appeal on the limited basis  so  that  it
    remained for the Secretary of State to make  a  decision  which  is  in
    accordance with the law, effectively sending the decision back  to  the
    Secretary of State.

17. In JO the President held that the duty imposed by section  55  required
    the decision maker to be properly informed of the position of  a  child
    affected by  the  discharge  of  an  immigration  act  function.  "Thus
    equipped, the decision maker must conduct a careful examination of  all
    relevant information and factors." This and "a scrupulous analysis  are
    elementary prerequisites to the inter-related tasks of identifying  the
    child's best interests and then  balancing  them  with  other  material
    considerations."

18. Whilst the judge was right to consider as a  primary  factor  the  best
    interests of the children, the way  in  which  this  was  done  in  the
    decision amounted to an error  of  law.  In  deciding  at  �17,  before
    embarking on the article 8  assessment,  that  the  appeals  should  be
    allowed on the basis of the  failure  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    consider section 55, the First-tier Tribunal pre-judged  the  Razgar  5
    step  assessment  and  in  particular  the  proportionality   balancing
    exercise. Nothing was being balanced against those best  interests  and
    no account was taken of the public interest  before  the  decision  was
    made.

19. The judge then went on from  �18  to  allow  the  appeals  on  what  he
    described as a further and separate basis, namely article 8  ECHR,  the
    consideration of which followed from �22 onwards.

20. At �25 the judge found the first four  criteria  of  Razgar  were  met,
    without explaining in  what  way  the  removal  decision  created  such
    interference with either family or private life so as to engage article
    8 ECHR. The judge appears to have concentrated on  finding  that  there
    was family life in the UK, which was not in issue in  the  appeal.  The
    claimants would have been removed together to Nepal, where  they  would
    be able to continue their family life.

21. In relation to proportionality, section 117B  had  been  drawn  to  the
    judge's attention and  at  �24  he  stated  that  he  had  applied  the
    criteria, Given the contents of �26  it  may  be  that  the  judge  had
    section 117B in mind at that state.

22. At �27 the judge returned to section 55 and  found  that  it  would  be
    "wholly undesirable" to uproot the five year old child from the  school
    environment on the basis that the child would  be  "transferred  to  an
    environment with which she was unfamiliar to a degree which  would  not
    be in her best interests without full and proper  preparation  for  the
    transition. However, as previously suggested, neither at this point nor
    elsewhere in the decision does the judge take any proper account of the
    public interest in requiring  removal  from  the  UK  as  part  of  the
    proportionality balancing exercise.

23. In relation to children, the Court of Appeal at �35 of EV (Philippines)
    set out factors to be considered in assessing  the  best  interests  of
    children. These include: (a) the age; (b) the length of time that  they
    have been here; (c) how long they have been in education; (d)  to  what
    extent they have become distanced from  the  country  to  which  it  is
    proposed that they be returned; (e) how renewable their connection with
    it may be; (f) to what extent they will  have  linguistic,  medical  or
    other difficulties in adapting to life in that  country;  and  (g)  the
    extent to which the course proposed will interfere  with  their  family
    life or their rights (if they have any) as British citizens." The Court
    of Appeal went on to emphasis the "strong weight to  be  given  to  the
    need to maintain immigration control in pursuit of the  economic  well-
    being of the country and the fact that,  ex-hypothesi,  the  applicants
    have no entitlement to remain."

24. In ZH (Tanzania) Baroness Hale stated that what matters is not so  much
    the form of the inquiry but rather whether there has  been  substantive
    consideration of the best interests of the child. If  all  the  factors
    weighed in the  best  interests  overwhelmingly  in  favour  the  child
    remaining in the UK, that is very likely to mean that only very  strong
    countervailing factors can outweigh it.

25. One of the difficulties with this decision is that whilst the judge has
    given every consideration to the best interests of the children,  there
    was no reference to the countervailing factors, or  consideration  that
    their best interests are undoubtedly going to be to remain  with  their
    parents and whether that included returning with their parents to Nepal
    and the culture and society of the family. The judge also seems to have
    ignored the fact that neither parents nor children are British citizens
    and have no rights to education or other benefits of life  in  the  UK.
    Whilst the third claimant is in school, at the young age  she  and  her
    sibling are, their primary focus will have been around the family  home
    in which their mother, at least, speaks Nepalese and  immersed  in  the
    culture of their parents' and their own nationality.

26. In Zoumbas, Lord Hodge in submitting the  unanimous  judgement  of  the
    Supreme Court stated at �24 that,

         "No doubt it would have been possible to have  stated  that,  other
         things being equal, it was in the best interests  of  the  children
         that they and their parents stayed in the UK  so  that  they  could
         obtain such  benefits  as  health  care  and  education  which  the
         decision-maker recognised might be of a higher standard than  would
         be available in the Congo. But other things were  not  equal.  They
         were not British citizens. They had no right  to  future  education
         and health in this country. They were part of a  close-knit  family
         with highly  educated  parents  and  were  of  an  age  when  their
         emotional needs could only be fully met within the immediate family
         unit. Such integration as had occurred into UK society  would  have
         been predominately in the context of that family unit."

27. Lord Hodge could have been speaking of  the  children  in  the  present
    appeal, as much of what was stated applies to them. Obviously,  removal
    from schooling in the UK will cause some disruption, but at their young
    age that is necessarily going to be temporary and  very  limited.  With
    respect  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  nothing   about   their
    circumstances suggests anything other than  one  might  expect  of  the
    dependant children  of  students  present  in  the  UK  on  a  strictly
    temporary basis. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see  how  the
    best interests of these children were such as to  require  them  to  be
    allowed to remain in the UK on the basis of their  private  life  under
    article 8.

28. To similar effect is the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  E-A,  where
    at �40 the Tribunal noted that although the children in that case  (who
    had just started primary school) had been in the UK for a  considerable
    period of time, "the nature and degree of private life that  they  have
    forged is such that it is still of a very personal, intra-family nature
    in the main, with the focus on the home and family, although they  have
    begun to take their first tentative steps toward socialisation and  the
    world outside the family." At �42 the Tribunal recognised that whilst a
    move to Nigeria would require some adaptation to a new home, new school
    and church, "we see no  reason  why  that  should  not  be  a  positive
    experience for the children who will be supported  by  their  parents."
    The Tribunal went on to note the factors that made such a move  easier.
    At �43 the Tribunal stated, "It is important to  recall  that  although
    the appellants may all have been here lawfully, they came to the UK for
    a temporary purpose with no expectation of being able to remain in  the
    UK. The third appellant happened to  be  born  in  the  UK  whilst  her
    parents were here for a temporary purpose.  The  expectation  was  that
    they would all return to Nigeria once  the  first  appellant's  studies
    were completed. Those who have their families with them during a period
    of study in the UK must do so in  the  light  of  that  expectation  of
    return."

29. That leads me on to the absence of consideration  in  the  decision  of
    matters relevant to the private life rights  of  the  adult  claimants.
    Following Nasim and Patel, it is clear that whilst each  case  must  be
    considered on its own merits, the temporary presence of an immigrant in
    the UK for the purpose of study or work does not normally give rise  to
    a degree of private life the interference of which  caused  by  removal
    would be sufficiently grave to engage article 8(2).  Article  8(2)  has
    limited utility in such cases which are far removed from  the  physical
    and moral integrity of the individual.

30. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

31. The panel considered at length article 8 in the  context  of  work  and
    studies. The respondent's case was that none of  the  appellants  could
    demonstrate removal would have such grave  consequences  as  to  engage
    article 8. �57 of Patel stated,  "It  is  important  to  remember  that
    article 8 is not a general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished
    from the Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
    outside the rules, which  may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected  human
    right... The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under article 8."

32. At �14 of Nasim [2014], the panel stated:

         "Whilst the concept  of  a  "family  life"  is  generally  speaking
         readily identifiable, the concept  of  a  "private  life"  for  the
         purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear.  At one end of  the
         "continuum" stands the concept of moral and physical  integrity  or
         "physical and psychological integrity" (as categorised by the ECtHR
         in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 1)  as  to  which,  in
         extreme instances, even the state's interest  in  removing  foreign
         criminals might not constitute a proportionate response.   However,
         as one moves down the continuum, one encounters aspects of  private
         life which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not  alone,  then  in
         combination with other factors) are so far removed from the  "core"
         of Article 8 as to be readily defeasible by state  interests,  such
         as the importance of maintaining a credible and coherent system  of
         immigration control."

33. The panel pointed out  that  at  this  point  on  the  continuum,  "the
    essential elements of the private  life  relied  on  will  normally  be
    transposable, in the sense of being capable  of  replication  in  their
    essential respects, following a person's return to their home  country,
    (�15)" and (�20) recognised "its limited utility to an individual where
    one has moved along the continuum, from that  Article's  core  area  of
    operation towards what might be described as its  fuzzy  penumbra.  The
    limitation arises, both from what will at that point  normally  be  the
    tangential effect on the individual of the  proposed  interference  and
    from the fact that, unless there are particular reasons to  reduce  the
    public interest of enforcing immigration controls, that  interest  will
    consequently prevail in  striking  the  proportionality  balance  (even
    assuming that stage is reached)."

34. Absent from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is reference to any
    of the case law cited above.

35. In the light of the case law it is difficult to see on what  basis  the
    First-tier Tribunal could find that there was a  breach  of  the  first
    claimant's private life rights. Between �28 and �30 the  judge  recites
    the educational and career ambitions of the first claimant and seems to
    find that the public interest would be met by allowing him to  continue
    to complete his studies. The judge also described his  desire  to  work
    for a year in the UK as an entirely justified aspiration.

36. However, he has no legitimate expectation of being able to  remain  and
    no right to study or work in the UK. The length of time  the  claimants
    had been in the UK  was  a  relevant  factor,  as  was  the  extent  of
    integration into society during the years they have been in the UK. But
    the fact remains that their presence here was  always  intended  to  be
    temporary. There was a route for leave to remain  in  the  capacity  of
    student for further studies, but he had not applied for  it  and  there
    was no credible evidence to support his claim that he  had  been  badly
    legally advised.

37. Further, the judge had taken no account of the fact that the  claimants
    had not been able to meet any of the Rules for leave to remain, whether
    as a Tier 2 migrant and dependants or under Appendix  FM  or  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules. I find that the judge failed to  apply
    the relevant case law to the facts of the case and  to  recognise  that
    the claimants could have had no legitimate expectation of being able to
    remain in the UK except in accordance  with  those  Immigration  Rules.
    Article 8 is not intended to be a one-stop-shop shortcut to  compliance
    with the Immigration Rules. There is no reason on  the  facts  of  this
    case why the claimants could not continue to develop their private life
    in Nepal and maintain such associations and friendships they  may  have
    made in the UK through modern means of communication. It is commonplace
    that not only friends, but close family members relocate  to  different
    areas of the world far apart from each other, but keep  in  touch  with
    each other.

38. It is not clear at this stage of the decision  whether  the  judge  was
    considering private or family life factors, but by �32 the judge  found
    there would be a breach of the first claimant's rights and a breach  of
    the second claimant's family life rights. The judge  also  found  there
    would be a breach of the children's article 8 family life, on the basis
    that the family should remain together. It is not clear why or for what
    purpose  the  judge  devoted  such  a  significant  proportion  of  the
    consideration to whether or not family life existed, which was  not  in
    issue. Quite how there could be a breach of family life given that they
    would be removed together is difficult to see. The judge then  went  on
    to purport to give a recommendation that the claimants be permitted  to
    remain for two years, which is a matter for the Secretary of State. The
    judge appears to have made no acknowledgement that  family  life  could
    continue in Nepal, with the entire family together.

39. For the reasons set out above, I find that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal contained such errors of law that  it  cannot  stand  and
    must be set aside. Having set it aside,  I  heard  further  submissions
    from the representatives of the claimants and the  Secretary  of  State
    and reserved the decision in the appeal.

40. It is obvious, for the reasons stated, and Mr  Hussain  conceded,  that
    the claimants cannot, even now, meet the requirements of Appendix FM or
    paragraph 276 of the Immigration Rules.

41. Since the First-tier Tribunal hearing, the first claimant has continued
    to study  and  completed  further  exams.  He  has  two  further  exams
    outstanding, however, the college will not let him return unless he can
    demonstrate he has leave. As his leave continued pending the series  of
    appeals, there is no reason why  the  first  claimant  could  not  have
    continued, at least until the outcome of this appeal.

42. Mr Hussain seemed to place considerable reliance on the fact  that  the
    first claimant has property and investments in the UK. He  also  relied
    on the fact that the claimants had not broken  the  law  or  relied  on
    public funds. However, those factors do not outweigh  or  diminish  the
    public interest in removal. I find it  a  rather  surprising  assertion
    that a person should have a greater claim to  remain  under  article  8
    because they have property and investments in the UK.

43. I bear in mind that the first claimant has come close to completing his
    studies, but again I have to point out that if he wanted to  remain  in
    that capacity he should have  made  an  application  for  that  on  the
    correct form. He has no inherent right to study in the UK or remain for
    work except in strict accordance with the Immigration Rules. I  do  not
    know why he has not made such an application before  now,  even  whilst
    these proceedings were pending. I find the complaint that he was  badly
    advised entirely unsatisfactory, especially since he has failed to make
    any formal complaint about the conduct of his case. The  fact  that  it
    may well be still open to the claimant to make  a  further  application
    for leave to remain as  a  student  must  surely  be  relevant  to  the
    proportionality of the decision to refuse the Tier 2 application and in
    consequence seek to remove the claimants.

44. As Judge Hollingworth did,  I  also  take  full  account  of  the  best
    interests of the children in relation to  section  55,  and  take  into
    account the same factors set out by the First-tier  Tribunal  decision.
    However, in the light of their ages and circumstances it is very  clear
    that their overwhelming best interests are  to  return  to  Nepal  with
    their parents, remaining in the family unit. For the  reasons  set  out
    above in some detail, I do not accept that any private life rights they
    may have acquired through limited  exposure  to  life  in  the  UK  can
    sensibly be considered to outweigh the very strong public  interest  in
    enforcing  immigration  control.  Neither  is  there  any   basis   for
    considering that the family life rights could amount  to  a  basis  for
    permitting them to remain when they cannot meet the requirements of the
    Rules to do so.

45. In relation to section 117B I consider that the claimants' position  in
    the UK is precarious and thus limited weight should  be  given  to  any
    private life accrued in the UK. Whilst there is extant leave by  virtue
    of section 3C, it has been plain for some time that the first  claimant
    could never meet the requirements of Tier 2 and without an  application
    for leave to remain as a student, he can only expect to be required  to
    leave the UK.

46. In my view, taking all the evidence and the  submissions  together,  in
    the round, it is very  clear  that  neither  family  nor  private  life
    interference is sufficiently grave as to engage article 8. Even if I am
    wrong on that, I further find, for the reasons set out above,  that  in
    the proportionality balancing exercise between  on  the  one  hand  the
    rights of the claimants individually and as a family and on  the  other
    the legitimate and necessary aim of protecting the economic  well-being
    of the  UK  through  immigration  control,  the  decision  is  entirely
    proportionate  and  not  disproportionate  to  the  claimants'  rights.
    Neither can the decision be considered as unjustifiably harsh, or it be
    otherwise unreasonable to expect the claimants to return to  Nepal  and
    continue their family and private life there.

Conclusion & Decision

47. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal of  each
                    claimant on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
