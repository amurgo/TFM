Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel, instructed by Duncan Lewis
                    & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of Mr Renugoban [M] brought against the decision  of
    Judge Chana following a hearing at Harmondsworth on 10th June 2016.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He sought asylum  in  the  UK.
    He was refused on 17th March 2015 and appealed to the Immigration Judge
    who dismissed the appeal.

 3. The appellant filed grounds challenging the determination on the  basis
    that the judge acted irrationally in discounting the  medical  evidence
    from the Medical Foundation. Moreover she  failed  to  have  regard  to
    relevant evidence, for example in relation to his wife's statement, the
    appellant's flight ticket, and a number of letters.

 4. Permission to appeal  was  originally  refused  but  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge  Blum.  He  observed  that  the  basis  of  the  judge's
    conclusions relating to issue of consistency appeared to be speculative
    and unsupported by any evidence before her.

Notice of Decision

 5. Mr Duffy for the Secretary of State, did not disagree  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge's comments, and accepted that  the  determination  could
    not stand.

 6. It is set aside and will be reheard by a judge other than  judge  Chana
    at the next available date.



No anonymity direction is made.
