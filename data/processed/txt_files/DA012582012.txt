                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, Ms EM, was born  in  Zimbabwe  36  years  ago,  and  has
    apparently been living in the United Kingdom (although not with  leave)
    since 1999.  In 2001 she gave birth to a son, SS,  who  has  a  hearing
    impairment as a result of meningitis.  Motherhood did not prevent Ms EM
    from embarking in 2002 on what  the  judge  at  Sheffield  Crown  Court
    described as a career  of  crime.   She  had  notched  up  26  previous
    convictions by the time she was convicted in April  2009  at  Sheffield
    Magistrates'  Court  on  19  counts   of   dishonestly   making   false
    representations, and one count of obtaining services by deception.  She
    was committed for sentence to the Crown Court, where the  judge  called
    her "a thoroughly dishonest lady" who had  perpetrated  "sophisticated,
    well-organised crime."  Despite her guilty plea, EM was sentenced to 2ï¿½
    years in prison.

2.   In the meantime, Ms EM had split up from her  partner,  the  father  of
    SS, who is the primary carer of the child and now has leave  to  remain
    as a refugee until 2015.  The boy has leave in line  with  his  father,
    and lives with him in Sheffield, where he receives therapy  to  improve
    his hearing.  His mother has been living in  Milton  Keynes  since  her
    release from detention, and visits him  in  Sheffield  twice  a  month,
    while he also sometimes stays with her.  SS now has a half-sister,  HA,
    born in November 2012 to a Nigerian man who appears to have dropped out
    of the picture.

3.   It was also in November 2012 that a deportation order  was  made  under
    section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The subsequent  appeal  came
    before the First-tier Tribunal on 1st August 2013 and was dismissed  by
    a panel  comprising  Judge  Kelsey  and  Mrs  Lydia  Schmitt,  JP.   An
    application for leave to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  was  initially
    unsuccessful, but permission was  granted  on  renewal,  and  when  the
    matter came before me today Miss McCarthy (who had also appeared below)
    took me through the detailed grounds of appeal which she  had  settled.
    These were vigorously rebutted by Mr Wilding.  I am  grateful  to  both
    representatives for highlighting all the salient points in this appeal,
    and for putting their opposing cases so lucidly.  After  hearing  their
    submissions, it seemed to me that the panel had not made  an  error  of
    law, requiring their determination to be set  aside.   My  reasons  for
    that conclusion are set out below.

4.   I shall first deal with something which clearly is an error, but not  a
    material one.  Ms EM had claimed asylum in 2005, but on  being  granted
    temporary admission she failed to comply with her reporting  conditions
    or to attend for interview.  She claimed asylum again in 2010, when she
    was detained under Immigration Act powers on completing  the  custodial
    part of her sentence.  The claim was rejected, and was certified  under
    s.72(9)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, because
    the length  of  Ms  EM's  sentence  raised  the  presumption  that  she
    constituted a danger to the community.  Under  section  72(10)  of  the
    Act, the panel were obliged to deal first  with  the  certificate.   If
    they upheld it, they  would  have  to  dismiss  the  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds.

5.   The presumption, however, is rebuttable, and  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    must give reasons for finding that the presumption  has,  or  has  not,
    been rebutted.  "We have already", say the panel  at  paragraph  29  of
    their determination, "given our reasons for upholding the certificate."
     But they had given no proper reasons at all.   At  paragraph  6,  they
    observed that the presumption arose  because  the  appellant  had  been
    sentenced to at least two years in prison, and "in those circumstances,
    we are satisfied that  we  must  uphold  the  certificate."   That,  of
    course, does not follow.  The presumption would be irrebuttable,  if  a
    two-year sentence was inevitably sufficient to justify the certificate.
     The panel do, it  is  true,  go  on  to  say  that  in  upholding  the
    certificate, "we have taken into consideration all the  issues  we  set
    out in this determination."  But something more specific is  needed  by
    way of explanation.

6.   As Mr Wilding submits, however, this error is  not  material.   Despite
    upholding the certificate, the panel did in fact go on to consider  the
    asylum  claim,  setting  out  at  paragraphs  30-31  the  plethora   of
    inconsistencies and contradictions in her account, as given at  various
    times, which  deprived  EM's  asylum  claim  of  any  credibility.   At
    paragraph 32 the panel refer to "a  claim  by  the  appellant  and  her
    representatives  that  she  holds  French  citizenship."   That,   Miss
    McCarthy points out, is not so.  It was the Home Office that mistakenly
    believed the appellant to be French.  But the panel's  impression  that
    the mistake was due to the  appellant's  dishonestly  "strengthens  the
    conclusions that the appellant is an untrustworthy witness and that  we
    can place  no  trust  in  the  appellant's  evidence."   Miss  McCarthy
    contends that this erroneous impression wholly undermines  the  panel's
    negative credibility finding.  I do  not  think  it  does.   There  was
    plenty of other  material,  from  the  host  of  discrepancies  in  the
    appellant's account to the  judge's  sentencing  remarks  at  Sheffield
    Crown Court, to justify the conclusion that Ms EM's claim to be at risk
    in Zimbabwe was not to be believed.

7.   This conclusion did not, however, affect the panel's assessment  of  Ms
    EM's relationship with  her  son.   From  what  they  observed  of  the
    interaction between mother and child at the hearing, "there was clearly
    a loving bond between them."   This  observation  at  paragraph  33  is
    reiterated at paragraph 36.  The oral evidence of SS is  summarised  at
    paragraph 21, and Miss McCarthy insists that the panel  have  misquoted
    her when they say that, according to counsel, Ms EM wanted the  boy  to
    say a few words to the panel.  It was SS himself, she says,  who  asked
    for this opportunity.  I do not think  anything  turns  on  this.   The
    panel accepted that there was a close bond between mother and son.  The
    crucial question, as far as error of law is concerned, is  whether  the
    panel included this bond  in  their  weighing  of  the  proportionality
    scales.

8.   At paragraph 36, the panel refer to a shared residence order made by  a
    Family Court.  In fact, no order needed to be made, because the  father
    of SS has no objection to the appellant having contact, and  having  SS
    to stay with her occasionally.  Where  the  panel  really  went  wrong,
    argues Miss McCarthy, was in downplaying the effect on SS of separation
    from his mother, such that it cannot be said that  his  best  interests
    have been properly taken into account.  I do not think that  is  right.
    The panel acknowledged that SS "would miss the visits  of  his  mother"
    and that, if she were outside the UK, "letters and phone  calls  cannot
    be a substitute for personal company."  (Miss McCarthy  doubts  whether
    SS could hear very much over the telephone.)  But the point  which  the
    panel go on to make at paragraphs 37  and  39-40  is  that  the  public
    interest can outweigh even the happiness of  a  child.   They  cite  SS
    (Nigeria) as a case where the private and family life aspects were "not
    sufficiently strong to  prevail  over  the  extremely  pressing  public
    interest in the appellant's deportation."  In SS it was the father  who
    was facing deportation, while the mother was the primary carer,  having
    looked after the child while the father was in prison.  In the  instant
    case, it was the mother who was facing deportation,  while  the  father
    was the primary carer, having looked after the child while  the  mother
    was in prison.

9.   One aspect of  Article  8  which,  Miss  McCarthy  submits,  the  panel
    overlooked altogether is the  relationship  between  SS  and  his  baby
    sister, HA, whom the panel envisage going with her mother to  Zimbabwe.
    Miss McCarthy had included, in her submissions, that SS was very  close
    to his sister, but the panel did not place this factor onto the Article
    8 balance.  I do not think, however, that this omission is material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.  HA was only nine months old when the appeal
    came before the First-tier Tribunal.  The relationship between  SS  and
    HA, half-siblings who did not  live  together,  was  inchoate  at  that
    stage.  It could not carry much weight in the Article 8 balance.

10.  On the other hand, the appellant had, as the  panel  say  at  paragraph
    40, "committed a large number of serious offences."   In  finding  that
    the best interests of SS would be served by continuing to have a stable
    home with his father and contact with his mother, the panel  emphasized
    the stability of the paternal connexion by  supposing  that  there  was
    "still a fair likelihood  that  the  appellant  will  re-offend."   The
    appellant has not re-offended, Miss  McCarthy  reminds  me,  since  her
    release in 2011.  Mr Wilding points to a 'medium' risk of  re-offending
    given in the Home Detention Curfew Report, but as the report  dates  to
    September 2009, that assessment may be out of date.  But as  the  Court
    of Appeal has reminded tribunal judges in OH (Serbia)  and  a  line  of
    other cases, the risk of re-offending is not the most  important  facet
    of the public interest when serious offences have been committed.

11.  At the end of the day, the challenge to  the  First-tier  determination
    comes down to a disagreement about  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
    various factors involved, and matters of  weight  are  classically  not
    matters of law.  Apart from the relationship between SS and HA  (which,
    as I say, is at a very early stage), it cannot be said that  the  panel
    have overlooked material factors.  To put the matter starkly, the panel
    have found the public interest in the prevention of crime  to  outweigh
    the loss to SS of face-to-face contact with his mother.   If  the  best
    interests of the child were the paramount consideration in  deportation
    appeals, the panel would have erred.  But the  best  interests  of  the
    child are not a trump card,  and  I  cannot  say  that  the  panel,  in
    deciding that the Article 8 balance came down on one side  rather  than
    the other, committed an error of law.


     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
