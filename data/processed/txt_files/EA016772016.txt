Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Amir Fouladvand, Legal Representative instructed
                    by Migrant Advisory & Advocacy Service (MAAS)
For the Respondent:    Mr David Clarke, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier  Tribunal  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  the
    respondent to grant him a permanent right of residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a family member with retained rights of  residence  pursuant
    to  Regulation  10(6)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 (as amended).

 2. The appellant was married to an EEA national from 29 November  2010  to
    29 November 2013 when the  marriage  ended.   He  has  ischaemic  heart
    disease and was not able to work very much in 2012/2013  or  2013/2014,
    on the evidence before me.

 3. This appeal came before me on 9 February 2018 and was adjourned to give
    the appellant an opportunity to produce evidence showing  that  he  was
    temporarily unable to work on the date of termination of the  marriage,
    29 November 2013.  The appellant  was  able  to  produce  further  HMRC
    records and sicknotes which are considered below.

Background

 4. The appellant came to the United Kingdom on 22 June 2003 with a student
    visa , which was extended to expire on 31 July 2009. On 4 August  2008,
    he was served with form IS 151A for removal on the basis that he was no
    longer  pursuing  his  studies  at  Life  Line  Learning   Centre.   An
    application on 4 September 2009 to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a
    Tier 4 (Student) Migrant was refused on 12 March 2010 with no right  of
    appeal.

 5. In the meantime, the appellant had met his former wife, an EEA national
    who was present in the United Kingdom.  On 8 April 2009 he applied  for
    a certificate of approval to marry her, and was granted approval  on  7
    October 2009.  The parties married on 29 November  2009.   On  2  March
    2010, the appellant applied for an EEA spouse residence card, which was
    issued on 27 August 2010, valid to 27 August 2015.

 6. Unfortunately, the  marriage  failed.   The  appellant  says  this  was
    because he was the victim of domestic violence at his wife's hands.  He
    has produced a risk assessment  created  by  the  Independent  Domestic
    Violence Advocacy Project, but no police reports or other corroborative
    evidence of the alleged domestic violence. The marriage  was  dissolved
    by  decree absolute on 29 November 2013. It had lasted exactly 4 years.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 7. The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  the  appellant  credible.  The  Judge
    accepted that the marriage had terminated  'in  circumstances  of  some
    abuse' but made  no  finding  whether  the  circumstances  amounted  to
    domestic violence.  He accepted the oral evidence of the appellant that
    his marriage 'was attended by circumstances of  verbal  abuse,  abusive
    accusations  of  infidelity,  violent  argument  and  occasional  petty
    violence, including pushing'.  The appellant submitted to this 'with  a
    resigned and patient mien' until he left the marital home in 2013.  The
    Judge found that even if the appellant  was  able  to  meet  Regulation
    10(5)(d)(iv) on domestic violence grounds, it would not avail him if he
    could not meet the other requirements of Regulation 10(5)(a),  (b)  and
    10(5)(c) with reference to 10(6)(a) or (b).

 8. Paragraphs [12]-[13] of the decision contain the core  of  the  Judge's
    reasoning:

         "12. The principle here is that in order to qualify  as  a  worker,
         the alleged employment  must  be  genuine  and  effective  and  not
         pursued on such a small scale as to be only marginal or  ancillary.
         There is no lower limit on earnings specified in [the Regulations].
          It is necessary, in  deciding  the  issue  whether  employment  is
         effective, to consider all circumstances, including  value  to  the
         employer.  The earnings of  the  appellant  during  the  two  years
         covering the relevant period are to my mind so low that they do not
         give rise to any  ability  whatever  to  be  self-supporting.   The
         annual income received in the last year under consideration is  the
         equivalent of �33 weekly.  ...This is work at  less  than  an  hour
         every day.  It is employment at a very low  level  of  earning  and
         responsibility.  In my view, the employment of  the  appellant  was
         not effective, it was marginal.   This is perhaps affirmed  by  his
         own evidence,  which  I  think  is  truthful  throughout,  that  he
         otherwise subsists on housing  benefits  and  from  the  charitable
         donations of food, cloting  and  other  material  from  his  Church
         congregation.

         13.  I come to the conclusion that the appellant's account, genuine
         and reliable as it is, does not serve to prove effective employment
         at the material time, or any time.  It does not show that he was  a
         worker, other than in a marginal and ancillary capacity, in his own
         right, as if  he  were  an  EEA  national.   This  means  that  the
         appellant does not qualify for a right  of  a  permanent  right  of
         residence as a non-EEA national family member who  has  retained  a
         right of residence. "

 9. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

10. The grounds of appeal are largely a recital of relevant  jurisprudence.
    The core of the appellant's argument is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to engage with evidence that 'in what was deemed  the  remaining
    relevant period of time [between the date of divorce 29  November  2013
    and the end of the 5-year period being 29 November 2013]' the appellant
    had been found unfit for  work  on  17  separate  occasions  between  9
    December 2013 and 1 October 2014, including seven hospital  admissions,
    which  affected  his  working  hours  and  his  income.  The  appellant
    contended that insufficient weight had been placed on his long  service
    (14 years with Ladbrokes) or with his 10 years' service Certificate  of
    Appreciation.  He argued that before his October 2010 surgery,  he  had
    earned much higher amounts, just under  �9000  in  2007-2008  and  over
    �11000 in 2008-2009.

11. Permission to appeal was granted for the following reasons:

         "It is arguable that First-tier Tribunal Judge Gillespie failed  to
         engage properly with the question of whether the  appellant's  work
         between November 2013 and November 2014 was genuine  and  effective
         or marginal and ancillary because it is not clear  that  the  judge
         took account of the appellant's ill  health  evidenced  by  medical
         records which reduced his ability to work even though  he  remained
         employed and thereby affected his earnings.  In  particular,  there
         appears to have been no  consideration  of  Regulation  6(2)  which
         indicates that a person may retain worker status during periods  of
         illness.  As  a  result  it  is  arguable  that  Judge  Gillespie's
         findings  in  relation  to  Regulation  10(6)  of  the   2006   EEA
         Regulations are not sustainable.  Therefore permission is granted".



12. There is no Rule 24 reply in this appeal.  That is the basis  on  which
    the appeal comes before the Upper Tribunal.

The EEA Regulations 2016

13. Regulation 10(6) so far as relevant to this appeal says this:

         "10. (1)      In these Regulations, 'family member who has retained
                  the right of residence' means, subject to  paragraphs  (8)
                  and (9), a person who satisfies a condition  in  paragraph
                  (2), (3), (4) or (5). ...

             (5)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person (A) -
                  (a)  ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or
                      an EEA national with a right of  permanent  residence
                      on  the  termination  of  the   marriage   or   civil
                      partnership of A;
                  (b)      was residing in the United Kingdom in  accordance
                      with these Regulations at the date of termination;
                  (c)  satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
                  (d)  either-
                      (i)  prior to the initiation of the  proceedings  for
                           the termination of  the  marriage  or  the  civil
                           partnership, the marriage  or  civil  partnership
                           had lasted for  at  least  three  years  and  the
                           parties to the marriage or civil partnership  had
                           resided in the United Kingdom for  at  least  one
                           year during its duration; ... or
                      (iv) the continued right of residence in  the  United
                           Kingdom  of  A  is  warranted   by   particularly
                           difficult  circumstances,  such  as  where  A  or
                           another  family  member  has  been  a  victim  of
                           domestic violence whilst the  marriage  or  civil
                           partnership was subsisting.

             (6)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person -
                  (a)  is not an EEA national but would, if the person  were
                      an EEA national, be a worker, a self-employed  person
                      or a self-sufficient person under Regulation 6; or
                  (b)  is the family member of a  person  who  falls  within
                      paragraph (a)".

14. Regulation 6(2) of the 2016 Regulations  is  identical  with  the  2006
    Regulations:

         "6.(2)   A person who is no longer  working  must  continue  to  be
                  treated as a worker provided that the person -
                  (a)  is temporarily unable to work as  the  result  of  an
                      illness or accident".

Upper Tribunal hearing

15. In order to qualify for a permanent  right  of  residence  based  on  a
    retained right of residence, the appellant must be able  to  show  that
    his right of residence continued because on the date of dissolution  of
    the marriage, either his former wife was still exercising Treaty rights
    in the United Kingdom or he was  entitled  to  be  treated  as  an  EEA
    Regulations worker in his own right.

16. The grounds of appeal focus on Regulation 10(6)(a).  The appellant does
    not contend that he can meet Regulation 10(6)(b)  and  so  we  are  not
    concerned with his wife's status as a qualified person  or  acquisition
    of a permanent right of residence on the date of the  decree  absolute,
    29 November 2013. The appellant's grounds of appeal did  not  challenge
    the judge's finding that his employment was  ancillary.   There  is  no
    engagement with  the  reasoning  at  [13]  of  the  decision.   At  the
    beginning of the hearing, Mr Fouladvand for the appellant conceded that
    the judge had been entitled to find that the appellant worked only in a
    marginal and ancillary capacity.   Later  during  his  submissions,  he
    submitted to the contrary, but for the reasons I now give,  I  was  not
    persuaded by that submission.

17. Mr Fouladvand relied on the judgments of the Court of  Justice  of  the
    European Union in D.M. Levin  v  Staatsecretaris  van  Justitie  [1982]
    EUECJ R-53/81 and Deborah Lawrie-Blum v Land  Baden-W�rttemberg  [1986]
    EUECJ R-66/68.  Both decisions were considered and taken  into  account
    by the Court of Appeal in Barry v London Borough  of  Southwark  [2008]
    EWCA Civ 1440 and the Upper Tribunal's guidance in Begum (EEA -  worker
    - jobseeker) Pakistan [2011]  UKUT  00275(IAC),  which  summarised  the
    guidance thus:

         "(1)   When deciding whether an EEA national is a  worker  for  the
         purposes of the EEA Regulations, regard must be  had  to  the  fact
         that the term has a meaning in EU law, that it must be  interpreted
         broadly and that it is not conditioned by the type of employment or
         the amount of income derived.  But a person  who  does  not  pursue
         effective and genuine activities, or pursues activities on  such  a
         small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and  ancillary  or
         which have no economic value to an employer, is not a  worker.   In
         this context, regard must be given to the nature of the  employment
         relationship and the rights and duties of the person  concerned  to
         decide if work activities are effective and genuine. ..."

18. The appellant has now produced HMRC records of his  tax  returns.   For
    the year April 2013 to  April  2014  he  is  recorded  as  working  for
    Ladbrokes Betting and Gaming Limited and earned �1,785.09 (about �34  a
    week) for the entire year, paying no tax or  National  Insurance.   The
    other new documents produced show that  he  continued  to  have  health
    difficulties in January and March 2018, that he received a  certificate
    of long service from Ladbrokes in 2014  and  participated  in  a  share
    scheme in 2017, and that because of his low income he received  housing
    benefit in the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

19. The grounds of appeal however err in treating the  whole  of  the  year
    from 29 November 2013 to 29 November 2014 as the relevant period: while
    that period is  relevant  for  a  permanent  right  of  residence,  the
    appellant can be considered for that only if  his  right  of  residence
    continued beyond the date of termination of his marriage on 29 November
    2013, and for that, he must meet all the conditions of  Regulation  10.
    He must show:

   i) that he ceased to be a family member  of  a  qualified  person  on  29
      November 2013 (Regulation 10(5)(a));

  ii) that he was in the United Kingdom 'in accordance with the Regulations'
      on the date of dissolution (Regulation 10(5)(b));

 iii) that he would, had he been an EEA national, have been a worker  on  29
      November 2013 (Regulation 10(5)(c) with Regulation 10(6)); and either

  iv) that before the divorce proceedings were begun the marriage had lasted
      at least 3 years (Regulation 10(5)(d)(i)) or that he was a  victim  of
      domestic violence (Regulation 10(5)(d)(iv)).

20. This appeal falls at the first hurdle.  The appellant cannot show  that
    he was a family member of  a  qualified  person  on  29  November  2013
    because he lacks the relevant information  about  his  former  spouse's
    presence in the United Kingdom, or her exercise  of  Treaty  rights  on
    that date.  If she was not exercising Treaty rights, then he was not in
    the United Kingdom 'in accordance with the Regulations' and the  appeal
    falls also at the second hurdle.  Nor is  there  satisfactory  evidence
    that he was entitled to be treated as a 'worker' on 29  November  2013:
    his sick notes had not yet begun and  there  is  no  evidence  that  he
    received pay covering that period.  Regulation 10(5)(d) is not reached.



21. I am satisfied, on the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    even with the addition of the new evidence before me, that it was  open
    to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  find  that  the  appellant  had  not
    demonstrated as at 29 November 2013 either that his wife was exercising
    Treaty rights or had acquired a permanent right of residence,  or  that
    he was employed in a manner which was more  than  purely  marginal  and
    ancillary, or that he was temporarily unable to work for reasons of ill
    health.  Unless he can meet one  of  those  three  qualifications,  the
    appellant cannot show that he is a family member who has  retained  the
    right of residence and accordingly, his appeal was bound to fail.

22. The First-tier Judge did not err in law in dismissing this  appeal  for
    the reasons given.  There is no material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

23. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law.
    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
