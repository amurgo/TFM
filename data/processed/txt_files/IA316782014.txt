Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by Immigration
Chambers Ilford
For the Respondent:    Mr Kingham, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, born 1 January 1986, is a citizen of Pakistan. He  first
    came to the UK to study with a valid grant of entry clearance as a Tier
    4 student on 23 August 2009 until  31  January  2011.  That  leave  was
    subsequently varied so that he enjoyed leave as Tier 1 Post Study  Work
    Migrant until 1 June 2013.

 2. The Appellant then made his first application for a  variation  of  his
    leave as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur, which was refused, and  a  decision  to
    remove him from the UK was also made. His appeal  rights  against  that
    decision were exhausted on 12 February 2014.

 3. The Appellant made a second application as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur  on  7
    May 2014 which was refused on 24 July 2014. The letter of  reasons  for
    that decision was then amended and reissued so that it bears the legend
    "24 July 2014 -reprinted 22 January 2015 with required amendments".  It
    is agreed before me that this did not constitute a fresh decision,  but
    simply an amendment to the reasons given for the decision  of  24  July
    2014.

 4. It is agreed before me that although the letter  of  24  July  2014  is
    poorly drafted it does contain the clear statement on  the  first  page
    that the Appellant enjoyed no right of  appeal  against  the  decision.
    That stance is repeated with more force, and greater  clarity,  in  the
    letter of 22 January 2015.

 5. Notwithstanding this stance by the Respondent the Appellant  lodged  an
    appeal against the decision of 24 July 2014, and this came before First
    Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Swinnerton  on  5  June  2015.  In  a   decision
    promulgated on 23 June 2015 he failed to engage with  the  jurisdiction
    point, although he noted its  existence  [21],  and  he  dismissed  the
    appeal.

 6. The Appellant's application to the First Tier Tribunal  for  permission
    to appeal was granted by Judge Saffer on 16 November 2015. The grant of
    permission  fails  to  engage  with  the  jurisdiction  point,  and  is
    addressed solely to the question of whether Judge Swinnerton had  given
    any (or any adequate) reasons for the decision to dismiss the appeal.

 7. Thus the matter comes before me.

Right of appeal?

 8. After some discussion between the representatives, Mr Ahmed conceded on
    behalf of the Appellant that upon a true analysis of the chronology the
    decision under appeal had been to refuse to grant leave to one who  had
    no leave at the time he made his application.

 9. In the circumstances Mr Ahmed conceded that the Appellant had no  right
    of appeal against the decision of 24 July 2014, and  that  neither  the
    failure of the presenting officer to take the point forcefully  at  the
    hearing, nor the failure of the  Judge  to  address  the  point,  could
    remedy that.

Adequate reasons for the First Tier Tribunal decision?

10. It was agreed before me that  the  decision  fell  well  short  of  the
    obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision upon  an  appeal.
    The Appellant as the losing party is not  able  to  identify  from  the
    decision what evidence the Judge considered, the weight he attached  to
    it, or how he arrived at the decision to dismiss the appeal.

Conclusion

11. In  the  circumstances,  and  by  consent,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on  23
    June 2015 did involve the making of an error of law in the decision  to
    dismiss the appeal that requires that decision  to  be  set  aside  and
    remade. I therefore set aside the decision to dismiss the  appeal,  and
    remake the decision so as  to  dismiss  the  appeal  for  want  of  any
    jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal to entertain it.

DECISION

    The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    23 June 2015 did involve the making of an error of law in the  decision
    to dismiss the appeal that requires that decision to be set  aside  and
    remade. I remake the decision so as to dismiss the appeal for  want  of
    any jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal to entertain it.

Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008

    The Appellant did not seek anonymity before the  First  Tier  Tribunal,
    and no request for anonymity is made to me.  There  appears  to  be  no
    proper basis for the Upper Tribunal to make such a direction of its own
    motion.
