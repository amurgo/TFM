For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION


   BACKGROUND

     1. By a decision promulgated on 3 October 2019, I found  an  error  of
        law in the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bart-Stewart
        promulgated on 21 June 2019 which allowed the  Appellant's  appeal.
        I therefore  set  aside  Judge  Bart-Stewart's  decision  and  gave
        directions for further evidence and a resumed hearing.   It  is  on
        that basis that this appeal comes back before me.  My error of  law
        decision is annexed to this decision for ease of reference.

     2. By a decision dated 29  October  2019,  an  Upper  Tribunal  Lawyer
        extended the parties'  time  for  filing  further  evidence  to  15
        November 2019.  That  was  on  application  by  the  Appellant  who
        indicated that his solicitors had ceased to act.

     3. The resumed hearing  was  initially  listed  on  5  December  2019.
        However, the Appellant's new solicitors, Sabz Solicitors,  applied,
        on 29 November 2019, for an adjournment of that hearing as they had
        been unable to obtain the  Appellant's  file  of  papers  from  the
        previous solicitors in  spite  of  a  number  of  requests.   By  a
        decision dated 6 December 2019, that adjournment was granted by the
        Upper Tribunal Lawyer.   The new solicitors were directed to update
        the Tribunal by 6 January 2020 whether they had been successful  in
        obtaining the client's file and otherwise the appeal file was to be
        sent to me for review.  As it was, and although the solicitors  did
        not expressly indicate whether the file  had  been  received,  they
        filed a supplementary appeal bundle on 7 January 2020 from which  I
        inferred that they were ready to  proceed.   So  it  was  that  the
        appeal came before me on 24 January 2020.

     4. The Appellant appeals the Respondent's decision dated 13 March 2019
        refusing his human rights claim made in the context of  a  decision
        to deport him to the US.  The Appellant is entitled to be  admitted
        to the US, having been born there at a time  when  his  father  was
        working there.  He is however a national of Sierra  Leone  and  has
        never lived in the US other than for a short period when he  was  a
        baby.  The factual background to the Appellant's case is set out at
        [2] to [4] of my error of law decision and I do not need to  repeat
        what is there said.

   THE LEGAL BACKGROUND

     5.  The  Appellant  is  a  foreign  criminal  to  whom  the  automatic
        deportation provisions in section 32 UK Borders Act 2007 apply.  He
        also falls within the definition for the purposes  of  Section  117
        Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("Section  117").
        Section 117C is of particular relevance.  The  sentence  passed  on
        the Appellant for the index offence was one of eighteen months.

     6. The relevant provisions of  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")
        relating to this Appellant are as follows:


           "398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human
           Rights Convention, and
           (a) ...
           (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
           the public good and in the public interest because they have
           been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12
           months; or
           (c) ...,
           the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
           whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
           public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other
           factors where there are very compelling circumstances over and
           above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.
           399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)
        applies if -
           (a) ...
           (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
           partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in
           the UK, and
           (i) the relationship was formed at a time when the person
           (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
           was not precarious; and
           (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in the
           country to which the person is to be deported, because of
           compelling circumstances over and above those described in
           paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
           (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the
           UK without the person who is to be deported.
           399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)
        applies if -
           (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
        his life; and
           (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
           (c) there would be very significant obstacles to his integration
           into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

     7.  Section 117C reads as follows (again so far as relevant):


           "117CArticle 8: additional considerations in cases involving
        foreign criminals
           (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
        interest.

           (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
           the criminal.

           (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
           Exception 2 applies.

           (4) Exception 1 applies where-

           (a)C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
        of C's life,

           (b)C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
        Kingdom, and

           (c)there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
           into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

           (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
           relationship with a qualifying partner,..., and the effect of
           C's deportation on the partner ... would be unduly harsh.

           (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to
           a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
           interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
           and 2.

           ..."


     8. The Rules and Section  117C  are  in  materially  the  same  terms.
        Where, as here, a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment  of
        under four years but more  than  twelve  months,  the  Tribunal  is
        required to consider whether either of the two exceptions  at  rule
        399/exception  2  ("Exception  2")   or   rule   399A/exception   1
        ("Exception 1") are met.  If they are not, the Tribunal is required
        to consider whether there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
        and above those exceptions.  Although, as appears at  Section  117C
        (6) (and the corresponding provision in the Rules) on the  face  of
        the legislation this provision applies only to those  sentenced  to
        at least four years, the Court of Appeal held at [24]  to  [27]  of
        its judgment in NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2016] EWCA Civ  662  that  this  was  an  unintentional
        drafting error.   Accordingly,  that  same  "fall-back"  protection
        applies equally to those in the position of the Appellant.

     9.  Although  dealing  with  the  position  of  children  rather  than
        partners, the Supreme Court gave guidance  as  to  the  meaning  of
        "unduly harsh" at [23] of its judgment in KO (Nigeria) and others v
        Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  53  ("KO
        (Nigeria)") as follows:

           "On the other hand the expression 'unduly harsh'  seems  clearly
           intended  to  introduce   a   higher   hurdle   than   that   of
           'reasonableness' under section 117B (6), taking account  of  the
           public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  foreign   criminals.
           Further the word 'unduly' implies an element of comparison.   It
           assumes that there is a 'due' level of 'harshness',  that  is  a
           level which may be acceptable or  justifiable  in  the  relevant
           context.  'Unduly' implies something going  beyond  that  level.
           The relevant context is that set by section 117C  (1),  that  is
           the public interest in the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals.
           One is looking for a degree of harshness going beyond what would
           necessarily be involved for any child faced with the deportation
           of a parent..."

    10. At [27] of the judgment in KO (Nigeria), the  Court  expanded  upon
        what is meant by "unduly harsh" by reference to what  was  said  by
        this Tribunal in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
        Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as follows:

           "...'unduly  harsh'  does   not   equate   with   uncomfortable,
           inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult.  Rather, it poses
           a  considerably  more  elevated  threshold.   'Harsh'  in   this
           context,  denotes  something  severe,  or  bleak.   It  is   the
           antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.    Furthermore,   the
           addition of the  adverb  'unduly'  raises  an  already  elevated
           standard still higher."

    11. In  relation  to  the  test  for  "very  significant  obstacles  to
        integration" within Exception 1, the Court of Appeal described this
        in Secretary of State for the Home Department v Kamara [2016]  EWCA
        Civ 813 ("Kamara") in the following way:

           "14.   In  my  view,  the  concept  of  a   foreign   criminal's
           "integration" into the country to which it is proposed  that  he
           be deported, as set out  in  section  117C(4)(c)  and  paragraph
           399A, is a broad one. It is not confined to the mere ability  to
           find a job or to sustain life while living in the other country.
           It is not appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject
           to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a  court  or
           tribunal simply to direct itself in the  terms  that  Parliament
           has chosen to use. The idea of "integration" calls for  a  broad
           evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual will
           be enough of an insider in terms of understanding  how  life  in
           the society in that other country is carried on and  a  capacity
           to participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity  to
           be accepted there, to be able to operate on a  day-to-day  basis
           in that society and to build  up  within  a  reasonable  time  a
           variety  of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to   the
           individual's private or family life."

    12. It is also relevant to note the comment of the Court of  Appeal  in
        Secretary of State for the Home Department v Olarewaju [2018]  EWCA
        Civ 557 that "''[v]ery real culture shock' is not the same as 'very
        significant obstacles'" although of course each case will  turn  on
        its own facts and balance.

    13. In the context of integration in country of return, Mr Jarvis  also
        directed my attention to two further cases which  post-date  Kamara
        and expand on what is there said.

    14. In El Gazzaz v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2018]
        EWCA Civ 532, the Court of Appeal said the following:

           "35.  So far as concerns other aspects of  living  in  Egypt  if
           removed there, the appellant had been brought up  in  Egypt  and
           had made frequent trips there to  see  family  members,  as  the
           Tribunal noted had been the position down to 2006: [31].  It was
           not suggested that the appellant could not speak  the  language,
           nor that he lacked any understanding of how society operates  in
           Egypt.  This is in contrast to the position of the individual in
           Kamara v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA
           Civ 813; [2016] 1 WLR 152, an authority particularly  relied  on
           by Ms Ward on this appeal.  Also, Kamara involved a  person  who
           had come to the United Kingdom at a  significantly  younger  age
           (six) than the appellant.  Contrary to Ms Ward's submission,  it
           is not an authority which shows that the Tribunal erred  in  its
           assessment in the present case.  She submitted that, if  removed
           to Egypt, the appellant would not be able 'to operate on a  day-
           to-day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable
           time a variety of human relationships there as  he  has  in  the
           United Kingdom.  Those are limited in both cases by  his  mental
           ill-health, and the treatment for that in Egypt might not be  at
           the same level as in the United Kingdom.  But as already pointed
           out above, such gap as there is in that regard does not indicate
           that his removal to Egypt  would  be  disproportionate  for  the
           purposes of Article 8."

    15. In AS v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA  Civ
        1284 ("AS"), the Court of Appeal said this about  the  judgment  in
        Kamara:


           "57.  Mr Buley can point to the UT's reference to  AS's  ability
           to 'adapt to life in Iran' but it is clear that it did  not,  as
           submitted  by  Mr  Buley,  substitute  this  for  the  issue  of
           obstacles to integration.  Further, whether someone is  able  to
           adapt to life  in  the  other  country  easily  fits  within  an
           assessment of the extent to which there are obstacles  to  their
           integration.
           58.   I do not consider that Mr Buley's categorisation  of  some
           factors as 'generic' is helpful.  Consideration of the issue  of
           obstacles to integration requires consideration of all  relevant
           factors some of which may be  described  as  generic.   What  Mr
           Buley identified as 'generic' factors, as referred to above, can
           clearly be relevant to the  issue  of  whether  there  are  very
           significant obstacles to integration.  They can form part of the
           'broad evaluative judgment' as is specifically  demonstrated  by
           the reference  in  Kamara  to  'good  health'  and  'capable  of
           working'.
           59.   I  also  reject  Mr  Buley's  submission  that,  following
           Kamara, whether someone is 'enough  of  an  insider'  is  to  be
           determined by reference to their ties  or  links  to  the  other
           country.  This is to turn what Sales LJ said in Kamara into just
           the sort of gloss which he  expressly  warned  against.   It  is
           clear, to repeat, that generic factors can  be  of  significance
           and can clearly support the conclusion that the person will  not
           encounter very significant obstacles to integration.
           60.   The UT undertook an assessment which took into  account  a
           range of factors including AS's  ability  to  speak  Farsi,  his
           ability to adapt  to  Iranian  culture,  his  intelligence,  his
           academic  abilities  and  character.   Additionally,  given   Mr
           Buley's submissions in respect of the relevance of the  mother's
           ties to Iran, it is probably helpful to quote  more  fully  what
           was said about ties in Ogundimu, paragraph 124 (my emphasis):
                 'His father may have ties but they are not the ties of  the
                 appellant or any ties that could result in support  to  the
                 appellant in the event of his return there."
           This analysis in Ogundimu,  including  specifically  the  latter
           part of this passage, was expressly approved in YM (Uganda).  In
           any event, the broad evaluation  required  when  this  court  is
           considering obstacles to integration  can  clearly  include  the
           extent to which a parent's ties might assist with integration."

    16. The judgment in AS is also of interest for what it has to say about
        the applicability of the case of Maslov v Austria (2008) 47 EHRR 20
        ("Maslov") on which Mr Nadeem placed some reliance in  his  written
        submissions.  In  AS,  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  the  following
        observations about the applicability of that case:


           "50.   In  Ali,  Lord  Reed  JSC  said,  when   concluding   his
           consideration of the Strasbourg jurisprudence, including Boultif
           and Maslov.
                 '35.  While the European court has provided guidance as  to
                 factors  which  should  be  taken  into  account,  it   has
                 acknowledged  that  the  weight  to  be  attached  to   the
                 competing considerations, in striking a fair balance, falls
                 within  the  margin  of  appreciation   of   the   national
                 authorities, subject to supervision at the European  level.
                 The Convention on Human Rights can thus accommodate, within
                 limits, the judgments made  by  national  legislatures  and
                 governments in this area.'
           51.   In Akpinar, the Court of Appeal  directly  considered  the
           reference in Maslov to 'very serious reasons' being required  to
           justify expulsion.  The submission that Maslov laid 'down a  new
           rule of law, creating a consistent and objective  hurdle  to  be
           surmounted by the state in all cases to  which  it  applies;  in
           other words, irrespective of the other factors involved,  unless
           the state can show that there are  'very  serious  reasons'  for
           deporting ..(him),  his  article  8  rights  will  prevail'  was
           rejected: paragraph 30.  Sir Stanley Burnton considered that the
           Strasbourg court's 'extensive citation of its previous case  law
           (did) not suggest that  it  intended  to  depart  from  it'.   A
           conclusion further supported by the way in which the  court  had
           expressed its ultimate conclusion, in paragraphs  100  and  101,
           which reflected 'a conventional balancing exercise: paragraph 31
           of Akpinar."

    17. Mr Nadeem relies on what is said about the applicability of  Maslov
        by the Court of Appeal in CI (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the
        Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2027 ("CI") at [103]  to  [114]  of
        the judgment, the relevant parts of which read as follows:


           "Applicability of the Maslov case
           103.  As noted earlier, the object of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is
               through a structured approach to produce a final result that
               is compatible with article 8. To ensure that this is
               achieved, it is necessary when considering whether
               circumstances are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the
               public interest in the deportation of a "foreign criminal"
               to take into account the jurisprudence of the European Court
               of Human Rights, including the important decisions of �ner v
               The Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 14 and Maslov v
               Austria [2009] INLR 47: see NA (Pakistan), para 38.
          104. In Maslov the European Court reaffirmed the criteria,
               already established in its judgment in �ner, which are to be
               applied when assessing whether the expulsion of a foreign
               national on account of criminal offences is consistent with
               article 8. These include the need to have regard to "the
               special situation of aliens who have spent most, if not all,
               of their childhood in the host country, were brought up
               there and received their education there" (see para 74 of
               the Maslov judgment). In Maslov the court further stated (at
               para 75):
                 "In short, the court considers that for a settled migrant
                 who has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her
                 childhood and youth in the host country, very serious
                 reasons are required to justify expulsion."
           105.  ...
           109.  ... Although the points made in the Maslov case about the
               need to take account of the applicant's age when he or she
               (a) moved to the host country and (b) committed criminal
               offences are of general relevance in deportation cases, the
               observations made about the 'special situation' of persons
               who have spent most of their childhood and youth in the host
               country and the need for 'very special reasons' to justify
               their expulsion are not applicable to criminal offenders who
               are unlawfully present in the UK.
           110.  Unlike the appellants in JO (Uganda), ED (Ghana) and DM
               (Zimbabwe), however, CI is not unlawfully present in the UK.
               He has indefinite leave to remain and is thus a "settled
               migrant", as that expression has been used in the case law
               of the European Court. On the other hand, he has not spent
               all or the major part of his childhood and youth lawfully in
               the UK, and therefore does not fall within the description
               in para 75 of the Maslov judgment. This raises the question
               whether, as the Upper Tribunal judge in this case thought,
               the principles stated in Maslov (and, in particular, para 75
               of the judgment) are inapplicable because they are confined
               to settled migrants who have had that status - or who at any
               rate have been lawfully present in the host country - for
               most of their childhood.
           111.  In my view, the relevance of the Maslov case (and other
               cases in the same line of authority) is not limited in this
               way. In the first place, it would be wrong to read the
               court's judgment in that case as if it were a legislative
               text. As discussed by Sir Stanley Burnton (with whom
               McFarlane and Maurice Kay LJJ agreed) in R (Akpinar) v Upper
               Tribunal [2014] EWCA Civ 937; [2015] 1 WLR 466, paras 30-54,
               the statement in para 75 of the Maslov judgment about the
               need for 'very serious reasons' is not to be read as laying
               down a new rule of law but rather as indicating the way in
               which the balancing exercise should be approached in the
               circumstances of that case. As Sir Stanley Burnton pointed
               out, this is confirmed by the way in which the court
               expressed its ultimate conclusion in para 100 of the
               judgment that there had been a violation of article 8 in
               that case:
               "Having regard to the foregoing considerations, in
               particular the - with one exception - non-violent nature of
               the offences committed when a minor and the State's duty to
               facilitate his reintegration into society, the length of the
               applicant's lawful residence in Austria, his family, social
               and linguistic ties with Austria and the lack of proven ties
               with his country of origin, the Court finds that the
               imposition of an exclusion order, even of a limited
               duration, was disproportionate to the legitimate aim
               pursued, 'the prevention of disorder or crime'. ...'
               This was a conventional balancing exercise, with no bright
               line rule applied in relation to the length of the
               applicant's lawful residence in Austria.
           112.  Secondly, as I have indicated, the distinction of
               principle drawn in the case law of the European Court is
               between the expulsion of a person who has no right of
               residence in the host country on the one hand and, on the
               other hand, expulsion which involves the withdrawal of a
               right of residence previously granted. There is no such
               distinction of principle between a person who has spent most
               of their childhood lawfully in the UK and someone who has
               spent part but less than half of their childhood living in
               the country lawfully. The difference is one of weight and
               degree. Such a difference is compatible with adopting the
               condition specified in section 117C(4)(a) that a foreign
               criminal has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
               his life as a prima facie requirement. But it would not be
               consistent with the test of proportionality under article 8,
               which involves a balancing exercise, to treat the principles
               stated in the Maslov case as inapplicable to a settled
               migrant with a right of residence just because the
               individual concerned, although present in the country since
               early childhood, has not had a right of residence for a
               particular length or proportion of their time in the host
               country..."

    18. I make three observations about what is there said.  First, it does
        not appear that the Court of Appeal was taken to the judgment in AS
        although I accept does refer to the case of Akpinar  on  which  the
        Court's judgment depends in part.  Second, the Court of Appeal  was
        in CI concerned with whether the Judge below was right to  have  no
        regard to the case and was making observations about why  it  might
        have  had   some   relevance.   The   appeal   was   remitted   for
        redetermination.  That leads on to the third point that  the  Court
        was there concerned with the application  of  Section  117C(6)  and
        whether there are very compelling circumstances over and above  the
        exceptions and not to the test in Exception 1 per se.  As the Court
        of Appeal itself points out, the requirement that a beneficiary  of
        Exception 1 must have lived for most of his  life  lawfully  within
        Exception 1 is consistent with the distinction drawn in Maslov.   I
        will come to the application  of  that  requirement  in  this  case
        below.

    19. Although, in KO  (Nigeria),  the  Supreme  Court  decided  that  no
        reference is to be  had  to  the  public  interest  when  assessing
        whether the impact of deportation is unduly harsh on a  partner  or
        child (as it is already inherent in the threshold  which  applies),
        the same does  not  apply  when  considering  the  very  compelling
        circumstances outside the two  exceptions,  applying  Section  117C
        (6).  At [1] of its headnote in MS (s.117C  (6):  "very  compelling
        circumstances") Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC),  the  Tribunal
        provided the following guidance:

           "In determining pursuant to section 117C (6) of the Nationality,
           Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  whether  there   are   very
           compelling circumstances, over  and  above  those  described  in
           Exceptions 1 and 2 in  subsections  (4)  and  (5),  such  as  to
           outweigh the public interest in the  deportation  of  a  foreign
           criminal, a court or tribunal must taken into account,  together
           with any other relevant  public  interest  considerations,,  the
           seriousness of the  particular  offence  of  which  the  foreign
           criminal was convicted, not merely whether the foreign  criminal
           was or was not sentenced to imprisonment of more than  4  years.
           Nothing in KO (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department [2018] UKSC 53 demands a contrary conclusion."

    20. In summary, therefore  the  issues  for  me  to  determine  are  as
        follows:

           a) Does the Appellant meet either Exception 1  or  Exception  2?
              If he does, he is entitled to succeed.

           b) If he does not, are there very compelling circumstances  over
              and above Exceptions 1 and 2 which are sufficient to outweigh
              the public interest in the Appellant's deportation?

   EVIDENCE AND SUBMISSIONS

    21. The Appellant relies on his bundle of evidence  before  the  First-
        tier Tribunal to which I refer below as [AB/xx].   I  also  have  a
        supplementary bundle from the Appellant to which I refer  below  as
        [ABS/xx].  I refer to documents in the Respondent's bundle, so  far
        as relevant, as [RB/xx].  Mr Nadeem also  sought  to  introduce  in
        evidence at the  hearing  two  articles  drawn  from  the  internet
        entitled  "The  High   Cost   of   Endometriosis"   (published   on
        "Hormonesmatter.com") and "How US Healthcare Costs Compare to Other
        Countries".   Although  Mr  Jarvis  complained   about   the   late
        production of this evidence, he did not object  to  its  inclusion.
        He submitted (and for reasons I give below  I  accept)  that  those
        articles have little if any relevance  to  the  issues  I  have  to
        decide.

    22. In addition to the written evidence, I heard oral evidence from the
        Appellant, his partner, Ms Smith, and his mother,  Ms  Bangura.   I
        have had regard to all of the evidence when reaching  my  decision,
        but I set out below only the evidence which I  consider  to  be  of
        relevance to the issues.

    23. In my error of law decision, I also expressly preserved the  record
        of the evidence given in the First-tier Tribunal's decision which I
        set aside. I have set out those paragraphs as they apply below  and
        take into account the evidence  there  given  in  relation  to  the
        relevant issues.

    24. The Appellant relies on three aspects of  his  private  and  family
        life  in  his  assertion  that  deportation  to  the  US  would  be
        disproportionate.  First, he says that he would not be able to live
        in the US because he has lived in the UK from a very young age,  is
        socially and culturally integrated here and  there  would  be  very
        significant obstacles to  integration  in the  US  because  he  has
        never lived there (except for a very short period which he does not
        remember as he was a baby). He has no  family  living  there.   His
        family are all in the UK.  Second, he says that he and Ms Smith are
        in a long-standing, genuine relationship and that she could not  go
        to live in the  US  because  of  her  own  circumstances  (which  I
        describe below).  The relationship could not continue if they  were
        separated.  Third, he says that he provides care to his mother  who
        suffers from various illnesses and has some responsibility  towards
        other family members.  I will come to the detail of those  and  the
        care he provides below.  I take each  of  those  factors  in  order
        although I accept that there is an overlap of the factors  when  it
        comes to considering the case as a whole.

   Appellant's Integration in the UK and Ability to Move to the US

    25. Judge Bart-Stewart set out the Appellant's previous evidence  about
        this aspect at [27], [31] to [32]  and  [36]  of  his  decision  as
        follows:


           "27.   The  appellant's  witness  statements  are  fairly  short
           confirming the chronology and family circumstances as set out in
           the refusal letter.  The appellant said that he had  no  friends
           or family members in the USA.  A few months after his  birth  he
           lived with family in Sierra Leone for 2 years and then moved  to
           the UK where he  attended  nursery,  primary,  high  school  and
           college.  Ms Smith has been his long-term partner for 13  years.
           They became engaged on 8 November 2018 and plan  to  marry.   He
           said he is not at risk of reoffending and would not  contemplate
           committing another crime.  He accepts what he did and is  sorry.
           He wants to continue to care for his brother who depends on  him
           and is struggling to cope without him.  His  fear  is  that  his
           family  life   would   not   continue.    His   partner   cannot
           realistically relocate to the United States  because  of  health
           problems  for  which  she  is  receiving   treatment   and   her
           commitments to her father's health problems.
           31.   He said he would not be  able  to  integrate  and  support
           himself in the USA.  He has no qualifications  for  the  US  and
           does not think that his work as an estate agent would assist him
           there as the industry and the market is different and  it  is  a
           large country.  He would be a fish out of water as he had  never
           lived there and spent at most a couple  of  months  after  being
           born there.  He was born in Atlanta Georgia then taken to Sierra
           Leone at a few months old.  He understands his family were based
           in Sierra Leone at the time and came to the UK  because  of  the
           civil war.
           32.   In cross-examination he said he believed his mother was in
           the US briefly before his birth but does not know why.   He  had
           Maths, English and Science GCSE, went to college and then  chose
           to  work.   He  is  the  only  member  of  his  family  with  US
           nationality.  He had not applied for British nationality  as  he
           had indefinite leave to remain and thought that was as  good  as
           having a passport.  He holds a US passport.
           ...
           36.   He visited the US with his father when he was 9.  They are
           no longer in contact and he does not know where his  father  was
           living.  The last contact was when he was a child.  His  brother
           is aged 21 and in employment."

    26. The Appellant's very brief witness statement  at  [AB/3-5]  largely
        confirms the above.   The Appellant says that he would be unable to
        go to live and work in the US.  He has been here since the  age  of
        two years.  He has never lived in the US.   His  parents  are  from
        Sierra Leone.  He lived in Sierra Leone for one year after  the  US
        and then came to the UK when he was still a  baby.   He  "does  not
        know anything about the US".  He "does not know the  country".   He
        "would be lost".  In relation to employment, he  said  that  if  he
        tried to get work there, he would be unable to find a job as he has
        no qualifications  for  that  country.   He  would  be  up  against
        millions of other  people  more  familiar  with  the  US  and  with
        qualifications from that country.  Why, he said, would an  employer
        take him? I note that the evidence is that the Appellant has  three
        GCSEs obtained in the UK, two relating  to  the  core  subjects  of
        English and Maths.  There is no  documentary  evidence  as  to  his
        qualifications.

    27.  Similarly,  there  is  limited  documentary  evidence  as  to  the
        Appellant's employment in the UK.  He says in  a  letter  dated  21
        December 2018  ([RB/D1-4])  that  he  did  a  "numerous  amount  of
        different jobs until [he] found [his] foot in the property industry
        (Estate Agency) where [he] could see [himself] creating a  career".
        He says that he has worked for  five  different  companies  in  the
        field.  He said in oral evidence that he  is  now  employed  in  an
        estate agency firm close to his home.  He earns �18,000  per  annum
        plus commission on sales of 10%.  However, he started this job only
        in December 2019. He earned �1400-1500 in that month.  He  told  me
        that he is very good at his job.  He had been due to start  another
        job in an estate agency business at the time of  his  sentence  for
        the index offence with  a  salary  of  �22,000  and  a  promise  of
        promotion to management but obviously was not able to take up  that
        employment. Prior to beginning his current job, the Appellant  took
        temporary jobs "in order to relax".  Although there is evidence  in
        the Appellant's and Respondent's bundles as to various  job  offers
        in the past and at the time of conviction,  there  is  no  evidence
        from his past employers.  There is no documentary  evidence  as  to
        the Appellant's current employment and employment prospects in  the
        UK.

    28. The Appellant said that he had no savings on which he could rely on
        arrival in the US.  He and Ms Smith had been  saving  for  a  house
        together but the �8,000 they had saved had  been  spent  supporting
        him in prison and  on  legal  bills  for  this  appeal.   Ms  Smith
        confirmed that to be the position and I accept their evidence  even
        though, as Mr Jarvis pointed out, there is no documentary  evidence
        about the Appellant's or Ms Smith's financial circumstances.

    29. There are a number of letters in the Appellant's  and  Respondent's
        bundles from various friends of the Appellant, his  family  and  Ms
        Smith attesting to his character, the  assistance  he  has  offered
        various of them and asking that he be allowed to remain in the  UK.
        I have read and take those into account when reaching my  decision.



   The Appellant's Relationship with Ms Smith and Ms Smith's Circumstances

    30. The details of the Appellant's relationship with Ms Smith  and  her
        circumstances are recorded at [27], [29], [35] and [37] to [39]  of
        the First-tier Tribunal's decision.  I have already set out [27] of
        the decision.  The remaining paragraphs read as follows:


           "29.  [Ms] Smith said that she was born in the UK and lived here
           since  birth.   She  works  as  an  executive   assistant   with
           Wellington Management International. She first met the appellant
           in 2006 and their relationship started  soon  afterwards.   They
           lived together a year in 2013, were engaged in November 2018 and
           they planned to marry shortly before the appellants  issue  with
           the UK authorities.  During the relationship she has  known  the
           appellant to be a good character and always supportive.  He came
           to the UK when he was 2 years old and had not lived  in  another
           country since being brought here.  She  is  still  committed  to
           their relationship.  She would not like to move or live  outside
           the UK because of her health issues.   She  receives  medication
           and treatment for endometriosis and adenomyosis.  Her father  is
           also seriously ill and receiving treatment for cancer.  It would
           be very unreasonable for her to move to another country.
           ...
           35.   He and his partner discussed what she would do if  he  was
           deported.  It  is  difficult  for  her  as  she  has  a  medical
           condition and her father is ill.  She would have  to  remain  in
           the UK.  It would be very expensive to fly  to  the  US  and  he
           doubts she could visit.  It would have a detrimental  effect  on
           their relationship. They were trying to save to buy  a  property
           and so there is some money but there was a question  as  to  how
           often she could visit.  He had not used cannabis for more than 6
           or 7 years and never used any other drug.  He drinks mildly.
           ...
           37.   [Ms] Smith adopted her witness statement and said that she
           suffers from gynaecological problems which are debilitating  and
           sometimes she is unable to get up or go to work.  She  has  been
           suffering for 8 years and diagnosed 2 years ago.  The medication
           allows her to enjoy a good quality of life but if  this  was  to
           cease she would be debilitated.  If she went to the US she would
           not have access to the medication that she needs.  Her father is
           also seriously ill. He was diagnosed with  cancer  for  the  4th
           time in August 2018 and is receiving treatment.  She has  strong
           family connections in the UK and  cannot  envisage  leaving  her
           father.  It has been a difficult time for the family.  She lives
           with her parents and helps out with her father's medication  and
           as required as a family.
           38.   In cross-examination  she  said  she  has  a  21  year-old
           brother who is at university but home when he can.   There  were
           no other  siblings  and  she  has  no  children.   It  would  be
           difficult to visit the appellant in America as she  is  in  work
           and there is not a lot of money to  spare.   They  have  roughly
           �8000 saved towards a house purchase.
           39.   Their relationship began in 2006 and she has not known the
           appellant to have been involved in  anything  of  this  gravity.
           She is aware of the dispute with his older sister  resulting  in
           the sister calling the police and him being  cautioned  2  or  3
           times.  On each occasion it was the same sister.  She has always
           found the appellant to be kind, calm and the offence  completely
           out of character.  She was with the appellant on  the  night  of
           the index offence.  The victim was  very  intoxicated  and  kept
           coming up to them as they were leaving.  He was very provocative
           with his behaviour and his language.  The victims friends  tried
           several times to remove their friend and it  culminated  in  the
           appellant's action.  She knows that it would not be repeated."

    31. Ms Smith's witness statement is at [AB/8-9] and  confirms  some  of
        what is said in the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

    32. I accept that the Appellant and Ms  Smith  are  in  a  genuine  and
        subsisting and long-standing relationship. They have been  together
        since they were in their teens.  I did not understand Mr Jarvis  to
        contend otherwise.  Although he did ask Ms Smith and the  Appellant
        questions about why they were not  living  together  in  their  own
        place, I accept the answers given that they had done so for a  year
        but were now trying to save up to buy a property rather than  rent.
        For a young couple, I accept that this is a normal situation.

    33. I note however that  there  is  no  evidence  as  to  the  couple's
        financial circumstances.  Whilst they were consistent about  having
        spent the �8000 savings which they  had  accumulated,  I  was  told
        nothing about Ms Smith's earnings or ability to fund trips  to  the
        US if she was not able to go with the Appellant.

    34. The Appellant said  that  the  relationship  would  not  survive  a
        separation.  A long- distance relationship is  "hard  for  anyone".
        The couple speak every day and would  struggle  to  communicate  at
        long distance.   Not  seeing  each  other  "would  be  huge".   The
        Appellant said that he and Ms Smith were now living together at his
        mother's house.   The  Appellant  also  asked  how  they  could  be
        expected to continue a relationship at a distance when they  wanted
        to start a family.  Ms Smith reiterated the same concern.

    35. As regards Ms Smith's family circumstances, those have moved on.  I
        was told that her brother has a partner who  is  pregnant  and  has
        moved to Manchester to start his own family.  That means that he is
        not dependent on her (if he ever was).  Equally, however, it  means
        that he cannot support her with help for her father.

    36. However, in the latter regard, Ms  Smith  gave  evidence  that  her
        father's cancer is currently  in  remission.   He  has  though  had
        lymphoma four times.  She fears that his cancer might return.   The
        last supporting evidence is at [AB/12] and is dated October 2016 at
        which time Ms Smith's father was still receiving treatment.  At the
        current time, however, there is no evidence that Ms Smith needs  to
        be in the UK to support her father.  Indeed,  I  was  told  by  the
        Appellant that Ms Smith lives with him at his mother's  house  most
        of the time.  I also note that the Judge Bart-Stewart records  that
        Ms Smith lives with her parents which suggests that her  mother  is
        also there to support her father.  That appears to be supported  by
        a document at [ABS/7] which describes Ms Smith as "the daughter  of
        one of my midwifery colleagues" and at [ABS/3] which  describes  Ms
        Smith attending an appointment with  her  mother  who  is  a  staff
        member.

    37. The main factor relied upon as a reason why Ms Smith could not move
        to the US is  her  medical  condition.   The  evidence  about  that
        appears  at  [ABS/2-11].   Those  documents  confirm   Ms   Smith's
        condition.  The most recent report is one dated  17  December  2019
        from Mr M  Nawar,  Consultant  Obstetrician  and  Gynaecologist  at
        London North West University Healthcare.  He records that he saw Ms
        Smith in May 2018 and arranged for her to have an ultrasound  scan.
        She was diagnosed with the conditions from which she  confirms  she
        suffers.  He says that the medication prescribed is controlling her
        symptoms but that she may  have  difficulties  conceiving  and  may
        require IVF treatment to do so.  He says that "[h]er recurrent  and
        ongoing pain interferes with her daily activities and she does  get
        certain days when she is unable to do simple tasks in view  of  the
        pain". He advises that it will be necessary to  continue  with  the
        medication (which  appears  to  consist  of  a  contraceptive  pill
        together with mefenamic acid tablets and tranexamic  acid  tablets)
        until she attempts conception to avoid  putting  her  fertility  at
        risk from the condition.

    38. The Appellant's case is that Ms Smith would be unable to afford the
        medication she needs.  The Appellant said in his evidence that  the
        cost of the medication would be �11,000 to �15,000  per  annum  and
        they could not afford it.  No documentation was provided in support
        of that assertion save the  article  entitled  "The  High  Cost  of
        Endometriosis" which provides the following information:

           "The economic cost of endometriosis is  staggering.   The  World
           Endometriosis  Research  Foundation  (WERF)  has  conducted  and
           published a prospective study of the direct and  indirect  costs
           associated  with  endometriosis  in  women  over  10   different
           countries.  Direct costs were  mostly  health  care  costs,  and
           indirect costs were costs associated with loss of  productivity.
           This study found that the average cost per year, per  woman  was
           11,497USD.  In the US, using the incidence of  endometriosis  of
           10 percent of reproductive age women, this amounts of 85 billion
           dollars per year.  Of this amount, approximately  two-thirds  is
           associated with lost  productivity,  and  one-third  is  due  to
           direct health care costs."

    39. As Mr Jarvis pointed out, and I accept, if the Appellant's evidence
        is based on this article (and no other source was provided), it  is
        misconceived and based on a misunderstanding of what  this  article
        shows.  The "11,497USD" is an average annual cost per woman to  the
        countries surveyed.  The figure is given in US dollars  because  it
        is a wider survey of 10 countries.  In any event, it does not  show
        the cost to the individual but to the economy of the country.   The
        information about the US does not assist.  First, it is  not  clear
        that "direct health care costs" are passed on as  a  whole  to  the
        individuals affected.  Second, and more importantly, it is not said
        how many people are affected.  If anything, the  article  does  not
        assist the Appellant's case because it shows the prevalence of  the
        condition in the US and therefore that treatment would exist there.
         The other article regarding healthcare costs in the  US  does  not
        refer to the cost of treatment for this condition.   Moreover,  the
        article is undated and refers to data to 2014 which  might  suggest
        that it is out of date.  In any event, what that article  does  not
        deal with is the availability of publicly funded care for those who
        cannot afford treatment and/or the  availability  of  insurance  to
        cover medical treatment.

   The Appellant's Relationship with his Mother, her Circumstances and Other
   Family

    40. This aspect of the Appellant's case is dealt with  in  evidence  at
        [33], and [40] to [42] of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  as
        follows:


           "33.  At the time of his arrest he lived  with  his  mother  and
           siblings who visit him in prison.  His brother is aged 21 and he
           has 2 older sisters.  He had been his mother's  full-time  carer
           and was receiving a  carer's  allowance  until  about  5  months
           before his arrest...
           40.   [Ms] Bangura confirmed that she is the appellant's mother.
            She said she was in the US for about 2 months and the appellant
           born there.  They then went  to  Freetown  Sierra  Leone  before
           entering the UK in 1993.  She would  be  unable  to  assist  the
           appellant financially if he went to the US as she is not working
           and is receiving employment and support allowance due to ongoing
           illness.  She is also studying.  She suffers from chronic  pains
           and taking medicine for her cancer which is in  remission.   She
           also suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a few  other
           conditions.  The appellant received a carer's allowance  as  the
           medication she was taking inhibited her from doing things and he
           was helping out.  She was taking more than 10 different  tablets
           a  day  and  also  suffers  from  nerve  problems  following   3
           operations.
           41.   In cross-examination she said that she  had  2  operations
           from breast cancer and  one  where  they  removed  part  of  her
           intestine.  She has been in remission for about 2  years.   When
           the appellant was born she had spent 6 months in  total  in  the
           US. She and her husband had a business  at  the  time  and  were
           there on a business trip.  She also had sisters in the US at the
           time.  She moved back to Sierra Leone and  died  there  7  or  8
           years ago [sic].  She is married which does not know what became
           of her husband.  They had their children.
           42.   She said that she and the appellant's brother had  visited
           him in prison.  2 of his sisters were planning to do so, waiting
           to do so together, but were told he had been moved and both were
           at court.   Both sisters remain contact with the appellant.  The
           appellant had been living at home before being sent  to  prison.
           There were one or 2 occasions when he and his sister got into an
           argument and she called the police on him.  She thinks  she  was
           present during one of the altercations but does not see why  the
           sister called the police.  She cannot recall the precise  events
           but heard voices in an argument.  She did not see anything worth
           calling the police and told  her  so.   There  had  been  family
           arguments  leading  to  raised  voices  but  she  did  not  feel
           threatened by  her  daughter  and  her  daughter  did  not  feel
           threatened.  She knew that the appellant would not  have  harmed
           her.  The daughter argues a lot with them."

    41. Ms Bangura's statement is at [AB/6-7].  It deals  with  the  family
        background.  It says nothing  about  her  medical  conditions.   Ms
        Bangura confirmed during cross-examination that no medical evidence
        has been adduced  as  to  her  conditions.   She  did  present  for
        inspection her repeat prescription which was not put in evidence as
        it does not provide any details of the  conditions  for  which  the
        medication is prescribed.  Mr Jarvis did however accept that one of
        the medications (Sertralin) is an anti-depressant and others appear
        to be painkillers.

    42. The difficulty with the lack of evidence  concerning  Ms  Bangura's
        condition arises from the Appellant's case that he needs to  remain
        in the UK to care for her.  The evidence  that  he  cared  for  her
        before he went to prison and received  carer's  allowance  in  that
        regard was not challenged.  He  was  also  not  challenged  in  his
        evidence  that  the  flexibility  of  his  current  employment  and
        proximity of his workplace to his home allows him  to  go  home  to
        check on his mother periodically during the day.

    43. However, the evidence about what happened whilst the Appellant  was
        in prison was unsatisfactory.  The Appellant and his mother said it
        was very hard for her.  She said that her other children  struggled
        to come to support her.  She did however admit that  her  daughters
        had visited her once per week and left her meals as she  said  that
        she needed help with cooking.  She misunderstood a  question  asked
        about the need for the Appellant to  care  for  her  prior  to  his
        imprisonment as being critical of her for allowing  him  doing  so.
        She said that she thought he should have been  doing  other  things
        because he had potential to do more.  Sometimes  she  needed  help,
        but she had been trying to get her daughters to do more.  She had a
        conversation with him, but he said he  was  happy  to  be  helping.
        However, she "felt he was doing too much".

    44. When asked whether she had considered asking  for  local  authority
        support with care when the Appellant was in prison, she  said  that
        she had not.  She "did not feel comfortable to  have  someone  from
        the outside".  In light of the lack of evidence about Ms  Bangura's
        need for care and her own evidence, I do not give  much  weight  to
        this factor when considering the case.  Ms Bangura was, on her  own
        evidence, able to manage with such family support as her  daughters
        were prepared to offer whilst the Appellant was in  prison.   There
        is no evidence that she came to harm as a result.

    45. The Appellant also says that he has  a  "strong  relationship  with
        [his] brother who depends on [him] wholly and solely for  his  care
        in his academics and has been struggling coping with  life  without
        me".  That appears to be at odds with the evidence that his brother
        is in  employment.   In  his  oral  evidence  on  this  point,  the
        Appellant now says that his younger brother "comes and  goes".   He
        has a partner with whom he stays most of the time and the Appellant
        sees him "once every two weeks".   He went on to  say  though  that
        his brother "fell into depression  while  [the  Appellant]  was  in
        prison and because he thought that [the Appellant] was going to  be
        deported".  The Appellant said that he is close to his brother  and
        has "tried to steer him away from bad people".   The  Appellant  is
        "trying to help [his brother] focus and be consistent  with  work".
        There  is  some  inconsistency  within  the  evidence  as  to   the
        relationship between the two brothers, particularly since it is now
        said that the brother lives most of the time with his  partner  and
        the Appellant sees him infrequently.  There is no witness statement
        from the Appellant's  brother,  and  he  did  not  attend  to  give
        evidence.

    46. The Appellant also has two sisters.  One has  been  diagnosed  with
        cancer (as is confirmed by a document at [ABS/12-13]).   The  other
        has children.  That evidence is relevant to their ability  to  look
        after their mother.  Some of the Appellant's offending  relates  to
        one of the sisters and I will come to that below  when  considering
        the evidence about the offences.  Neither  sister  has  provided  a
        witness  statement  and  neither  attended  the  hearing  to   give
        evidence.

   The Appellant's Offences and the Public Interest

    47. Having dealt with the evidence  about  the  interference  with  the
        Appellant's private and family life and that  of  his  partner  and
        family, I turn to deal with the evidence on the other side  of  the
        balance, namely the public interest in the Appellant's  deportation
        as a foreign criminal.

    48. The index offence is one of wounding/  inflicting  grievous  bodily
        harm.  The offence was committed on 3 December 2017.  The Appellant
        was convicted on  27  November  2018  at  Harrow  Crown  Court  and
        sentenced to 18 months in  prison  and  ordered  to  pay  a  victim
        surcharge.

    49. Judge Bart-Stewart set out the particulars of the index offence  at
        [21] to [26] of her decision as follows:


           "21.  The details of the  index  offence  are  set  out  in  the
           sentencing remarks.  The appellant pleaded guilty to  one  count
           of inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the
           Offences against the Person Act.  On  3  December  2017  he  was
           outside a bowling venue in Stanmore.  The victim was there  with
           his works Christmas outing.  There was  a  conversation  between
           the victim and the appellant which  was  said  to  be  initially
           friendly but at some point the  mood  turned.   The  victim  was
           ushered  away  by  colleagues.   The  appellant  approached  the
           victims group, threw his cocktail glass to the floor and threw a
           single  punch  at  the  victim's   face.    This   knocked   him
           unconscious.  The appellant left.
           22.   The CCTV of the incident has gaps.  It showed one  attempt
           to separate the victim from the  appellant  but  witnesses  said
           there were 2 attempts.  It appears from the CCTV that the victim
           was irritating the appellant, had rather too much to  drink  and
           thought he was being funny when in fact he was not.  However the
           judge considered  that  the  appellant's  response  was  out  of
           proportion to any irritation he should have felt.  When  talking
           to probation about what happened the appellant described himself
           as in effect having had an out of body  experience.   The  judge
           called this 'the red mist'.
           23.   The effect was serious in that the victim's eye socket and
           nose were broken.  He suffered nerve  damage  to  his  face  and
           chipped teeth, cut the back of his head from the fall and  there
           was substantial swelling to his face.  He  had  surgery  to  his
           nasal area.  He was in great pain throughout his body for  weeks
           after the assault and his ability and quality of life  affected.
           The victim describes being unable to taste properly  because  of
           the operation on his nose and  his  face  being  numb.   He  was
           inhibited in  his  interactions  with  his  young  children  and
           described his anger and frustration that what happened  affected
           his family life.  He was off  work  for  about  3  months  which
           affected him financially.
           24.   His victim  statement  was  written  6  months  after  the
           assault when he still had nerve damage to his face,  was  unable
           to feel some of his teeth and his  lips  tingled  when  touched.
           His nose was out of alignment and he still had  bruising  around
           his eyes with a chip to his  front  tooth  which  he  could  not
           afford to have fixed.  He described looking in  the  mirror  and
           finding himself unable to recognise the person who was there.
           25.   The appellant pleaded not guilty at  the  plea  and  trial
           preparation hearing the  defence  being  identification  and  he
           challenged DNA evidence on the basis of transfer.  He  indicated
           a change of plea in October 2018 formally entering the  plea  on
           19 October which was the date set for hearing of an  application
           to dismiss the first count of wounding with intent.   The  Crown
           agreed not to proceed on that count.
           26.    The  maximum  sentence  is  5  years  imprisonment.   The
           sentencing guidelines for the offence is category 2 as it is  in
           the category of greater harm but of  lower  culpability  because
           none of the factors that might indicate higher culpability  were
           present. The starting point was therefore 18 months custody  and
           the range recommended between one and 3 years custody."

    50. The above  extract  neatly  encapsulates  the  particulars  of  the
        offence and what the Judge said when  passing  sentence  about  the
        seriousness of it.  However, the sentencing remarks go on  to  deal
        with the aggravating factors and the factors pointing the other way
        in mitigation.  It is appropriate to take those into  account  when
        looking at the wider public interest.  I  therefore  set  out  that
        part of the sentencing remarks ([RB/B1-7]):


           "..There are a number of factors that increase  the  seriousness
           of your offence; the location and timing of the offence;  social
           setting; outside the bowling venue with friends  and  colleagues
           present; the ongoing effect on Mr  Armstrong;  the  presence  of
           others, Mr Armstrong's were colleagues in  particular;  and  the
           fact that your offence was committed whilst you were  under  the
           influence of alcohol.
           I bear in mind also your previous convictions.  I have heard  on
           your behalf, and I accept that they are convictions for violence
           in a completely different context.  A 2012  caution  for  common
           assault against your  sister,  a  2013  conviction  for  battery
           against the same sister and a 2013 caution,  again,  for  common
           assault against the same sister, all arising  out  of  arguments
           between you and her.
           In terms of factors reducing the seriousness of  your  offending
           behaviour.  There is the fact that this was a  single  blow.   I
           accept that the CCTV shows that you walked away  afterwards.   I
           accept the probation officer says, and I accept, that it appears
           that you are genuinely sorry for this offence.  I have also read
           the numerous character references that you have managed  to  get
           friends and former employers  to  provide.   I  note  that  your
           referees describe you as courteous, not aggressive,  even  under
           provocation.  They mention occasions when you have broken  up  a
           fight and acted as a calming influence as captain of a  football
           team, amongst other incidents.  I know that your sister, who  is
           the subject of the other cautions  and  the  conviction  I  have
           mentioned, has provided a character reference, and it  is  urged
           on me that that was a difficult family situation that  both  she
           and you were facing, because your mother was  undergoing  cancer
           treatment at the time.
           I am told, and I accept, that your mother suffers from  multiple
           disabilities.  She has diabetes, hypertension and depression.  I
           am told that your instructions are that you are in receipt of  a
           carer's allowance for your mother, but your younger brother, who
           also lives with  you  and  your  mother,  works  full  time  and
           therefor the bulk of the caring responsibilities falls  on  you.
           Your two sisters, the one I have already mentioned  and  another
           sister, live locally but are married and have children of  their
           own.
           I bear in mind, as seems to be  the  case,  that  the  level  of
           violence on  this  occasion  is  something  that  you  have  not
           committed before and appears from your character  references  to
           be out of character, as it is known to your  referees.   I  have
           read the probation report carefully.  I note there is a risk  of
           reconviction is put at 87%, high risk.  However,  the  risk  you
           pose of causing serious harm in the future is assessed as low.
           This is an offence which it is accepted by your counsel on  your
           behalf, passes the threshold for a custodial sentence and it  is
           unavoidable.  I think this  is  right  in  my  judgment  that  a
           custodial  sentence  should  be  imposed.   I  have   considered
           carefully what  the  shortest  terms  of  imprisonment  I  could
           impose,  commensurate  with  the  seriousness  of  the  offence,
           bearing in mind  those  aggravating  factors,  particularly  the
           ongoing effect on the victim.  In my  judgement,  those  factors
           taken together and in spite of the mitigating factors, mean that
           the sentence has to go up from the starting point."

    51. The sentence of 18 months was arrived at by giving  an  appropriate
        deduction for the guilty plea. The  Judge  took  into  account  the
        mitigating factors which are much the same as some of those  raised
        by the Appellant in this appeal; that is to say,  his  relationship
        with Ms Smith and his caring responsibilities for his mother.   The
        Judge concluded that other family members would be able to care for
        his mother whilst the Appellant was in prison.  Taking into account
        those mitigating factors, the Judge declined to suspend the  prison
        sentence.

    52. I heard little  evidence  about  the  offence  or  the  Appellant's
        attitude to it.  It was suggested to  me  by  Mr  Nadeem  that  the
        offence was provoked by the victim's behaviour.   Whilst  I  accept
        that the  offence  was  not  pre-meditated,  the  sentencing  Judge
        concluded that the violence meted out by the Appellant was "out  of
        all proportion to any irritation that you  should  have  felt".   I
        note also that the "Short Format Pre-Sentence Report" ([RB/E70-74])
        says that "[t]he case summary indicates that  the  offence  was  an
        unprovoked attack which the defendant does not accept".  The report
        does however accept that the Appellant's regret at the offence "did
        appear to be convincing".  The  report  sets  out  the  Appellant's
        background, including his early aspirations  to  play  professional
        football and interest in sport.  The Appellant admitted to  smoking
        cannabis "in his younger days" but said he no longer used the  drug
        and had never taken Class A  drugs.   His  alcohol  consumption  is
        described  as  "occasional  and  social".   Nonetheless,   as   the
        sentencing Judge noted, his risk of general offending  reconviction
        is high (87%); the "statistical determinate" of that high score  is
        his "five previous sanctions" with which I deal below.  The  report
        accepts  however  that  the  index  offence  "does  appear  to   be
        dissimilar in nature to those sanctions". His risk of serious  harm
        is predicted at 1.2%. There are a  number  of  protective  factors,
        namely the Appellant's employment history, secure accommodation and
        long-term supportive relationship.

    53. In addition to the index offence, the PNC report which  appears  in
        the Respondent's bundle records the following convictions:

            . 1 January 2011: possession of cannabis.  Cautioned.

            . 8 August 2012: common assault. Cautioned.

            . 7 March 2013: common assault on 6 March 2013. Cautioned.

            . 3 September 2013: possession of cannabis  on  26  June  2013.
              Forfeiture and destruction ordered (no separate penalty).

            . 3 September 2013: Battery on 13 August 2013.  Pleaded guilty.
               Conditional discharge 18 months.

            . 17 May 2018: driving whilst under the influence of drugs on 6
              March 2018.  Pleaded guilty.  Fined and ordered to pay  costs
              and victim  surcharge.   Disqualified  from  driving  for  12
              months.

    54. Mr Nadeem submitted that the previous offences were of a  different
        nature to the index offence in terms of violence.  I  have  already
        noted the comments of the sentencing Judge and in the  pre-sentence
        report about the nature and circumstances of those  offences  which
        were committed against his sister.  Nonetheless, offences of common
        assault and battery are undoubtedly ones involving violence and the
        Appellant accepted that he had committed them.  I cannot  therefore
        accept  the  evidence  recorded  by  Judge  Bart-Stewart   of   the
        Appellant's mother who said that there was no reason for the police
        to be called.  I note  that  the  other  offences  are  related  to
        cannabis use.  The pre-sentence report records that  the  Appellant
        no longer uses that drug although  I  note  that  the  most  recent
        offence of  driving  under  the  influence  of  a  controlled  drug
        occurred even after the index offence was committed.

    55. I did not hear evidence  about  the  Appellant's  remorse  for  his
        crimes, I assume because I had preserved the previous evidence  and
        he was not asked about this.  The pre-sentence report accepted that
        his remorse "appeared" to be genuine.  Judge  Bart-Stewart  records
        the following which is corroborated by  the  Appellant's  statement
        and the other evidence before the Judge:


           "30.  In  oral  evidence,  the  appellant  adopted  his  witness
           statement  and  produce  the  letters  from  Forward  Trust  and
           Vitality Group in respect of drugs, alcohol  and  anger  courses
           that he has undertaken in prison.  He said  this  is  to  manage
           substance misuse and temper.  He began the course 4 to  5  weeks
           into his sentence and it is continuing.   The  course  looks  at
           potential triggers for anger and loss of control, how to  handle
           difficult situations, the impact of drink and drugs and  how  to
           manage on release into society.  Each of the programs take place
           once a week and he continues to attend both.  He is not aware of
           any other anger management course at the prison and had  made  a
           self-referral.
           ...
           34.   He was reminded of the judge's sentencing remarks  and  it
           was put to him that he showed an ability  to  become  aggressive
           and was asked how this would be prevented if he was  allowed  to
           remain in the UK.  He  apologised  for  the  situation  and  his
           actions and said he was still being punished.   In  relation  to
           his sister they are family and care for  each  other.   She  was
           going to hit his mother and had intervened but  throwing  Ribena
           at her was a step too far.  He said  he  genuinely  regrets  the
           index offence.  It was the first time something of  this  nature
           happened.  He does not normally get into fights  and  is  not  a
           bully.  He is usually the person to break up a fight and it  was
           out  of  character.   Attending  the  courses  indicates  he  is
           actively working on his anger and on being a better person."

    56. The Appellant's supplementary bundle contains a letter  from  Sofia
        Niazi, Probation Officer with the National Probation  Service,  who
        is the Appellant's Offender Manager.  That letter records that  the
        Appellant was released from prison on 10 September 2019 on  licence
        and has reported to the Probation Office on  six  occasions  since.
        She says the following:


           "Throughout his custodial part of his sentence, Mr  Bangura  has
           been a model prisoner, and was keen  to  maintain  contact  with
           Probation by regularly calling,  so  that  he  could  develop  a
           working relationship and share his objectives/plan for  when  he
           is released.
           Mr Bangura has positively engaged in  the  supervision  process,
           and settled into  the  community  with  relative  ease.   He  is
           currently residing with his mother, and has  managed  to  secure
           temporary employment.
           Mr Bangura is a highly motivated individual with plans  and  set
           objectives that he has been quick to implement and work towards.
            Mr Bangura will continue  to  report  to  Probation  until  his
           Licence end date which is 27/08/2020..."

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

    57. I begin with Exception 1 concerning the Appellant's  private  life.
        The Appellant did not have any  status  in  the  UK  until  he  was
        granted exceptional leave to remain with his family in  April  2004
        and  then  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  February  2005.   The
        Appellant was by that time aged  thirteen  or  fourteen  years.   I
        accept that during the time between his arrival in the UK  in  1993
        and then, the Appellant, as a child, could not be held  responsible
        for the fact that he was here with no immigration status.  However,
        his presence was nonetheless  not  lawful  for  that  period.   The
        Appellant was served with  an  automatic  deportation  decision  in
        March 2019.  As such, by my calculation, the  Appellant's  presence
        was lawful for a period of fifteen years.   He  is  now  aged  just
        under twenty-nine years.

    58. The Respondent accepts that the Appellant has been lawfully present
        in the UK for more than half his life.  She does not however accept
        that the other two limbs of Exception 1 are met.

    59. Dealing first with social and cultural integration  in  the  UK,  I
        accept that the Appellant is integrated.  He has lived  in  the  UK
        since the age of two years.  He was educated here.  He  has  worked
        in the UK.  He has formed a relationship here.  All his family  are
        here.  There are letters from  friends  and  other  family  members
        which support his involvement in life in the UK.  I accept that  it
        can be said that the Appellant's criminal offending indicates  non-
        integration.  However, other than the index offence, those offences
        have been more minor in nature and have never led to any period  of
        detention.  Those offences indicate a certain disregard for the law
        which I accept is relevant to the wider  public  interest  balance,
        but I do not consider that they are  sufficient  to  undermine  the
        Appellant's integrative links with the UK.

    60. I turn then to the  very  significant  obstacles  said  to  prevent
        deportation to the US.   The  Appellant  speaks  English  fluently.
        That is the language  used  in  the  US.  The  Appellant  has  some
        qualifications and has embarked on a career in  the  UK  in  estate
        agency.  He said that he is good at his job.  There is no  evidence
        that he would not be able to apply for and obtain  a  job  in  that
        sector in the US.  I do not have any evidence  that  the  Appellant
        has any particular qualifications in this sector but neither  do  I
        have any evidence that any qualifications which he does have  would
        not be accepted in the US.  The US is a developed  country  with  a
        property market and, by all accounts, a thriving economy.   I  have
        been provided with no evidence that there is any shortage  of  jobs
        in the real estate sector and his assertion  that  an  US  employer
        would not look at him appears to be mere speculation.

    61. Similarly,  provided  the  Appellant  is  able  to  seek  and  find
        employment in the US, there is no evidence that  he  would  not  be
        able to accommodate himself.  I accept that he does  not  presently
        have any savings (although there is  no  formal  evidence  to  that
        effect) but he would be able to apply for work before he arrives in
        the US and could save something from his present  employment  which
        would tide him over until he starts work.

    62. I accept that the Appellant has no ties to the US.  He lived  there
        only for a very short while as a baby and I  accept  that  he  will
        have no recollection of that country.  He apparently  visited  with
        his father when he was aged nine years but  there  is  no  evidence
        that his father remains in the US and the  visit  appears  to  have
        been no more than a holiday.  There is  evidence  however  that  he
        does have a US passport.  There is no evidence therefore  that  the
        US authorities would not accept him.  He is a recognised citizen of
        that country.

    63. I am prepared to accept that the Appellant might find it  difficult
        to integrate initially as he  will  not  know  anyone  in  the  US.
        However,  culture  shock  is  not  of  itself  a  very  significant
        obstacle.  Moreover, the US is not culturally very  different  from
        the UK.  He will be able to make friends as he assimilates to  life
        there via employment contacts and the such like.  Such difficulties
        as the Appellant might face do not come anywhere  near  to  meeting
        the threshold of "very significant obstacles".   For  that  reason,
        the Appellant cannot meet Exception 1.

    64. Turning then to Exception 2, the  only  relevant  relationship  for
        these purposes is that with Ms Smith.  The Appellant does not  have
        any children.  The Appellant's relationship  with  his  mother  and
        other family does not fall within this exception although falls  to
        be considered when looking at the case outside the exceptions.

    65. In order to consider whether Exception 2 is met,  I  must  consider
        the impact of the Appellant's deportation on Ms Smith both  on  the
        premise that she will accompany him and that she will remain in the
        UK and therefore be separated from him.

    66. I accept that the Appellant and Ms  Smith  are  in  a  genuine  and
        subsisting relationship which was formed some time ago.  They  are,
        I accept, committed to each other.

    67. I fully accept that Ms Smith would not wish to move to the US.   As
        a British citizen, there is obviously  no  question  of  her  being
        obliged to do so.  If I accept that the Appellant can be  deported,
        it will be a matter of choice for her whether to accompany him.

    68. The reasons Ms Smith gives for being unable to join  the  Appellant
        in the US are that she knows nothing of the country (and  I  accept
        neither does the Appellant), that she has family in the UK for whom
        she bears some responsibility and that she is  receiving  treatment
        for her medical  condition  and  is  anxious  not  to  change  that
        treatment or leave her present consultant who she trusts.

    69. I have already dealt with the reasons why I do not accept that  the
        Appellant would face very significant obstacles to  integration  in
        the US notwithstanding his lack of ties to  or  knowledge  of  that
        country.  Those reasons  apply  equally  to  Ms  Smith.   There  is
        evidence that she is employed.  There is no evidence that she would
        be unable to find a job nor any evidence that  the  US  authorities
        would not accept her as the unmarried partner of the Appellant.

    70. The evidence about Ms Smith's caring responsibilities has moved on.
         Her father is currently in remission.   I  recognise  that  it  is
        quite possible that  his  cancer  will  recur  given  his  previous
        history.  However, it is not difficult to travel between the US and
        the UK at short notice should the need arise.   There  are  regular
        flights.  Although the evidence also  now  shows  that  Ms  Smith's
        brother has moved to the north of England to start his own  family,
        there is no evidence to suggest that he would not be able  to  come
        back to London to be with his father or that his father  could  not
        go to stay with him if his  medical  problems  reoccurred.  In  any
        event, the evidence suggests that Ms Smith's mother remains  living
        her father and is able to provide him with support.

    71. Dealing finally with what is really the focus  of  the  Appellant's
        case that Ms Smith could not obtain or  afford  treatment  for  her
        conditions in the US, I have already  explained  why  the  evidence
        produced does not demonstrate what the Appellant suggests it  does.
        There is no evidence that treatment cannot  be  obtained,  at  what
        cost and what alternatives there are to payment, whether via public
        funds or insurance.   I appreciate that she would  have  to  change
        consultants but, although that is contrary to her wishes, there  is
        no evidence that the standard of treatment and care which she would
        receive in the US is not of at least equivalent standard.

    72. I am  not  satisfied  on  the  evidence  that  Ms  Smith's  medical
        condition prevents her from moving to the US.  The impact has to be
        shown to be unduly  harsh.   Even  though  she  does  not  wish  to
        relocate, and the impact of the move may be hard for her, at  least
        initially, I am  not  persuaded  on  the  evidence  that  it  comes
        anywhere near to the high threshold which applies.

    73. Even if I am wrong in that analysis, there is no evidence that  the
        impact of separation would be unduly harsh.  I fully recognise that
        to maintain a relationship at long-distance,  particularly  between
        countries, is difficult.   Ms  Smith  may  be  able  to  visit  the
        Appellant at regular intervals.  I have no evidence that she  would
        be unable to afford to do so.  However, since it is apparently  the
        wish of the Appellant and Ms Smith to start a family, I accept that
        the effect of the separation if that occurs may well be to bring to
        an end what has been a long-standing and close relationship due  to
        the impracticality of having  children  whilst  the  couple  remain
        living apart.  However, that does  not  mean  that  the  impact  is
        unduly harsh.

    74. Separation of partners including the break-up of relationships is a
        common consequence of deportation.   Whilst I do not  downplay  the
        upset which is caused by the breakdown of a relationship which  has
        been as longstanding as this, the evidence does not show that there
        would be  any  impact  beyond  the  fact  of  that  separation  and
        breakdown.  There is no evidence  that  Ms  Smith  is  particularly
        dependent upon the  Appellant  either  in  emotional  or  financial
        terms.  I accept that she would be very upset.  However, that  does
        not begin to show that the impact would be unduly harsh.

    75. Since I do not  accept  that  the  Appellant  can  meet  either  of
        Exception 1 or Exception 2, I turn to consider  whether  there  are
        very compelling  circumstances  beyond  those  exceptions.   In  so
        doing, I take into account my conclusions in relation to Exceptions
        1 and 2.  I therefore accept that the Appellant has lived in the UK
        for most of his life, over half of that time lawfully and I  accept
        that he is socially and culturally integrated.  I  recognise  that,
        for that reason, the judgment in Maslov  may  have  some  relevance
        which would require "very serious reasons" to justify  deportation.
        However, as the Court of Appeal made clear  in  CI,  whether  there
        would be a breach of Article  8  based  on  length  and  extent  of
        residence and the difficulties in the country of return depends  on
        an  assessment  based  on  proportionality,  balancing   the   fact
        sensitive nature of the interference with an  individual's  private
        and family life against the public interest.

    76.  I  also  accept  that  the  Appellant's  deportation   will   have
        consequences for Ms Smith, either  in  the  form  of  upheaval  and
        disruption of her own private and family life  if  she  chooses  to
        accompany the Appellant or the ending of their relationship if  she
        chooses to remain in the UK.  I accept that either alternative will
        be very upsetting for her and the Appellant.

    77. I also take into account the impact of the Appellant's  deportation
        on the Appellant's other  family  members.   It  appears  from  the
        evidence that the Appellant's siblings have  moved  away  from  the
        family home or are in the process of so doing and have formed their
        own lives.  I do not have supporting witness statements from  those
        family members nor did they attend to give evidence.   I  therefore
        have limited if any corroborative evidence of  the  impact  of  the
        Appellants' deportation on those family members nor evidence of the
        impact of separation from them  on  the  Appellant.   Some  of  the
        Appellant's earlier offences relate to heated arguments with one of
        his sisters.  It is unclear whether  those  differences  have  been
        resolved now that they are older.  I therefore place little  weight
        on this factor.

    78. I accept that the deportation of the Appellant would  be  unwelcome
        for his mother.  Notwithstanding the lack of  evidence  as  to  her
        medical conditions I am prepared to accept that she  is  unwell  in
        certain respects.  She attended the hearing and is mobile.  She did
        not claim to be housebound but says that she needs help  with  some
        household tasks.  However, the evidence is that she managed to cope
        whilst the Appellant was in prison.   She  herself  said  that  she
        would prefer the Appellant to do less for her so that he can  focus
        on his own life.  There is evidence that  the  Appellant's  sisters
        looked after her to some extent whilst he was in prison.  Whilst it
        was not necessary for her to call on help from the local  authority
        at that time and I recognise that the Appellant's mother  does  not
        want outside help, she could obtain that if she needed to do so.  I
        can therefore place little weight on this factor.

    79. I turn then to the public interest side of  the  balance  which  in
        this case is based on the Appellant's criminal offending.   I  have
        set out the particulars of the index  offence  and  the  sentencing
        Judge's remarks, and I do not repeat those matters.  The  Appellant
        considers that he was provoked but there is no doubt that this  was
        a violent assault  which  occurred  when  the  Appellant  lost  his
        temper.  There was a severe and ongoing impact  on  his  victim  as
        described in the sentencing remarks. Although  I  accept  that  the
        Appellant has been  found  to  be  genuinely  remorseful  by  those
        professionals with whom he has had dealings, there  is  still  some
        evidence that he continues to blame his victim.

    80. I recognise that the  Appellant's  earlier  offences  are  to  some
        extent different.  Some did involve violence, but I accept from the
        descriptions of those offences given at [AB/29] that  they  are  in
        the form of family disputes and, whilst that does not make them any
        the less serious, none led to any form of sentence of imprisonment.



    81. I cannot ignore however the Pre-Sentence  Report  which  gives  the
        risk of reoffending as high (87%) albeit the risk of  serious  harm
        being only 1.2%.   As  the  writer  of  that  report  explains  the
        "statistical determinate of such a high score" is  the  Appellant's
        previous offences which demonstrate a disregard for the  law.   The
        letter from the Probation Officer is positive as to the Appellant's
        time in custody and engagement with  the  service.   However,  that
        letter was written on 13 November 2019  following  the  Appellant's
        release on 10 September 2019 and therefore covers a period of  only
        about two months (six visits).  I am unable to give  that  evidence
        much  weight  and  there  is  no  evidence  undermining  the   risk
        assessment carried out pre-sentence.

    82. In any event, risk of reoffending is only one facet of  the  public
        interest.  Allied to  that  is  the  deterrence  of  other  foreign
        offenders and the expectation of the public that serious  offences,
        here the infliction of grievous bodily harm,  will  be  dealt  with
        appropriately.

    83. Having balanced the factors for and against the Appellant,  I  have
        concluded that deportation is a proportionate response.  Although I
        accept that the Appellant has made his home from a young age in the
        UK and that this is where his partner and family members live, I am
        not satisfied that the difficulties which he (and  his  partner  if
        she chooses to go) will face in  the  US  are  such  as  to  render
        deportation disproportionate when the effect  is  balanced  against
        the strong public interest in  the  deportation  of  those  foreign
        nationals who commit crimes whilst  in  the  UK.   The  Appellant's
        criminal offending, in particular the index offence, in the context
        of the overall proportionality assessment,  provides  very  serious
        reasons which justify his deportation.

    84. For those reasons, I conclude that  the  Respondent's  decision  to
        deport the Appellant is not unlawful under  the  Human  Rights  Act
        1998 and I dismiss the appeal.

solicitors


                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


   BACKGROUND

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease of reference, I
      refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal  even
      though the Secretary of  State  is  strictly  the  Appellant  at  this
      juncture.  The Respondent appeals against  a  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal  Judge  Bart-Stewart  promulgated  on  21  June  2019   ("the
      Decision") allowing the Appellant's appeal  against  the  Respondent's
      decision dated 13 March 2019 refusing his human rights claim  made  in
      the context of a decision to deport him to the US.

   2. The First Appellant was born on 28 February 1991. He came  to  the  UK
      accompanying his mother and three siblings on 20  December  1993.   He
      was a dependent on his mother's asylum claim.  That claim  failed  but
      the family were granted exceptional leave to remain on 10  April  2004
      and indefinite leave to remain on 17 February 2005.   The  Appellant's
      mother is  from  Nigeria  and  his  father  from  Sierra  Leone.   The
      Appellant has acquired US nationality by virtue of his birth  in  that
      country at a time when his  father  was  working  there.   The  family
      returned to Sierra Leone thereafter and left  that  country  when  the
      Appellant was aged two, due to the situation  in  that  country.   The
      Appellant has never lived in the US either as a child or  adult  other
      than for a couple of months.

   3. The Appellant has convictions for offences of violence, possession  of
      drugs and driving whilst over the specified  limit  for  a  controlled
      drug.  The index offence  is  one  of  wounding/  inflicting  grievous
      bodily harm of which he was convicted on  19  October  2018.   He  was
      sentenced to eighteen months in prison.

   4. The Appellant's human rights claim is one based on  his  private  life
      and family life.  As to the former, he points out that  he  has  lived
      and grown up in the UK since the age of two years.  He has lived  here
      lawfully for over half his life.  He has been  employed  here.  He  is
      socially and culturally integrated.  He has no knowledge  of  life  in
      the US.  He has no family or friend there.  His family life  is  based
      on two component factors.  First, he is  in  a  relationship  with  Ms
      Corrine Smith.  They have been in a  relationship  for  twelve  years.
      She is a British citizen. She has  a  father  who  has  suffered  from
      cancer albeit is currently in remission.  She could not leave  him  to
      go to the US.  Second, the Appellant's family  are  in  the  UK.   His
      parents separated when he was a child and the Appellant says  that  he
      has no contact with his father.  His mother  also  has  suffered  from
      cancer albeit she too is in remission.

   THE DECISION AND GROUNDS

   5. Judge Bart-Stewart accepted that the Appellant had lived half his life
      in the UK lawfully; the Respondent concedes that is  so  ([63]).   The
      Judge also accepted that he was  socially  and  culturally  integrated
      here for the reasons given at [63]  and  [64]  of  the  Decision.   Mr
      Clarke confirmed that no issue is taken in relation to  that  finding.
      The Respondent's grounds challenge the finding at [64] and [65] of the
      Decision that there are very significant obstacles to  integration  in
      the US.  I will come to the detail of that challenge below.

   6. As to the Appellant's family life, the Judge concluded at [61] of  the
      Decision that it would be unduly harsh for Ms Smith to  accompany  the
      Appellant to the US for reasons given at [58] to [61] of the Decision.
       That finding is challenged by the Respondent for reasons which I  set
      out in detail later.   The  Respondent  also  challenges  the  Judge's
      failure to make any finding whether it would be unduly  harsh  for  Ms
      Smith to remain in the UK without the Appellant.

   7. The Judge went on to consider  whether  the  decision  to  deport  was
      disproportionate applying Article 8 ECHR more  generally  at  [67]  to
      [76] of the Decision.  Mr Clarke fairly conceded that  the  Respondent
      has not expressly challenged that section of the  Decision.   However,
      for reasons which I set out below, the errors which  I  have  accepted
      exist in relation to the Judge's consideration of private  and  family
      life  within  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  impact  on  the
      lawfulness also of the Judge's consideration outside the Rules.

   8. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Grant-
      Hutchison on 16 July 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:


           "...3.      The Judge has carefully considered the evidence  and
           has made appropriate findings which were open  to  her  to  make
           having also had the benefit of oral evidence on the day  of  the
           hearing.  It was open for the Judge to consider what weight  she
           felt it appropriate to place on the evidence before her.  In  so
           doing the Judge has properly applied the statutory law and  case
           law to the facts and circumstances of the appeal.  The Judge has
           given cogent reasons for her decision.
           4.    The grounds disclose no arguable error of law."

   9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kekic  on  6
      August 2019 as follows (so far as relevant):


           "..Arguably, the judge failed to  apply  the  correct  threshold
           when assessing whether the appellant would be able to  integrate
           back into US society and whether he would be  able  to  form  an
           adequate private life there.   It  is  also  arguable  that  she
           failed to make findings as to  whether  there  would  be  unduly
           harsh consequences for  the  appellant's  partner  were  she  to
           remain in the UK after his deportation.
           All the grounds are arguable."

  10. The case comes before me to determine whether  the  Decision  contains
      errors of law and if so whether the Decision should be set aside.

   DISCUSSION

  11. Mr Claire for the Appellant very fairly conceded that  the  Judge  had
      failed to consider whether it would be unduly harsh for  Ms  Smith  to
      remain in the UK without the Appellant and that  this  amounts  to  an
      error of law.  However, he submitted that the Judge had not  erred  in
      her consideration of the private life exception nor  when  considering
      the Article 8 claim outside the Rules and in consequence the error was
      not material.

  12. I accept, of course, as Judge Grant-Hutchison indicated,  that  it  is
      not for this Tribunal to interfere with findings lawfully  made  by  a
      First-tier Tribunal Judge if the criticisms of those findings  do  not
      identify errors of law but merely challenge the weight  given  to  the
      evidence (and see also the Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  UT  (Sri
      Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
      1095 at [19]).  However, for the reasons which follow I do not  accept
      that this is what the grounds do in this case and nor do I accept that
      the error of law which is conceded is immaterial.

  13. As an overall criticism, the section of the Decision dealing with  the
      Appellant's private and family life is  muddled  as  between  the  two
      tests.  The errors made in that regard are unfortunately  not  rescued
      by the section dealing  with  the  Article  8  claim  overall,  first,
      because, in conducting that exercise, it is relevant whether the tests
      in relation to private and family life  are  met  (and  therefore  the
      errors in that  regard  have  a  knock-on  consequence)  and,  second,
      because the Judge fails in that section to have  regard  to  the  fact
      that, in the deportation context, the statute required her to consider
      whether there are  "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above
      Exceptions 1 and 2" and not simply whether the  Respondent's  decision
      is disproportionate (see section 117C(6) Nationality, Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117C") read with NA (Pakistan)  v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662 - "NA (Pakistan)"
      - at [23] to [27] of the judgment).  I recognise that  this  criticism
      does not form an express part of the Respondent's grounds  but,  as  I
      have indicated, it follows from the errors made  in  relation  to  the
      consideration of the Appellant's family and private life  and  whether
      he meets the exceptions in that regard.

  14. As to the specific errors made, dealing  first  with  the  Appellant's
      relationship with Ms Smith, as I have already indicated, the Judge has
      failed to consider whether it would be unduly harsh for her to  remain
      in the UK without him.  As Mr Clarke pointed out, that error arises at
      a very early stage due to the Judge's failure at [55] of the Decision,
      when setting out the test under the Rules, to have regard to the third
      indent of rule 398(b) which required her to consider also  whether  it
      would be unduly harsh for Ms Smith to remain  in  the  UK  whilst  the
      Appellant goes to the US.

  15. Second, when dealing with whether it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  Ms
      Smith to go with the Appellant, the Judge also fails to have regard to
      the high threshold which applies.  As Mr Clarke points out, the  Judge
      failed to mention the Supreme Court's judgment  in  KO  (Nigeria)  and
      others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]  UKSC  53
      ("KO (Nigeria)"), which is the most  recent,  and  most  authoritative
      word on the threshold which applies.  Oddly, since the  Supreme  Court
      has resolved the issue, the Judge  refers  at  [59]  to  the  previous
      decisions of the Tribunal in KMO (Section 117 - unduly harsh)  Nigeria
      [2015] UKUT 00543 and MAB (para 399: "unduly harsh") USA  [2015]  UKUT
      00435 ("MAB") and as a result falls into  error  by  referring   to  a
      balance needing to be struck between the seriousness  of  the  offence
      and the impact on the partner.  It is fair  to  say  that  it  is  not
      evident from the paragraphs which follow that this is the way in which
      the Judge has approached the test and she does note the  passage  from
      MAB which the Supreme  Court  cited  with  approval  in  KO  (Nigeria)
      drawing attention to the threshold which applies.  However, thereafter
      it is difficult to discern any application of the high threshold which
      is there encompassed.

  16. A summary of the problems which Ms Smith might face in the US  appears
      at [58] of the Decision.  In short, those are that  she  suffers  from
      endometriosis  and  adenomyosis  which  she  says   are   debilitating
      conditions affecting her life.  She said that she would not be able to
      afford the medication to deal with those conditions in the US.  As the
      Respondent points out in her grounds, and  as  the  Judge  appears  to
      accept at least to some extent, there was little evidence in  relation
      to the conditions from which Ms Smith suffers and none in relation  to
      the cost of the medication in the  US.   The  second  element  is  the
      medical condition of Ms Smith's father.  Ms Smith says that her father
      was undergoing treatment for cancer and  that  she  assists  with  his
      care.  As the Judge notes at [58], the only evidence  in  this  regard
      dates back to October  2016  and  there  is  no  updating  information
      suggesting that Ms Smith's father is still undergoing  treatment.   In
      fairness to the Judge, she does there refer  to  "the  possibility  of
      relapse and alarm symptoms for which to be observant" but,  similarly,
      there is no medical evidence as to the likelihood of recurrence.

  17. The findings made by the Judge in this regard appear at [60] and  [61]
      of the Decision as follows:


           "60.  I accept that the USA is a modern country which  shares  a
           common language.  However, the appellant's partner is a  British
           citizen and suffers from a serious gynaecological condition.  It
           is not suggested that the appellant's immigration status in  the
           UK has been precarious.  He was lawfully  in  the  UK  when  the
           relationship began.  He has been settled and in employment.   It
           would not have been in  either  party's  contemplation  that  he
           could be removed.  Indeed his oral evidence is that  because  he
           had indefinite leave he assumed it was  as  good  as  a  British
           passport.  The appellant has never spent any significant  period
           of time in  United  States.   He  would  be  going  there  as  a
           stranger.  They have no home or support there.   Whilst  couples
           relocate to other parts of  the  world,  it  differs  if  it  is
           through choice.
           61.   It is noted that they have savings and I accept this could
           be used to provide accommodation however with the need  to  also
           pay for medication and treatment this would only be for  a  very
           short time.  There is no known family or other form  of  support
           available to them in the United States and it is well known that
           treatment  costs  in  the  United  States  are  prohibitive.   I
           consider that for the appellant's partner this would  amount  to
           more  than  very  significant  difficulties  but  very   serious
           hardship.  I find  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
           appellant's partner to relocate with the appellant to the United
           States."

  18. The Respondent's challenges these finding on the basis that  they  are
      based on speculation as to treatment costs, that the Judge has  failed
      to consider that the Appellant and Ms Smith would be able to  work  in
      the US, and has also failed to consider that they could  access  money
      from the Facilitated Returns Scheme which, with their �8,000  savings,
      would be sufficient to tide them over until they could find work.   In
      summary,  as  Mr  Clarke  put  the  Respondent's  case,  there  is  an
      inadequacy of reasoning and a failure to explain  on  what  basis  the
      high threshold is met.

  19. It is indeed difficult to discern on what basis the Judge found in the
      Appellant's favour on  this  issue.   I  accept  that  the  Judge  was
      entitled to point to the Appellant's unfamiliarity with the US as  one
      reason.  Although that is predominantly concerned with his own ability
      to integrate which falls within the private life exception,  it  is  a
      factor relevant to Ms  Smith's  ability  to  adapt.   Difficulties  in
      adapting and a general preference to continue family life  in  the  UK
      though, are not of themselves sufficient to overcome the threshold  in
      a removal context, let alone a deportation one where the threshold  is
      higher.

  20. I accept the Respondent's categorisation of the Judge's finding  about
      Ms Smith's medication as "speculative".   That  is  evident  from  the
      Judge's reference to it being "well known that treatment costs  ...are
      prohibitive".  On the face of it, that element of the findings has  no
      evidential underpinning as is also clear from [58] of the Decision  to
      which I have already referred.  Mr Claire did not seek to suggest that
      the Appellant had put forward evidence in that  regard,  and  none  is
      apparent either from the Appellant's bundle  nor  the  record  of  the
      evidence given.

  21. For those reasons, I agree that there is  an  error  of  law  made  in
      relation to the test whether the consequences of  deportation  of  the
      Appellant would be unduly harsh  for  Ms  Smith,  both  on  the  issue
      whether it would be unduly harsh for her to go with the Appellant  and
      the failure to refer at all to the possibility of her remaining in the
      UK without him.

  22. Turning then to the private life  test,  this  was  the  focus  of  Mr
      Claire's submissions for obvious reasons since, if  he  were  able  to
      show that there was no error in this regard, the error in relation  to
      the family life exception would make no difference.

  23. The Judge's findings in this regard begin at  [62]  of  the  Decision.
      The test is accurately set out.  The Judge  was  clearly  entitled  to
      find that the Appellant has been in the UK lawfully for half his life.
       He was given exceptional leave to remain in 2004 aged thirteen years.
       He is now aged twenty-seven years.  Similarly, the  Judge  found  and
      was entitled to find on the evidence that the  Appellant  is  socially
      and culturally integrated in the UK.  The Judge's  reasoning  in  that
      regard appears at [63] and [64] of the Decision and, whilst brief,  is
      nonetheless adequate.  However, the factors and evidence  relied  upon
      by the Judge at [64] of the Decision on this issue are not relevant to
      the question whether there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to
      integration in the US.  The two  are  separate  issues.   I  therefore
      reject Mr Claire's submission which sought to introduce that  evidence
      in support of his assertion that  the  Judge  has  reached  a  finding
      properly open to her on the issue of integration in the US.

  24. The Judge's findings that there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to
      integration in the US therefore are as follows:


           "65.  Whether  there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
           appellant's integration into the USA is less clear.  Objectively
           as the respondent states, it is a modern country  and  shares  a
           common language however the appellant has never lived there  and
           he reasonably says he would not know where to start.  There  are
           likely to be obstacles in that he was never part of US  society,
           has the most tenuous link by sting of being born there and so it
           is not re-integration in any real sense.  He is being sent to  a
           country he does not know.
           66.   It was held in MF (Nigeria) It is common ground  that  the
           first step that has to undertaken under  the  new  rules  is  to
           decide whether deportation would be contrary to an  individual's
           Article 8 rights on the grounds that (i) the case  falls  within
           para 398(b) or (c) and (ii) one or more of  the  conditions  set
           out in para 399 (a) or (b) or para 399A (a) or (b) applies.   If
           the case falls within para 398(b) or (c)  and  one  or  more  of
           those conditions applies, then the new rules implicitly  provide
           that deportation would be contrary to Article 8.  Whether a case
           satisfies the criteria set out in para 398 (a), (b)  or  (c)  is
           self-evidently a question of "hard-edged" fact; and whether  one
           or more of the conditions set out in para 399  or  399A  applies
           may also involve a question of "hard-edged" fact.  However taken
           with my finding with the [sic] regarding the appellant's partner
           I find on balance there would be very significant  obstacles  to
           integration."

  25. Mr Clarke relied on the oft-cited paragraph in Secretary of State  for
      the Home Department v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 ("Kamara") as to  how
      the test in relation to integration is to be applied:

           "14.   In  my  view,  the  concept  of  a   foreign   criminal's
           "integration" into the country to which it is proposed  that  he
           be deported, as set out  in  section  117C(4)(c)  and  paragraph
           399A, is a broad one. It is not confined to the mere ability  to
           find a job or to sustain life while living in the other country.
           It is not appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject
           to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a  court  or
           tribunal simply to direct itself in the  terms  that  Parliament
           has chosen to use. The idea of "integration" calls for  a  broad
           evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual will
           be enough of an insider in terms of understanding  how  life  in
           the society in that other country is carried on and  a  capacity
           to participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity  to
           be accepted there, to be able to operate on a  day-to-day  basis
           in that society and to build  up  within  a  reasonable  time  a
           variety  of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to   the
           individual's private or family life."

  26. I accept Mr Claire's submission that the Judge  was  not  required  to
      make express reference to Kamara.  However, reference to it  may  have
      avoided the errors which the Respondent has identified in the  passage
      of the Decision which I have set out and  which  I  accept  amount  to
      errors of law.

  27. First, as Mr Clarke pointed out, the test is one of "integration"  and
      not "re-integration".  That is not a significant error.  As I accepted
      in discussion with Mr Claire, one of the relevant factors in this case
      is that the Appellant has never  really  lived  in  the  US  and  that
      clearly has some bearing on the question whether he might be  able  to
      integrate there at all (in other words, whether he would be "enough of
      an insider in terms of understanding  how  life  in  that  society  is
      carried on").

  28. Second, the Judge is of course entitled to  find  that  the  Appellant
      would be unfamiliar with US society due to that factor.  However,  the
      other question is whether the Appellant would nonetheless be  able  to
      participate in society in the US.  As the Judge notes at [65]  of  the
      Decision, the US is a modern country and there would  be  no  language
      difficulties.  The Appellant has worked in the UK. There is  reference
      in the record of the evidence to problems which he considers he  would
      have in transferring that experience over to the US market  but  there
      is no consideration of that evidence by the Judge in her findings  and
      no finding made as to the position in relation to employment.

  29. Third, as Mr Clarke pointed out, the finding made by the Judge at [65]
      of the Decision is only that "there are likely to be obstacles in that
      he was never part of US society".  That is not a  finding  that  there
      would be very significant obstacles. In fact, the  Judge's  conclusion
      that there would be very significant obstacles stems from what is said
      at [66] of the Decision.  That paragraph is very difficult to  follow.
      It is not clear whether, by the  reference  to  what  is  said  in  MF
      (Nigeria), the Judge is saying that  her  finding  that  it  would  be
      unduly harsh for Ms Smith to go to the US with the Appellant is to  be
      amalgamated with her finding as to the obstacles  to  the  Appellant's
      private life integration in US to enable him to succeed as a whole  or
      whether she is saying that the inability of Ms Smith to  go  with  the
      Appellant is a factor which affects  his  own  ability  to  integrate.
      Either way, there is an error.

  30. If the first interpretation applies, then,  if  the  Judge  had  found
      without error that the consequences of deportation for Ms  Smith  were
      unduly harsh, there would be no need to make any  further  finding  in
      relation to the  private  life  exception.   The  Appellant  would  be
      entitled to benefit from the family life exception. As it is,  I  have
      concluded that there is an error  in  relation  to  the  unduly  harsh
      finding which therefore impacts on this finding.   Leaving  aside  the
      error in that regard, if there  were  no  error  in  relation  to  the
      finding on the private life exception and the Judge had  independently
      found that  there  were  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration
      leaving this paragraph out of account, I accept that what is  said  at
      [66] of the Decision would not be material.

  31. However, either the Judge has taken  into  account  the  unduly  harsh
      finding and coupled that with the finding of  obstacles  to  reach  an
      overall conclusion that there would be very significant  obstacles  by
      amalgamating the two exceptions (which would be the wrong approach  at
      this stage) or has taken into account that,  in  her  view,  Ms  Smith
      could not go with the Appellant and therefore that would impact on his
      integration in the US.  The separation from Ms Smith if she could  not
      go with him is part of the consideration in  relation  to  the  unduly
      harsh  consequences  of  deportation  when  considering   a   possible
      separation of the partners.  It  is  in  consequence  of  the  Judge's
      failure to consider that at the appropriate  point  that  the  finding
      made at [66] of the Decision is out of place.  In any event, as I have
      already concluded, the earlier unduly harsh  finding  itself  contains
      errors of law and therefore, whatever is said to be the  relevance  of
      that finding at this point in the Decision, the Judge's  finding  that
      there are very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  is  similarly
      flawed.

  32. The finding that there are very significant obstacles  to  integration
      is therefore flawed by an insufficiency of reasoning  and  failure  to
      take into account relevant evidence (as to  employment,  accommodation
      etc) and by the taking into account of an irrelevant consideration  as
      to the separation of the Appellant from Ms Smith.

  33. As I have already pointed out and as Mr Clarke accepted, there  is  no
      express challenge to the Judge's consideration of  Article  8  outside
      the Rules. However, given Mr Claire's reliance on  this  part  of  the
      Decision as reason for saying that there the errors are not  material,
      I need to say something about this.

  34. First, as I have already pointed out, the test when looking at Article
      8 outside the exceptions is governed by rule 398(c) and  Section  117C
      (6).  Although Section 117C (6) expressly applies only to a case where
      the prison sentence is under four years, the Court  of  Appeal  in  NA
      (Pakistan) concluded that this was a drafting error and that the  same
      test applies, namely whether there are very  compelling  reasons  over
      and above the exceptions.  Indeed, the Judge recognises at [54] of the
      Decision that this  is  the  correct  test.    However,  there  is  no
      recognition of that test at [67] to [76] of the  Decision.   I  accept
      that the Judge is required to carry out a balancing exercise, but that
      balancing exercise has to be carried out giving appropriate weight  to
      the public interest which applies.  The Judge is obliged by statute to
      have regard to the relevant test.

  35. Second, and in any event, that passage is infected by the errors  made
      when assessing the private and family  life  exceptions,  particularly
      that relating to the Appellant's family life as is evident  from  what
      is said at [75] of the Decision.  Put another  way,  the  errors  made
      when  determining  whether  the  exceptions   are   met   infect   the
      consideration whether there are very compelling circumstances over and
      above those exceptions (see also what is said by the Court  of  Appeal
      at [36] of the judgment in NA (Pakistan))   For  those  reasons,  that
      section of the Decision cannot save the remainder.

  36. I therefore find that the Decision contains  errors  of  law.   I  set
      aside the Decision. In relation to re-making, this is not a case where
      it is necessary or appropriate to remit the appeal to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.  There is no or no significant dispute of fact.   There  are
      some assertions  relied  upon  by  the  Appellant  which,  as  I  have
      indicated, do not appear supported by evidence.  As Mr Clarke  pointed
      out, there is no recent evidence about the medical  conditions  of  Ms
      Smith's father or the Appellant's mother.  Similarly, there is  no  or
      no substantial evidence in relation to the extent  and  impact  of  Ms
      Smith's own medical condition, the treatment she requires and the cost
      in the US of the medication which she requires (even if that  is  only
      evidence obtained from the internet).  However, there are no  disputes
      of fact concerning the genuineness  of  the  Appellant's  relationship
      with Ms Smith or that with his family nor any challenge to the finding
      that the Appellant is socially and culturally integrated.  As such,  I
      am prepared to take as read the record of the evidence set out in  the
      Decision at [20] to [42] of the Decision and to preserve  the  finding
      that the Appellant is socially and culturally integrated in the UK.

  37. Equally, though, I did not consider it appropriate  to  continue  with
      the re-making of the decision at this  hearing.   Although  there  has
      been no application to adduce  further  evidence,  I  have  identified
      above some areas where further evidence would be of assistance to  the
      Tribunal.  There may be other areas  where  the  Appellant  wishes  to
      adduce further evidence. Further, and in any event, the Tribunal  made
      a direction that the Appellant should not be produced  from  detention
      and he was not therefore present at the hearing.  Nor, so far as I  am
      aware, was Ms Smith present.  Despite the lack of any  application  to
      adduce further evidence, I would be reluctant to re-make  a  decision,
      particularly in an  appeal  previously  allowed,  without  giving  the
      Appellant and his main witness(es) the opportunity to attend  to  give
      oral evidence. I have therefore given directions below in  preparation
      for the resumed hearing.

   CONCLUSION

  38. For the above reasons, I conclude  that  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart  promulgated  on  21  June  2019  contains
      errors of law.  I set that aside.  I give directions below for the re-
      making of the decision.

DECISION
The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Bart-Stewart  promulgated  on  21
June 2019 contains errors of law.  I set that decision aside.   I  make  the
following directions for the re-making of the decision:
    1. Within 28 days from the date when this decision is sent, the parties
       are to file with the Tribunal and  serve  on  the  other  party  any
       further evidence on which they rely.
    2. The resumed hearing will be relisted on  the  first  available  date
       after 6 weeks from the date when this decision is sent with  a  time
       estimate of � day.  The Appellant's representatives  are  to  inform
       the Tribunal within 28 days from the date when this decision is sent
       whether an interpreter is required (and for which language) so  that
       one can be booked and whether the  Appellant  remains  in  detention
       (and if so at which establishment) and confirm  that  he  wishes  to
       attend the hearing.
