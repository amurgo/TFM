Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Claire, Counsel, instructed by Wai Leung
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity order.

 2. The appellant claimed to be a Syrian national; albeit this was disputed
    by the respondent. On August 27, 2015 he applied for  leave  to  remain
    but his application was refused on August 19, 2016.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of  appeal  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on September 2, 2016.  His
    appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal   Abrebrese
    (hereinafter called "the Judge") on November 29, 2017 and in a decision
    promulgated on December 29, 2017 the Judge refused his  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

 4. The appellant appealed the decision on January 11, 2018. Permission  to
    appeal was granted by  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    MacDonald on January 24, 2018.

 5. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above. They both  agreed  the  Judge  had  erred
    because the finding that the appellant was Palestinian  was  unreasoned
    especially as it was the respondent's case  he  was  Egyptian  and  the
    appellant's case he was Syrian. The Judge referred to  "subjective  and
    objective evidence" for reaching this conclusion but failed to identify
    such evidence.

 6. Nationality was a key issue in this case and Mr  Deller  conceded  this
    finding was fundamentally flawed as no evidence had been identified  by
    the Judge to support his finding.

 7. In the circumstances the parties invited me to remit this matter to the
    First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

 8. In light of the above issue I concluded there was an error in  law  and
    there was no alternative to effectively restarting the appeal process.

    DECISION

 9. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I  set  aside  the  decision.  I
    remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Abrebrese.


Signed                              Date     11/04/2018
