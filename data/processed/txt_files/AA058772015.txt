                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge R A Cox on 19 October 2015 against the  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge K W Brown made in a decision and  reasons
         promulgated on 21 September 2015 dismissing the Appellant's asylum,
         humanitarian protection and human rights appeals.

    2.     The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, born on  29  September
         1991.  He had appealed against the refusal decision  taken  by  the
         Respondent on 11 March 2015.  The Appellant had entered the  United
         Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant in October 2009.  His
         Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  visa  was  subsequently  extended
         until 29 October 2014 but was curtailed on 9 May 2011 until 8  July
         2012.  The Appellant claimed asylum on 9 January 2014.   He  stated
         that he feared to return to Sri Lanka  because  of  his  past  LTTE
         involvement and family connections.

    3.     When granting permission to appeal, First-tier Tribunal Judge  R
         A Cox considered that it  was  arguable  that  Judge  K  W  Brown's
         adverse  credibility  findings  were  variously   irrational,   ill
         founded, inconsistent and reached to the wrong standard of proof.

    4.     The Respondent filed notice under rule 24 dated 29  August  2015
         indicating that the appeal was opposed.  Standard  directions  were
         made by the tribunal and the appeal was listed for adjudication  of
         whether or not there was a material error of law.

    Submissions

    5.     Ms Harris for the Appellant relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal
         previously lodged and the grant of permission to appeal. In summary
         Counsel  submitted  that  there  were  multiple   errors   in   the
         determination.   There  were  inconsistent   findings   about   the
         Appellant's Sri  Lankan  court  documents,  which  were  illogical,
         inconsistent and irrational.  The judge had  impermissibly  allowed
         his own views about plausibility to inform his findings, as seen in
         his finding about the likelihood that the Appellant and his  father
         had continued to run their business and to work with the LTTE, even
         after they had been challenged.  The judge had applied too  high  a
         standard of proof, repeatedly using the term  "unlikely"  when  the
         lower standard applied.  The judge  had  incorrectly  assessed  the
         Appellant's documents, as seen in his dismissal of the  Appellant's
         arrest warrant as a photocopy of a photocopy.  It  was  plain  from
         the document produced that there was writing  on  the  court  form.
         There should have been an assessment of authenticity  made  by  the
         Respondent.  The judge's  treatment  of  the  significance  of  the
         payment of a bribe for the Appellant's release was at variance with
         the observations in GJ and Others (post-civil war:  returnees)  Sri
         Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).   The decision and reasons should
         be set aside, and the  appeal  reheard  before  another  First-tier
         Tribunal judge.

    6.     Mr Kandola for the Respondent relied on the Respondent's rule 24
         notice.  He submitted that the decision and  reasons  disclosed  no
         error of law.  There was no duty  on  the  Respondent  to  seek  to
         verify the Appellant's documents  which  in  most  cases  would  be
         impractical and inconclusive.  The Appellant's complaints  at  most
         were just a disagreement with the  judge's  proper  findings.   The
         judge had explained why he found that there was no  real  depth  to
         the evidence and that the Appellant was not credible.  The decision
         and reasons should stand.

    7.     Ms Harris wished to add nothing by way of reply.

    No material error of law

    8.     In the tribunal's view, the terms of the grant of permission  to
         appeal were far too generous a response to what was  a  feeble  and
         repetitive reasons challenge.  The tribunal agrees with Mr  Kandola
         that the grounds are no more than  disagreement  with  the  judge's
         proper and sustainable findings.

    9.     The fact that the Upper Tribunal  has  had  to  provide  country
         guidance on claims from Sri Lanka at various times is an indication
         of the large number of appeals from that source.   Indeed,  despite
         the defeat of the LTTE on 17 May  2009,  now  over  6ï¿½  years  ago,
         asylum claims continue to be made, often after  surprising  periods
         of delay, as in the present appeal.  Some claims are recognised  as
         well founded by the Home Office and hence are never seen on appeal,
         so that judges see only the contested claims which as a  group  are
         likely to be weaker.

    10.    It is beyond dispute that Sri Lanka is  an  endemically  corrupt
         country,  where  false  documents  are  readily  available:  for  a
         striking example in  the  public  domain  of  the  depths  of  such
         corruption see the www.Tamilnation.org  report  on  the  Katunayaka
         Airport bombing by the LTTE on 24 July 2001, which claims that  Sri
         Lankan military officers were bribed.   It may be almost too  trite
         to say so, but asylum claimants in the United Kingdom  have  little
         or nothing to lose from pursuing the process as far  as  they  can.
         The worst that can happen is that they  might  be  returned  at  no
         expense to themselves at the end of what is all too  often  a  long
         drawn out appeals process, during which time they are supported  by
         the state if unable to work.  Establishing the  truth  (or  rather,
         the facts to the standard of a reasonable likelihood) can often  be
         a difficult process.

    11.    Experienced First-tier Tribunal judges such as Judge K  W  Brown
         must be expected to  recognise  certain  familiar  elements  to  an
         appeal such as that advanced by the  present  Appellant,  of  which
         open entry on his own passport endorsed with a valid  visa  to  the
         United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and a long and
         unsatisfactorily explained delay in claiming  asylum  (measured  in
         this instance in years) are frequently encountered.  That  was  the
         background to the present appeal.  It was on its face  a  weak  and
         possibly contrived claim.

    12.    Despite those familiar and unpromising elements noted above, and
         without alluding to  them  in  any  manner  whatsoever,  the  judge
         examined the case put forward by the Appellant in the  round,  with
         evident anxious scrutiny.  The judge  placed  the  claim  into  its
         context,  setting  out  the  Appellant's  story  and  the   country
         background information: see [12] to [23] and [34] and [35]  of  the
         determination.

    13.    There  was  no  obligation  on  the  Appellant  to  produce  any
         documents or other from of potential corroboration, but as he chose
         to do so (some 5 years after entering the United Kingdom as a  Tier
         4 (General) Student Migrant), the judge was bound to  assess  them.
         There was no obligation on the Secretary of  State  to  attempt  to
         verify the documents and no obligation on the  judge  to  make  any
         such direction, which seemed to be Ms Harris's submission.  At [47]
         of the determination the judge  correctly  applied  Tanveer  Ahmed*
         [2002] UKIAT 00439 to the selection the Appellant had provided.

    14.    The judge examined the Appellant's documents with  care  and  in
         detail.   It was not the judge's findings which  were  inconsistent
         or irrational, but rather the Appellant's confused and  conflicting
         tale: see, e.g. [40] of  the  determination.   The  arrest  warrant
         produced was fairly described by the judge as barely legible and by
         no means of the standard to  be  expected  of  a  genuine  official
         document.   The judge  correctly  assessed  all  of  the  documents
         together.

    15.    Contrary to Ms Harris's submissions, the judge did not apply his
         own views of plausibility, but had  first  sought  the  Appellant's
         explanation of the issues of concern during the evidence: see  [23]
         of the determination.  The judge applied ordinary logic at [37] and
         [38] when finding that the Appellant's father would have been at as
         much at risk as the Appellant had their claimed business  continued
         supplying the LTTE  even  after  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  had
         challenged them.  It is obvious that such a business, supplying the
         sworn enemy of the  state,  would  have  been  susceptible  to  the
         seizure and sequestration of its assets.

    16.    The judge's use of the term "unlikely" when discussing  elements
         of the evidence was made in the light of the correct self direction
         set out at [6] of the determination.  It is  also  plain  that  the
         judge was careful to consider alternative possibilities as a  cross
         check on his conclusions: see [48] of the determination.  It was  a
         thoroughly bad point to submit that the wrong standard of proof had
         been applied by the experienced judge, a bad point which  is  taken
         far too frequently in this jurisdiction.

    17.    The judge's assessment of the consequences of the payment  of  a
         bribe at [40] was open to him and was not in any  way  in  conflict
         with GJ (Sri Lanka) (above).  The judge's findings as to risk  were
         not based on the bribe claim alone, but on his  assessment  of  the
         Appellant's evidence as  a  whole,  in  the  round,  as  the  judge
         reiterated at various stages:  see,  e.g.  [47]  and  [49]  of  the
         determination.

    18.     In  the  tribunal's  judgment,  the  judge's  decision  was   a
         comprehensive reflection  on  the  various  issues  raised  in  the
         appeal, and his findings were balanced and logical.  The assertions
         of irrationality had no substance and should not  have  been  made.
         There was no error of law.  There is no basis for interfering  with
         the judge's decision  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal,  which
         dismissal must stand.




    DECISION

    The tribunal finds that there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    original decision, which stands unchanged
