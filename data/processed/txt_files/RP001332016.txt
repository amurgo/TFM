                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant.  This direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties.  Any failure to comply with this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision dated 27 September 2017 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Chohan which allowed the appellant's appeal against
    his deportation to Somalia.

 3. For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of State for
    the Home Department as the respondent  and  to  AD  as  the  appellant,
    reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The background to this matter is that the appellant was born in Somalia
    on 10 October 1994.  He came to the UK illegally with  his  mother  and
    siblings on 27 August 2002 at the age of 8.  He  and  his  family  were
    granted refugee status on 14 October 2003.  That grant was made on  the
    basis that the family were from the Ashraf minority clan and  from  the
    Urkad area of Somalia.

 5. The appellant has a prolific offending history.  He was convicted on 29
    December 2009 of robbery and given a 12 month referral  order.   On  31
    October 2009 he was made the subject of a  youth  rehabilitation  order
    with a supervision requirement for 6 months and his referral  order  of
    29 September 2009 was revoked.  On 14 September 2010 he  was  convicted
    of using disorderly behaviour and given a fine of �50  and  subject  to
    �85 cost.  On 15 February 2011 he committed an offence  while  on  bail
    using disorderly behaviour and was fined �75 with costs of  �60.   This
    litany of offending continues through 2011 until the index  offence  in
    2014.  On 6 March 2014  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  12  months'
    imprisonment at a youth offender institution for affray.  On  26  March
    2014 he was sentenced  to  6  weeks'  concurrent  imprisonment  with  a
    restraining order in order to protect from harassment for battery.

 6. Those matters led to the respondent issuing a decision on 9  July  2015
    which ceased the appellant's refugee status and found that he could  be
    returned to Somalia.  On 14 July 2015 the respondent made a deportation
    order against the appellant.  Those two documents were  served  on  the
    appellant on 20 July 2015.

 7. The appellant appealed against those decisions and in a decision  dated
    16 November 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew allowed the appeal as
    not in accordance with the law and remitted it to the respondent.   The
    substantive part of her decision states as follows:

         "2.  It was agreed by both representatives at the  commencement  of
             the hearing this appeal should be allowed to the  extent  that
             the Decision was not in accordance with the  law  because  the
             Respondent had decided to cease the Appellant's refugee status
             applying Article  1(c)(v)  of  the  Convention  and  Paragraph
             399A(v) of the Rules.  In applying paragraph  399A(v)  of  the
             Rules the Respondent had erred in law as the Appellant claimed
             asylum in 2002  and  the  Respondent  can  only  rely  on  the
             cessation clause of the 1951 Convention".

 8. Notwithstanding all that had gone before and the clear intention of the
    respondent to deport him  on  18  March  2016  the  appellant  offended
    further, being convicted of driving otherwise than in accordance with a
    licence, using a vehicle while  uninsured  and  possessing  a  class  B
    controlled drug.  He received a sentence of �150 fine, was disqualified
    from driving for  twelve  months  and  given  a  12  month  conditional
    discharge.

 9. In due course, the respondent made a new decision dated 9 June 2016  in
    which she again ceased the appellant's refugee status  and  found  that
    the appellant could be returned to Somalia without there being a breach
    of his human rights.

10. The appellant appealed and the matter came before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chohan on 15 September 2017.

11. Judge Chohan set his substantive reasoning in [2] and [3]:

         "2.  When the matter came before me, Ms Masih  submitted  that  the
             respondent's latest decision had failed to take  into  account
             Judge Andrew's decision and therefore was flawed  and  not  in
             accordance with the law.  It  is  not  clear  as  to  why  the
             respondent ignored the judge's decision.  Mr Hussain could not
             shed light on the matter and having taken advice from a senior
             caseworker, requested that the matter be adjourned or  in  the
             alternative the matter should be sent back to the  respondent.
             I did suggest to Mr Hussain that perhaps the  decision  should
             be  withdrawn.   Mr  Hussain  advised  that  as  this  was   a
             deportation matter the senior caseworker  did  not  have  such
             authority; only the department known as CCD could make such  a
             decision.

         3.   The  Tribunal  has  no  power  to  remit  the  matter  to  the
             respondent.   The  Tribunal  must  make  a  decision.   It  is
             apparent that the respondent's  decision  is  flawed  and  the
             matter has been aggravated by the  fact  that  Judge  Andrew's
             decision has been ignored.  In the circumstances, I allow  the
             appeal and it is a matter for the respondent as to whether  or
             not a new decision is made.  However, if a new decision is  to
             be made then the respondent  is  referred  to  Judge  Andrew's
             decision and the reason  why  it  had  been  allowed  on  that
             occasion should be given careful attention".

    The decision goes on to indicate that the "appeal  is  allowed  to  the
         extent above".

12. Notwithstanding the concerns of the Home Office Presenting Officer  set
    out in paragraph 2 of Judge Chohan's  decision  above,  the  respondent
    appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  grounds  of  appeal  state  as
    follows:

         "As in paragraph 2 of the previously  allowed  determination  (also
         submitted with this application) confirms that status is ceased  in
         accordance with both Article 1(c)(v) of the Refugee Convention  and
         paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules.   Having  relied  on  both
         Article 1(c)(v) of the Refugee Convention and the Immigration Rules
         such as referred to at paragraph 60 of the decision letter 21/09/16
         it was  incumbent  on  the  FtTJ  to  have  considered  the  matter
         substantively.  Failure to do is an error in law.

         Reliance is placed on the authority  of  Salahadin  Abdulla  [2010]
         EUECJ C-176/08 that was also  relied  on  at  paragraph  6  of  the
         decision letter 21/09/17 that the FtTJ should have considered.   If
         the FtTJ was of the opinion that  the  guidance  afforded  by  this
         authority was not relevant then he was bound to give clear  reasons
         why this authority was  not  relevant.   Failure  to  address  this
         authority that was relied on in the decision letter amounts  to  an
         error in law".

13. At the hearing before me the parties were in agreement that the  First-
    tier Tribunal had erred in approaching the appeal on a technical  basis
    and  not  making  substantive  decisions  on  the  grounds  of   appeal
    concerning whether the respondent had made a valid decision on  ceasing
    refugee status, the Article 3 and humanitarian  protection  claims  and
    the Article 8 ECHR claims. The parties were  in  agreement  that  where
    there were no findings of fact on any of the grounds the appeal  should
    be set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  re-made  de
    novo.

14. The agreement reached by the parties was entirely  in  accord  with  my
    preliminary view of the case and so I find that a material error of law
    occurred such that the decision must be set aside and remitted to be re-
    made de  novo  on  consideration  of  all  grounds  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside  to  be  re-made  de  novo  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

16. The appeal will be heard in Birmingham and not before FTTJ Chohan.
