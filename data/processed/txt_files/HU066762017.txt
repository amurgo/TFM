Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Claimant/Respondent:    Mr O Manley of Counsel, instructed by AWS
                             Solicitors Ltd


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh.  He first entered  the  United
    Kingdom as a student in March 2011.

2.   The claimant seeks to appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of
    State for  the  Home  Department  dated  18th  May  2017  refusing  the
    application for leave to remain on the basis of human rights and  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

3.   The basis of refusal was that the claimant had exercised  deception  in
    the obtaining of the TOEIC language certificate and that there were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the family returning to Bangladesh.

4.   The claimant sought to appeal against that decision, which appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Suffield-Thompson hearing on 24th July
    2017.  In a determination promulgated on 1st August 2017 the appeal was
    allowed both on  the  basis  that  the  Judge  was  satisfied  that  no
    deception had been exercised by the claimant and that  there  would  be
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being commenced in Bangladesh.

5.   The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  sought  to  appeal
    against that decision and leave to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted.  Thus the matter comes before me to determine  the  issues  as
    between the parties.

6.   In terms of the deception aspect of  the  TOEIC,  Mr  Manley  submitted
    that the Judge had found the claimant to be credible and that that  was
    a finding which was unassailable in  the  circumstances  of  the  case.
    Also, given the health of the appellant's spouse, it was entirely  open
    to the Judge to conclude that she would not be able safely to travel to
    Bangladesh and  that  that  amounted  to  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    reintegration and/or exceptional or compassionate circumstances.

7.   The difficulty, it seems to me with the approach taken by the Judge  to
    the matter of deception, is that there is no acknowledgement whatsoever
    in the determination as to the context in which  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant should be considered.  Although the  determination  sets  out
    certain legal principles in terms of family or private life,  there  is
    no  recognition  as  to  the  jurisprudence  relating  to   the   TOEIC
    certificates.  Particularly there was no recognition for  example  that
    SM and Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof)  UTIAC  made  it  clear
    that the Secretary of State's generic evidence was such as to discharge
    the evidential burden upon the Secretary of State, such that the burden
    then fell upon the claimant.  The course did not discharge the  overall
    burden invested upon the Secretary of State.

8.   It seems to me to be fundamental to any consideration of  the  evidence
    to be clear as to the contextual nature of that consideration.

9.   It was of course open to the Judge to be unimpressed with  the  quality
    of the evidence as adduced,  provided  that  the  full  nature  of  the
    evidence is considered.    In  Annex  A  the  nature  of  the  evidence
    produced on behalf of the Secretary of State it was that  the  claimant
    had taken part in the test at Colwell College on 15th January 2013  and
    the test at Eden College International on 19th March 2013.

10.  It was the evidence of the claimant that he had never attended  Colwell
    College and that was accepted by the Judge.  In those circumstances the
    Judge felt that little weight could be given to  the  ETS  selt  source
    data.  Linked with that was the ETS TOEIC test centre look-up tool  for
    Eden College International on 19th March 2013, the day accepted by  the
    claimant that he was there, to show that there  were  two  questionable
    results and 60 invalid results out of a total of  62  tests  that  were
    taken.

11.  The Judge noted that fact.  The Judge noted also the witness  statement
    of Professor French that there was a 2% error rate of false  positives.
    The Judge took that to mean that a valid test  could  be  found  to  be
    false.

12.  It was the evidence of the claimant that he did indeed attend  on  19th
    March and that people were cheating at that college  but  that  he  was
    not.

13.  Mr Manley submits that, on the basis of  the  2%  error  rate,  it  was
    properly open to the Judge to conclude, having heard the claimant, that
    he was one of the very few at the  college  that  had  taken  the  test
    properly.

14.  However the Judge did not, as I so  find,  properly  consider  all  the
    evidence that was presented by the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department in respect of that particular college.  There  was  also  in
    the same bundle of documents a Project Fa�ade - criminal  enquiry  into
    abuse of the TOEIC specifically referring to Eden College International
    London.  It indicated that between 20th March  2012  and  5th  February
    2014 there had been 2,439 TOEIC speaking and  writing  tests  of  which
    1,878 was found to be invalid and 561 questionable.  It was  said  that
    that demonstrated clearly the organised and  widespread  abuse  of  the
    TOEIC that took place at the centre.  It was said  also  that  the  BBC
    Panorama programme highlighted abuse at the college, invigilators  were
    shown to read out answers  to  listening  and  reading  candidates  and
    pilots (imposters) were shown taking the TOEIC exam on  behalf  of  the
    entire classrooms of students while the students stood next to them.

15.  That is of significance in this case as part of  the  credibility.    A
    factor found in favour of the claimant was that he was able to describe
    the college and who was taking part at the time of the  test.   Clearly
    if the claimant was one of those classroom students, who were  cheating
    as described by the BBC, then he would be fully aware of the layout.

16.  The nature of the evidence of the  Project  Fa�ade  is  essentially  to
    indicate  that  Eden  College  was  a  bogus  college   in   terms   of
    examinations.

17.  It seems to me only proper that that  full  context  should  have  been
    appreciated by the Judge in the  assessment  of  credibility  that  was
    made.

18.  The assessment of credibility essentially was that the appellant was  a
    good English speaker and had no need therefore to cheat.  As  was  made
    clear by the court in MA (Nigeria) [2016] UKUT 450. And in paragraph 57
    in particular, the ability to speak English was not of itself a defence
    to the accusation of deception; there may be a range of reasons  why  a
    person is proficient in English and yet  engage  in  the  TOEIC  fraud.
    Such may include lack of confidence, the fear of failure, lack of  time
    and commitment and contempt for the immigration system.

19.  In common sense it would seem  to  be  extraordinary  that,  given  the
    entirely bogus nature of the college, exceptionally it was the claimant
    who was genuine in his taking of the test.  Clearly it  is  open  to  a
    Judge, having heard the claimant, to make that  assessment  but,  as  I
    have indicated, it should be a finding made in the  proper  context  of
    the evidence as produced and I find that that  in  this  case  was  not
    done.  I find therefore that there was a material error of law in  that
    approach.

20.  In terms of Article 8 generally  I  do  not  uphold  the  Secretary  of
    State's challenge.  The  respondent  made  clear  that  the  claimant's
    partner  had  very  serious  health  issues  which  would  prevent  any
    prolonged flying.  The Judge recognised  that  a  ten  hour  flight  to
    Bangladesh would be injurious to her health.  What is suggested by  the
    Secretary of State in the grounds of challenge is that she could travel
    to Bangladesh by train which would take sixteen days.  It seems  to  me
    that that is a ridiculous suggestion to make given the  nature  of  her
    health.  The Judge properly considered  that  she  will  be  unable  to
    relocate  to  Bangladesh,  that  that  would  either   amount   to   an
    insurmountable   obstacle   to   her    reintegration,    alternatively
    compassionate circumstances to be borne in mind under Article  8.   The
    Judge  then  considered  whether  the   claimant's   removal   in   the
    circumstances would be proportionate and concluded that it  would  not.
    That of course was on the basis that the  claimant  had  not  committed
    deception.  Whether that factor if established,  will  be  such  as  to
    render his removal proportionate, particularly in the  public  interest
    is of course not a factor that was considered in the  mix.   Clearly  a
    finding as to deception or  not  is  a  relevant  factor  to  determine
    properly the aspect of Article 8 of the ECHR in particular,  given  the
    public interest considerations which would arise.

21.  Having found a material error of law  in  the  approach  taken  by  the
    Judge I set the decision aside to be remade.

22.   Given  that  the  issue  of  the  TOEIC  involves  considerations   of
    credibility it is appropriate that this appeal be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal to determine the issues.

23.  I  do  not  seek  to  preserve  any  findings  as  that  would  perhaps
    unreasonably tie the hands of any Judge who considers the  matter.   No
    doubt were the Judge to conclude, having heard the evidence within  its
    proper context that the allegation of deception falls away, then it may
    well be that he or she would be entitled  to  adopt  the  reasoning  of
    Judge Suffield-Thompson when it comes to the approach taken to  Article
    8.  Of course it will be a matter for the Judge but  it  might  perhaps
    correspond with common sense and fairness.


Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State before the Upper Tribunal  is  allowed.
The First tier tribunal decision is set aside to  be  remade  in  the  First
