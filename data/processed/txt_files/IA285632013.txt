For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Kashif Ali, was born on  3  June  1988  and  is  a  male
    citizen of Pakistan.  The appellant first entered the United Kingdom as
    a student but, on 25 April 2013, he married Mahria Begum and applied on
    3 June 2013 for application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    for settlement and on the basis  that  he  was  married  to  a  British
    citizen.  The respondent refused the application on 25  June  2013  and
    the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Stott)  which,
    in a determination  promulgated  on  9  December  2013,  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission, Designated Judge Zucker wrote at [4]:

         Whilst being very slow to grant permission to  challenge  what  are
         largely findings of fact, it is arguable that the judge  has  erred
         in law in this case by arguably going behind a concession  (see  NR
         (Jamaica) [2009] EWCA Civ 856); failing to make a finding as to the
         sponsor's earnings based upon the available  evidence;  failing  to
         read  the  Rules  purposefully;  and  misunderstanding   the   term
         'exceptional' in the context of Article 8.

 3. I shall consider the grounds of appeal in the order in which  they  are
    set out in  the  application  for  permission.   First,  the  appellant
    challenges the judge's finding at [13]:

         As regards the wage slips, she [the appellant's wife] has  produced
         wage slips dating between 31 December 2012 and 31 May  2013.   That
         is a five month period, but  I  am  prepared  to  accept  she  only
         commenced work on 3 December 2012.

 4. It was not clear what might be the consequence for the  appeal  of  the
    judge having accepted that the sponsor only commenced employment  on  3
    December 2012 but it does appear to be clear that the  number  of  wage
    slips produced by the sponsor for the period 31 December 2012 - 31  May
    2013 is six, and not five as stated by the judge.  However,  whilst  it
    might be the case that the sponsor satisfied the  requirements  of  the
    Rules as regards the production of the wage slips, the  appellant  does
    not challenge the judge's finding at [12]:

         In relation  to  the  appellant's  wife  there  is  a  letter  from
         accountants but not from her direct employer.  It  is  argued  that
         the accountants' letter suffices but the Rules are  precise  as  to
         the documentation which is needed.  The appellant accepts that  the
         Rules provide that there should be a letter  from  an  individual's
         employer.

    As a consequence, the assertion made in the grounds at [6] ("Had the IJ
    properly considered that this element of Appendix FMSE 2 [production of
    wage slips for a six month period] had been  satisfied  it  would  have
    impacted upon the outcome of his decision.") is immaterial because  the
    sponsor could not satisfy the Rules in relation to  the  production  of
    the employer's letter.

 5. Secondly, there were  problems  relating  to  the  evidence  of  income
    produced by the appellant himself.   In  relation  to  this  ground  of
    appeal, the appellant asserts that  there  had  been  a  concession  as
    regards his own ability to comply with the rules made  in  the  refusal
    letter of the respondent dated 25 June 2013 and that no application had
    been made subsequently by the respondent  or  at  the  hearing  by  the
    Presenting Officer to withdraw that concession.   The  refusal  letter,
    having set out the requirements of E-LTRP3.1/3.2 continued as follows:

         You stated on the application form that you and your spouse jointly
         earn �20,500, I have sufficient evidence to confirm  how  much  you
         earn however I cannot corroborate your spouse's  yearly  income  as
         she has not provided the required  evidence,  please  see  Appendix
         FMSE in the Immigration  Rules.   You  and  your  spouse  have  not
         provided the required evidence for me to be able  to  confirm  that
         you earn the required �18,600 per annum you therefore the Secretary
         of State is not satisfied you earn a specified gross annual  income
         of at least �18,600 (sic).

 6. Does that  paragraph  constitute  a  concession  on  the  part  of  the
    Secretary of State?  One thing is certain; the paragraph is very poorly
    expressed.  The appellant relies on Carcabuk (18 May 2000) (unreported)
    a decision of the Tribunal presided over by Collins J.  The judgment is
    quoted in NR (Jamaica) (see above):
    In Carcabuk guidance was offered as to the approach to  be  taken  by
    tribunals to concessions. As was said [11-12]:
      "It is in our judgment important to identify the precise nature of any
      so-called concession. If it is of fact...the adjudicator should not go
      behind it. Accordingly, if facts are agreed,  the  adjudicator  should
      accept whatever is agreed. Equally, if a concession is clearly made by
      a HOPO that an appellant is telling the truth either generally  or  on
      specific matters, the adjudicator may raise with the HOPO  his  doubts
      whether the concession as appropriate but, if  it  is  maintained,  he
      should accept it. But there is all the difference in the world between
      a concession and a failure to challenge.  The  former  will  bind  the
      adjudicator, the latter will not. Furthermore, any concession  can  be
      withdrawn so that, for example, the case before the  Tribunal  can  be
      presented in a different way to that before  the  adjudicator.  It  is
      open to a HOPO to withdraw a concession  made  before  an  adjudicator
      before the hearing is concluded, but the appellant  must  be  given  a
      proper opportunity to deal with the new case against  him  and  unless
      there is good reason for the withdrawal such as the discovery of fresh
      material we doubt that the adjudicator should permit  any  adjournment
      which such withdrawal would be likely to necessitate...
      We can summarise the position as follows:-
      ...(3) If the HOPO wishes  to  withdraw  any  concession  made:  in  a
      refusal letter or explanatory statement, he must inform the  appellant
      or his advisor as soon as possible and it will be for the  adjudicator
      to decide if an application for an adjournment to enable the new  case
      to be met is made, whether to grant it. If he does not, the concession
      will stand...
      (6) A concession can be withdrawn but, if a HOPO seeks to do this, the
      adjudicator  must  be  satisfied  that  the  appellant  will  not   be
      prejudiced  if  the  hearing  continues  and  should  only  allow   an
      adjournment if persuaded that there was good reason to have  made  and
      to withdraw the concession"







 7. Collins J has used  his  words  carefully  in  relation  to  "so-called
    concessions" made by the respondent.  The passage quoted  above  refers
    to the importance of identifying "the precise nature" of any "so-called
    concession" and goes on to observe that "if  a  concession  is  clearly
    made by a HOPO...".  In order to  bind  the  Secretary  of  State,  any
    concession needs to be unequivocal and clearly  expressed.   I  do  not
    consider the passage from the refusal letter which I have quoted  above
    to comply with those requirements.  The matter was  raised  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge who at [17] observed:

         Although accepting the  respondent  in  the  refusal  letter  makes
         reference to having sufficient evidence to confirm  how  much  [the
         appellant] is earning, the particular paragraph goes  on  to  state
         that, 'You and your spouse have not provided the required  evidence
         for me to be able to confirm that you earn the required �18,600 per
         annum.'  I consider this section to have been misinterpreted by the
         appellant as being an acceptance by the  respondent  of  his  gross
         annual salary.

    The passage in the refusal letter is  entirely  equivocal;  within  two
    sentences, the author of the letter appears to  accept  "how  much  you
    earn" but then goes on to say  that  "you  and  your  spouse  have  not
    provided the required evidence..."  For the First-tier Tribunal to have
    found that those sentences unequivocally bound the Secretary  of  State
    to accept that the appellant met all the  required  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules even when, on the face of the evidence, he  did  not,
    would, in my opinion, have constituted an error of law.   In  addition,
    in order to have allowed the appeal under the Rules the  judge  himself
    would have had to have been satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules had been met in full by the appellant and it was clear  from  the
    determination that he did not find this to be the case:

         There is however no  documentation  to  establish  that  fact  [the
         appellant's gross annual salary] nor is there any letter  from  his
         employer confirming the nature of his employment nor the annual sum
         that he is to be paid.

 8. The appellant does not submit that he met  those  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Looking again at the passage in the refusal letter,
    the so-called concession solely concerns "how much you earn";  it  says
    nothing about the nature of the supporting  evidence  produced  by  the
    Appellant whether or not that evidence complied  with  the  Immigration
    Rules.  I find that there has been no clear and unequivocal  concession
    on the part of the Secretary of State in this  instance  and  that  the
    passages of the determination which I have set out above are free  from
    legal error either as asserted in the grounds or at all.

 9. The grounds go on to complain that the judge had not  given  sufficient
    weight to the oral evidence of the sponsor at the hearing.   The  judge
    was concerned at [17] that it was "not possible to trace the  sponsor's
    salary into her bank account and, in any event part of her salary being
    paid to the appellant as opposed to into her own or into a  joint  bank
    account held with the appellant..."  The  appellant  asserts  that  the
    sponsor "gave oral evidence as to the provenance of the  sums  and  the
    reason as to why exactly it goes from her cash salary but not deposited
    into her account."  Whilst that may be the  case,  the  judge  was  not
    compelled to accept such explanations nor was he, faced with  the  very
    specific requirements of the Immigration Rules  as  to  the  nature  of
    supporting documentation, obliged to ignore those specific requirements
    in the light of oral evidence.

10. Thirdly, the grounds raise with Article 8 ECHR.  The grounds  at  [16a]
    contain an  acknowledgement that the appellant was unable to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules ("this is a  classic  case  where
    the appellant could demonstrate that he met the substance of the  Rules
    albeit without meeting the letter of  Appendix  FM-SE.")   The  grounds
    complain that the judge failed to follow the decision of Blake J in  MM
    [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).  Having dismissed the appeal  in  respect  of
    the Immigration Rules, the judge said this  about  Article  8  ECHR  at
    [18]:

         As regards Article 8 of the ECHR, the sponsor  was  unable  to  put
         forward any reasons as to why she could not, if necessary, relocate
         to Pakistan  to continue her married life in that country.  I  have
         taken account of the five principles set out in the case of  Razgar
         and  although  family  life  undoubtedly  would  be  disrupted   by
         requiring the appellant to return to Pakistan, I do  not  find  the
         consequences of the interference to be so  extreme  or  exceptional
         for it to  amount  to  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the
         appellant and his wife's right to a family life for  a  requirement
         to be made for the  appellant  to  return  to  Pakistan  where  the
         couple's family life can be continued should they so choose.

11. The appellant criticises that passage of the determination on a  number
    of grounds: the judge had failed to account of the sponsor's pregnancy;
    it was unlikely that the appellant will be able to obtain employment at
    the same level of income as  he  enjoys  in  the  United  Kingdom;  the
    sponsor would have to travel to  Pakistan  to  give  birth;  there  was
    likely to be a delay in dealing with any  entry  clearance  application
    because MM was awaiting hearing in the Court of Appeal;  the  appellant
    had not breached immigration law in the United Kingdom; the sponsor had
    not visited Pakistan since she  was  3  years  old;  it  would  not  be
    proportionate to expect the appellant to return to Pakistan to make  an
    application for entry clearance.

12. Although he does not refer to it, the judge's  determination  postdates
    the decision of the Court of Appeal in MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    1192.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the  new  Immigration  Rules
    constitute a complete code as regards Article 8 and it would be only in
    limited circumstances that an individual who fails to comply with  that
    code will succeed outside the Rules.  In the present  case,  the  judge
    was aware that the sponsor is a British citizen and he was  aware  also
    that there were, as at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing,  no
    children of the  marriage.   Significantly,  what  appears  to  be  the
    judge's main reason for dismissing the Article 8 appeal (the fact  that
    the sponsor and appellant could continue their married life together in
    Pakistan) was not objected to by the appellant on the  basis  that  his
    wife (and the child she is carrying) are British citizens.   I  do  not
    consider that the judge is obliged to set out each and every fact which
    he had taken into consideration (for example, the wife's  pregnancy  or
    the fact that she had not been in Pakistan since she was 3 years  old).
    I find that it was open to the judge to find  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor could live together in Pakistan.  That finding  was  sufficient
    to dispose of the Article 8 ECHR appeal.  The decision in  MM  was  not
    binding on the judge and it is not clear that  it  was  even  cited  in
    argument before him.

13. In conclusion, I find that the judge did not go behind any  unequivocal
    concession made by the Secretary of State and  that  he  has  correctly
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules.   I  find  that  the
    judge was well-aware of all the relevant circumstances in the Article 8
    ECHR appeal and he has reached an outcome which was available to him in
    the light of those circumstances.  It is arguable that his  observation
    at [18] that "I do not find the consequences  of  the  interference  to
    [private and family life] to be so extreme or  exceptional  for  it  to
    amount to a disproportionate interference..." might appear  to  suggest
    that he has applied a test of exceptionality, but I find,  having  read
    the determination as a whole, that the judge  is  doing  no  more  than
    observing (as the court did in MF) that only  rarely  or  exceptionally
    will an appellant succeed under Article 8 ECHR,  when  he  or  she  has
    failed to meet the  requirements  of  the  complete  code  relating  to
    Article 8 which is now contained in the Immigration Rules.

DECISION

14. This appeal is dismissed.
