For the Appellant:     Mr D. Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Oliver &
                    Hasani Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z. Young, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant was born a national of Albania on the 17th July 1971.  He
    appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judge Thorne) to dismiss his appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
    decision to deprive him of his British nationality.

 2. The background to this appeal is that in 1999 the Appellant arrived  in
    the United Kingdom in the back of a lorry. He  claimed  asylum  telling
    officers that he was from Kosovo, and that  due  to  the  war  in  that
    territory he required international protection.  He used the name Zulfi
    Belaj.  In 2001 the Appellant, in that identity, was  recognised  as  a
    refugee. He was granted indefinite leave to remain. On  the  2nd  March
    2005 Zulfi Belaj was naturalised as a British citizen.

 3. In 2007 the Appellant's brother made an application for entry clearance
    to come and visit the Appellant. He lodged it at the British embassy in
    Tirana, Albania. As a result of that application  enquiries  were  made
    and it came to light that the Kosovan named Zulfi Belaj was actually an
    Albanian national named Xylfikar Belaj. On the 28th July 2008 the  Home
    Office wrote to the Appellant advising him that they  were  considering
    stripping him of his British nationality.

 4. The Appellant's representatives wrote back making  various  submissions
    which they asked to be taken into account.

 5. Nothing further happened until the 17th August 2018 when the  Appellant
    received a letter notifying him of a decision to  deprive  him  of  his
    British citizenship under s40 (3) of the British Nationality Act  1981.
    The reason given was  the  Appellant's  deception  in  claiming  to  be
    Kosovan. But for that  deception  he  would  never  have  been  granted
    refugee status nor ILR, and but for that status he would not have  been
    able to naturalise.

 6. The Appellant appealed. Before the Tribunal he admitted to the  alleged
    deception.  He  explained  that  he  had  left  Albania  due  to  other
    difficulties and that once he had established the deception he  had  to
    keep it up. He now had a wife and three children in  this  country.  He
    had his own home, and his own  business,  working  as  a  self-employed
    builder. He pointed out that he has a very established Article 8 family
    and private life in the United Kingdom, and that up until recently  the
    Secretary of State had recognised the importance of that: until 2014 it
    had been the Home Office's published policy not to  pursue  deprivation
    action against persons who had lived in this country for  14  years  or
    more. Had the Home Office not taken ten years to  make  this  decision,
    the Appellant could have had the benefit of that policy.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal began by noting that there was no dispute  that
    the relevant condition precedent in 40(3) was established:

         '(3)     The Secretary of State may by order deprive a person of  a
         citizenship  status  which  results  from   his   registration   or
         naturalisation if the Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the
         registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-

             (a) fraud,

             (b) false representation, or

             (c) concealment of a material fact.'

 8. The Tribunal then went on to properly direct itself that section  40(3)
    imports a discretion into the decision-making process: the Secretary of
    State may deprive a person of his citizenship  status.   It  then  said
    this: "I can  only  allow  A's  appeal  if  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    reasonably foreseeable consequences of deprivation  would  violate  the
    obligations of the United Kingdom government under the Human Rights Act
    1998 and/or that there is some exceptional feature of  the  case  which
    means the discretion in the subsection concerned  should  be  exercised
    differently". Before me the parties agreed that this was a valid  legal
    direction in accordance with  the  principles  set  out  in  Deliallisi
    (British citizen: deprivation appeal: Scope) [2013] UKUT 439 (IAC)  and
    BA (Deprivation of citizenship: appeals) [2018] UKUT 00085 (IAC).

 9. Turning to  the  facts  the  Tribunal  noted  that  there  had  been  a
    substantial  delay  in  the  Respondent  coming  to  his  decision.  It
    recognised that there had, until August 2014, been a  policy  that  "in
    general" deprivation action would not be  taken  where  14  years  long
    residence was established. The  Appellant  had  established  such  long
    residence in November 2013. The Tribunal was not however satisfied that
    this aided the Appellant's case. The delay had not been malicious -  it
    had resulted from the Respondent awaiting the outcome of litigation (in
    another case - Hysaj v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] UKSC 82).  Nor had  it  been  established  that  the  delay  had
    deprived the Appellant of some certain advantage: the  policy  made  it
    clear that the  concession  was  not  automatic,  and  its  application
    depended  on  the  seriousness  of  the  deception.  The  Tribunal  was
    satisfied that the Secretary of State was correct to have  applied  the
    policy in force at the date of  his  decision:  this  offered  no  such
    concession.  These were the findings that led the Tribunal to  conclude
    that there were no exceptional features in the evidence.

10. As to human rights the Tribunal noted that the Respondent had  not  yet
    determined whether he  would  pursue  deportation  action  against  the
    Appellant.  As  such  the  reasonably   foreseeable   consequences   of
    deprivation of citizenship did not include removal. They  were  limited
    to the following matters:

      a) The Appellant may not be able to work

      b) The Appellant will not be able to vote

      c) He would no longer be able to use his British passport

      d) He may not be able to drive in the United Kingdom

      e) It will be difficult for the Appellant to  access  rental  property
         and free health care

      f) He will be under stress 'in limbo' awaiting  the  decision  of  the
         Respondent in respect of deportation.

11. The Tribunal was not satisfied that these  factors  could  cumulatively
    render the decision disproportionate. As to (c) and (d)  the  Appellant
    had not demonstrated that he would  be  unable  to  obtain  alternative
    Albanian documentation.  As to  (e)  he  owns  his  own  home  and  the
    evidence indicates that he is fit and well.   Nor  was  there  evidence
    sufficient to demonstrate that his wife and adult  children  could  not
    work to support him: (a). As to  the  stress  of  limbo  there  was  no
    medical evidence to establish that this would have any psychological or
    physical  impact  on  the  Appellant.   The  appeal   was   accordingly
    dismissed.




    The Appeal

12. The Appellant submits that the First-tier Tribunal decision  is  flawed
    for the following errors of law (I  have  re-ordered  the  grounds  for
    convenience):

      i) Material misdirection in that First-tier Tribunal Thorne  conducted
         a Wednesbury review of the Secretary  of  State's  decision  rather
         than making its own merits based assessment of how  the  discretion
         should have been exercised;

     ii) The Tribunal erred in considering that the  delay  needed  to  have
         resulted from bad faith on the part of the Respondent;

    iii) There are a number of mistakes of fact including:

          a) the finding that the Appellant would not have had the  benefit
             of the policy;

          b) the finding that the Appellant "may" not be able to work;

          c) the finding that he could be supported by his family.

     iv) There  was  a  failure  to  take  material  evidence  into  account
         including the impact upon the Appellant of living 'in  limbo',  and
         the practical and psychological difficulties that he and his family
         would face should his citizenship be removed.

13. The Respondent defended the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    resisted the appeal on all grounds. I reserved my decision.

14. Shortly after the hearing the Court of Appeal decision in RA  (Iraq)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ  850  became
    available. This was a case  which  addressed,  albeit  in  a  different
    context, the relevance of applicants being  left  in  'limbo'  in  this
    country. Lord Justice Haddon-Cave summarised  the  issues  arising  for
    such individuals in his opening introduction to the decision [ï¿½1] :

         "[the case] concerns the Appellant's so-called 'limbo' status, that
         is to say a continuing stasis, whereby a  person  is  prevented  by
         continuing circumstance from being deported, but also prevented  by
         lack of leave  to  remain  from  working,  receiving  normal  State
         benefits, renting or buying property, or accessing the  full  range
         of  NHS  benefits,  which  together  are  said  to   constitute   a
         disproportionate interference with family  or  private  life  under
         Article 8 of the Convention."

    Counsel for RA, Mr D Chirico, put it as follows [ï¿½27(3)]:

         "The interference thus includes (i) criminalisation of P's presence
         in the UK (see e.g. s.24 of Immigration Act 1971); and (ii) effects
         on P and P's family of P's inability to participate fully in
         society: prohibitions on employment, obtaining accommodation, a
         bank account, a driving licence or secondary healthcare, and so on.
          This interference requires weighty justification."

15. Observing that these practical difficulties were on all fours with  the
    concerns raised in this case, on the 8th  June  2019  I  wrote  to  the
    parties inviting their submissions on the potential relevance of RA  to
    my decision, and specifically to Mr Sellwood's ground 2 [at his ï¿½16, at
    my ï¿½12(iv) above].   Submissions  in  writing  were  received  by  both
    parties on the 26th June 2019.

16. In brief summary the Appellant submits that the decision in RA  can  be
    distinguished on the facts in that the 'limbo' under discussion therein
    arose in a completely different context. RA was an individual  who  was
    subject to a deportation order because he was a serious  criminal,  but
    could not be removed to Iraq because he was undocumented. There was  an
    uncertainty about  whether  his  deportation  could  ever  in  fact  be
    affected, but the public interest in keeping it as an option was clear.
     By contrast no decision has yet been taken in this case as to  whether
    it would breach Mr Belaj's Article 8 rights.

17. The Secretary of State focuses on the Court's conclusions at its ï¿½71:

         "The principal basis on which it might be said that the public
         interest in continued 'limbo' may be so weakened, such that Article
         8 rights or other Convention rights might tip the balance, will
         normally only arise in cases where it is clear that the public
         interest in effective immigration is extinguished because, in
         practical terms, there is no realistic prospect of effecting
         deportation within a reasonable period (see above)."

    Adopting this reasoning, the Secretary of  State  submitted  that  this
    cannot be said to be a case "where it is clear that the public interest
    in effective immigration is extinguished".




    Discussion and Findings

    Did the First-tier Tribunal impermissibly apply a  Wednesbury  standard
    of review?

18. It is common ground  that  in  reaching  its  decision  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was tasked with conducting a full merits based review  of  the
    Respondent's decision: Deliallisi (British Citizen: deprivation appeal:
    scope) [2013] UKUT 00439 (IAC). Mr Sellwood submits that  this  is  not
    however what the Tribunal did. He  points  to  the  following  passage,
    where the Tribunal considers the relevance of the  now  withdrawn  Home
    Office policy. Having found that the delay had arisen  because  of  the
    Hysaj litigation, and that the old policy was in any event  couched  in
    discretionary terms such that the Secretary of State could legitimately
    have taken deprivation action even  if  it  was  still  in  force,  the
    Tribunal concluded [at its ï¿½27]:

         "It seems to me therefore  that  R  was  correct  to  exercise  her
         discretion in relation to her published policy as at  the  date  of
         decision under appeal before me and not at some  notional  date  in
         the past..."

    This, submits Mr Sellwood, indicates that the Tribunal here  restricted
    itself to assessing whether the decision of the Secretary of State  not
    to give the Appellant the benefit of the old policy was irrational.

19. I do not accept that this is  what  the  Tribunal  did.  There  was  no
    question of the Secretary of State 'applying' a policy which no  longer
    existed. At its highest this argument ran as  follows.   The  Appellant
    could, between the dates of November 2013 (when he  accrued  14  years'
    continuous residence) and August 2014 (when the policy  was  superceded
    by new guidance), have legitimately expected that  his  case  would  be
    reviewed in line with the published policy, which stated that where  14
    years' long residence was established,  deprivation  action  would  not
    normally have been taken.   The fact that the Secretary  of  State  did
    not take his decision within those 9 months deprived the  Appellant  of
    that substantive benefit. That is a matter to  be  taken  into  account
    when assessing whether there are exceptional features in this case.  It
    is relevant because there has been a delay, and but for that delay  the
    Appellant would not find  himself  in  this  position.  It  is  further
    relevant because it indicates that at  one  time  at  least,  the  Home
    Office recognised that very long residence is capable  of  tipping  the
    balance in favour of the citizen concerned.

20. I am not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal failed to  engage  with
    those submissions. The Tribunal gives substantive reasons, at its  ï¿½24-
    27, why it does not consider the  argument  to  be  a  good  one.   The
    formulation "correct to exercise her  discretion"  is  consistent  with
    that:  the Tribunal simply agrees with the Respondent  that  the  point
    about the delay, and the old policy, takes the case no further.

    Was there a requirement that the delay result from bad faith?

21. The answer, plainly, is no. There is no authority for  the  proposition
    that delay will only diminish the public interest where it can be shown
    to be 'malicious'. If the First-tier  Tribunal  thought  that  was  the
    case, it did indeed err in law. It may be that it had in mind the third
    factor identified by the appellant committee in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL
    41:

         "16.     Delay may be relevant, thirdly,  in  reducing  the  weight
         otherwise to be accorded to  the  requirements  of  firm  and  fair
         immigration control, if the delay is shown to be the  result  of  a
         dysfunctional system which yields unpredictable,  inconsistent  and
         unfair outcomes ..."

    But dysfunction does not amount to malice.

22.  In  this  case  the  delay  appears  to  have  been  almost   entirely
    attributable to the passage of the  appeal  in  Hysaj  making  its  way
    through the higher courts. That decision was handed down  on  the  21st
    December 2017 and the Secretary of  State  took  the  decision  in  the
    present matter on the 17th August 2018.  That is  acknowledged  by  the
    Tribunal at its ï¿½25.

23. That being the case, it is difficult to  see  the  materiality  of  the
    alleged error. It was not the Appellant's case that the delay  resulted
    from bad faith, or indeed any dysfunction at  the  Home  Office.    Any
    comments to that  effect  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are  therefore
    irrelevant.  The relevance of the delay, as  far  as  Mr  Sellwood  was
    concerned, was that it had the potential  to  dramatically  change  the
    outcome for the Appellant, because as I discuss above, had the decision
    been taken in the 9 months between November 2013 and August 2014, there
    would have been an operative  presumption  that  no  action  should  be
    taken.  It is clear from the determination that the First-tier Tribunal
    understood that: its response is at its ï¿½26 where it  points  out  that
    the  presumption  was  not  enough.  The  policy  still  permitted  the
    Secretary of  State  to  take  deprivation  action,  depending  on  the
    seriousness of the deception. In this case Judge Thorne considered that
    the serious, deliberate and repeated nature of the  deception,  coupled
    with the Appellant's implication of his wife and children in the deceit
    (they also obtained status in  false  names  etc)  would  have  been  a
    sufficient basis to rebut the presumption and for deprivation action to
    be pursued. In that way the relevance of the  policy  fell  away.  This
    brings me to Mr Sellwood's next ground.

    Does the determination contain material errors  of  fact  amounting  to
    errors of law?

24. The first complaint under this head relates to the  findings  discussed
    in the foregoing paragraph. The First-tier  Tribunal  in  effect  found
    that the old policy would never have assisted the Appellant, and so  it
    was of little consequence. It is submitted that this was a  fundamental
    misunderstanding of the terms of the policy.  The  Appellant  does  not
    dispute that the Secretary of State had a discretion to  exercise,  but
    submits that the Tribunal was simply wrong to find that  the  Appellant
    would not have benefitted from the policy.

25. The presumption is set out at 55.7.2.5 of the policy:

         'In general the Secretary of State  will  not  deprive  of  British
         citizenship in the following circumstances:

           . If a person has been resident in the United Kingdom  for  more
             than 14 years we will not normally deprive of citizenship'

26. At 55.7.2.6, under the heading 'deprivation on fraud grounds regardless
    of length of residence' it read:

         'Although the Secretary of State will not normally deprive  someone
         of their British citizenship where they have  more  than  14  years
         residence in the United Kingdom (long residence), circumstances  in
         which the Secretary of  State  may  still  proceed  to  deprive  of
         British citizenship include, but are not limited to, where:

           . Deception has been used more  than  once  in  an  individual's
             dealings with UKBA -  e.g.  multiple  frauds  using  different
             identities, rather than repeat episodes of  the  same  factual
             deception at different immigration stages;

           . ...

         These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and the  Secretary
         of State may  still  proceed  to  deprive  of  British  citizenship
         regardless of the subject's length of residence depending upon  the
         facts of a particular case.'

    The policy then went on to give examples of where discretion  would  be
    exercised against the subject: one is an individual who had concealed a
    criminal conviction and cheated in the 'Life  in  the  United  Kingdom'
    test; another is a people trafficker. Caseworkers  were  instructed  to
    consider whether the deception was deliberate, whether  the  individual
    was complicit in it, whether there were  any  mitigating  factors,  and
    ultimately whether the decision is proportionate.

27. Having read that guidance, the Tribunal held as follows:

         "In A's case there  was  serious,  deliberate,  repeated  deception
         using forged documents and involving him  being  complicit  in  his
         wife and  children  obtaining  immigration  status  in  the  United
         Kingdom under false names"

28. I accept that what happened here, as far as the Appellant is concerned,
    is that there was simply "repeat episodes of the same factual deception
    at different immigration stages". As such it cannot be equated with the
    example given in the guidance  of  an  individual  who  uses  "multiple
    identities".  That said, I am not satisfied  that  this  was  material.
    That is because, as Mr Sellwood  rightly  notes,  this  was  a  'merits
    based' review: Judge Thorne was entitled to reach his own view  on  the
    matter. The examples given in the guidance  were  not  exhaustive.  The
    First-tier Tribunal found  that  the  extension  of  the  deception  to
    include the Appellant's family was what elevated it above a 'run of the
    mill' deception. I entirely agree. Expecting children to  assume  false
    identities is in my view a factor that carried considerable weight.  It
    is obviously contrary to a child's best interests to teach a  child  to
    lie, or to allow a child to be confused about his  own  nationality  or
    identity. As such I find that Judge Thorne was rationally  entitled  to
    conclude that the policy would not, had it been in operation,  of  been
    of any assistance to the Appellant.

29.  I would add this. That the reliance on the policy could never be  more
    than one factor to be considered. The policy had long since  ceased  to
    be in operation and the case in  effect  rested  on  there  being  some
    prejudice to the Appellant in the fact that the case did not  fall  for
    consideration in a very specific 9 month period. Beyond that  the  only
    point to be made was that once upon a time the Secretary of  State  had
    been of the view that in most cases people  with  14  years'  residence
    should get to keep their British passports. That was, at best, a factor
    of limited importance today.

30. The next matter in issue under this heading was  whether  the  Tribunal
    erred in its conclusion, at ï¿½31, that the Appellant "may" not  be  able
    to work. Mr Sellwood strongly contested this finding on the basis  that
    the unequivocal position, in the  'hostile  environment'  was  that  an
    individual without status in this country will not be able to  lawfully
    find employment. There is no 'may' about  it.   Similarly  the  finding
    that he could otherwise be supported by his family  is  criticised  for
    failing to have regard to the evidence that in fact his wife and  three
    adult children all rely on him.

31. For the Respondent Ms Young accepted that Mr Sellwood was correct about
    these matters. She submitted however that any error identified would be
    irrelevant, because it was nowhere stated that the Appellant's wife was
    actually unable to work. Her  statement  says  that  she  suffers  from
    anxiety, and that she is understandably worried that  she  is  next  in
    line for deprivation action being taken against her, but in fact  there
    is no explanation offered as to why she, or indeed any other member  of
    the family, could not take or increase their  level  of  employment.  I
    agree.  It might also be said that the  Appellant  is  here  protesting
    that he is not being permitted to continue to enjoy the benefits of his
    deception: a patently unattractive argument.

    Does the Tribunal err in failing to  have  regard  to  the  foreseeable
    consequences of the Appellant being left in 'limbo'?

32. That leaves the questions posed by Aziz v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home  Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ  1884:  what  are  the   reasonably
    foreseeable consequences  of  deprivation  and  do  they  render  it  a
    disproportionate interference with the Appellant's Article 8(1) rights?
    In seeking to answer these questions Mr Sellwood submitted  that  there
    would be immediate, and medium-term issues for the  Appellant  and  his
    family.  Unless and until the Respondent  saw  fit  to  regularise  the
    Appellant's position he would be in  a  position  of  uncertainty  that
    could have practical, and  emotional,  consequences  for  him  and  his
    family.

33. In that period of limbo he would be in the dark about  whether  or  not
    the Respondent in fact intended to remove him from the United  Kingdom.
    In his submissions  Mr  Sellwood  emphasised  that  the  Appellant  was
    entitled to view that prospect with some apprehension,  given  that  he
    had already spent ten years wondering whether the Respondent was  going
    to try and take his citizenship away.  This period would  therefore  be
    immensely stressful for the whole family. The Appellant  would  not  be
    permitted to work and his savings are  meagre:  that  would  mean  that
    members of his family who have hitherto not worked, or earned enough to
    support themselves, would have to start doing so, because the shortfall
    would not be met by benefits.   All the matters  relied  upon  in  RA's
    case would also pertain (the grounds had asserted that the  family  may
    be at risk of losing their home, but Mr Sellwood withdrew  that  ground
    upon instruction that in fact the mortgage has been paid in full).  The
    Appellant's final ground is that the First-tier Tribunal failed to have
    regard to these material factors in its balancing exercise.

34.  At  paragraph  30  the  Tribunal  lists  the  reasonably   foreseeable
    consequences of deprivation. These  include  that  "he  will  be  under
    stress in  limbo  awaiting  the  decision  of  R  whether  to  initiate
    deportation proceedings. At paragraph 31 it says this:

         "A has not established that he will be incapable  of  obtaining  an
         Albanian passport which will allow him to travel abroad. A has  not
         established that he will be  incapable  of  obtaining  an  Albanian
         driving licence which  will  allow  him  to  drive  in  the  United
         Kingdom. He does not need to rent as he owns his ow  home.  He  may
         lose the right to vote, work and access to  free  health  care  but
         evidence establishes that he and his family have savings, he is fit
         and well and here is inadequate evidence to establish that his wife
         and adult children cannot work  and  support  him  financially.  In
         addition he may feel under stress 'in limbo' awaiting the  decision
         of R whether to initiate deportation proceedings.  However,  he  is
         the author of his own misfortune in this respect and  there  is  no
         medical  evidence  to  establish   that   the   'limbo'   has   any
         psychological or physical effects on him and his family".

35. That paragraph, it appears to me, is a complete answer to Mr Sellwood's
    concerns: the Tribunal plainly  did  consider  whether  the  period  of
    'limbo' could be said to so adversely affect the  Appellant  so  as  to
    render deprivation disproportionate.

36. As to the potential relevance of RA,  it  is  this.   The  Court  there
    confirmed [at ï¿½69] that the focus for enquiry is first what the  impact
    will  be  on  the  individual.  This,  as  the  passage  I  cite  above
    illustrates, the Tribunal has done. Second, it must balance that impact
    against the public interest in  making  an  order.  In  RA  the  public
    interest  was  informed  by  the  appellant's  criminality;   in   this
    deprivation case it is in the maintenance of immigration control. It is
    a  different  factual  matrix,  but  the  principles  underpinning  the
    assessment are the same. There is a strong public interest in  removing
    the citizenship of individuals who only obtained  that  status  through
    fraud. At ï¿½71 the Court indicated  that  the  adverse  consequences  of
    statis will only be likely to tip the balance in the appellant's favour
    where the period in question is likely to be prolonged  or  indefinite.
    That is not so here, where the Respondent has indicated that a decision
    will be made within 8 weeks of  the  deprivation  order  being  signed,
    which in turn will be within 4 weeks of the  Appellant  exhausting  his
    appeal rights.

37. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  upheld.  The  appeal  is
