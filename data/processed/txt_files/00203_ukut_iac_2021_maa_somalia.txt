For the Appellant:     Mr J. Anderson, Counsel instructed by the Government

For the Respondent:    Mr R. Toal and Mr T. Lay, Counsel, instructed by
                    Brighton Housing Trust Immigration Legal Services

     i) Said [2016] EWCA  Civ  442  is  not  to  be  read  to  exclude  the
        possibility that Article 3 ECHR could be engaged by  conditions  of
        extreme material deprivation. Factors to be considered include  the
        location where  the  harm  arises,  and  whether  it  results  from
        deliberate action or omission.

    ii) In cases where the material deprivation is not intentionally caused
        the threshold is the modified N  test  set  out  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)
        [2020] UKSC 17. The question will be whether  conditions  are  such
        that there is a real risk that the  individual  concerned  will  be
        exposed to intense suffering or a  significant  reduction  in  life
        expectancy.

   iii)  The  Qualification  Directive  continues  to  have  direct  effect
        following the UK withdrawal from the EU.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent, Mr Ainte (MAA), is a national of Somalia  born  on  the
    23rd October 1991. He has lived in this  country  since  2008  when  he
    arrived, aged 16, and sought protection as a refugee.  That  protection
    was never  granted.  The  Secretary  of  State  was  still  considering
    submissions when, in November 2011, MAA received his first  conviction,
    for possessing cannabis. Further convictions followed in  2013  and  in
    April 2014 he was convicted of possession of a Class A  drug  (cocaine)
    with intent to supply. He was sent  to  prison  for  4  years.   It  is
    therefore in the  public  interest  that  MAA  be  deported  from  this
    country.

 2. Before the  First-tier  Tribunal  MAA  advanced  two  reasons  why  the
    'automatic deportation' procedure set out in s32 of the UK Borders  Act
    2007 should not apply to him.

 3. First, he submitted that he was entitled to protection  as  a  refugee:
    s33(2)(b) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied. Although  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was satisfied that MAA should not be denied  protection  as  a
    result of his criminality, it rejected the submission that  MAA  had  a
    currently well-founded fear of persecution on any of the alternative or
    cumulative bases advanced by him. The appeal was therefore dismissed on
    Refugee Convention grounds and MAA was  refused  permission  to  appeal
    against that decision.

 4. The second limb of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    the removal of MAA to Mogadishu would result in him facing a real  risk
    of living in conditions of such extreme material  deprivation,  and  so
    lacking in security, that they would constitute inhuman  and  degrading
    treatment  under  Article  3  ECHR[1]  and/or  Article  15(b)  of   the
    Qualification  Directive[2],  and/or   amount   to   "very   compelling
    circumstances"   establishing   that    deportation    would    be    a
    disproportionate interference with MAA's Article 8 private life.    The
    First-tier  Tribunal  found  this  argument  to  be   made   out,   and
    consequently allowed the appeal on both human rights  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds.   It was that finding of fact which was the subject
    of the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal, heard on  the
    15th October 2020.

 5. By a decision dated the 25th October 2020 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bruce
    found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in its approach. Paragraph
    10 of the 'error of law' decision explains why:

         "The real difficulty with the  decision  is  in  the  gaps  in  the
         reasoning, and the failure to make clear findings.   At its �39 the
         Tribunal rehearses the views of [country expert]  Ms  Harper  about
         what "might" happen to [MAA]  if  he  returned  to  Mogadishu,  but
         nowhere does the Tribunal  go  on  to  reach  its  own  conclusion,
         applying the appropriate standard  of  proof  and  considering  the
         relevance  of  its  own  findings  about  [MAA]  circumstances,  in
         particular that he is not a member of the Ashraf minority.  As  the
         Secretary of State points out, Ms Harper  proceeded  on  the  basis
         that he was, and it was for the Tribunal to determine  whether  the
         views expressed at paragraph 8.10 of her report, and summarised  at
         the Tribunal's  �39,  survived  that  rejection.  It  was  entirely
         possible that they  would,  but  some  findings  had  to  be  made.
         Insofar as such conclusions are reached at  �40  of  the  decision,
         these are flawed for lack of reasoning: there was for  instance  no
         exploration of why [MAA] might find himself without clan support".

 6. Judge Bruce directed that the decision, insofar as it related to  human
    rights (Articles 3 & 8) and Article 15 of the Qualification  Directive,
    be re-made. This is that remade decision, to which both members of  the
    panel have contributed.  We were referred to a great deal  of  evidence
    and had the benefit of detailed argument from Counsel about the  proper
    approach to take in cases involving material deprivation generally, and
    in the context of Somalia in particular.   We begin by addressing those
    legal issues, before considering and determining MAA's claim.




    The Legal Framework

 7. As we are considering protection grounds our starting point must be the
    applicable country  guidance  on  Somalia.  Although  new  guidance  is
    shortly to be forthcoming, at the  date  of  this  appeal  the  current
    country guidance is MOJ & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia  CG  [2014]
    UKUT 00442 (IAC). Neither party  has  asked  us  to  depart  from  that
    guidance. The material part of it, for the purpose of this  appeal,  is
    set out in the headnote:

       vii) A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of  absence  will
            look to his nuclear family, if he has one living  in  the  city,
            for  assistance  in  re-establishing  himself  and  securing   a
            livelihood. Although a returnee may also  seek  assistance  from
            his clan members who are not close relatives, such help is  only
            likely to be forthcoming for majority clan members, as  minority
            clans may have little to offer.

      viii) The significance of clan membership in  Mogadishu  has  changed.
            Clans now provide, potentially, social  support  mechanisms  and
            assist  with  access  to  livelihoods,  performing  less  of   a
            protection function than previously. There are no clan  militias
            in Mogadishu, no clan violence, and no clan based discriminatory
            treatment, even for minority clan members.

        ix) If it is accepted that a person facing  a  return  to  Mogadishu
            after a period  of  absence  has  no  nuclear  family  or  close
            relatives in the city to assist him in  re-establishing  himself
            on return, there will need to be a careful assessment of all  of
            the circumstances. These considerations will  include,  but  are
            not limited to:

               . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

               . length of absence from Mogadishu;

               . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

               . access to financial resources;

               . prospects  of  securing  a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                 employment or self employment;

               . availability of remittances from abroad;

               . means of support during  the  time  spent  in  the  United
                 Kingdom;

               . why his ability to fund the journey to the West no  longer
                 enables  an  appellant  to  secure  financial  support  on
                 return.

         x) Put another way, it will be for  the  person  facing  return  to
            explain why  he  would  not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
            opportunities that have been  produced  by  the  economic  boom,
            especially as there is evidence to the effect that returnees are
            taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been away.

        xi) It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or family support
            who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad  and  who
            have no real prospect of securing  access  to  a  livelihood  on
            return who will face the prospect  of  living  in  circumstances
            falling  below  that  which  is   acceptable   in   humanitarian
            protection terms.

       xii) The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply  those  who
            originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return  to  live
            in the city without being subjected to an Article 15(c) risk  or
            facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation
            in Mogadishu for a person of a minority  clan   with  no  former
            links to the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,
            family or social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in  the
            absence of means to establish a home and some  form  of  ongoing
            financial support there  will  be  a  real  risk  of  having  no
            alternative but to live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP
            camp where there is a real possibility  of  having  to  live  in
            conditions   that  will  fall  below   acceptable   humanitarian
            standards.

 8. It is common ground that this country guidance must now be read in line
    with the decision in Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Said
    [2016] EWCA Civ 442, [2016] Imm AR 1084. Said was a Somali national who
    faced deportation  following  his  conviction  for  rape.  He  resisted
    deportation on the grounds that upon return to Mogadishu he would  very
    likely become destitute, and thus be exposed to the risk of  having  to
    enter an IDP camp, where conditions would be very poor. On  appeal  the
    Upper Tribunal had held that Said could work, speak Somali,  was  of  a
    majority clan and that he could benefit from  remittances  from  family
    members in the UK if necessary. The  'real  question',  identified  the
    Tribunal, was whether Said's mental health was so poor that he would be
    unable to cope with relocation to Mogadishu and thus end up in  an  IDP
    camp, where applying the guidance  set  out  in  the  headnote  of  MOJ
    (above), it found that conditions would fall so  far  below  acceptable
    humanitarian standards that the appeal fell to be allowed on Article  3
    grounds. The Secretary of State appealed to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on
    perversity grounds; Said defended the decision of UTIAC on the  grounds
    that the Tribunal had, on the evidence,  been  rationally  entitled  to
    conclude that he would end up in an IDP camp, and that the  "conclusion
    that removal would violate Article 3  necessarily  followed"  from  the
    decision in MOJ.

 9. In delivering the lead judgment Lord Justice Burnett (as he  then  was)
    was concerned to make two points. The first was of general application.
    Having reviewed the caselaw, and in particular  the  judgment  of  Lord
    Justice Laws in GS (India) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2015] EWCA Civ 40, [2015] Imm AR 608, he emphasised that claims  based
    on harms arising from naturally occurring phenomena, such as illness or
    famine, are not paradigm Article 3 claims. Because the feared harm  was
    not being intentionally  inflicted  (either  by  omission  or  positive
    action) the threshold to establish a violation of Article 3 was a  high
    one. Equating cases involving material deprivation with  health  claims
    [at �15 and �18] the Court held that the applicable threshold  is  that
    set out in N v United Kingdom (App. No. 26565/05), [2008]  Imm  AR  657
    and N v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2005]  UKHL  31,
    [2005] Imm AR 353.

10. The second point arose specifically from the way in which the  Tribunal
    had applied the guidance in MOJ to Said's claim. Although this part  of
    the judgment is obiter - the decision of UTIAC having already been  set
    aside on perversity grounds - it has been  expressly  endorsed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  v  MS
    (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345, [2020] Imm AR  131  and  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in SB (refugee revocation: IDP camps) Somalia [2019] UKUT  358
    (IAC). Burnett LJ  held  that  MOJ  cannot  be  read  as  automatically
    equating life in an IDP camp to a violation  of  Article  3:    such  a
    "stark proposition of cause and effect" would be inconsistent with  the
    Strasbourg jurisprudence to the effect that any potential violation  of
    Article  3  is  to  be  evaluated  with  reference  to   the   personal
    characteristics of the individual concerned.  As the  decision  in  MOJ
    had made clear, it was not uniformly the case that all IDPs in  Somalia
    were at that time facing inhuman and degrading treatment:  indeed  some
    had managed to resettle with "'a reasonable standard of  accommodation'
    and with access to food, remittances  from  abroad  or  an  independent
    livelihood" [Said at �29]. In Said's case the  Tribunal  had  therefore
    erred in apparently drawing a line directly between entry into a  camp,
    and a violation of Article 3. The proper approach was that set out at �
    422 of MOJ:

         "422. The fact that we have rejected the view that there is a  real
         risk of persecution or serious harm or ill treatment  to  civilians
         or returnees in Mogadishu does not mean that no Somali national can
         succeed in a refugee or humanitarian protection or article 3 claim.
         Each case will fall to be decided on its  own  facts.  As  we  have
         observed, there will need to be a careful  assessment  of  all  the
         circumstances of a particular individual."

11. We know then from the decision in Said that MOJ is not to  be  read  as
    saying what earlier, undisturbed, Somali  country  guidance  cases  had
    held. In NM and Others (lone women -Ashraf)  Somalia  CG  [2005]  UKIAT
    00076 [obiter at �102],  HH  and  Others  (Mogadishu:  armed  conflict:
    risk)  Somalia  CG  [2008]  UKAIT  00022  [�299]  and  AMM  and  Others
    (conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011]  UKUT
    00445 (IAC) [�486] , the Tribunal had found conditions in the camps  to
    be  so  universally  appalling  and  degrading  that  a  general   risk
    pertained. At various points during the decades long Somali conflict  a
    direct line could, on the facts, be drawn between  displacement  and  a
    violation of Article 3 for any civilian in a given area. Conclusions to
    a similar effect were reached by European Court of Human Rights in Sufi
    and Elmi v United Kingdom (App. Nos 8319/07  and  11449/07)  (2012)  54
    EHRR 9 [at �291]: there the  entire  civilian  population  in  a  large
    section of Southern Somalia were held to be at such a risk.   By  2014,
    and the decision in MOJ,  the situation on the ground  in  Somalia  had
    improved so that this could  no  longer  be  said  to  be  true.  There
    therefore needed to be a "careful assessment of all the  circumstances"
    of the particular individual.

12. Before we are able to conduct such an assessment in respect of MAA,  we
    must address a number of  legal  matters  arising  in  the  submissions
    before us.



    Understanding Said

13. The first matter can be shortly dealt with, since it is  uncontentious.
    It would seem that just as the decision in MOJ has been misconstrued by
    decision makers, so subsequently has the  decision  in  Said.  Mr  Toal
    informed us that the decision has been interpreted by some as authority
    for  the  proposition   that   'naturally   occurring'   socio-economic
    deprivation can never, as a matter of law, found a claim under  Article
    3. As Mr  Anderson  readily  accepted,  such  an  interpretation  would
    plainly be wrong.  It would be contrary to Strasbourg authority[3], the
    decision in Said itself [at �18 and �31], and we note that a submission
    to the same effect was  carefully  considered,  and  rejected,  by  the
    Tribunal in AM and AM (armed conflict: risk categories) Rev  1  Somalia
    CG [2008] UKAIT 00091 [at �87].  The  N  threshold  is  undoubtedly  an
    extremely high one, but it is not  insurmountable.   Insofar  as  cases
    subsequent to Said have been read to the contrary,  such  readings  are
    inaccurate. We are told, for instance, that the  following  passage  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v MA (Somalia)  [2018]  EWCA
    Civ 994, [2018] Imm AR  1273  has  been  cited  as  authority  for  the
    proposition that Article 3 can never be engaged in  instances  of  non-
    intentional socio-economic deprivation:

         "63. The analysis in Said's case [2016] Imm AR 1084, by which  this
         court is bound, is that there is  no  violation  of  article  3  by
         reason only of a person being  returned  to  a  country  for  which
         economic reasons cannot provide him with  basic  living  standards.
         ..."

    The key to this passage is the term "only": there should be an analysis
    of the impact on the individual concerned, and living  conditions  must
    be bad enough to reach the minimum level of severity required to engage
    the article.  Neither Said nor MA (Somalia)  close  the  door  on  such
    cases.

14. Alternatively, we understand, the judgment in Said  has  been  read  as
    saying that resort to an IDP camp cannot, as a matter  of  fact,  found
    such a claim.  Again, that is a misunderstanding.   The  higher  courts
    have repeatedly  emphasised  the  value  of  the  careful  and  intense
    scrutiny that this Tribunal gives to the evidence in  country  guidance
    cases[4]: we do not think that Burnett LJ was seeking to displace  that
    role by conducting his own factual examination  of  the  IDP  camps  in
    Somalia.  He was  simply  pointing  out  that  on  the  Tribunal's  own
    analysis of the facts in MOJ, the line of causation could not  at  that
    time be directly drawn  between  life  in  the  camp  and  inhuman  and
    degrading conditions.




    The Country Guidance

15. The second matter can also be shortly stated, since it has already been
    authoritatively addressed by the President, Mr Justice Lane, and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rimington in SB (refugee revocation: IDP camps)  Somalia
    [2019] UKUT 00358 (IAC).

16. As we have detailed above, for  the  moment  MOJ  remains  the  country
    guidance on Somalia. Its guidance on the  particular  question  of  the
    material deprivation faced by IDPs must however be read in light of the
    judgment in Said.   It is Mr Toal's contention that this  part  of  the
    decision in MOJ having been set aside,   we  must  as  decision  makers
    revert to the earlier decision in AMM: as  we  allude  to  above,  this
    guidance, given in 2011,  was  to  the  effect  that  the  drought  and
    resulting famine then ravaging southern and central Somalia was of such
    drastic proportions that the Tribunal could be satisfied that there was
    a generalised Article 3 risk for any civilian returning to that region.



17. We do not accept that it would  be  right  to  simply  revert  to  this
    earlier country guidance. To do so would be  clearly  contrary  to  the
    stated intentions of the panel in MOJ [at paragraph (i) of the 'country
    guidance' section of the headnote]:

         "The country guidance issues addressed in  this  determination  are
         not identical to those engaged with by  the  Tribunal  in  AMM  and
         others (conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM)  Somalia  CG
         [2011] UKUT 445 (IAC). Therefore, where country guidance  has  been
         given by the Tribunal in AMM in respect of issues not addressed  in
         this determination then the guidance provided by AMM shall continue
         to have effect."

  18. We deduce from this that any issue addressed by both decisions  -  as
      the socio-economic conditions prevailing in the country plainly  were
      - the earlier guidance was replaced by the later.  It cannot sensibly
      be 'reinstated' by default.  The reason for that, as the Presidential
      panel in SB explain, is that conditions on  the  ground  had  changed
      between 2011 and 2014:

         "54. Although Mr Toal attempted, with his customary skill, to  rely
         upon extracts from the country guidance decision in MOJ in order to
         show that that decision had not,  in  fact,  superseded  the  above
         findings in AMM, it is, in our view, plain on any full  reading  of
         MOJ that the Upper Tribunal in that case was well  aware  that  the
         drought conditions, which had led  to  a  UN-recognised  famine  in
         rural areas and parts of Mogadishu in 2011,  no  longer  pertained.
         The nature of the armed struggle was also markedly different.

         55. We therefore agree with Mr Jarvis's submissions on  this  issue
         and respectfully decline to follow those of Mr  Toal.  The  largely
         naturally-caused events that led the Upper Tribunal in AMM to  find
         that the high threshold for Article 3 harm, as  regards  conditions
         in IDP camps, had been met, no longer applied at the time  of  MOJ.
         Given that there is nothing in MOJ or anywhere else  that  we  have
         seen which suggests human agency is responsible for the generalised
         conditions faced in IDP camps (as opposed to instances of  specific
         harm), that high threshold needs to be met. Insofar  as  MOJ  might
         have been read  to  suggest  otherwise,  or  insofar  as  it  might
         otherwise be read as indicating a generalised  risk  of  Article  3
         harm, Burnett LJ's judgment cogently explains why  that  is  wrong.
         Irrespective of whether his judgment is formally binding on us,  it
         is fully-reasoned and compelling and should  be  followed.  In  our
         view, it will be an error of law for a judge to refuse to do so."




      Intentional and Non-intentional harm

19. The third issue is whether this appeal is a Said case at all,  that  is
    to say a claim involving non-intentional or naturally  occurring  harm,
    where the N threshold should be applied.  There had  hitherto  been  an
    assumption by the parties that it was: certainly this was the way  that
    the argument was put before the First-tier Tribunal. Mr Toal  was  not,
    however, satisfied that this was the case. He pointed to evidence  that
    the Somali government is itself  complicit  in  actions,  such  as  the
    forced eviction of  squatter  camps,  which  cause  or  exacerbate  the
    suffering of the  displaced  population;  the  government  has  further
    omitted  to  deal  with  abuses  of  power  and   corruption   by   the
    'Gatekeepers',  those  men   who   control   the   camps.    In   those
    circumstances, Mr Toal submits, this Tribunal should  find  that  harms
    feared by MAA are not naturally occurring, and that for that reason the
    standard to be applied is simply whether there is a real risk  that  he
    will  face  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment.   In   addressing   this
    submission we have found it necessary to look in  more  detail  at  the
    different kinds of cases where material deprivation has  been  held  to
    engage Article 3.

20. Article 3 reads:

         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment."

21. In GS (India) Lord Justice Laws  expressed  this  uncontroversial  view
    about the harms that the article was originally conceived, in 1950,  to
    prevent:

         "In my judgment the language of the Article shows that the paradigm
         case of a violation is an intentional act which constitutes torture
         or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".

22. As he goes on to explain, however,  the  Convention  has  expanded,  or
    evolved, so that in 1997 the ECtHR found a violation of Article 3 where
    the suffering arose not  from  an  intentional  act,  but  from  wholly
    natural causes. The applicant in D v United Kingdom (App No. 30240/96),
    (1997) 24 EHRR 423 was a convicted drug smuggler  suffering  from  end-
    stage AIDS, who asserted that if he were to be deported to  his  native
    St Kitts, he would face an inhumane and degrading death.  In  assessing
    D's claim under Article 3 the Court noted that Contracting States  have
    the right to expel aliens, and take measures to prevent crime, however:



         "47... in exercising their right to expel such  aliens  Contracting
         States must have regard to Article 3 of the  Convention  (art.  3),
         which  enshrines  one  of  the  fundamental  values  of  democratic
         societies. It is precisely for  this  reason  that  the  Court  has
         repeatedly  stressed  in  its   line   of   authorities   involving
         extradition, expulsion  or  deportation  of  individuals  to  third
         countries that Article 3  (art.  3)  prohibits  in  absolute  terms
         torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment  and  that
         its guarantees apply irrespective of the  reprehensible  nature  of
         the conduct of the person in question...

         49.  It is true that this principle has so far been applied by the
         Court in contexts in which the risk  to  the  individual  of  being
         subjected to any of the proscribed forms of treatment emanates from
         intentionally inflicted acts  of  the  public  authorities  in  the
         receiving country or from those of non-State bodies in that country
         when the authorities there are unable  to  afford  him  appropriate
         protection...Aside from these situations and given the  fundamental
         importance of Article 3  in the Convention system, the  Court  must
         reserve to itself sufficient flexibility to address the application
         of that Article in other contexts which  might  arise.  It  is  not
         therefore prevented from scrutinising an  applicant's  claim  under
         Article 3 where the source of the risk of proscribed  treatment  in
         the receiving country stems from factors which cannot engage either
         directly or indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities
         of that country, or  which,  taken  alone,  do  not  in  themselves
         infringe the standards of that Article. To limit the application of
         Article 3 in  this  manner  would  be  to  undermine  the  absolute
         character of its protection. In any  such  contexts,  however,  the
         Court must subject all the circumstances surrounding the case to  a
         rigorous scrutiny, especially the applicant's personal situation in
         the expelling State."

    [Emphasis added]

23. The Court proceeds to detail the grim fate that awaited D in St  Kitts,
    before concluding [at �53]: "in view of these exceptional circumstances
    and bearing in mind the critical stage now reached in  the  applicant's
    fatal illness" that there would be a violation if the deportation  were
    to proceed.

24. The introduction of the term "exceptional" in D  was  suggestive  of  a
    higher threshold  than  the  "minimum  level  of  severity"  ordinarily
    applied. This was certainly the interpretation adopted by the Court  in
    Bensaid v United Kingdom (App No. 44599/98),  (2001)  33  EHRR  10  [at
    �40]:

         "40. ... Having regard, however,  to  the  high  threshold  set  by
         Article 3,  particularly where the case does not concern the direct
         responsibility of the Contracting State for the infliction of harm,
         the Court does not find that there is a sufficiently real risk that
         the applicant's removal in these circumstances would be contrary to
         the standards  of  Article  3.  The  case  does  not  disclose  the
         exceptional circumstances of [D v the United Kingdom] ..."

    [Emphasis added]

25. It was not however until N v United Kingdom  in  2008  that  the  Court
    elaborated on what might be meant by such "exceptional circumstances":

         "42. In summary, the Court observes  that  since D  v  the  United
         Kingdom it has  consistently  applied  the  following  principles.
         Aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in principle  claim  any
         entitlement to remain in the territory of a  Contracting  State  in
         order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of
         assistance and services provided by the expelling State.  The  fact
         that the applicant's circumstances, including his life  expectancy,
         would be significantly reduced if he were to be  removed  from  the
         Contracting State is not sufficient  in  itself  to  give  rise  to
         breach of Article 3.  The  decision  to  remove  an  alien  who  is
         suffering from a serious mental or physical illness  to  a  country
         where the facilities for the treatment of that illness are inferior
         to those available in the Contracting  State  may  raise  an  issue
         under Article 3, but only in a very  exceptional  case,  where  the
         humanitarian  grounds  against  the  removal  are  compelling.  In
         the D case the  very  exceptional  circumstances  were  that  the
         applicant was critically ill and appeared to  be  close  to  death,
         could not be guaranteed any nursing or medical care in his  country
         of origin and had no family there willing or able to care  for  him
         or provide him with even a basic level of food, shelter  or  social
         support.

         43. The Court does  not  exclude  that  there  may  be  other  very
         exceptional cases where the humanitarian considerations are equally
         compelling. However, it considers that it should maintain the  high
         threshold set in D v the  United  Kingdom and  applied  in  its
         subsequent case-law, which it  regards  as  correct  in  principle,
         given that in such cases the alleged future harm would emanate  not
         from the intentional acts or omissions of public authorities or non-
         State bodies, but instead from a naturally  occurring  illness  and
         the lack of sufficient resources to deal with it in  the  receiving
         country."

    [Emphasis added]

26. The approach taken in D, Bensaid and N to health cases has subsequently
    been  uncontroversially  applied  to  those  involving  non-intentional
    material deprivation: for instance by the ECtHR in SHH v United Kingdom
    (App No. 60367/10), (2013) 57 EHRR 18, and  domestically  in  Said.  In
    such cases, where the feared harm is  not  caused  by  the  actions  of
    others, that is to  say  it   is  "naturally  occurring",  outwith  the
    jurisdiction, applicants are required to demonstrate that theirs  is  a
    very exceptional case,  where  the  humanitarian  grounds  against  the
    removal are compelling.

27. A different type of case is where the material deprivation in  question
    arises within the jurisdiction of a signatory state, and where  it  can
    to some degree, by its acts or omissions, be held responsible for  that
    suffering.  In MSS v Belgium and Greece (App No. 30696/09),  (2011)  53
    EHRR 2 the asylum-seeking applicant had been subject to a third-country
    removal from Belgium to Greece where he found  himself  living  on  the
    streets in conditions of extreme and unremitting poverty. Holding  that
    those conditions were inhuman and degrading the ECtHR  emphasised  that
    asylum seekers were a "a particularly  underprivileged  and  vulnerable
    population group in need of special protection"  and  that  Greece  had
    purposely failed in its legal duties, both domestic and  international,
    to give them such protection. In these circumstances the threshold  for
    proving a violation of Article 3 was simply  that  ordinarily  applied:
    having regard to the personal characteristics of the claimant,  can  it
    be said that the treatment he suffered was "inhuman and degrading"?

28. A related claim arose in Sufi and  Elmi.  This  too  concerned  extreme
    poverty, but not in a signatory state: here the feared  harm  arose  in
    southern Somalia. Accepting that the civilian population were in effect
    starving en masse, and living in conditions of extreme fearfulness  and
    insecurity, the ECtHR went on to  examine  why.  It  found  that  those
    conditions were not naturally occurring, but  arose  from  the  ongoing
    conflict. For this reason the case was distinguished from N [at �282]:

         "282. If the dire humanitarian conditions in Somalia were solely or
         even predominantly attributable to poverty or to the  state's  lack
         of resources to deal with a naturally occurring phenomenon, such as
         a drought, the test in N  v  United  Kingdom  may  well  have  been
         considered to be the appropriate one. However,  it  is  clear  that
         while drought has contributed  to  the  humanitarian  crisis,  that
         crisis is predominantly due to the direct and indirect  actions  of
         the parties to the conflict. The reports indicate that all  parties
         to the conflict have employed indiscriminate methods of warfare  in
         densely populated urban areas with no regard to the safety  of  the
         civilian population. This fact alone  has  resulted  in  widespread
         displacement and the breakdown of social,  political  and  economic
         infrastructures.  Moreover,  the   situation   has   been   greatly
         exacerbated by al-Shabaab's refusal  to  permit  international  aid
         agencies to operate in the areas under  its  control,  despite  the
         fact that between one-third and one-half of all Somalis are  living
         in a situation of serious deprivation."

    Consequently it was the ordinary threshold of harm that was applicable.
    In respect of what factors might be relevant in this context the  ECtHR
    specifically directed itself to  the  approach  taken  in  MSS:  having
    "regard to an applicant's ability to cater for his most basic needs,
    such as food, hygiene and shelter, his vulnerability to ill-treatment
    and the prospect of his situation improving within a  reasonable  time-
    frame".

29. Which of these approaches should we take here?

30. Neither party asked us to take the Sufi  and  Elmi  option.  There  the
    ECtHR had found a clear causal nexus between behaviour of  the  various
    parties to the conflict and the suffering of  the  population.   As  we
    have seen[5], developments in Somalia have since changed that calculus.
    In AMM the Tribunal found the preponderant cause  of  dire  poverty  in
    Somalia to be the country's  worst  famine  in  60  years.   Today  the
    objective evidence  points  towards  a  plague  of  locusts  that  have
    destroyed successive harvests. In common with the panel in AMM, we  are
    in no doubt that three decades of civil war has some part  to  play  in
    the lack of resources faced by Somalia, but for  the  purpose  of  this
    appeal the parties agree that at present it is this plague which is the
    "preponderant cause". As such Mr Toal did not seek to  persuade  us  to
    embark on a Sufi and Elmi analysis of the facts.

31. Mr Toal does, however, seek to persuade us that we could properly  find
    this to be an MSS type case. First, he asks us to equate the  situation
    of IDPs/returnees in Somalia with that of  asylum  seekers  in  Greece:
    both are particularly  vulnerable  populations.  Second,  he  draws  an
    analogy between the failure of the Greek government to meet  its  legal
    obligations under inter alia the relevant EEA Reception Directive  with
    those of the Somali government under the African Union  Convention  for
    the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa
    ('the Kampala Convention').

32. We think it uncontroversial that Somali IDPs - an umbrella term in this
    appeal accepted to  include  'returnees'  -  are  in  general  terms  a
    particularly vulnerable group. Successive country guidance  cases,  and
    the facts on the ground, would  suggest  it  to  be  so,  as  does  the
    preamble to the Kampala Convention.

33. We further accept that Somalia is a signatory to the Kampala Convention
    and that it has undertaken to incorporate the obligations therein  into
    its domestic law (although we are not told whether it has in fact  done
    so). Those obligations  include  "meeting  the  basic  needs"  of,  and
    "providing sufficient protection" to, IDPs.

34. We are not however satisfied that the ratio of MSS can be applied here.
    MSS was concerned with inhuman and degrading treatment within Europe of
    a particularly vulnerable individual whom  the  Greek  authorities  had
    both the ability, and legal duty, to  protect.  That  duty  arose  from
    Greece's obligations not  only  under  the  ECHR,  but  under  the  EEA
    treaties and its own domestic legislation.   Nothing  in  the  decision
    suggests  that  the  same  considerations  would  extend  to  a  feared
    violation in a non-signatory state. Indeed the ECtHR has expressly held
    to the contrary. In SHH v United Kingdom it was asked to  consider  the
    potential for violation of Article 3 in the case of a disabled man whom
    the United Kingdom proposed to return to Afghanistan.  It  declined  to
    take the MSS approach in the following terms [at �90]:

         "90. Second, the Court considers  that  the  present  case  can  be
         distinguished from M.S.S. In  that  case, a  fellow Contracting
         State, Greece, was found to be in violation of Article 3  of  the
         Convention through its own inaction and its failure to comply with
         its    positive    obligations    under    both    European     and
         domestic legislation to provide  reception  facilities  to  asylum
         seekers. Central to the Court's conclusion was its finding that the
         destitution  of  which  the  applicant  in  that  case   complained
         was linked to his status as an asylum seeker and to the fact  that
         his asylum application had not yet been  examined  by  the  Greek
         authorities. The Court was also of the opinion  that,  had  they
         examined  the  applicant's  asylum  request  promptly,  the   Greek
         authorities could have substantially alleviated his suffering (see
         paragraph 262  of  the  judgment).  By  contrast,   the present
         application  concerns the living  conditions  and  humanitarian
         situation in Afghanistan, a non-Contracting State, which has  no
         such    similar     positive     obligations     under     European
         legislation and cannot be held accountable under  the  Convention
         for failures to provide adequate welfare assistance to persons with
         disabilities.  In that regard, it is recalled that  the  Convention
         does not purport to be a means of requiring Contracting  States  to
         impose Convention standards on  other  States  (see, as  a  recent
         authority, Al-Skeini    and    Others     v. the     United
         Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, � 141, 7 July 2011)."

35. We are accordingly satisfied that the MSS approach cannot  be  extended
    to cover situations in which non-ECHR signatories fail  to  meet  their
    own regional or international commitments. It follows that the approach
    to take here is that set out in N, bringing us at last to  the  central
    legal issue before us: where is the N threshold to be set in such cases
    today?




      Non-intentional harm and the N threshold: Paposhvili applied?

36. As we have seen, in Said Burnett LJ expressly equated  cases  involving
    non-intentional material deprivation with those concerning  ill-health:
    the Court held that it was the high N threshold that must be applied to
    such claims.  This is also  the  view  taken  by  the  ECtHR,  see  for
    instance Sufi and Elmi [�282], and by the  Court  of  Appeal,  see  for
    instance MI (Palestine) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1782, [2019] Imm AR 75 [�16-23].   To  date  there  has
    never been any suggestion that different approaches should be taken  to
    these related species of claims. Yet before us this was the case put by
    Mr Anderson.

37. The reason that the Secretary of State  is  now  concerned  to  draw  a
    distinction between these two types of 'non-intentional harm' cases  is
    the modification of the N test introduced by the ECtHR in Paposhvili  v
    Belgium (App No. 41738/10), [2017] Imm AR 876 and endorsed in  December
    2020 by the UK Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2020] UKSC 17, [2020] Imm AR 1167.    Following  N
    claimants were required to demonstrate circumstances  so  exceptionally
    appalling that they reached the high threshold  set  in  D:  where  the
    applicant was critically ill and appeared to be close to  death,  could
    not be guaranteed any nursing or medical care in his country of  origin
    and had no family there willing or able to care for him or provide  him
    with even a basic level of  food,  shelter  or  social  support.   That
    'deathbed' scenario has now been held to set too high  a  threshold  to
    properly reflect the values that Article 3 is designed to protect.  The
    formula posited in Paposhvili was that there must be a real risk of:

         "being exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in  his
         or her state of health resulting  in  intense  suffering  or  to  a
         significant reduction in life expectancy".

    This was the test endorsed by the Court in  AM  (Zimbabwe),  albeit  it
    that it is properly understood as  a  departure  from,  rather  than  a
    clarification of, N. It is therefore no longer a  requirement  of  such
    cases that death be imminent: the focus shifts instead to whether there
    will be intense suffering in the country of return, or to a significant
    reduction in life expectancy.

38. For MAA Mr Toal simply asks us to apply this modified N  threshold.  He
    points out that the Upper Tribunal has already indicated, in KAM  (Nuba
    - return) Sudan  CG  [2020]  UKUT  00269  (IAC),  that  this  would  be
    appropriate:

         52. Whilst the case of N v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 39 has  recently  been
         reconsidered by the Strasbourg Court in Paposhvili v Belgium [2017]
         Imm AR 867 and adopted by the Supreme Court in AM(Zimbabwe) v  SSHD
         [2020] UKSC 17 so as to broaden the category of 'exceptional  case'
         falling within Art 3 in medical/health cases (and here  by  analogy
         we assume in 'living condition' cases), it remains a rigorous  test
         requiring serious and immediate suffering reaching the high  Art  3
         threshold or a significant diminution in life expectancy (see [27]-
         [31] per Lord Wilson in AM).

39. For the Secretary of State Mr Anderson points out that we are not bound
    by KAM (Sudan), particularly since the Tribunal does not appear to have
    heard any argument on the  point.  He  submits  that  contrary  to  the
    assumption made therein, there are good  reasons  to  distinguish  what
    that Tribunal refers to as 'living condition'  cases  from  the  health
    cases discussed in Paposhvili and AM. His argument, skilfully put,  was
    as follows.

40. In the beginning there was Article 3.  The contracting  parties  wanted
    to draw a line in the sand about what kind of behaviour was  acceptable
    in post-war Europe. Torture was  not.  Recalling  the  horrors  of  the
    concentration camps, nor was inhuman and degrading treatment. Those are
    the paradigm behaviours that the article prohibits, in absolute terms.

41. It was never intended that  the  Convention  would  be  concerned  with
    securing rights outside  the  territory  of  the  contracting  parties:
    indeed Article 1 specifically requires the High Contracting Parties  to
    secure to "everyone within their jurisdiction the rights  and  freedoms
    defined in section I".  Then in 1989 came Soering v United Kingdom (App
    No. 14038/88) (1989) 11 EHRR 439, an American  extradition  case  where
    the ECtHR was asked to find a real risk of violation in  another  place
    entirely - in the death row cells of a Virginia penitentiary. The Court
    embarked on  what  Mr  Anderson  describes  as  the  first  significant
    extension of the ambit of Article 3 [from �87]:

         "87. In interpreting the Convention  regard  must  be  had  to  its
         special character as a treaty for  the  collective  enforcement  of
         human rights and fundamental freedoms. Thus, the object and purpose
         of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual
         human beings require that its provisions be interpreted and applied
         so as to make its safeguards practical and effective. In  addition,
         any interpretation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed has to  be
         consistent  with  "the  general  spirit  of  the   Convention,   an
         instrument designed to maintain and promote the ideals  and  values
         of a democratic society".

         88 ...

         The question remains whether  the  extradition  of  a  fugitive  to
         another State where he would  be  subjected  or  be  likely  to  be
         subjected to torture  or  to  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or
         punishment would itself engage the responsibility of a  Contracting
         State under Article 3.  That the abhorrence  of  torture  has  such
         implications is recognised in  Article  3  of  the  United  Nations
         Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,  Inhuman  or  Degrading
         Treatment or Punishment, which provides that "no State Party  shall
         ... extradite a person where  there  are  substantial  grounds  for
         believing that  he  would  be  in  danger  of  being  subjected  to
         torture". The fact that a specialised treaty should spell  out  in
         detail a  specific  obligation  attaching  to  the  prohibition  of
         torture does not mean that an essentially similar obligation is not
         already inherent in the general terms of Article 3 of the  European
         Convention. It would hardly  be  compatible  with  the  underlying
         values of  the  Convention,  that  "common  heritage  of  political
         traditions, ideals, freedom and the  rule  of  law"  to  which  the
         Preamble refers, were a Contracting State knowingly to surrender  a
         fugitive to another State where there were substantial grounds  for
         believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,
         however heinous the crime allegedly committed. Extradition in  such
         circumstances, while not explicitly referred to in  the  brief  and
         general wording of Article 3, would  plainly  be  contrary  to  the
         spirit and intendment of the Article, and in the Court's view  this
         inherent obligation not to extradite also extends to cases in which
         the fugitive would be faced in the receiving State by a  real  risk
         of  exposure  to  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment
         proscribed by that Article[6]."

42. Soering was quickly followed by Cruz Varas v Sweden (App No. 15576/89),
    (1992) 14 EHRR 1, Vilvarajah  v  United  Kingdom  (App  No.  13163/87),
    (1992) 14 EHRR 248 and Chahal v  United  Kingdom  (App  No.  22414/93),
    (1996) 23 EHRR 413. Application of  this  'extraterritorial  extension'
    thereafter became a regular feature of the ECtHR's work.

43. All of these cases were, however, still concerned with harms that  were
    to be deliberately  inflicted  by  the  authorities  in  the  receiving
    states.  It was not until 1997 that the ECtHR in  D  v  United  Kingdom
    found Article 3  to  be  engaged  in  circumstances  where  the  feared
    degradation and suffering arose naturally.  Mr Anderson identifies this
    as the second significant extension to the ambit of the  Convention  as
    it was originally conceived. In D the Court found a violation not  only
    where the harm occurred outside of the jurisdiction, but where it arose
    from the Appellant's  naturally  occurring  illness:  D,  and  N  which
    followed, represented an 'extension of an extension'.

44. Having taken us this  far,  Mr  Anderson  asks  us  to  find  that  the
    application of the D/N ratio to cases involving material deprivation is
    an extension further still.  He makes two points  in  support  of  that
    submission. First, he points out that nowhere in any of  the  judgments
    in D or N, domestic or European, do the  courts  expressly  contemplate
    such a leap. More importantly it is clear from the drafting, and indeed
    the history of the  Convention,  that  its  focus  is  upon  civil  and
    political rights as opposed to social, cultural and economic rights. In
    Said type cases, the argument goes, we are dealing with  'an  extension
    of an extension of an extension': we are pushing at the very limits  of
    the Convention's protections.  Whilst the Convention may be  a  'living
    instrument', Mr Anderson submits that  its  boundaries  should  not  be
    distorted to the point where it would be unrecognisable to the original
    signatories.   To this end Mr Anderson prays in  aid  the  judgment  of
    Lord Justice Laws in GS (India) and in particular its approval of  Lord
    Bingham's speech in Brown v Stott [2003] 1 AC 681 [at �703D-G]:

         "In interpreting  the  Convention,  as  any  other  treaty,  it  is
         generally to be assumed that the parties have  included  the  terms
         which they wished to include and on which they were able to  agree,
         omitting other terms which they did not wish to include or on which
         they were not able to agree. Thus particular regard must be had and
         reliance placed on the  express  terms  of  the  Convention,  which
         define the rights and freedoms which the contracting  parties  have
         undertaken to secure. This  does  not  mean  that  nothing  can  be
         implied into the Convention. The language of the Convention is  for
         the most  part  so  general  that  some  implication  of  terms  is
         necessary, and the case law of the European Court  shows  that  the
         court has been willing to imply terms into the Convention  when  it
         was judged necessary or plainly right to do so. But the process  of
         implication is one to be carried out with caution, if the  risk  is
         to be  averted  that  the  contracting  parties  may,  by  judicial
         interpretation, become bound by  obligations  which  they  did  not
         expressly accept and might not have been willing to accept.  As  an
         important constitutional instrument the Convention is to be seen as
         a 'living tree capable of growth and expansion within  its  natural
         limits' (Edwards v Attorney General for Canada [1930] AC 124,  136
         per Lord Sankey LC), but those limits  will  often  call  for  very
         careful consideration."

45. It is against this background that Mr Anderson urges  the  Tribunal  to
    proceed with caution: the modification of  the  N  test  introduced  by
    Paposhvili  and  confirmed  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)   was   a   humanitarian
    recalibration based very specifically on the circumstances  arising  in
    medical cases.  Those  judgments  focused  on  the  illogicality  of  a
    distinction between dying on  arrival  or  dying  within  some  months.
    Should that relaxation of the standard be extended to  cases  concerned
    with  material  deprivation,  it  will  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    submission be an extension too far. It would risk, as Laws LJ puts  it,
    binding the contracting parties  to  obligations  which  they  did  not
    expressly accept [at �38 GS (India)]. For those reasons we are asked to
    confine the Paposhvili modification to health cases.

46. Impressed as  we  were  with  Mr  Anderson's  argument,  and  his  oral
    presentation of it, we are unable to accept it.

47. The Secretary of State's case rests on the principle that  the  'living
    instrument' doctrine should not be so liberally applied that it renders
    the  protections  of  the  Convention  unrecognisable.  This  was  Lord
    Bingham's caution, echoed by Lord Justice Laws in GS (India) [at �38]:

         "38. ... So the starting-point is the text, and any implication  or
         enlargement requires a  careful  avoidance  of  the  imposition  of
         obligations beyond the  actual  or  assumed  scope  of  the  States
         parties'  agreement.  But  there   is   at   once   a   difficulty,
         unacknowledged in these dicta.  How  is  the  "living  instrument"
         approach to be reconciled with the court's duty to be loyal to  the
         founders' agreement? The notion  that  the  modern  scope  of  ECHR
         rights may be resolved by asking whether the States  parties  might
         have consented to this or that outcome suggested  by  circumstances
         which were or might have been beyond contemplation  when  the  text
         was agreed is surely problematic. I think the best one can do is to
         confine any implication or enlargement  to  situations  which  have
         some affinity with the paradigm case; situations which are,  so  to
         speak, within the spirit of the paradigm case, whose identification
         therefore assumes a considerable importance."

48. As a matter of principle, this is plainly correct, and it accords  with
    the general rule of interpretation set down in  Article  31(1)  of  the
    Vienna Convention on the Law  of  Treaties.  Decision  makers  must  be
    careful not to read into the Convention protections beyond  its  scope,
    since to do so would be to bind signatories to  obligations  that  they
    never  agreed  to.  It  would  however  be  equally  wrong  to  take  a
    restrictive, originalist approach to the text.  The Convention is to be
    interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights  practical
    and effective, not theoretical and illusory,  and  in  a  manner  which
    continues to reflect the values of the societies  that  it  serves.   A
    review of the jurisprudence since 1950 reveals just how  far,  applying
    those principles, the branches of the tree have already spread.

49. The first  decades  of  the  Convention's  lifespan  saw  little  legal
    activity  in  Strasbourg:  the  Convention  then  simply  served  as  a
    declaration of the values and political will  of  post-war  Europe.  In
    this early period it was seen primarily as a mechanism  by  which  that
    democratic order  could  be  enforced:   see  for  instance  the  Greek
    Case[7], in which other members of the Council of  Europe  charged  the
    fascist junta in Athens with the torture of political  opponents.    It
    was not in fact until the mid-1960s that the United Kingdom, in  common
    with other major powers, accepted the right of individual  petition  at
    all[8].  Having taken that leap, however, the  ECtHR soon accepted that
    it is the purpose of the Convention which is to be given primacy in its
    interpretation, taking a teleological approach  in  Wemhoff  v  Federal
    Republic of Germany (App No 2122/64), (1979-80) 1  EHRR  55,  Golder  v
    United Kingdom (App No. 4451/70), (1979-80) 1 EHRR 524 and then Tyrer v
    United Kingdom (App No. 5856/72), (1979-80) 2 EHRR 1 in which the court
    expressly recognised that this purpose was to be interpreted  in  light
    of societal developments:

         The Court  must  also  recall  that  the  Convention  is  a  living
         instrument which, as the  Commission  rightly  stressed,  must  be
         interpreted in the light of present-day conditions.

50. Applying the 'living instrument' doctrine the  ECtHR  has  since  Tyrer
    repeatedly enlarged the scope of the  Convention's  protections  beyond
    scenarios within the contemplation of the signatory  parties  in  1950.
    In for instance Marckx v Belgium (App No 6833/74), (1980)  2  EHRR  330
    the ECtHR recognised the Article 8 family life rights of children  born
    out of wedlock, and in Dudgeon  v  United  Kingdom  (App  No  7525/76),
    (1981) 4 EHRR 149 the private life rights of gay men.  As Mr Anderson's
    own chronology demonstrates, the protection of the Convention was  then
    (in effect) extended outwith the borders of Europe in Soering, and in D
    to cases far beyond the original paradigm.  As these cases  illustrate,
    the 'living instrument' doctrine  has  already  yielded  results  which
    would seventy years ago have been regarded as radical, but in  applying
    it the  ECtHR has expressly recognised that its decisions must  reflect
    the prevailing norms in the societies that it serves. As the court  put
    it in Wemhoff, it is necessary "to  seek  the  interpretation  that  is
    most appropriate in order to realise the aim and achieve the object of
    the treaty, not that which would restrict  to  the  greatest  possible
    degree the obligations undertaken by the Parties".

51. This being so, we find  a  number  of  ECtHR  cases  in  which  social,
    cultural  and  economic  rights  feature,   either   tangentially,   or
    centrally, notwithstanding their apparent exclusion by the  signatories
    in 1950. It is trite history  that  in  this  wholly  western  European
    project the drafters selected from the Universal Declaration  of  Human
    Rights only those civil and political rights believed to  best  reflect
    democratic values: the economic rights  ideologically  vaunted  by  the
    eastern bloc were deliberately omitted[9].  Yet as early  as  1979  the
    ECtHR had in Airey v Ireland (App No. 6289/73), (1979-80)  2  EHRR  305
    cautioned against imagining a "water-tight division"  between  the  two
    classes of rights. The Court subsequently recognised  the  multifaceted
    nature of suffering in cases such as Seljuk and Asker v  Turkey  (1998)
    26 EHRR 477, Bilgin v Turkey (App. No 23819/24) 2000 and Dulas v Turkey
    (App. No 25801/94) 2001, all applications in which Turkey was found  to
    be in violation of Article 3 (and 8)  notwithstanding  that  they  were
    ostensibly concerned with the destruction of property and homelessness.
      Both Commission and Court have further accepted that dire poverty  is
    capable of engaging Article 3: see for  instance  Larioshina  v  Russia
    (App  No.  56869/00)  (23rd  April  2002)  and  then  in  another  case
    concerning inadequate provision for pensioners,  Budina v Russia  (App.
    No 45603/05) (18 June 2009). In Budina the Court expressly rejected the
    Russian submission that it lacked the  jurisdiction  to  consider  such
    matters[10]:

         "as to compatibility ratione materiae, the Court  reiterates  that
         the mere fact that an interpretation of the Convention may  extend
         into the sphere of social and  economic  rights  should  not  be  a
         decisive factor against such an interpretation".

52.  An  analysis  to  the  same  effect  is  found  in  our  own  domestic
    jurisprudence in Adam, Limbuela and Tesema v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2005] UKHL 66, [2007] 1 All ER 951 where the House  of
    Lords was asked to consider whether legislation depriving those who had
    failed to claim asylum on arrival - "late applicants"  -  of  financial
    support had given rise to a violation of Article 3.    Their  Lordships
    expressly  recognised  that  the   Convention   imposes   no   positive
    obligations  upon  signatory   states   to   guarantee   socio-economic
    rights[11], but where the lack of them is abject, the  Article  may  be
    engaged. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill puts it [at �7]:

         "Treatment is inhuman or degrading if, to a  seriously  detrimental
         extent, it denies the most basic needs of any human  being.  As  in
         all article 3 cases, the treatment, to be proscribed, must  achieve
         a minimum standard of severity,  and  I  would  accept  that  in  a
         context such as this, not involving the  deliberate  infliction  of
         pain or suffering, the threshold is a high one.  A  general  public
         duty to house the homeless or provide for the destitute  cannot  be
         spelled out of article 3. But I have no doubt  that  the  threshold
         may be crossed if a late applicant with no means and no alternative
         sources  of  support,  unable  to  support  himself,  is,  by   the
         deliberate action of the state, denied shelter, food  or  the  most
         basic necessities of life. It is not necessary that  treatment,  to
         engage  article  3,  should  merit  the  description  used,  in  an
         immigration context,  by  Shakespeare  and  others  in Sir  Thomas
         More when they referred to "your mountainish inhumanity".

53. In all of the cases to which we have been referred,  whether  they  are
    about poverty, or a lack  of  palliative  care,  or  homelessness,  the
    'living instrument' approach has enabled the  ECtHR  to  focus  not  on
    fact that the suffering endured by the claimants is  socio-economic  in
    nature, but on the suffering itself, and in particular its  assault  on
    the human dignity of the individuals concerned. There is  no  right  to
    health care, but it may be a violation if the lack of  it  exposes  the
    sick to inhuman and degrading conditions: see D v United Kingdom.   Nor
    is there a right to a minimum level of income, but an  existence  below
    that subsistence level could engage Article 3  if  it  is  damaging  to
    physical or mental health, or leaves the individual in "a situation  of
    degradation incompatible with human dignity": Budina v  Russia.   There
    is no guarantee under the Convention of a right to housing per se  (see
    for instance Muslim v Turkey  (App No. 53566/99), (2006)  42  EHRR  16)
    but there may be a violation of  Article  3  if  the  lack  of  housing
    fundamentally undermines the dignity of the homeless:   in  Moldavan  v
    Russia (No 2) (Apps No 41138/98 and 64320/02) the severely  overcrowded
    and unsanitary conditions endured by the applicants over a long  period
    was found, in light of the state's indifference  to  their  plight,  to
    arouse in them feelings of "humiliation and debasement".

54. This focus upon dignity has led the  Court  in  recent  years  to  find
    violations in some arguably unlikely scenarios.   In  Vinter  &  Ors  v
    United Kingdom (Apps Nos 66069/09 130/10 and 3896/10) III ECHR 317, for
    instance, the Court found the hopelessness faced by  prisoners  serving
    sentences without the prospect of parole to be  incompatible  with  the
    UK's obligations under Article 3, notwithstanding the  s  ECtHR's  long
    stated  commitment  to  giving  signatory  states  a  wide  margin   of
    appreciation when it came to penal policy. In Bouyid v Belgium (App  No
    23380/09), (2015) ECHR 819  the  facts,  a  single  slap  by  a  police
    officer, did not at first blush come  close  to  reaching  the  minimum
    level of severity required: indeed it had been the unanimous verdict of
    the Chamber that they did not. By  a  substantial  majority  the  Grand
    Chamber overturned the decision below. Central to the  Grand  Chamber's
    reasoning was a confirmation that although the word does not feature in
    Article 3 itself - the Court  lists  no  fewer  than  20  human  rights
    instruments in which it does  - human dignity is, and always has  been,
    "the very essence of the Convention"[12] :

         87.  Ill-treatment that attains such a minimum level  of  severity
         usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental
         suffering. However, even in the absence  of  these  aspects,  where
         treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing  a  lack  of
         respect for or diminishing his or her  human  dignity,  or  arouses
         feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority  capable  of  breaking  an
         individual's moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised
         as degrading and also fall within  the  prohibition  set  forth  in
         Article 3 ...

         89.  The word "dignity" appears in many international and regional
         texts and instruments (see paragraphs 45-47  above).  Although  the
         Convention does not  mention  that  concept  -  which  nevertheless
         appears in the Preamble to  Protocol  No.  13  to  the  Convention,
         concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all  circumstances
         - the Court has emphasised that respect for  human  dignity  forms
         part of the very essence of the Convention.

         90.  Moreover, there is a particularly  strong  link  between  the
         concepts of "degrading" treatment or punishment within the  meaning
         of Article 3 of the Convention and respect for "dignity".  In  1973
         the European Commission  of  Human  Rights  stressed  that  in  the
         context of Article 3 of the Convention  the  expression  "degrading
         treatment" showed that the general purpose of that provision was to
         prevent  particularly  serious  interferences  with  human  dignity
         (see East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, nos. 4403/70 and 30
         others, Commission's report of  14  December  1973,  Decisions  and
         Reports 78-A, p. 56, � 192). The Court,  for  its  part,  made  its
         first  explicit  reference  to  this  concept   in   the   judgment
         in Tyrer ...

55. Having had regard to this jurisprudence we are  unable  to  accept  the
    Secretary of State's submission  that  cases  concerned  with  material
    deprivation are necessarily at the  very  outer  limits  of  Convention
    protection and should accordingly be subject to the most  stringent  of
    standards, the unmodified N test.  Strasbourg has already in a  variety
    of contexts recognised rights which, although ostensibly socio-economic
    in nature, arise  in  situations  fundamentally  concerned  with  human
    dignity and so capable of engaging Article 3. As the decision in Bouyid
    makes clear, this approach is consistent not only with  the  object  of
    the Convention itself, but with the wider humanitarian purpose of human
    rights law as a whole.

56. Furthermore we are unable  to  accept  the  proposition  that  material
    deprivation cases are a tenuous 'extension' of the health cases at all:
     on the contrary, we find them to be growth on the same branch.

57. In the health cases what is the factor  that  fundamentally  undermines
    the dignity of the individuals concerned? It was not the illness of  Mr
    D, Ms N, nor Mr Paposhvili which led to the cases before the ECtHR:  it
    was the lack of medical treatment - i.e. material  deprivation  -  that
    they would face upon expulsion from the host country. This is explained
    by the Court in Pretty v United Kingdom [at �53]:

         In the present case, it is beyond dispute that the respondent State
         has not, itself, inflicted any ill-treatment on the applicant.  Nor
         is there any complaint that the applicant is not receiving adequate
         care from the State  medical  authorities.  The  situation  of  the
         applicant is therefore not comparable with that in D. v. the United
         Kingdom, in which an AIDS sufferer was threatened with removal from
         the United Kingdom to the island of St  Kitts  where  no  effective
         medical or palliative treatment for his illness was  available  and
         he would have been exposed to the risk  of  dying  under  the  most
         distressing circumstances. The responsibility of  the  State  would
         have been engaged by its act ("treatment") of removing him in those
         circumstances. There is no comparable act  or  "treatment"  on  the
         part of the United Kingdom in the present case.

    [Emphasis added].

58. And in SHH v United Kingdom:

         "74.  In Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, cited above, the Court
         held that socio-economic and humanitarian conditions in  a  country
         of return did not necessarily have a bearing, and certainly  not  a
         decisive bearing, on the question of whether the persons concerned
         would face a real risk of  ill  treatment  within  the  meaning  of
         Article 3 in those areas (� 141).

         75.  However,  in N. v.  the  United  Kingdom, cited  above,
         the Court held  that  although  the  Convention  was  essentially
         directed at the protection  of  civil  and  political  rights, the
         fundamental importance of Article 3 meant that it was necessary for
         the Court to retain a degree of flexibility to prevent expulsion in
         very exceptional cases. Noting that Article 3 did not  place  an
         obligation on Contracting States to alleviate  disparities  in  the
         availability of medical treatment in different States through the
         provision of free and unlimited health care to all aliens without a
         right    to    stay     within     their     jurisdictions,     the
         Court nevertheless held that humanitarian conditions  would  give
         rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention in very exceptional
         cases  where  the  humanitarian  grounds   against   removal   were
         compelling (�42).

         ...

         89.  The Court finds that the  principles  of N.  v.  the  United
         Kingdom should apply to the circumstances of the present case for
         the    following    reasons.  First,    the    Court    recalls
         that N. concerned the  removal  of  an  HIV-positive  applicant
         to Uganda, where her lifespan was likely to be reduced on  account
         of the fact that the treatment facilities there  were  inferior  to
         those available in the United Kingdom. In reaching its conclusions,
         the Court noted that the alleged future harm would emanate not from
         the intentional acts or omission of public authorities or non-State
         bodies but from a naturally  occurring  illness  and  the  lack  of
         sufficient resources to deal with it in the receiving country. The
         Court also stated that Article 3 did not place an obligation on the
         Contracting State to alleviate disparities in the  availability  of
         medical treatment between the Contracting State and the country  of
         origin through the provision of free and unlimited health  care to
         all   aliens   without    a    right    to    stay    within    its
         jurisdiction (ibid, � 44). The Court acknowledges that, in  the
         present case, the applicant's disability cannot be considered to be
         a "naturally"  occurring  illness and  does  not  require medical
         treatment. Nevertheless, it is considered to be significant that in
         both scenarios the  future  harm  would  emanate  from  a  lack  of
         sufficient resources to provide either medical treatment or welfare
         provision rather than the intentional acts  or  omissions  of  the
         authorities of the receiving State."

59. And in Paposhvili itself:

         183.  The Court considers that the "other very exceptional  cases"
         within the meaning of the judgment in N. v. the United Kingdom (�
         43) which may raise an issue under Article 3 should  be  understood
         to refer to situations involving the removal  of  a  seriously  ill
         person in which substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing
         that he or she, although not at imminent risk of dying, would  face
         a real risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in
         the receiving country or the lack of access to such  treatment,  of
         being exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline  in  his
         or her state of health resulting  in  intense  suffering  or  to  a
         significant reduction in life expectancy. The Court points out that
         these situations correspond to a high threshold for the application
         of Article 3 of the Convention in cases concerning the  removal  of
         aliens suffering from serious illness.

    [Emphasis added]

60. As the unfortunate demise of Mr  Paposhvili  illustrates,  the  illness
    remained a constant, wherever he was: for the purpose  of  the  court's
    enquiry, it was simply  a  personal  characteristic  that  fell  to  be
    evaluated as part of the assessment of whether the conditions he  faced
    on return to Georgia gave rise to a real risk of inhuman and  degrading
    treatment. In fact in each of the health cases to which  we  have  been
    referred, a defence of the contracting party has not been to query  the
    impact  of  the  claimant's  illness,  but  to  argue  that  prevailing
    circumstances  on  the  ground  are  not  dire   enough   to   find   a
    violation[14].

61.  Consequently  we  cannot  agree  that  there  is  any  jurisprudential
    distinction between the health cases and those concerned with  material
    deprivation:  it  is  no  doubt  for  this  reason  that  none  of  the
    authorities to which we have been  referred  have  drawn  one.  To  the
    contrary, the Courts have treated  them  in  the  same  way,  uniformly
    applying the N test wherever the  feared  harm  arises  from  naturally
    occurring circumstance.

62. Thus whilst we accept that the Convention has expanded, and  that  each
    incremental spurt of growth must be carefully  considered,  we  do  not
    accept that in applying Paposhvili to this case we would materially, or
    impermissibly, be adding to that growth. We would  simply  be  applying
    the law within its existing limits.  The N threshold has been  modified
    by Paposhvili and AM (Zimbabwe) and  it  is  that  less  exacting,  but
    nevertheless very high, test that we must  apply.   We  are  no  longer
    concerned with whether there would be an imminence  of  death  for  MAA
    upon return to Somalia, but  rather  whether  he  will  be  exposed  to
    conditions resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction
    in his life expectancy such that the  humanitarian  case  for  granting
    leave is compelling.




    The Qualification Directive

63. MAA relies, in addition  to  Article  3,  upon  Article  15(b)  of  the
    Qualification Directive:

         Serious harm consists of:

      a) The death penalty or execution; or

      b) Torture or inhuman or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  of  an
         applicant in the country of origin; or

    Serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person by  reason
    of indiscriminate violence in situations of international  or  internal
    armed conflict

64. The parties  agreed  that  the  United  Kingdom's  departure  from  the
    European Union notwithstanding, the Directive continued to have  direct
    effect, although neither was in a position to articulate  exactly  why.
    The Supreme Court in G v G [2020] EWCA Civ 1185 certainly proceeded  on
    the same footing but again without explanation: see [�84].  The  reason
    is set out at ss2 -4 of the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018:

         2 Saving for EU-derived domestic legislation


         (1) EU-derived domestic legislation, as it has effect  in  domestic
         law immediately before  exit  day,  continues  to  have  effect  in
         domestic law on and after exit day.

         (2) In this section "EU-derived  domestic  legislation"  means  any
         enactment so far as-

             (a) made under section 2(2) of, or paragraph 1A of Schedule  2
             to, the European Communities Act 1972,

             (b) passed or made, or operating, for a purpose  mentioned  in
             section 2(2)(a) or (b) of that Act,

             (c) relating to anything-

                  (i) which falls within paragraph (a) or (b), or

                  (ii) to which section 3(1) or 4(1) applies, or

             (d) relating otherwise to the EU or the EEA,

         but does not  include  any  enactment  contained  in  the  European
         Communities Act 1972.

         ...

         3 Incorporation of direct EU legislation


         (1) Direct EU legislation, so far as operative  immediately  before
         exit day, forms part of domestic law on and after exit day.

         (2) In this Act "direct EU legislation" means-

             (a) any EU regulation, EU decision or EU tertiary legislation,
             as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day...

         (3) For the purposes of this Act,  any  direct  EU  legislation  is
         operative immediately before exit day if-

             (a) in the case of  anything  which  comes  into  force  at  a
             particular time and is stated to apply from a later  time,  it
             is in force and applies immediately before exit day,

             (b) in the case of a decision which specifies to  whom  it  is
             addressed, it has been notified to  that  person  before  exit
             day, and

             (c) in any other case, it is in force immediately before  exit
             day.

         ...

         4 Saving for rights etc. under section 2(1) of the ECA


         (1) Any rights,  powers,  liabilities,  obligations,  restrictions,
         remedies and procedures which, immediately before exit day-

             (a) are recognised and available in domestic law by virtue  of
             section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972, and

             (b) are enforced, allowed and followed accordingly,

         continue on and after exit day to be recognised  and  available  in
         domestic  law  (and  to   be   enforced,   allowed   and   followed
         accordingly).

         ...

65. Prior to the end of the implementation period the relevant parts of the
    Qualification Directive were implemented domestically by The Refugee or
    Person in Need of International Protection (Qualification)  Regulations
    2006, and the Immigration Rules. They continue therefore, by virtue  of
    s2(1) above, to have direct effect.

66. That having been established, no material discrete  issue  arose  under
    Article 15: the parties accepted that if MAA is  able  to  make  out  a
    claim under Article 3, success under Article 15(b)  would  follow,  and
    vice versa.   The only discussion  about  the  Qualification  Directive
    before us arose in the context of Mr  Toal's  reply  to  Mr  Anderson's
    argument about the various enlargements to  the  Convention,  discussed
    above. As Mr Toal points out the language of Article 15(b) requires the
    torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to be faced in an
    applicant's  "country  of  origin"  thus  expressly  incorporating  the
    Soering extension into European law. Support, if support is needed, for
    the contention that  in  human  rights  law,  once  radical  departures
    eventually become orthodoxy.

67. For the sake of completeness  we  note  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepts that MAA would be entitled to  humanitarian  protection  if  he
    discharges the burden upon him: he is not excluded by his  criminality,
    the First-tier  Tribunal  having  quashed  the   Secretary  of  State's
    certification  under s72 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.



    Article 8

68. There was no disagreement between the parties  about  the  approach  we
    must take to Article 8, which we only intend to address should MAA fail
    to make out his Article 3 protection grounds.  As  a  foreign  criminal
    who has been sentenced to 4  years  or  more,  MAA  cannot  succeed  on
    Article 8 grounds on the basis  of  one  of  the  'exceptions'  to  the
    automatic deportation procedure set out in s33 Borders  Act  2007.   He
    can only defeat the proposed action if he can  demonstrate  that  there
    are "very compelling circumstances over and above" those matters.  This
    very high test is reflective of  the  strong  public  interest  in  the
    deportation of serious criminals. In making our assessment we must have
    regard to a wide range of factors which in this context, would  include
    conditions on the ground in Somalia.




    Article 4

69. Before we turn to make our findings on MAA's appeal, it is  appropriate
    that we record one submission which we do not intend  to  address.   It
    was Mr Toal's analysis of the evidence about 'Gatekeepers' - those  who
    guard and control the IDP camps in and  around  Mogadishu  -  that  the
    inhabitants of those camps are kept in conditions which mean that  they
    are, as a matter of law, to be classified as  victims  of  trafficking.
    In very brief  summary  the  point  made  is  that  the  definition  of
    trafficking set out at Article 4 of the European Convention  on  Action
    Against Trafficking in Human Beings (ECAT) includes the "harbouring  or
    receipt of persons" for the purpose of financial exploitation.    Since
    there is some evidence of Gatekeepers keeping IDPs  confined  to  their
    camp, and subjecting those IDPs to unlawful and oppressive 'taxation' -
    i.e. taking a proportion of their meagre resources - that definition is
    prima facie met.  As we explained to Mr Toal at the hearing, we are not
    going to deal with this blanket submission.   This  is  not  a  country
    guidance case, and it is of no concern to  MAA  whether  or  not  other
    Somalis find themselves in a trafficking situation.  We  are  concerned
    only with the potential risks to him.



    The Facts

    MAA's Life in Somalia

70. MAA arrived in the UK on the 11th April 2008, when he was sixteen years
    old. We accept the following relevant facts about his life  until  that
    point.

71. MAA states that he was born in Farhad in the Lower Shabelle but when he
    was very young his family moved  to  Mogadishu  after  militias  seized
    their land.  They lived in a district called Hodan, near  30th  Street.
    MAA attended the Imam Shafi'i school.  There  was  a  period  when  the
    fighting was too heavy to attend, but on and off he was there for about
    4 years. MAA was a good student.  He states that security in  Mogadishu
    at this time was very poor. He details a number of incidents  where  he
    was attacked or robbed or both, and a  time  when  a  missile  hit  his
    family home.   He also experienced a lot of bullying  and  difficulties
    with other boys in the area.

72. When he claimed asylum it was MAA's case that he is from  the  minority
    Ashraf clan. That claim was rejected by the  First-Tier  Tribunal.   In
    seeking permission to appeal against that decision MAA made  no  direct
    challenge to that finding.  Insofar as a challenge could be implied, in
    the ground that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to his  mother's
    statement, permission was in any event refused.   MAA did not make  any
    representations on the issue of his ethnicity by way of a  response  to
    the Secretary of State's appeal filed in accordance with Rule  24(3)(e)
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.    Nor  was  the
    matter raised before Judge Bruce at  the  'error  of  law'  hearing  in
    October 2020. Before us Mr Toal  nevertheless  sought  to  re-open  the
    question of whether MAA is from a minority Somali clan.  We declined to
    hear those  submissions.  Having  had  regard  to  that  chronology  of
    proceedings thus far we are satisfied that  it  would  not  be  in  the
    interests of justice to permit  a  challenge  to  be  mounted  to  this
    finding of fact at such late stage.   The finding that MAA is not of  a
    minority clan is therefore preserved.

73. MAA states that he has not seen any  member  of  his  immediate  family
    since 2005. He had gone to school early in  the  morning  but  fighting
    broke out and so the children were all told to go home.  MAA  tried  to
    make his way home but there was gunfire so he ran the opposite way.  By
    the evening he managed to reach the family  home.  He  found  the  door
    locked.  He went to his neighbour's house and  found  no  adults,  only
    children. They told him that they had returned home from school to find
    that their parents,  and  his,  had  fled.   The  children  all  stayed
    together: MAA, the twin neighbour boys aged 16, and their elder brother
    Abdi who made a living,  and  supported  them  all,  by  selling  qaat.
    Sometimes the boys would get leftovers given to them by local cafes and
    shops. MAA remained with these brothers for about a year. He  continued
    to attend school: because he had been a good student they did  not  ask
    for any fees.

74. After some time MAA heard from people in the area that his  family  had
    fled back to Farhan. He was told that his father was ill. He wanted  to
    travel to Farhan to find his family but there were two  obstacles.   He
    did not have any money, and the fighting meant that travel  was  risky.
    He knew that his paternal grandmother lived just outside  Mogadishu  in
    Lafoole - it was only about one hour away on  foot  but  once  when  he
    tried to go there he was attacked in the street so he was afraid to try
    again for a long time.   It was not until 2006 that he managed to reach
    his grandmother's house. MAA remembers his grandmother as being "fairly
    well off". She had a herd of cows and used to  sell  milk.   He  stayed
    with her for about two months.  She gave him money for another year  of
    school fees and told him to go back to Mogadishu and carry on with  his
    education.  She had heard from people travelling from Farhan  that  his
    parents were there and this was their wish.

75. By the autumn of 2007 MAA had resolved to leave  Somalia.  The  ongoing
    heavy fighting had meant that he had been unable to attend school for a
    month  and.  Many  people  left  the  city  -  when  MAA  reached   his
    grandmother's house in January 2008 he found the  whole  area  full  of
    refugees. His grandmother sold some of her herd and raised  $10,000  to
    pay for MAA's journey.  She got a relative to make contact with a well-
    known agent in Mogadishu, and MAA's  trip  was  arranged.  He  flew  to
    Somaliland, and then to Djibouti before continuing on to the UK.




    MAA's Family

76. When MAA arrived in the UK he was in possession of a  telephone  number
    of a lady he had not at that  point  met.   Her  name  is  AH  and  she
    identifies herself as his paternal cousin - her mother and  his  father
    were half siblings. AH is the only relative MAA has any  contact  with.
    Since arriving in this country he has lived with her  on  and  off  and
    before she lost her job in the pandemic she  had  been  supporting  him
    financially. We heard  oral  evidence  from  AH.  Not  all  of  it  was
    particularly helpful - she has been in the UK since 1996 and so much of
    her evidence about events in Somalia was hearsay.  As we explain below,
    we are however prepared to place significant weight on what she had  to
    say about the current whereabouts of members of MAA's family,

77. At the point that he left Somalia MAA had been  living  with  his  next
    door neighbours for approximately three years. The only  family  member
    with whom he had had direct contact was  his  grandmother  in  Lafoole.
    After his arrival in the UK MAA called his neighbour Abdi in  Mogadishu
    to tell him of his safe arrival and Abdi had  some  exciting  news  for
    him. His father had returned to the city. He was unwell and had come to
    try and obtain medical treatment. Abdi told MAA that he  would  arrange
    for his father to be there when he called back. After a couple of  days
    this call took place.  MAA's father told him that his two sisters  were
    living with a maternal uncle in Farhan, and  that  his  three  brothers
    were placed with another uncle.  Their mother was living with  friends.
     Mr Anderson asked us to reject the evidence about this telephone  call
    on the basis that it was  unclear  how  MAA's  father  would  have  had
    contact with Abdi. We are satisfied that this was quite straightforward
    - he was the next door neighbour. It is natural that upon returning  to
    the city MAA's father would go to his  own  house,  and  speak  to  the
    neighbours. Further,   MAA's  evidence  is   that  his  grandmother  in
    Lafoole  had  at  least  indirect  contact  with  her  son  in  Farhad,
    communicated through people who were travelling between the  locations,
    so it is probable that MAA's family were aware that he had been  living
    with Abdi and his brothers.

78. It is MAA's case that this was the last time he spoke with his  father.
    He claims that in 2013 his father was killed in a  bomb  blast  at  the
    Supreme Court in Mogadishu where he had  got  a  job  working  for  the
    government. This evidence  was  rejected  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    because it was contradicted by evidence elsewhere that the father  made
    a living selling farmland and labouring.   Permission  to  appeal  that
    finding was refused on the 12th  June  2020  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Macleman. Undeterred by that, Mr Toal sought before  us  to  argue  the
    point, calling evidence from AH about her understanding of where  MAA's
    father had worked and when, and the circumstances of his death.  As  we
    indicated at hearing, we are not prepared  to  revisit  a  matter  upon
    which permission has been expressly refused. We would note that even if
    we had exercised our discretion in MAA's  favour,  it  would  not  have
    assisted him. That is because the evidence we heard about MAA's  father
    was even more confused than the evidence already before the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The previous evidence that  he  died  in  a  bomb  blast  was
    directly contradicted by the testimony of AH that he was in  fact  shot
    by an al-Shabaab fighter. The evidence that  he  died  at  the  Supreme
    Court complex is contradicted by a letter from the  Somali  Embassy  in
    Kampala that he died at the Benadir District Court.   Had this  been  a
    matter upon which we could properly replace the finding of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, we would have found that the evidence was not capable of
    discharging the burden of proof, even to the lower  standard.   Finally
    we would  note  that  the  point  is,  for  the  purpose  of  our  risk
    assessment, largely moot, since MAA's own expert witness, Mary  Harper,
    concludes that no additional or discrete risk would attach  to  him  if
    his father had happened to be killed in a terror attack  on  the  court
    complex in 2013.

79. The question then arises: where are MAA's family today?

80.  We  are  satisfied  on  the  evidence  before  us  that  his  paternal
    grandmother resident in Lafoole died in Somalia in 2014. This  was  the
    evidence of AH, and we have no reason to  doubt  her  evidence  on  the
    point. AH was not in Somalia at the time but we  accept  that  she  was
    told, and she  believes,  that  her  grandmother  died  at  that  time.
    Applying the lower standard of proof, and having  regard  to  the  life
    expectancy for women in Somalia, we accept that it is reasonably likely
    that this lady did indeed die in 2014.

81. We are satisfied on the  evidence  before  us  that  MAA's  mother  and
    siblings are now living in Kenya. This was the  understanding  of  both
    MAA and AH,  and  their  assertions  were  supported  by  corroborative
    evidence to which we are prepared to attach significant  weight.     We
    have before us a signed statement prepared  by  Rosemary  Kate  Jessop,
    MAA's solicitor at Brighton Housing Trust. Ms Jessop explains  that  on
    the 31st October 2019 she telephoned a number with a  Nairobi  dialling
    code and spoke, with the assistance of an interpreter, to a  woman  who
    identified herself as MAA's mother.   Although the line cut off on  the
    first few occasions Ms Jessop tried again and  on  the  fourth  attempt
    managed to speak to the lady for 42 minutes. The  statement  Ms  Jessop
    took is in the bundle.  The woman told her that she  and  her  children
    had fled Somalia and they were living in a house in Nairobi with  other
    Somalis and Muslims from the mosque.   She is unwell and  she  and  the
    children survive on the charity of others.  Ms Jessop asked  the  woman
    if she could provide some evidence that she and  the  children  are  in
    Kenya: she took some photographs and sent them. They show a lady  in  a
    burqa with a number of children. They have taken the picture  in  front
    of the sign for the children's school, and in front of the school  bus.
    In his oral evidence MAA identified the people pictured as  his  mother
    and siblings. We recognise that it is of  course  possible  that  MAA's
    mother travelled temporarily to Kenya in order to lie to Ms Jessop  and
    this Tribunal but we think it unlikely. There  are  a  huge  number  of
    Somali refugees living in Kenya and given that she is a female head  of
    a household we find it altogether more likely that she  has  left  that
    country, where she is - according to the  country  guidance  in  MOJ  -
    particularly vulnerable.

82. That leaves MAA's father.  It was  the  conclusion  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that he was not killed in 2013, and as we  explain  above,  we
    are not prepared to interfere  with  that  finding.    We  are  however
    prepared to accept,  on  the  lower  standard  of  proof,  that  it  is
    reasonably likely that he is not currently in Somalia. That is  because
    of the evidence about what he did after MAA left the country  in  2008.
    It was the wholly credible evidence of AH that at some  point  unknown,
    MAA's father abandoned his mother and married a second wife.  This  was
    not talked about or acknowledged within the family for  some  time.  AH
    told us that she was very shocked when she found out. The  second  wife
    started calling people in the family in approximately 2014 and  started
    asking  for  help  and  money  -  she  claimed  that  al-Shabaab   were
    threatening her.  As far as AH is aware this woman,  and  the  children
    she had with MAA's father, are all now in Uganda.   Evidence  of  their
    presence there has been produced in the form of  a  letter  dated  27th
    November 2014 from the Somali Embassy in Kampala and a Ugandan  refugee
    identity card.   On the basis of this evidence we  are  satisfied  that
    wherever MAA's father is, it is reasonably likely that  he  is  not  in
    Somalia, since both his wives and families are now living elsewhere.

83. We further accept on the lower standard of proof that  it  is  unlikely
    that any support will be forthcoming from  MAA's  father,  wherever  he
    might be. It is MAA's evidence that he had  a  very  poor  relationship
    with his father. When interviewed MAA informed Dr. Bell,  a  Consultant
    Psychiatrist, that his father beat him regularly as a  child  and  that
    they were in effect estranged. This appears to be borne out by the fact
    that as a teenager MAA stayed on his own in Mogadishu for three  years,
    and then made the journey to Europe, rather  than  reuniting  with  his
    family in Farhan, a journey that  may  have  been  difficult,  but  was
    evidently possible, given the information passed by travellers  between
    MAA's father there and his grandmother in Lafoole.

84. We are therefore prepared to accept, in light of the  above,  that  MAA
    has no close relatives to whom he could turn living in Mogadishu today.
     Mr Anderson is quite right to  say  that  he  may  have  more  distant
    relatives such as cousins or uncles in the city. To make such a finding
    would however  require  some  speculation  on  our  part,  and  we  are
    satisfied that it is reasonably likely that if any such individuals  do
    exist they would be unwilling to offer him any real support: as someone
    who has been living in the west for 13 years it is difficult to see why
    he would attract their sympathy and valuable resources.




      MAA's Life in the UK

85. MAA arrived in United Kingdom on  the  11th  April  2008  when  he  was
    sixteen years old.  He has never had any leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom. His asylum claim was refused in 2008; his appeal against  that
    decision was unattended, and subsequently dismissed.

86. In the first few years that he lived here MAA moved between  AH's  home
    and the care of the local authority. He found it difficult  to  settle,
    moving between Littlehampton and Worthing.  MAA  succinctly  summarises
    his slide into criminality like this:

         "I was initially looked after by  the  Social  Services  under  the
         leaving care provisions, but I lost their support and accommodation
         in 2011 and became homeless and had  no  support.  I  started  sofa
         surfing. I had fallen in with a bad  crowd,  and  started  behaving
         badly myself, first drinking alcohol and later taking drugs. When I
         arrived in the UK I had never had any alcohol and  when  I  started
         drinking I became dependent  on  it  and  could  not  live  without
         drugs....I did not have any money to buy them. The  dealers  who  I
         got my drugs from said that I could have drugs if I sold the  drugs
         for them and gave them money for the drugs and so this  is  what  I
         did...."

87. He received his first conviction, for  selling  cannabis,  in  November
    2011. A number of other minor convictions  followed  before  the  index
    offence of possession of a Class A drug with intent to  supply  led  to
    the sentence of 4 years, handed down at Chichester Crown Court  on  the
    19th April 2014.  MAA served  24  months[15].  Although  he  admits  to
    having tried Spice in prison he states that he has been clean since the
    beginning of 2015. He worked in the prison's education  department  and
    claims to have undertaken  some  courses,  although  he  has  lost  the
    certificates.    Since  his  release  he  has  complied  with  all  his
    probation requirements and his licence ended in May 2018: he  has  been
    assessed as being at a low risk of reoffending. He currently spends his
    time volunteering for a Somali community group in Brixton.  He has been
    supported by AH but since the pandemic started she has lost her job  in
    accountancy and is finding it difficult to give him what she once did.

88. Having had regard to the probation materials  and  MAA's  circumstances
    the First-tier Tribunal was satisfied that he presented a low  risk  of
    reoffending and accordingly found MAA to have rebutted the  presumption
    in s72 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that he is a danger
    to the community. That finding is  unchallenged  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.



    The Medical Evidence

89. MAA relies on the expert assessment of two mental health professionals.
    We have been provided with a report by Consultant Forensic Psychologist
    Dr Lisa Davies, dated 20th September 2019, and a report  by  Consultant
    Psychiatrist Dr DL Bell dated 8th March 2021.  We  are  satisfied  that
    both Dr Davies and Dr Bell are suitably qualified to give  evidence  in
    this capacity. We note Mr Anderson's objections to the  late  admission
    of Dr Bell's evidence, which was not filed and  served  until  the  day
    before the hearing.  We recognise that this was contrary to directions,
    but in view of the potential significance of  such  evidence,  and  the
    fact that Mr Anderson  was  able  to  produce  a  cogent  supplementary
    skeleton addressing it, we do not consider that the Secretary of  State
    was so disadvantaged that it would  in  the  interests  of  justice  to
    exclude it.

90. In 2019 Dr Davies met with MAA for two and half hours  and  interviewed
    him with the  assistance  of  a  Somali  interpreter.   Her  report  is
    primarily concerned with whether he presented a risk of reoffending: it
    was relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal to rebut the presumption
    that MAA is a danger to the community. Dr Davies does however make some
    findings of potential relevance to the assessment which  we  must  make
    today, in respect of MAA's circumstances upon return to Somalia. It was
    not Dr Davies' view that MAA was suffering from Post- Traumatic  Stress
    Disorder or depression, but she acknowledged that at some points he had
    experienced symptoms associated with both, for instance in 2015 when he
    witnessed the suicide of a peer in prison. MAA reported  to  Dr  Davies
    that even in these periods he had  not  sought  medical  help  but  had
    rather managed his symptoms himself by actively socialising and playing
    football.  Dr  Davies  found  no  indications  of  maladaptive   coping
    strategies being used to manage the stress MAA faced as a result of his
    proposed deportation.  There was at the  time  that  she  prepared  her
    report no evidence of suicidal ideation, nor past engagement in suicide
    attempts or self-harm, but she did conclude that the  risk  of  suicide
    "could increase if  deported",  given  his  reported  past  history  of
    depressed mood. Dr Davies concluded:

         "Deportation would likely result in an exacerbation of symptoms  of
         depression and trauma should he be exposed to further conflict  and
         the separation from current supportive relationships  would  likely
         render him vulnerable to exploitation in his future and  a  relapse
         of drug and alcohol abuse".

91. This year, very shortly before the hearing, MAA was interviewed  online
    by Dr Bell.  He observed MAA to be clean and appropriately dressed, and
    that he did not appear to be  obviously  psychiatrically  unwell.   The
    history presented to Dr Bell by MAA was that as a young  child  he  was
    regularly beaten by his father, with whom  he  did  not  enjoy  a  good
    relationship; thereafter he witnessed many  traumatic  scenes  such  as
    seeing dead bodies in the street and people  being  killed  or  injured
    around him. He was separated from his family and after his  arrival  in
    this country ended up abusing drugs. He then spent time in prison.

92. MAA explained to Dr Bell that he feels depressed  and  ruminates  about
    his current predicament: he is unable to work, his future is uncertain,
    and he is filled with feelings of  guilt  and  remorse.   He  tries  to
    prevent these feelings overwhelming him but sometimes he becomes filled
    with rage, and when he is very low he cries.  Dr Bell records:

         "he does suffer suicidal ideation wishing he were dead or would not
         wake, although he has never acted upon this,  that  is  there  have
         been no suicide attempts. It is clear that he  feels  protected  by
         his religion beliefs, being a Muslim he believes it to be a sin  to
         kill himself"

93. MAA told Dr Bell that he has difficulty sleeping, and that sometimes he
    stays in the same clothes for days without  washing.  Dr  Bell  thought
    this to be a "very significant degree of self-neglect".   MAA  reported
    suffering from nightmares once or twice per week,  and  explained  that
    sometimes the dream continues even after he has woken. Dr  Bell  states
    this to be typical of traumatic dreams. MAA  said  that  his  days  are
    unstructured, and his appetite  is  poor;  he  spends  his  days  in  a
    "profoundly apathetic listless state" and suffers from a high degree of
    social isolation. Dr Bell records that  before  the  pandemic  MAA  did
    however play football, went to restaurants with  friends  and  attended
    mosque.  He feels supported by his friends and although he has not been
    able to see them over lockdown he has regular  contact  through  social
    media chatgroups.  MAA reported being much more disturbed by  phenomena
    of paranoia, flashbacks and noise sensitivity prior to 2018.

94. Having had regard to the answers given to him by MAA, Dr Bell concludes
    that he is suffering from Depressive Disorder in partial remission, and
    that he also shows typical features  of  PTSD,  although  he  does  not
    currently meet the full diagnostic criteria for this condition: Dr Bell
    explains that it is common for traumatised  states  to  eventuate  into
    depressive disorder.  Dr Bell writes:

         "It is highly likely that the support provided to him by his cousin
         and his network of friends, particularly those with whom  he  plays
         football, has been  of  great  importance  in  terms  of  providing
         emotional and social support. Disorders such as these  are  however
         highly context dependent. Any disruption  to  the  current  context
         will result in a relapse into a more disturbed  psychiatric  state,
         similar to that which he has encountered previously...

         The prognosis for [MAA] is entirely dependent on the outcome of the
         immigration proceedings...In the event that a decision is  made  to
         return him  to  Somalia  there  will  be  a  deterioration  in  his
         psychiatric state..."

95. Dr Bell  notes  that  although  MAA  does  not  currently  receive  any
    treatment in  this  country,  given  the  stability  of  a  regularised
    immigration status his capacity for  further  rehabilitation  would  be
    improved. By contrast Dr Bell believes that  if  returned  to  Somalia,
    there will "in all likelihood be a deterioration in his mental  state".
    Dr Bell bases this prognosis on the following factors:

              i) Any separation from AH and current friends "will  re-ignite
                 in his mind the  major  trauma  he  suffered  when  he  was
                 suddenly separated from his family as a teenager"

             ii) He will have no familiarity with Somalia, nor any  familial
                 or social support of any kind. This will constitute a major
                 external stressor leading to a further deterioration in his
                 mental state. "He is likely to become extremely  vulnerable
                 to exploitation by others"

            iii) Returning to the scene of traumatic events will mean he  is
                 "very likely to break down" and end up self-medicating with
                 drugs and alcohol.

96. Mr Anderson has made some cogent criticisms of this  medical  evidence,
    in particular the evidence of Dr Bell. The Secretary of State  asks  us
    to note that Dr Bell does not appear to have had access to all  of  the
    relevant  documentation,  and  that  he   proceeded  on  the  basis  of
    assertions that have  in  fact  been  rejected  by  the  Tribunal,  for
    instance the claim that MAA's father was murdered  by  Al-Shabaab.   Dr
    Bell concludes that MAA  is  socially  isolated  and  is  exhibiting  a
    "significant degree of  self-neglect"  without  exploring  whether  not
    seeing people and not getting dressed for days on  end  may  simply  be
    related to the Covid-19 lockdown: in the context of the pandemic  those
    reported behaviours are not at all unusual. They are to  be  contrasted
    with Dr Davies' observations that pre-pandemic MAA had an active social
    life, regularly playing football, going to caf�s etc. Dr  Bell  himself
    observed MAA to be cleanly dressed, and did not consider him to display
    any outward  signs  of  mental  illness,  and  recorded  that  MAA  has
    continued to have regular social contact with his friends in accordance
    with public health regulations.

97. We consider much of this criticism of Dr  Bell's  report  to  be  well-
    founded.  We do not however find much to turn on  it.  It  is  accepted
    that MAA grew up in Mogadishu during a period in which street to street
    fighting, shelling and inter-clan violence was  still  commonplace.  He
    made the journey to this country on his own whilst only 16, and  it  is
    not contested that he ended up using drugs and in prison, exposing  him
    to the extreme violence of the narcotics industry.   On those facts  we
    find it to be unremarkable that he suffers some mental health  sequalae
    from those successive challenges.  Since his release from prison he has
    had the threat of deportation hanging over him. He reports being filled
    with remorse and regret, and  feels  despondent  about  his  situation.
    Again, none of that is surprising and we see no reason to  reject  that
    evidence.  Both Dr Bell and Dr Davies believe that  MAA's  symptoms  of
    depression are likely to worsen should  he  actually  be  deported.  We
    accept, at least in the short term, that this is likely to be true.  He
    has his cousin in this country who supports him, and a good  number  of
    friends. He is actively involved in the Somali community and has spoken
    of valuing the guidance he receives from the elders.  We  fully  accept
    that an involuntary dislocation from  all  of  that  is  likely  to  be
    emotionally difficult, and that MAA will likely experience an  increase
    in his symptoms of depression.

98. We are not however persuaded that such a deterioration  will  have  any
    significant impact on the decision that we need to make. First we  note
    that no issue arises in respect of the lack of  treatment  in  Somalia,
    for the simple reason that MAA has  not  received  treatment  here.  Dr
    Davies notes that at the very height of his trauma - in  the  aftermath
    of witnessing a suicide - MAA was able to deal with it on  his  own  by
    socialising and playing football.  Dr Davies opines that a worsening in
    MAA's  mental  health   will   "likely   render   him   vulnerable   to
    exploitation... and a relapse of drug and alcohol abuse", a  view  with
    which Dr Bell concurs.  We are unclear about the circumstances in which
    it is feared that this might arise. We note that in the years since  he
    was sent to prison MAA has shown admirable strength in recovering  from
    what he regarded as  a  drug  addiction.  Despite  the  very  difficult
    circumstances that he currently  finds  himself  in  he  has  made  the
    conscious  decision  to  avoid  'the  wrong  crowd'  and  any   further
    involvement in either drugs or alcohol.     We  further  note  that  Dr
    Bell bases his conclusions in this regard  at  least  in  part  on  the
    assumption that MAA will have  no  familiarity  with  Somalia:  on  the
    facts, this is simply incorrect. MAA lived in Somalia until he was  16,
    for approximately three of those years independently from  his  family.
    He has retained cultural connections through regular contact  with  the
    Somali community in this country.  The suggestion that he would somehow
    be a 'fish out of water' is therefore unfounded.




    The Country Background

99. We are bound to apply the country guidance of MOJ,  and  neither  party
    asked us to depart from it. We were nevertheless provided  with  almost
    2500 pages of additional country background evidence.  Whilst  we  have
    looked at all of that material we do not intend to summarise it in  our
    analysis below. We shall only refer to  additional  material  where  it
    either specifically addresses the issues in this appeal  -  as  in  the
    helpful expert evidence of Ms Mary Harper, BBC Africa Correspondent[16]
    - or where it post-dates MOJ and materially adds to  what  is  said  in
    that decision.




    Analysis and Findings

100. MAA is a foreign criminal as defined by s32 of the  Borders  Act  2007.
    This means that the public interest requires his automatic deportation,
    unless he can bring himself within one of the 'exceptions' set  out  in
    s33.   MAA contends that he can bring himself within 'exception  1'  as
    set out at s33(2)(a) of the 2007  Act:  he  seeks  to  prove  that  his
    deportation would breach his rights under the  ECHR.   Specifically  he
    contends that he faces a real risk of enduring  inhuman  and  degrading
    treatment such that would violate Article 3 ECHR and/or that there  are
    "very compelling circumstances" such that his deportation  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with his Article 8(1) rights.

101. Because MAA raises protection grounds, through the prism of Article  3,
    we frame our assessment using the country guidance extant at  the  date
    of hearing, MOJ.  We begin by considering whether MAA faces a real risk
    of actual physical violence, before going on to assess  whether  it  is
    reasonably likely that he will find himself  living  in  conditions  of
    such dire poverty such that he would  face  "intense  suffering"  or  a
    significant reduction in his life expectancy.



    Violence

102. Generally, a person who is an ordinary citizen returning  to  Mogadishu
    will face no real risk of serious harm such as to engage Article  3  of
    Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.    In  MOJ  the  Tribunal
    specifically considered the risks pertaining to returnees, and rejected
    the contention that this class of person faces  any  enhanced  risk  of
    targeting by groups such as al-Shabaab for that reason alone.  Although
    al-Shabaab continue to pursue a strategy of "asymmetrical  warfare"  by
    the use of terrorist attacks in the city, the Tribunal in MOJ held that
    civilians can mitigate any risk by avoiding  areas  and  establishments
    that are clearly identifiable as likely targets.

103. MAA has been out of Somalia for 13 years. We accept  that  during  that
    time a lot will have changed in Mogadishu and that to some extent, this
    will present MAA with a disadvantage.   However it is not  an  obstacle
    that will be  particularly  difficult  for  him  to  overcome.  As  the
    Tribunal observed in MOJ, avoiding the places that might be  vulnerable
    to terrorist attack is a matter of common sense, not specialist insider
    knowledge. MAA navigated the city when it was ravaged by open fighting:
    we infer that he therefore has the experience to understand that  today
    he should not, for instance, linger near an army  checkpoint  or  other
    location that might be a target.

104. MAA has been candid in his evidence that he  can  still  speak  Somali,
    and that he has ongoing involvement with the Somali  community  in  the
    UK. It cannot therefore be said  that  he  is  unfamiliar  with  Somali
    culture, or would  have  forgotten  'how  things  work'.   In  MOJ  the
    Tribunal rejected for lack of evidence the supposition that a  returnee
    might face a risk - from terrorists or  other  criminals  -  simply  by
    virtue of being someone who has lived in the West:   Mogadishu  has  in
    recent years attracted returnees from the diaspora on  a  large  scale,
    and that as a result many accents can be heard  on  the  streets,  from
    Geordie to Minnesotan. The evidence does not  establish  that  standing
    out as a former resident of the UK would cause MAA any problems.

105. In so finding we reject the submission of Mr Toal that there is a  real
    risk that MAA would be targeted for extortion  or  kidnap  by  criminal
    elements.  This was a matter specifically  addressed  in  MOJ  and  the
    scant evidence before us on the topic did not provide sufficient  basis
    upon which to depart from the conclusions in that case.  We were  taken
    to a 2019 article published by Cornell  University  Law  School[17]  in
    which the authors analysed reports of Bantu people forcibly returned to
    Somalia from the United States facing  kidnap  and  ransom  upon  their
    return. As the authors of that  study  acknowledge,  the  Bantu  are  a
    distinct group who have suffered particular racial  discrimination  and
    marginalisation  within  Somalia.  As  such   they   are   particularly
    vulnerable, not just to attack, but to the state's failure  to  protect
    them. MAA is not Bantu, and  this  evidence  is  of  no  assistance  in
    establishing that he would face a similar level of risk.

106. In  her  reports  Ms  Harper  expresses  her  own  concerns  about  the
    potential risks to MAA's personal security upon return to Somalia.  She
    states that he "may" encounter problems at the airport  if  he  appears
    "jittery". We are unclear as to why MAA might appear  jittery  or  what
    problems he might encounter. Whilst we understand  being  an  obviously
    non-Somali woman at the airport is probably  a  challenging  experience
    for Ms Harper, we are unable to understand why MAA might  draw  adverse
    attention to himself in this way.   Second she suggests that  having  a
    criminal conviction for drug dealing is a matter which  could  lead  to
    MAA facing social stigma or rejection. Even if we  accept  Ms  Harper's
    expert  assessment  that  Somalis  are   "extraordinary   gossips   and
    communicators" who know each other's business, we have found  that  MAA
    knows no-one in the city. In those circumstances it is  not  reasonably
    likely that anyone would come to know that he has criminal  convictions
    in the UK. We further note the conclusions in MOJ [at �200] that  there
    is no real evidence of such returnees being shunned.

107. For the sake of completeness we note that the Tribunal in MOJ  rejected
    the suggestion  that  returnees  would  face  a  real  risk  of  forced
    recruitment to terrorist groups and nothing in the evidence  before  us
    leads us to depart from that finding.

108. Having considered all of those matters, we are satisfied that there  is
    no real risk of MAA being targeted by violence  or  criminality  simply
    because he is a returnee. We do accept that discrete risks may arise if
    he finds himself living in insecure living arrangements and  we  return
    to this matter below.




    Living Conditions

109. In MOJ the Tribunal heard evidence that there is a  broad  spectrum  of
    circumstances in which people live in Mogadishu.  At  one  extreme  the
    wealthy live in gated compounds guarded by armed security personnel. At
    the  other  are  the  dispossessed  who  live  in  makeshift  dwellings
    described by Mary Harper as "igloos", "made of sticks, cloth,  plastic,
    metal. Not tents. Dwellings. Crammed  into  patches  of  spare  ground,
    closely together. Inside there is just sand or cardboard or plastic  on
    the ground". The Tribunal  accepted  that  life  in  such  a  structure
    amounted to destitution [�182]  and  could  properly  be  described  as
    "appalling" [�411].  Where an individual returnee was likely to end  up
    depended on a number  of  factors,  including  whether  he  had  family
    connections, was in receipt of remittances or another source of income,
    and whether he was able to  work  to  support  himself.   The  Tribunal
    concluded, although it was  not  given  evidence  on  the  point,  that
    logically there must also be types of dwellings  falling  somewhere  in
    the middle of this spectrum.

110.  Nothing in the evidence before us indicated  that  this  spectrum,  or
    the circumstances at its polar extremes, had materially changed.

111. In her two reports Ms Mary Harper confirms that  she  has  visited  IDP
    camps in and around Mogadishu on several occasions since she  gave  her
    evidence in MOJ.  She  describes  the  conditions  as  "shocking"  even
    compared to other refugee camps elsewhere  in  Africa:  "conditions  in
    most camps are desperate, with inadequate  flimsy  shelters  made  from
    twigs, cloth and plastic, limited  food,  water  and  sanitation".   In
    February 2021, Ms Harper received information from an employee  of  the
    UN Office for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  who  works
    directly with IDPs in Mogadishu. He describes conditions in  the  camps
    as "dire, very dire". Before us Mr Toal made extensive argument about a
    further  challenge faced by residents of IDP camps:  predation  by  the
    'Gatekeepers', which ranges from the diversion of  funds  to  rape  and
    beatings, as outlined in the Human Rights Watch report cited at �470 of
    MOJ.

112. Ms Harper reports that for those dispossessed who are  unable  to  gain
    entry to a camp  an  alternative  living  arrangement  is  to  take  up
    residence on the streets or by squatting  an  abandoned  building.  She
    explains that such an arrangement is extremely precarious,  not  simply
    because of the likely poor quality of the shelter, but because  of  the
    substantial rise in the number of  evictions  occurring  in  the  city.
    Evictions were certainly a feature of the evidence before the  Tribunal
    in MOJ, being reported as a routine hazard  by  organisations  such  as
    UNHCR and Amnesty International,  but having had regard to the evidence
    before us, we accept Mr Toal's submission  that  they  appear  to  have
    increased exponentially in the  intervening  years  in  line  with  the
    rapidly increasing demand for land.    Today  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepts that forced evictions are a serious problem  in  Mogadishu.  In
    the November 2020 Country Policy and Information  Note  Somalia  (South
    and Central): Security and humanitarian situation the joint  report  of
    various NGOs is cited as follows:[18]

          'Forced evictions are a huge threat to Mogadishu's IDPs and  urban
         poor. Benadir is the most affected by evictions: in  2019  so  far,
         there have been 95,004 evictions in the region.... Most are forced,
         with only very few lawful evictions  or  evictions  with  dignified
         relocations. In most cases, evictions are  enforced  by  a  private
         citizen from his or her property in order to  develop  their  land,
         where, as often happens, the  residents  had  no  formal  (written)
         agreement in place with the landlord.'

113. This concern, of eviction  from  private  land  by  landlords  keen  to
    develop it, is echoed in much of the material  produced  on  behalf  of
    MAA.  These reports are concerned not just with 'igloo' dwellers  being
    pushed off a patch of  open  land,  but  squatters  being  forced  from
    buildings, often damaged or abandoned, where they have made their home,
    sometimes for extended periods of time; there have also been  instances
    in which informal camps have been cleared. As in MOJ, the large  influx
    of people moving into the city is  identified  as  a  driver  of  these
    evictions, with property prices  having  risen  to  meet  demand.   One
    aspect of the evidence before us that did not appear to feature in  MOJ
    was alleged government complicity in these evictions. The CPIN cites  a
    report by Refugees International (December 2019) to the effect that the
    "greatest fear" of insecure communities is that  the  "government  will
    take their land" [�3.10.2]. As  Mr  Toal  stressed,  there  is  now  in
    addition some evidence of police, soldiers and/or government-affiliated
    militias assisting in private evictions:

         "The breakneck pace of urbanization has led to price increases  and
         growing competition for property, against the backdrop  of  a  weak
         institutional framework. Given that they can  frequently  act  with
         impunity, landlords are known to employ armed men (including police
         officers acting in a private capacity)  and  forced  evictions  are
         common"

    [International Institute for Strategic Studies, May 2020].

114. The evidence before us indicated that for many people living  in  these
    precarious circumstances access to food remains a regular  concern,  as
    it was at the time of MOJ.  The Tribunal then found food insecurity  to
    be a fact of life for many people in Somalia: it was taken to  evidence
    [at �281] that the number of individuals in this category could  be  as
    high as 870,000, and that a further 2.3 million were  classed  as  food
    "stressed".

115. Having had regard to all of this evidence we accept without  hesitation
    that there are many people in Mogadishu living in conditions  that  can
    properly be described as inhuman and degrading. If you are  a  resident
    of a poorly equipped and run camp,  where food supplies are  short  and
    you are at the mercy of exploitative Gatekeepers who  take  the  meagre
    aid intended  for  you  for  themselves,  you  risk  facing  daily  the
    physical and mental harms of hunger, heat, cold, disease and  violence.
    So too are the 'igloo' dwellers,  perching  precariously  on  illegally
    squatted land in the city, potentially exposed to such conditions. They
    now contend with the ever present threat of eviction:  the dispossessed
    being further dispossessed.   We can accept that even if an eviction is
    conducted in a calm and non-violent manner, it is  still  a  profoundly
    challenging life event if you have  nowhere  else  to  go.   Where  the
    evictions occur without warning, and without mercy, armed  men  turning
    up without notice to force residents out, it is likely to be  extremely
    frightening and we accept that it is likely to have a 'knock-on' effect
    on the individual's ability  to  continue  working,  or  receive  basic
    humanitarian  supplies  or  other  services  such   as   education   or
    healthcare.  If your only option is  to  squat  in  another  -  equally
    insecure - pitch there is  certainly  the  potential  for  inhuman  and
    degrading circumstances to arise. As Baroness Hale  explained  in  Adan
    Limbuela and Tesema whether the high threshold is reached  will  depend
    on the individual concerned, the overall circumstances in which  he  or
    she finds himself, and crucially whether there is any  hope  of  escape
    from that predicament:

         "It might be possible to endure rooflessness for some time  without
         degradation if one had enough to eat and somewhere to wash  oneself
         and one's clothing. It might be possible to endure cashlessness for
         some time if one had a roof and basic meals and hygiene  facilities
         provided. But to have to endure the indefinite  prospect  of  both,
         unless one is in a place where it is both  possible  and  legal  to
         live  off  the  land,  is  in  today's  society  both  inhuman  and
         degrading".

116. Whilst the House of Lords was there considering the position of  asylum
    seekers under the  care  of  the  British  state,  and  so  applying  a
    different threshold, the point is a good one.  Hopelessless  undermines
    dignity, wherever you are.  Sustained and extreme  deprivation  is,  we
    think uncontroversially, a material  condition  likely  to  lead  to  a
    "significant reduction in life expectancy".   Even  the  strongest  and
    most resilient individual  can  experience  "intense  suffering"  where
    conditions are bad enough.

117. We therefore accept that it is certainly possible that a returnee  from
    the UK to Somalia may face a real risk of  enduring  living  conditions
    which would  cumulatively  amount  to  serious  harm  contrary  to  our
    obligations under Article 3.  To determine whether that  is  reasonably
    likely to be the fate of MAA, we return to the analysis in MOJ.

118. The country guidance is that a person returning to  Mogadishu  after  a
    period of absence will look to his nuclear family, if he has one living
    in the city, for assistance in re-establishing himself and  securing  a
    livelihood. We accept that it is reasonably  likely  that  MAA  has  no
    nuclear family remaining in Mogadishu, and no other relatives  to  whom
    he could turn. We cannot know whether MAA will receive support from his
    clan, for the simple reason that we do not know what clan he  is  from.
    We therefore proceed on the assumption that he will  not  be  receiving
    any support from clan members. Having had regard to the totality of the
    evidence presented on this point in MOJ  we  accept  that  the  nuclear
    family has become the primary support mechanism in Somali  society  and
    that the relevance of clan membership has diminished. MAA is a returnee
    who has been in the West some 13 years.  We  consider  it  unlikely  in
    those circumstances that he would be offered material support by anyone
    simply by virtue of shared lineage.

119. We therefore need to make a careful assessment of MAA's  circumstances.
    In MOJ the Tribunal identified the relevant considerations to include:

            . circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

            . length of absence from Mogadishu;

            . family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

            . access to financial resources;

            . prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
              or self employment;

            . availability of remittances from abroad;

            . means of support during the

            . time spent in the United Kingdom;

            . why his ability to fund the journey  to  the  West  no  longer
              enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.

120. We accept that MAA is likely to face  considerable  difficulties  in  a
    number of respects.  We  have  already  acknowledged  that  he  has  no
    relatives or clan associations that he could call upon in the city.  He
    has been away a long time and as such may not  even  have  any  friends
    left there, for instance we do not know what  might  have  happened  to
    Abdi and his brothers.   We accept that it is  reasonably  likely  that
    MAA will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad. AH has done what
    she can for him, but having recently lost her job is not in a  position
    to carry on funding him.  MAA's remaining family members are living  as
    refugees in neighbouring countries and we see no reason to reject their
    evidence that they are living in impoverished circumstances themselves.
     Mr Anderson asked us to note that at the time of his  departure  MAA's
    grandmother had managed to sell enough cows to fund a $10,000  one  way
    trip: applying the guidance in MOJ he asked us to find  that  a  family
    with that kind of resource is likely to  still  have  it.  We  are  not
    prepared to make that finding. We  have  already  accepted  that  MAA's
    grandmother has since died. We have no means of knowing  what  happened
    to her herd of cattle, nor indeed any other  property  she  might  have
    had. She apparently had many grandchildren, and a family who have  been
    dispersed  both  within  Somalia  and  internationally.  We   find   it
    impossible, in those circumstances, to draw any certain  conclusion  on
    what might have happened to her estate. We  can  however  be  satisfied
    that it is at least reasonably likely that  MAA  will  not  derive  any
    material benefit from his deceased grandmother's estate today.

121. We note that before us there was some debate about whether  MAA  would,
    upon departure, qualify for any kind of payment from the UK  government
    or other body. The Secretary  of  State  submitted  that  he  would  be
    entitled to a payment of �750 under the Facilitated Returns Scheme,  so
    long as he signed a disclaimer confirming that he  had  no  outstanding
    submissions or claim: he may in  addition  be  entitled  to  a  further
    discretionary payment of �500. These payments  would  be  made  on  the
    point of departure, and are paid in cash.

122. We have had regard to the Secretary of  State's  published  policy  The
    Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS) (Version 8.0, 3rd  October  2016).  The
    introduction explains that it  exists  to  "promote  and  assist  early
    removals by encouraging full compliance and cooperation  from  eligible
    foreign national offenders (FNOs) willing to return to their country of
    origin voluntarily".    The payment is intended to assist deportees  in
    reintegrating in their countries of origin, and the  document  suggests
    that the money could be used  for  things  such  as  setting  up  small
    businesses etc. It would therefore obviously be of  some  relevance  to
    the decision we need to make in this case. Further reading reveals that
    the policy, and the FRS, will however be of no  assistance  at  all  to
    MAA.  Contrary to the Secretary of State's submission it  appears  from
    the policy that MAA would be expressly excluded from the scheme,  since
    he received a sentence of more than four years:

         Applicants ineligible for FRS

         Certain categories of  foreign  national  offender  (FNO)  are  not
         within the scope of the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS) and if they
         apply will be rejected. These are where the applicant:

          . was given a custodial sentence of 4 years or more

          . was given a custodial  sentence  of  under  4years  but  for  an
         offence listed at 'Convictions for serious offences' below

         . committed their  first  criminal  offence  within  12  months  of
         arrival in the UK

         . has pursued an immigration appeal beyond the first-tier  tribunal
         or its earlier equivalents in the past

123. We therefore proceed on the basis that MAA will be returned to  Somalia
    without the benefit of any grant under the scheme.    It is unclear why
    the Secretary of State made submissions  to  the  contrary,  given  the
    clear terms in which the policy is expressed.

124. We  further  note  that  Ms  Harper's  respondents  appear  unanimously
    pessimistic about the likelihood of MAA obtaining any kind  of  regular
    humanitarian relief once he lands  in  Somalia.   Successive  stressors
    currently faced by the aid community mean that basic supplies, and  the
    means to distribute them, are under severe pressure.   One  NGO  worker
    she spoke to in November 2020 said that for a lone male like  MAA  "the
    likelihood of him getting NGO support is zero":  what  resources  there
    are would be given to the most vulnerable first, for instance the sick,
    children, women or the elderly.

125. We are therefore satisfied that MAA will, when it comes to  income,  be
    on his own.  It is reasonably likely  that  he  will  find  himself  in
    Mogadishu with no 'return grant', no contacts, no access to remittances
    or NGO aid.  The ultimate question posed by MOJ is however  whether  it
    is reasonably likely that MAA, an able bodied young man unencumbered by
    dependents, will be unable to fend for himself by obtaining employment.



126. In MOJ the Tribunal found that Mogadishu was  undergoing  an  "economic
    boom" and that  there  are  considerable  opportunities  in  the  city,
    particularly for returnees, who are taking jobs at the expense of those
    who had never been away. The country guidance on employment is set  out
    at �344-352 of MOJ.   There the Tribunal describe the post-war economic
    revival of Mogadishu as "remarkable":

         345. It is beyond doubt that there has been huge inward investment,
         large-scale construction projects and  vibrant  business  activity.
         Land values are said to be "rocketing" and entrepreneurial  members
         of the diaspora with access to funding are returning in significant
         numbers  in  the  confident  expectation  of  launching  successful
         business projects. The question to be addressed is  what,  if  any,
         benefit does this deliver for so called  "ordinary  returnees"  who
         are  not  themselves  wealthy   businessmen   or   highly   skilled
         professionals employed by such people.

127. In answer to its own question  the  Tribunal  rejected  the  suggestion
    that it was only a tiny elite who might benefit from the economic boom.
    In the period leading up to the appeal in MOJ huge  numbers  of  people
    had  returned  to  the  city;  the  Tribunal  heard  evidence  about  a
    resurgence of the hospitality industry as well as taxi businesses,  bus
    services, drycleaners, electronics stores and so on:

         349......The  evidence  speaks   of   construction   projects   and
         improvements in the city's infrastructure such as the  installation
         of some solar powered street lighting. It does not,  perhaps,  need
         much in the way of direct evidence to conclude that  jobs  such  as
         working as building labourers, waiters or drivers or assistants  in
         retail outlets are unlikely to be filled by the tiny minority  that
         represents "the elite".

128. As to the evidence to the effect that returnees from the West may  have
    an advantage in the job market:  "this  is  said  to  be  because  such
    returnees  are  likely  to  be  better  educated  and  considered  more
    resourceful and  therefore  more  attractive  as  potential  employees,
    especially where the employer himself or herself has returned from  the
    diaspora to invest in a new business" [�351].

129. Mr Toal asked us to  read  that  guidance  in  the  light  of  evidence
    showing that today, for young people in  particular,  the  unemployment
    rate  is  extremely  high.   An  August  2020  report  by  the  Finnish
    Immigration Service[19], based on a fact finding mission  conducted  in
    March of that year found that:

         "Mogadishu offers limited business  and  employment  opportunities.
         There is hardly any work on offer and the  best  jobs  are  usually
         taken. The labour market in Somalia is very narrow, as the  country
         has  no  industry  that  would  employ  a  significant  number   of
         people.... There are no precise statistics on unemployment, but the
         figure is estimated to be high. Youth unemployment  is  also  at  a
         high level"

130. The youth unemployment figures we were shown from sources  dated  2017-
    2021 varied, but averaged at a rate of about 65%. We note that  similar
    figures appeared in the evidence before the Tribunal in  MOJ  [see  for
    instance �287]. In fact the recent Finnish report  concurred  with  the
    conclusions in MOJ in two other respects. It  agreed  that  individuals
    coming from the diaspora have an advantage  in  the  jobs  market,  and
    found that the high rate of youth unemployment  notwithstanding,  there
    are particular sectors of the economy where work can be found:

         "Mogadishu's  lively  diaspora-funded  reconstruction  offers  work
         experience at building sites as a carrier,  for  instance.  However
         there is a lot of labour on offer and work  at  construction  sites
         does not pay much. Wages can be approximately US$100 per month.  In
         addition,  members  of  the  majority  population   have   negative
         attitudes towards construction work and do not want to do it. Those
         who work at building sites are usually members of marginal groups.

         The  port  of  Mogadishu  provides  some  job  opportunities.  Non-
         governmental organisations  and  the  Somali  government  have  few
         employees, security forces such as the police and military  provide
         slightly more jobs. Many people earn their living from small  scale
         sales at markets or  by  working  at  restaurants  and  tea  shops.
         However the job of a waitress is one of low esteem and most  people
         do not want to work as one"

131. Whilst we appreciate that low status,  or  physically  demanding,  jobs
    may not be attractive to a wide pool of  applicants,  it  appears  from
    this recent evidence that the position  remains  as  it  was  when  the
    Tribunal  heard  MOJ.    There  is  a  high   rate   of   unemployment,
    particularly for the young, but the diaspora-driven boom  of  the  past
    decade continues to provide work for those who are prepared to  do  it,
    particularly in  the  construction  and  hospitality  sectors.   It  is
    logical to assume that those who are rejecting such work do so  because
    they have other  income  to  fall  back  upon:  presumably  the  stigma
    attached to being a waiter is not so great  that  people  would  rather
    face destitution. This evidently leaves opportunities  for  those  like
    MAA, who do not have the support of extended family  or  clan  to  fall
    back upon, and who cannot afford to  have  such  misgivings  about  the
    'status' of such occupations.

132. The burden rests on MAA to demonstrate that  it  is  reasonably  likely
    that he will not  be  able  to  secure  a  livelihood  for  himself  in
    Mogadishu. On the evidence before us we are  not  satisfied  that  this
    burden has been discharged, even to the lower standard.   Having  heard
    his live evidence we concur with the view expressed, amongst others  by
    AH, that he is  a  socially  able  and  personable  man.  Although  his
    difficult  life  experiences  have  left  him  with  symptoms  of  both
    depression and trauma he has shown real fortitude in  addressing  these
    issues and  does  not  present  as  mentally  unwell.   He  is  clearly
    intelligent: he was top of his class whilst still  in  Somalia  and  in
    effect continued to study on a scholarship as a result.  He  has  shown
    resilience and willing. He has addressed his own mental  health  issues
    by exercise and socialising, and by utilising social media  during  the
    difficult, isolating days of the pandemic. We accept that he has worked
    hard to escape the pull of drug culture  and  rehabilitate  himself  by
    undertaking  education  courses  in  prison.   Even  in   his   current
    predicament he is continuing  to  seek  to  improve  his  situation  by
    volunteering with a Somali community group.

133. We have also placed considerable weight on the striking  fact  that  at
    the time that MAA left Somalia in 2008 he had been living independently
    of his family for between 2-3 years.   Despite being a  young  teenager
    at the time he was able to utilise social connections  (with  Abdi  and
    the twins), access education (he continued  to  attend  school  for  at
    least a year), and travel within Somalia to visit his  grandmother.  We
    do not underestimate how difficult these years were for MAA.  Mogadishu
    was at the time the scene of inter-clan violence and street  to  street
    fighting was still liable to erupt at any  time,  as  MAA  has  himself
    described.  He no doubt felt lonely and distressed that his family left
    him behind. And yet he managed not only to live and attend school,  but
    to organise, with the assistance of his grandmother, his own  departure
    from the country. We do not accept that as a grown man of 30 years  old
    MAA will somehow have lost the skills that enabled him  to  do  all  of
    that.

134. Today he returns as a mature adult with spoken English and Somali,  and
    a strong imperative to find employment.  Whilst we  see  no  reason  to
    reject the concurring medical evidence that MAA's mental health will be
    negatively impacted by his deportation, we are not satisfied that  this
    will prevent him from obtaining the work that he needs to  rebuild  his
    life.  Accordingly we are not satisfied that it  is  reasonably  likely
    that he will remain unemployed for long.

135. We accept, having had regard to the caselaw, the findings  in  MOJ  and
    the evidence before us, that  it  is  entirely  possible  that  someone
    returning to Somalia  from  the  UK  will  find  themselves  living  in
    conditions that are inhuman and degrading such that would place the  UK
    in breach of its obligations  under  Article  3.    Even  applying  the
    modified N test, the threshold is a high one, but on  the  evidence  of
    the situation faced by those living at the 'wrong end' of the spectrum,
    we are wholly satisfied that it could be made out.

136. On the facts in this particular case, however, it is not.  We  are  not
    satisfied that it is reasonably  likely  that  MAA  will  find  himself
    living in  inhuman  or  degrading  circumstances  such  that  his  life
    expectancy will be significant reduced,  or  that  he  will  experience
    intense suffering of the kind envisaged by the jurisprudence.  He  does
    not have family, nor the hope of remittances from abroad. He  will,  we
    accept,  find in difficult to readjust back to life  back  in  Somalia.
    He is nevertheless a fit and able  bodied  young  man  who  has  proved
    himself  capable  of  living  in  Mogadishu  in  far  more  challenging
    circumstances than those he faces today.  He will be able to find work,
    albeit that it may be of low quality or low status, and that work  will
    enable him to find and pay for accommodation somewhere in the middle of
    the spectrum identified in MOJ.    It may be  basic,  but  it  will  be
    secure. It  follows  that  we  need  not  consider  further  the  risks
    attendant with life at the 'lower end' of the spectrum that featured in
    so much of the evidence presented by Mr Toal.  He has the social skills
    and resilience to found a new private, and in due course a  new  family
    life, for himself.  We accordingly dismiss the appeal with reference to
    Article 3/ Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive.

137. Mr Toal made no discrete submissions on Article 8, save  to  point  out
    that failure under Article 3 would not  automatically  translate  to  a
    failure under Article 8, applying the test set out at s117C(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. We accept,  as  does  the
    Secretary of State, that  this  must  be  right.  If  "very  compelling
    circumstances" was a benchmark intended to be equated with  Article  3,
    the Act would have said so. It is nevertheless a  very  exacting  test,
    which on the facts before us is not made out.

138. We have found that upon  return  to  Somalia  MAA  is  likely  to  face
    considerable difficulties. They are not however difficulties  which  he
    will be unable to overcome. He will be able to find work,  and  a  roof
    over his head, and in time he will start to make  his  own  connections
    and build a private life. The evidence indicates that he  will  face  a
    deterioration in his mental health, and we see nothing controversial in
    that - he has  however  faced  such  a  deterioration  before,  and  as
    detailed by Dr Davies, has managed to overcome it. We would accept that
    MAA has built a private life for himself in this country and that he is
    socially and culturally integrated here. He has friends, his cousin and
    is active in his community.  He has managed to build this,  what  might
    be termed his 'legitimate' private life, apart from and  in  spite  of,
    his previous association with criminals.  It is to his credit  that  he
    has done  so.   It  is  nevertheless  a  private  life  that  has  been
    established at a time when he had no status, and as such it is one that
    attracts only a little weight in the balancing exercise. We have  taken
    into account his young age on arrival, and the fact that he has faced a
    series of very difficult life events.   We have no reason to doubt  the
    assessment  of  the  probation  service,  accepted  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that he presents a low risk of reoffending. We  have  weighed
    all of these matters cumulatively against the strong public interest in
    deporting serious criminals. Having done so we are satisfied  that  MAA
    has not established that there are  very  compelling  circumstances  in
    this  case,  or  that  his  deportation  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with his Article 8(1) rights. The  appeal  is  accordingly
    dismissed on Article 8 grounds.

economic, social and cultural rights required protection too, the immediate
need was for a short, non-confrontational text which governments could
accept at once, while the tide for human rights was strong"
