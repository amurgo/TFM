Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr H Kannangara, Counsel, instructed via Direct
Access
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This appeal has  a  somewhat  lengthy  and  complicated  history.   The
    application which was refused and which gave rise to the appeal process
    involved the application by this appellant for further leave to  remain
    in this country as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  The  decision  which  is  in
    issue was made as long ago as 30 September 2014.

2.   Her appeal was dismissed by a First-tier Judge in a decision  given  on
    29 April 2015 and there were three matters which the  First-tier  Judge
    relied on to justify the dismissal, namely first that the appellant had
    failed to demonstrate that she and her business partner  had  available
    as funds �50,000.

3.   Secondly it was said that she did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    relevant Rule, which I shall obviously come to in due course,  relating
    to evidence of marketing and trading and thirdly  that  she  could  not
    meet the maintenance requirements in paragraph 1A, Appendix C.  So  far
    as that was concerned it has since been accepted both on appeal to this
    Tribunal and in the Court of  Appeal  that  that  particular  basis  of
    refusal was not made out and I need not go into it  in  any  detail  in
    this judgment.

4.   The decision of the First-tier Judge was appealed with  leave  and  the
    determination by Judge Smith was given  dismissing  the  appeal  on  14
    August 2015.  As I have said, she did  not  uphold  the  third  ground,
    namely the failure to meet maintenance requirements but she did  uphold
    the other grounds and she dismissed the appeal on the  basis  that  the
    error made  in  relation  to  the  third  ground  could  not  make  any
    difference because of the failures on the other two grounds.

5.   The case was taken to the Court of  Appeal  and  leave  to  appeal  was
    granted by the Court of Appeal in relation only to what was  Ground  3,
    namely that there been a failure to apply the flexibility policy  which
    in a sense supplemented the provisions of Rule 245AA of the Immigration
    Rules.

6.   Leave to appeal on specific grounds relating to the failure  to  comply
    with what I have called Grounds 1 and 2 was refused so that it  has  to
    be accepted that there was a failure to meet the specific  requirements
    of the Rules in relation to those issues.  The question is whether  the
    evidential flexibility policy ought to have been applied to enable  the
    failures to, as it were, be overlooked because  it  is  said  that  the
    necessary information was available and any gaps  could  properly  have
    been filled.

7.   The basis upon which permission was granted was  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in Mandalia v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2015] 1 WLR 4546.  In introducing that case Lord Wilson, who gave  the
    judgment, with which all the other members of the court  agreed,  cited
    observations of Lord Justice Jackson that the Rules  relating  to  what
    has been called the points-based system in Part 6A  of  the  Rules  had
    achieved a degree of complexity which even the Byzantine emperors would
    have envied and the point is made that it is exceedingly difficult  for
    anyone, particularly if they do not have English as a  first  language,
    to navigate their way  around  the  requirements  because  the  purpose
    behind what has been described sometimes as a tick box approach  is  to
    enable those who are responsible for applying the Rules to be  able  to
    make decisions. It is  considered  undesirable  to  leave  an  area  of
    discretion because that  makes  it  very  difficult  for  those  making
    applications to know whether they do or do not have a good  claim  that
    can be made and the purpose of the Rules is to set out in  detail  what
    information is required and, what is of particular  importance  in  the
    context of these sorts  of  applications,  the  manner  in  which  that
    information  has  to  be  given  because  particular  documentation  or
    particular forms of documentation are required in many instances.

8.   The requirements which are material  in  this  case  are  contained  in
    Appendix A to the Rules and I have helpfully  been  provided  with  the
    necessary provisions.  Table 4(c) deals with applications for leave  to
    remain which include the application in relation  to  this  application
    and the requirement is that the applicant has access to not  less  than
    �50,000.

9.   There is no issue about the other requirements in (c), and in  (d)(iii)
    it is required that since before 11 July 2014 and up to the date of the
    application the applicant had been  continuously  engaged  in  business
    activity which was not, or did not amount to, activity  pursuant  to  a
    contract of service with a business other than his own,  and  in  (iv),
    which again for the purpose of this case is  material,  it  has  to  be
    established that since before 11 July 2014 and up to the  date  of  the
    application had continuously been working in an  occupation  which  was
    specified and,  working  meant  the  core  service  that  the  business
    provided to its customers or clients involves the business delivering a
    service in  an  occupation  at  the  relevant  level,  and  again,  the
    important point there is access to �50,000.

10.  In 41 it is provided that the applicant would  only  be  considered  to
    have access to funds if the specified documents in paragraph 41-SD were
    provided to show cash money to the amount required (this must not be in
    the form of assets), and  it  was  required  that  the  money  remained
    available to the applicant until such time as  it  was  spent  for  the
    purposes of the business or businesses.

11.  And then we come to 41-SD and what is required in 41-SD(c) is that  the
    specified documents must show evidence  of  the  funding  available  to
    invest, whether from the applicant's own funds  or  from  one  or  more
    third parties and for money held in the UK a recent  personal  bank  or
    building society statement and so on and various other details which  I
    do not think I need spell out for the purposes of what I have to decide
    because it will become clear what information was and was not,  it  was
    said, properly provided.

12.  Now we come on to paragraph 46-SD, which requires  following  paragraph
    46 that documentary evidence has to be provided in all  cases  and  the
    specified documents set out in 46-SD and one of  the  requirements  was
    that audited accounts had to be provided or, if audited  accounts  were
    not required, unaudited accounts and a report from  an  accountant  who
    was a member of the UK Recognised Supervisory Body as  defined  in  the
    2006 Companies Act and those accounts must show the investment in money
    made directly  by  the  applicant  if  that  is  material  and  various
    documentary evidence that the business has indeed been established  and
    is in being.

13.  It is accepted and indeed the grounds were  refused  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in relation to whether there had in fact  been  compliance  with
    the first two issues, namely that she had not demonstrated that she and
    her business partner had available funds of not less than  �50,000  and
    secondly that she met the requirements  of  41-SD(e)(iii)  relating  to
    evidence of marketing and trading.   I  should  perhaps  have  referred
    specifically  to  that  when  I  went  through  46-SD,  which  required
    effectively the amount of money made available, and what  was  required
    by that was evidence of trading.

14.  Now, as I say, it having been accepted that, the decision of the  judge
    that she had not demonstrated those two matters having been upheld, the
    only question is whether the evidential flexibility policy should apply
    in order to show that the gaps in the information provided ought to  be
    filled.

15.  The starting point for the question of  any  flexibility  is  paragraph
    245AA of the Rules, which provides by 245AA(b):

         "If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:


         (iv) a document does not contain all of the  specified  information
             the Secretary of  State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
             representative in writing and request the correct documents."


    And then (d):


         "If the applicant has submitted a specified document  in the  wrong
         format or which is a copy and not an  original  document  or  which
         does not contain all of the specified information but  the  missing
         information is verifiable from:


         (1)  other documents submitted with the application;


         (2)  the website of the organisation which issued the document; or


         (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body

         the application may be  granted  exceptionally  provided  that  the
         Secretary of State is satisfied that the  specified  documents  are
         genuine and the applicant meets all the  other  requirements.   The
         Secretary of State reserves the  right  to  request  the  specified
         original documents in the correct format in  all  cases  where  (b)
         applies and to refuse  applications  if  these  documents  are  not
         provided as set out in (b)."

16.  Thus it is clear that the Rule provides that if  a  document  does  not
    contain all the  specified  information  then  that  can  lead  to  the
    Secretary of State requesting the correct documents but if they are not
    provided then it is made clear  that  there  is  the  right  to  refuse
    applications if the documents are not provided.

17.  So far as (d) is concerned if the document is in  the  wrong  form  but
    the missing information is verifiable  from  other  material  then  the
    Secretary of State can grant the  application  if  satisfied  that  the
    specified documents are genuine and the applicant meets all  the  other
    requirements.  Thus, so far as the Rule is concerned one  can  see  the
    limits to the discretionary approach that is applicable.

18.  The Secretary of State has issued guidance which changes from  time  to
    time and I have been reminded of the relevant guidance which deals with
    this issue and what is said there is, and of course  this  is  guidance
    given to those responsible for dealing with applications: "You  do  not
    have to write to an applicant about a specified document if it does not
    contain all of the specified information where you can get the  missing
    information from other documents etc."

19.  That reflects entirely what is set out in 245AA(d),  to  which  I  have
    referred and I then come to additional information in relation to leave
    to remain and the page in question of the  guidance  in  issue  at  the
    relevant time back in 2014 says:

         "This page tells you about  requesting  additional  information  if
         there is missing evidence or  evidence  is  not  in  an  acceptable
         format.   You  must  only   request   additional   information   in
         circumstances that would lead to the application being approved."


20.  Of course, as will become apparent, it  is  important  because  if  the
    application is not to be approved on grounds other than in relation  to
    a failure to deal with specific information then obviously there is  no
    point in requiring that additional information because it  cannot  lead
    to a decision to allow.

21.  And it goes on:

         "Before you request additional evidence you must have enough reason
         to believe the information exists.  This is limited to cases  where
         documents, for example bank statements, are missing from a  series,
         photocopies have been received  or  a  document  is  in  the  wrong
         format."


    Again, that reflects largely what is set out in 245AA(b),  to  which  I
    have referred, and it is said that the application must be  refused  if
    it would fall for refusal even if the missing information was  provided
    or if a minor error was corrected and that missing  information  should
    not be requested if it could not change the decision on  the  case  and
    any refusal should include if it is the  case  that  there  were  minor
    errors but the request was not made because the  case  would  fall  for
    refusal on other grounds.


22.   So  essentially  the  meat  of  the  guidance  does  not  really  vary
    significantly so far as I can see from what is set out in the Rule  and
    indeed it is clear that it should not because the guidance  cannot  and
    should not override what is set out in a Rule  but  of  course  it  can
    explain and can indicate how a particular matter should be  dealt  with
    within the Rule and the Rule of course does not  have  the  limitations
    other than those specified in it.

23.  Now, the question, as I say, is whether the  failures  to  comply  with
    what I have called issues 1 and 2 and what has been referred to in  the
    judgment of Judge Smith which went to the Court of  Appeal  could  have
    been cured or rather should have been cured by the application  of  the
    flexibility policy.

24.  Mr Kannangara submits, as he has previously submitted in the appeal  to
    the Court of Appeal, that the information missing in  relation  to  the
    two  issues  was  such  as  should  and  could   have   been   properly
    supplemented.  The second issue, which I shall  deal  with  first,  was
    whether essentially the document produced, which was dated 19 July, did
    not establish that the relevant trading material had existed as from 11
    July 2014.  That was dealt with specifically in  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Judge where he referred to material which had been  produced
    but the judge did not  accept  that  the  material  was  sufficient  to
    establish that the requirement was  met  and  indeed  that  finding  of
    course has been upheld.  So there was no evidence  so  far  as  he  was
    concerned that established that the website  was  created  and  up  and
    running prior to 11 July 2014.

25.  It is important also to bear in mind that the Rules  require  that  the
    evidence must have been submitted to the Secretary of State and  it  is
    not open to an applicant to rely on subsequent material in  the  appeal
    process, subject obviously to the evidential flexibility issue.  So the
    question there  is  whether  the  error  could  and  should  have  been
    supplemented and there should have been a request  in  accordance  with
    the  evidential  flexibility  approach   to   provide   the   necessary
    information.

26.  The other issue, described as issue  1,  was  effectively  whether  the
    �50,000 was available.  It is accepted that there was  a  shortfall  of
    something over �1,000 and that, according to the appellant, was made up
    by a sum of something over �4,000, which in fact was  the  value  of  a
    motorcar which had been acquired and which was what  the  report  which
    was provided showed as a tangible asset.  The information set  out  the
    report from the so-called accountant, I say "so-called"  because  there
    is no evidence  that  the  accountant  qualified  as  such  within  the
    requirement of the Rule is singularly lacking in any detail because the
    sum of money in question is simply put as  a  tangible  asset  with  no
    information as to what it in fact consisted of and where it came  from.
    As I say, the evidence of the appellant was that it  was  the  motorcar
    and that of course was put forward as an investment  of  in  fact  some
    �4,344.  Again, it is set out in the report not as an investment but as
    a tangible asset although it may be in fairness that  there  is  little
    difference in that.

27.  What is submitted by Mr Clarke is that this is not  a  case  where  the
    policy could properly be applied to fill the gaps.  Mr  Kannangara  has
    referred me to a decision of the Court of Appeal  in  SH  (Pakistan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  426,  which
    concerned the application of the policy but that was a case related  to
    the provision of qualifications from  university  which  had  not  been
    provided in the proper form but there was evidence that he did in  fact
    qualify as he should have done and it was accepted in that case that if
    he had submitted the material  in  the  approved  form  he  would  have
    qualified and so would have had the  application  that  he  was  making
    granted, and so that falls, on the face of  it,  directly  within  what
    both 245AA and the guidance.

28.  Similarly, in the Mandalia case the gap was some very few days  because
    the bank statements produced showed the necessary funding for a  period
    of 22 instead of a month, so there was a gap here for some, whatever it
    was, four or five days, and it was said in that  case  that  there  was
    other evidence which indicated that actually  it  was  clear  that  the
    funding had existed for the  relevant  period  and  so  the  evidential
    flexibility should be applied.  That again was a  case  where  the  gap
    once filled meant that the application would succeed.

29.  What Mr Clarke submits here is that that is not  the  decision  in  the
    circumstances of this case because the starting point is of course  the
    Rules and Mr Clarke draws my attention specifically to 245AA(c),  which
    provides that  documents  will  not  be  requested  where  a  specified
    document has not  been  submitted,  for  example  an  English  language
    certificate is missing, or  where  the  Secretary  of  State  does  not
    anticipate that  addressing  the  omission  or  error  referred  to  in
    subparagraph (b) will lead to a grant because the application  will  be
    refused for other reasons and indeed that is reflected in the  passages
    of the guidance to which I have already referred.

30.  He then draws attention to 46 in the Appendix, which provides:

         "Documentary evidence must be provided in all cases.  The specified
         documents in paragraph 46-SD must be provided as  evidence  of  any
         investment and business activity that took place when the applicant
         had leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant or  a  Tier  1  (Post-
         Study Work) Migrant",


    that is the starting point, as it were, because it is necessary to show
    that the business was set up and that there  had  been  previous  leave
    under either of those, and he goes on "and any investment made no  more
    than twelve months before the date of the  application  for  which  the
    applicant is claiming points", and then SD, as  I  say,  sets  out  the
    relevant documentation.


31.  The point made is that there is no indication as to the time  when  the
    investment which the motorcar represents was made.  Furthermore, it  is
    required that the accountant is qualified but again I have referred  no
    evidence that that is indeed the position and so far as the question of
    advertising material is concerned there is a requirement that  "one  or
    more of the following specified documents covering a continuous  period
    commencing before 11 July 2014 up  to  no  earlier  than  three  months
    before  the  date  of  the  application",  "advertising  and  marketing
    material" and so on.  That information simply is not  produced  and  no
    doubt can be made available but is not produced.

32.  It seems to me quite clear that Mr Clarke is right in what  he  submits
    that this is not a case in which  the  application  of  the  evidential
    policy unless it goes far beyond that which it  is  designed  to  cover
    could result in the application being allowed.   There  were  too  many
    gaps in what was provided and however flexible the policy can  be  said
    to be it does not, in my judgment, extend to  cover  the  situation  in
    this case.  It may be that that is an over-harsh decision in one  sense
    and it may be that the appellant has in fact  complied  but  one  thing
    that is clear is that what I have called the  tick  box  approach  does
    require that consideration is carefully given to  what  information  is
    required and the form in which it is required.

33.  Gaps can be filled in by evidential flexibility  if  they  comply  with
    what both 245AA and the guidance which follows the provisions of  245AA
    provide but what cannot be done by flexibility guidance  is  simply  to
    supplement failures unless it is clear that there was  material  before
    the Secretary of State which  did  show  that  all  that  was  required
    existed but maybe that there were omissions in the  precise  nature  of
    the documentation and the information that was provided.   That,  I  am
    afraid, in my judgment, does not apply in  the  circumstances  of  this
    case and I am satisfied that the decision of the First-tier  Judge  was
    correct, albeit maybe not for the correct reasons  and  that  therefore
    this appeal must be dismissed.

Notice of Decision
