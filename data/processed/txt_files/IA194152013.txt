For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvyn, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   Following a hearing at Field House on  10  July  2014  I  set  aside  a
    decision dismissing this appeal.  My reasons for doing so,  along  with
    an outline of the immigration history, was set  out  in  the  following
    error of law decision, which was sent to the parties on 18 July 2014.

           (i).   The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan,  aged  27,  who
                claims that he was brought to the UK as a 13 year old child,
                and has remained here since then.  An application  was  made
                on long residence grounds on 30 July 2012.  This was shortly
                after  the  Long  Residence  Rules  were  changed   by   the
                introduction  of  Appendix  FM,  and   shortly   after   the
                appellant's 25th birthday (this is relevant to the reference
                in paragraph 276ADE(v) to those who could show that they had
                been in the UK for half their lives, and were  under  25  at
                date  of  application).   The  appellant's  application  was
                refused on 16 May 2013, and  his  appeal  was  dismissed  by
                Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  K  W  Brown,  following  a
                hearing at Taylor House on 10 March 2014.  The determination
                was promulgated on 18 April 2014.


           (ii)   Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-
                tier Tribunal McDade on 22 May 2014.  The  grounds  seeking
                permission to appeal were concerned with  two  issues.   The
                first was the  judge's  approach  to  the  evidence  of  two
                witnesses who claimed to have taken care  of  the  appellant
                between his arrival in 1999 and 2004.  The second  concerned
                the  judge's  approach  to  the  question  of  whether   the
                appellant had no ties to Pakistan, and failure to follow the
                Home Office guidance and the case of Ogundimu (Article  8  -
                new Rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60 (IAC).


           (iii)  In granting permission to appeal Judge McDade appeared to
                open an additional ground, in that he referred to  it  being
                arguable that  the  judge's  assessment  of  Article  8  was
                inadequate and insufficiently reasoned.


           The Hearing


           (iv)   The appellant and his partner were both  present  at  the
                hearing.


           (v)    Mr Aslam, for the  appellant,  started  with  the  ground
                about "no  ties"  in  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of  the  Rules.
                Detailed guidance as well as Ogundimu had  been  put  before
                the judge, and extracts of these had been  in  the  skeleton
                argument.  The Ogundimu approach showed  that  there  was  a
                need for an ongoing connection between the appellant and the
                country of origin.  The judge had erred in not carrying  out
                the assessment required.  The challenge therefore  was  that
                the reasoning at  paragraph  29  of  the  determination,  in
                support of the conclusion that the appellant still had  both
                cultural and family ties to Pakistan,  was  inadequate.   In
                relation to the first ground the  submission  was  that  the
                reasons given for rejecting the evidence of the two men that
                looked after the appellant was inadequate and  insufficient.
                It was submitted that the  reasoning  was  contradictory  in
                that the only reason given for rejecting  the  evidence  was
                that the two men could not be trusted given  that  they  had
                not informed Social Services about the illegal presence of a
                child.  The inconsistency was that the judge's  own  finding
                was that the appellant had not in fact been  in  the  UK  at
                that time.  Mr Aslam also made  submissions  on  Article  8,
                noting that the judge had accepted  that  there  was  family
                life with the  appellant's  Indian  partner,  and  that  his
                removal would separate  the  couple.   Given  these  factual
                findings the reasoning at paragraph 33 was  inadequate,  and
                the proportionality assessment was conducted  on  the  wrong
                factual basis.


           (vi)    Mr  Bramble,  for  the  respondent,  questioned  whether
                Article 8 should be considered at all, given that there  had
                been no application to vary  the  grounds.   The  judge  had
                noted that the first sponsor or guardian  of  the  appellant
                had not given oral evidence.  The judge had been entitled to
                find against him on long residence, and to find that he  had
                not lost ties to Pakistan, given the finding that he  had  a
                sister there.  It was also significant  that  the  appellant
                had had no documentary evidence to show his presence in  the
                UK between 1999 and 2007.


           Error of Law


           (vii)  As I indicated at the hearing I have decided  that  there
                was a material error of law in the  determination.   I  have
                decided that grounds 1 and 2 are made out.   The  length  of
                residence was a crucial factual dispute.  The only reasoning
                put  forward  for  rejecting  the  evidence   of   the   two
                "guardians" was at paragraph 11  of  the  determination.   I
                accept the submission that it is difficult to regard this as
                having been properly  conducted  on  a  hypothetical  basis.
                There is nothing in the determination to suggest  that  this
                was in the judge's mind, and even if it was on such a  basis
                there would be no remaining reasoning if  the  finding  went
                against the appellant, as it did.  As a result  there  is  a
                clear contradiction between the  judge's  finding  that  the
                appellant had not been in the UK between 1999 and  2007,  on
                the one hand, and his reasoning, based on the failure of the
                two guardians to contact the Home Office or Social  Services
                in this period, on the other.  The issue may not  have  been
                fatal if there had been any other reasons  put  forward  for
                rejecting this evidence, but this was the only  reason.   On
                that basis I conclude that the reasoning for  rejecting  the
                evidence was inadequate, and that the judge erred in law  in
                this respect.


           (viii) The second ground also appears to me to be made out.  The
                judge, in the determination, notes that he was  referred  to
                the guidance and to the  Ogundimu  case.   Having  done  so,
                however, he then does not go on to follow  the  guidance  in
                Ogundimu, or refer to the Home Office guidance in  any  way.
                The consideration of  whether  the  appellant  has  ties  to
                Pakistan is restricted to a single narrow point, namely that
                he has a sister in that country.  It is also the  case  that
                the judge refers to the appellant's length of residence, and
                if that point falls away due to an error of  law,  then  the
                consideration of whether there were  ties  to  Pakistan  has
                been conducted on an incorrect factual basis.


           (ix)   Without having  to  decide  whether  the  judge  granting
                permission to appeal did intentionally  broaden  the  points
                raised in the grounds the same issue applies in relation  to
                Article 8.  The Article  8  proportionality  assessment  has
                been conducted on the  basis  that  the  appellant  was  not
                brought to the UK as a child, and that he has been in the UK
                for considerably less time than he has claimed.  The  length
                of residence, and the age on arrival, would be  a  key  fact
                both for assessing ties within paragraph  276ADE,  and  also
                for considering Article 8 outside the Rules.  It is also the
                case that there is no reference within the determination  to
                any recent case law on the relationship between Article 8 in
                Appendix FM, and Article 8 outside the  Rules.   Neither  is
                there any reference to the partner  provisions  in  Appendix
                FM, or within  the  points-based  system  student  dependant
                Rules.  On the factual matrix  point  alone  the  Article  8
                conclusion cannot  be  separated  once  the  long  residence
                findings are set aside.


           (x)    For  these  reasons  I  have  decided  that  the  judge's
                decision has to be set aside, and that it needs  to  be  re-
                made.


           (xi)   The parties both agreed  to  a  re-making  in  the  Upper
                Tribunal.  It was also agreed that there was a need for  the
                matter to be adjourned.   I  have  considered  the  relevant
                Practice Direction, and the agreement of the parties, and it
                does not appear to me to be necessary  to  depart  from  the
                normal expectation that a re-making would be  in  the  Upper
                Tribunal.


           (xii)  An error of law having been  found  the  appeal  will  be
                listed for a re-making hearing in the Upper  Tribunal,  with
                no findings preserved.

2.   The remaking hearing was adjourned part-heard on 1 September 2014.   On
    that date there was oral evidence,  including  cross-examination,  from
    the appellant and two further witnesses.  The matter was adjourned part-
    heard for lack of time at 5.15pm, with one further witness to be heard,
    followed by submissions.

3.   After some listing difficulties that led to an adjournment  the  matter
    resumed on 18 December 2014.  The appellant  and  the  three  witnesses
    were again present, but the  only  oral  evidence  was  from  the  last
    remaining witness.  Mr Melvyn, for  the  respondent,  provided  written
    submissions in advance of the hearing, and added  to  these  with  oral
    submissions after the evidence.  At the end  of  the  submissions  from
    both sides I reserved my decision.

Summary of the Evidence

4.   In outline, the evidence was as follows.  The appellant was brought  to
    the UK by his father in 1999, at the age of 12 (the reference to 13  in
    the error of law decision is less likely since he turned 13 in December
    1999).  The appellant's father left him with  Mr  H,  and  returned  to
    Pakistan.  The appellant was not aware of the travel arrangements,  but
    it appears likely that entry to the UK was on a false document.   Mr  H
    took the appellant into his  household  and  looked  after  him.   This
    arrangement  was  based  on  his  longstanding  friendship   with   the
    appellant's father in Pakistan.  At first it was  suggested  that  this
    was to be temporary, but the appellant's father in fact never returned,
    and in 2001 Mr H informed the appellant that both his father and mother
    had been killed in a traffic accident.  The appellant has one  sibling,
    a younger sister.  He last spoke to her in 2000.  Mr H heard  that  she
    was married in 2006, but the appellant has  not  retained  any  contact
    with her and is now unaware of her whereabouts.

5.   Mr H treated the appellant well, as part of his  family,  but  did  not
    send him to school, did not register him with a GP, and made no contact
    with  the  Home  Office,  or  any  other  official  bodies,  about  the
    appellant's presence.  The appellant's education was limited to classes
    in the local mosque.

6.   In 2002, when the appellant was  15,  he  was  transferred  to  another
    family, that of Mr S.  He was a friend of Mr H, and had  come  to  know
    the appellant through being a frequent visitor at Mr H's restaurant  in
    East London.  He became fond of the boy, and he and his wife,  who  had
    two daughters who were then toddlers, agreed to take him in.  Mr S  was
    a market trader in East Ham.  The same arrangements about not going  to
    school, and not contacting the authorities, and only  having  education
    at the mosque, continued as before.  Mr S came to regard the  appellant
    as a son, and thought highly of him.

7.   In 2004, at the age of 17, the appellant moved  to  Scotland.   He  had
    been offered a job, with accommodation, in a restaurant.  On arrival he
    registered, for the first time, with a GP,  and  with  a  library.   He
    continued to live and work in Scotland until 2007 (about three  years),
    by which time he was 20 years old.  In 2007 he was detected by the Home
    Office as a result of an intelligence  led  enforcement  visit  to  the
    takeaway restaurant where he was working.  He initially  gave  a  false
    name and claimed to have a work permit, but  the  appellant's  employer
    and his wife later went to the police station and  admitted  that  they
    knew the appellant was in the UK illegally.  The  appellant,  according
    to an extract from Home Office records, then said in an interview  that
    he had only come to the UK a year previously, and had paid �8,000 to an
    agent.  This is disputed by the appellant, whose evidence was  that  he
    said no such thing.

8.   The appellant was served with a  notice  as  an  illegal  entrant,  and
    given reporting conditions,  but  he  left  Scotland  and  returned  to
    London, as a result being listed as an absconder.  He then resumed life
    in East Ham, until he was arrested again in 2010, again  working  in  a
    restaurant.  Since that date he has been reporting continuously.  After
    the 2010 detention he obtained legal advice, and was  told  that  there
    was no application that he could make, but that he might have a  chance
    of succeeding if he could remain illegally in the UK for fourteen years
    (it is not clear if he was given detailed advice about  the  impact  of
    the illegal entrant notice served on him in  2007).   It  then  appears
    that the appellant continued to report, and  no  attempt  was  made  to
    remove him, until July 2012, when he was detained on reporting.  It was
    then that the application that has generated  the  current  appeal  was
    made.  The Immigration Rules changed on 9 July  2012,  withdrawing  the
    fourteen year rule.  The appellant paid the  relevant  fee  (�991)  and
    made an application on Article 8 grounds, with reference  to  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules, as  well  as  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules.   This  application  was  refused  on  15  May  2013,  and   was
    accompanied by a removal decision under section 10 of  the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.

9.   Although no reference to it was made in the 2012  application,  by  the
    time of the preparation of  documents  for  the  appeal  the  appellant
    introduced an additional  element,  namely  his  relationship  with  an
    Indian citizen who was in the UK as a student.  He  indicated  that  he
    had been living with her since 2009,  and  that  the  couple  had  gone
    through a religious marriage ceremony in January 2014.

10.  Documentary evidence in support of the appellant's claim was  extremely
    limited.  Mr H and Mr S both said that they had had no contact with any
    official bodies, and they also both said that they had  not  taken  any
    photographs of the appellant in the years between 1999 and  2004.   The
    appellant said that the Home Office had taken his  health  and  library
    registration documents in Scotland in 2007, and he had  not  seen  them
    since.  No documents were put forward to support  the  claim  that  the
    appellant's parents had died in 2001, or that his sister had married in
    2006.  No documents were provided from the mosque that he was  said  to
    have attended in East Ham.  The respondent did not provide  any  record
    of the interview in 2007 referred to in the Home Office  records.   The
    documents in the appellant's bundle all dated from 2011 onwards.

11.  The evidence about the appellant's relationship with  his  partner  was
    that they met in East Ham in 2009, and started  their  relationship  in
    2010.  They have been living together since the end of that year.   The
    appellant's partner is  currently  applying  for  further  leave  as  a
    student.  At the hearing on 18  December  2014  I  was  told  that  she
    continued to await the outcome  of  her  latest  application.   In  her
    evidence she described a dilemma in relation to  the  attitude  of  her
    parents.  She has not told them about the relationship.  The difficulty
    would flow from the fact that she is a Sikh, and  the  appellant  is  a
    Muslim.  She anticipates difficulties when she does tell  her  parents.
    She made some enquiries with the Indian Embassy about whether he  could
    obtain a visa to accompany her to  India,  and  was  given  a  negative
    response.  The appellant himself, on advice, made an  approach  to  the
    Pakistan High Commission, who produced a letter, in March 2014, stating
    that the appellant could not be issued with a travel  document  because
    he had failed to produce any Pakistani identity documents.  As a result
    the evidence of both the appellant and his partner was that they  would
    face difficulties in  attempting  to  establish  themselves  either  in
    Pakistan or India.  The appellant's  partner  has  plans  to  establish
    herself in business at the end of her studies, with the support of  her
    family, and hopes that it might be possible for this to take  place  in
    the UK rather than in India.  She supports the appellant's attempts  to
    regularise his status.

Credibility Submissions

12.  The submissions by Mr  Melvyn,  for  the  respondent,  in  relation  to
    credibility, can be summarised as follows.  There were no documents  to
    show presence in the UK before 2007; there were no documents  from  the
    mosque; no official documents from the time with Mr  H  and  Mr  S;  no
    photographs of him with either family; no  documentary  evidence  about
    the death of his parents.   In  addition  the  appellant  had  made  no
    attempt to regularise his status even when he turned 18 in 2004, and he
    gave a false name on detection in 2007, and then absconded.  No  weight
    should  be  placed  on  the  evidence  of  Mr  H,  which  was   without
    credibility.  He had given no proper explanation of the actions of  the
    appellant's father in leaving  the  appellant  with  him,  or  his  own
    actions in not contacting the authorities or arranging  education.   In
    oral evidence Mr H was wrong about the relative ages of  the  appellant
    and one of his sons with whom the appellant had shared a room, and  the
    nickname that he gave for his daughter did not match that given by  the
    appellant.  Interpretation difficulties were mentioned but these should
    not be used to give him the benefit of any doubt.

13.  The evidence of the appellant's partner was also  without  credibility,
    because this relationship had not  been  mentioned  in  the  July  2012
    application for settlement, and this was not  adequately  explained  by
    either the appellant or his partner; she had not informed  her  parents
    about the relationship; and the only evidence about the response of the
    Indian authorities was  her  oral  evidence  about  a  telephone  call.
    Although it was accepted that there  were  photographs  of  the  couple
    together, and documentary evidence to show that  they  lived  together,
    the relationship could  not  be  accepted  without  further  supporting
    evidence.

14.  In oral submissions Mr Melvyn added that the evidence of Mr S was  also
    not reliable.  His claim to have harboured the appellant  between  2002
    and 2004 was implausible.  If the appellant had really been in  the  UK
    at this time Mr S would have  made  some  attempts  to  regularise  his
    status.  The evidence of Mr S was also vague on the subject of  exactly
    what the appellant was doing in that period.

15.  Mr Aslam,  for  the  appellant,  made  submissions  on  credibility  as
    follows.  The two witnesses, Mr H and Mr S, had come to  give  evidence
    on a number of occasions.  This indicated a close relationship, and  it
    was not clear what motive they would have to  lie  on  the  appellant's
    behalf.  They were also running a  substantial  risk  of  getting  into
    trouble.  For Mr S, who worked on a self-employed  basis  as  a  market
    trader, this was the fourth time that he had come to give evidence.  To
    go to all this trouble, for a person with whom there was not the  close
    relationship  described,  established   during   his   childhood,   was
    implausible.  All three witnesses had been consistent.  The Home Office
    computer record had not been supported by a  record  of  the  interview
    under caution.  The appellant  had  made  it  clear  that  he  was  not
    accepting the aspect about �8,000  or  having  entered  in  2006.   The
    burden in this respect was on the  respondent,  and  it  had  not  been
    discharged.  It was accepted that  there  was  a  lack  of  documentary
    evidence, but that was made up by the oral evidence  of  the  appellant
    and the two witnesses.  In cases  where  people  had  been  in  the  UK
    unlawfully it was highly likely that they  would  not  have  paperwork,
    especially for a person who had come as a child.  In  this  case  there
    was therefore  a  reasonable  explanation  for  the  lack  of  official
    documents.  The appellant had made some  effort  to  get  the  Scottish
    health records, but had  been  unable  to  do  so  without  a  Scottish
    address, and without an identity document.

Findings

16.  Having considered all of the evidence as a whole, and the  written  and
    oral submissions made by both sides, I have decided that the  appellant
    has established the majority of the account that he has given,  and  in
    particular that he has established the  claimed  length  of  continuous
    residence in the UK.

17.  I have given these findings very careful thought.  Cases of this  sort,
    where appellants claim to have been in the  UK  illegally  for  lengthy
    periods,  pose  particular  credibility  problems.   A  straightforward
    approach of rejecting the credibility of an  account  given  solely  or
    mainly because it  is  not  supported  by  official  documents  is  not
    appropriate in such cases.  This is because,  where  a  person  accepts
    that he or she has been in the country illegally for a long period,  it
    will nearly always be the case that the kind of contact  with  official
    bodies that would generate such documentation will have  been  avoided.
    The difficulty, obviously, is that it is an easy  thing  for  a  person
    caught in the UK to make up their date  of  entry,  in  an  attempt  to
    establish a longer period of unlawful residence than has actually  been
    the case.  Where a person has entered illegally, and there is therefore
    no official record of entry,  it  may  be  difficult  to  disprove  the
    claimed entry date.  It is therefore  important  to  be  alert  to  the
    motivation for putting forward a false date  of  entry,  and  also  the
    difficulties of disproving it where there is an  explanation  available
    for the lack of documentary support.

18.  At times issues such  as  this  will  turn  on  the  oral  evidence  of
    witnesses.  It is far from an easy task to assess such evidence, but in
    a case of this sort, as with many asylum  claims,  the  entire  outcome
    turns on such  an  assessment,  and  I  have  the  unenviable  task  of
    assessing whether the appellant and the witnesses called on his  behalf
    were being truthful or not.

19.  The general plausibility or implausibility of an account  is  dangerous
    territory in the process of credibility assessment.  Having said that I
    would remark, without it being a matter on which I  would  place  great
    weight,  that  the  overall  account  did  not  appear  to  me  to   be
    implausible.  This would certainly not be the first time that a  parent
    in  Pakistan,  India,  or  Bangladesh  decided  to  bypass  immigration
    controls in this way and leave a child with a family friend or relative
    in the UK.  When asked to speculate on  his  father's  motivation,  the
    appellant suggested that his father might have been hoping that his son
    would have a better life here.  I heard nothing about  the  appellant's
    parents' overall circumstances in Pakistan, but it does not  appear  to
    me implausible that the appellant's father might  have  acted  in  this
    way, with this general motivation.

20.  It appears to  me  to  be  likely  that  the  arrangement  between  the
    appellant's father and Mr H was more explicit than Mr H has  suggested.
    It appears to me that Mr H wanted to sweeten the pill of the nature  of
    his involvement, by suggesting that at  first  the  appellant's  father
    left him behind when he  returned  to  Pakistan  for  some  unspecified
    emergency, and that at first the  arrangement  was  only  meant  to  be
    temporary.   In  my  view  it  is  more  likely,  based  on  their  old
    friendship, that the appellant's  father  was  more  direct  about  his
    request to Mr H.  Similarly it seems to me that both  Mr  H  and  Mr  S
    would have been aware of the potential consequences if the  appellant's
    presence came to be known.   The  two  witnesses,  it  appears  to  me,
    probably avoided contact with schools or any  other  officials  because
    they had some idea of what might  happen  if  the  appellant's  illegal
    presence came to light (even if this was not detailed, or based on  any
    legal advice).

21.  A potentially  powerful  piece  of  evidence  against  the  appellant's
    central claim was the reference to an  admission  by  him  made  in  an
    interview under caution in 2007, that he had in fact entered  illegally
    in about 2006.  On this point, however, I accept the submission made on
    the appellant's behalf that, once it was clear that this was contested,
    it was for the respondent to provide evidence of  the  interview.   The
    distinction between Home Office  records  on  the  one  hand,  and  the
    evidence on which they are based on the other,  is  an  important  one.
    Records can contain errors.  It is not clear whether the appellant  was
    the only person arrested during the enforcement visit.  The  respondent
    had time to obtain the interview record, and would have been  aware  of
    its importance.  Whilst I would say that this was the matter that  gave
    rise to the greatest level of doubt in my mind,  and  that  led  me  to
    approach the oral evidence with scepticism, nevertheless I have come to
    the conclusion that I can only place very limited weight on the record,
    given the manner in which it has been contested,  where  the  interview
    record and other documentary evidence has not been produced.

22.  My overall impression of the two witnesses, Mr H and  Mr  S,  was  that
    they were relatively unsophisticated, but appeared to me to be  broadly
    honest and truthful.  My reservations relate to specific areas.  I have
    already  mentioned  my  reservation  about  Mr  H's  account   of   his
    interaction with the appellant's father.  For Mr S  my  reservation  is
    that it appears to me likely that the appellant  helped  Mr  S  on  his
    stall, but that, in his evidence, Mr S was keen not to  disclose  this,
    presumably on the basis that this would show him in  a  bad  light,  or
    that the issue of employing an illegal entrant might be a more  serious
    matter than providing accommodation to one.  Apart from  those  points,
    however, having given  the  matter  careful  thought,  I  came  to  the
    conclusion that these were both truthful witnesses.   It  is  certainly
    the case that they acted unlawfully in keeping the presence of a  child
    who had been brought to the UK illegally, and remained illegally,  from
    the knowledge of  the  authorities.   In  other  similar  cases,  where
    children are trafficked to the UK and then  badly  treated  in  various
    ways, this could be an extremely serious  matter  indeed.   As  it  is,
    despite  the  fact  that  they  appear  to  have  suffered   no   legal
    consequences, they would have  been  liable  to  face  prosecution  for
    immigration offences.  The appellant emphasised that  his  relationship
    with both men was entirely positive, and  that  both  had  treated  him
    extremely well.  This is therefore very far from a case of a trafficked
    child in that sense, but the seriousness of what they  did  flows  from
    the fact that children brought to the UK in this way, who remain in the
    UK unlawfully, are highly vulnerable for a number of reasons.

23.  Having said all of that I  accept  that,  within  their  own  frame  of
    reference, both men considered that they  were  being  helpful  to  the
    appellant, and acted from broadly positive motives.

24.  The evidence of the two witnesses was consistent.   The  account  given
    has remained consistent throughout.  I did  not  see  anything  in  the
    minor discrepancy about the age of one of Mr H's children.  Overall  it
    appeared to me that the evidence given by both witnesses,  and  by  the
    appellant, came across as truthful in most respects.

25.  I have taken account of  the  appellant's  immigration  history.   This
    clearly has negative aspects which  lead  to  approaching  any  of  his
    evidence with caution.  Although he cannot be held responsible for  the
    actions of his father in bringing him to  the  UK  illegally  and  then
    leaving him here, nevertheless he made  choices  from  the  age  of  17
    onward that included  working  illegally,  giving  a  false  name  when
    initially  detected,  leaving  Scotland  when  he  was   on   reporting
    conditions and not bringing himself to the attention of the authorities
    again until 2010, and continuing to work  illegally  between  2007  and
    2010.

26.  I note that the appellant provided two other letters from men  in  East
    Ham, saying that they had known him in that area from about  2000,  but
    it appears to me that I can place much less  weight  on  these  letters
    given that neither of these men were called as witnesses.

27.  I did not see  any  proper  reasons  to  reject  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's partner as lacking in credibility, although I note that she
    had no knowledge of the appellant's presence in the UK before 2009, and
    she therefore offered no support on the  central  contested  issue.   I
    have considered  the  point  made  about  the  relationship  not  being
    mentioned in the 2012 application.  Having listened to the  explanation
    given by both the appellant and his partner this does not appear to  be
    as damaging as might otherwise be the case.  In  the  2012  application
    the appellant was acting on  advice.   The  advice  that  he  had  been
    following since 2010 had focused on the issue  of  long  residence  and
    private life.  The appellant's partner's presence was temporary,  as  a
    student, and any competent legal advisor  would  have  noted  that  the
    relationship did not therefore assist.  It also appears  to  me  to  be
    plausible that the appellant would have wanted to pursue the matter  on
    his own behalf, without involving his partner.  It  is  also  plausible
    that this may have changed as time  progressed,  and  the  relationship
    became more established.

28.  For all  of  these  reasons  my  finding  is  that  the  appellant  has
    established that he was brought to the UK, and left here, in 1999,  and
    that he was looked after in  the  households  of  Mr  H  and  Mr  S  as
    described.  I therefore find that he has been continuously  in  the  UK
    from 1999, when he would have been 12.  He has now just turned  28.   I
    also find that he is in  a  genuine  committed  relationship  with  his
    partner, that they have been living together since 2009, and that  they
    did go through an Islamic wedding ceremony in 2014.

29.  The subject of the death of the appellant's parents appears  to  me  to
    be a particularly difficult one on which to make a finding.  On the one
    hand I can accept that both Mr  H  and  the  appellant  are  relatively
    unsophisticated, in terms of education, and that there  may  have  been
    difficulties in making  whatever  written  enquiries  would  have  been
    required to obtain death certificates.  On the other hand Mr H  appears
    to live in a community where he would  have  contact  with  people  who
    travel to Pakistan, or have relatives and friends there, and  it  could
    be said that it would not have been  that  difficult  to  obtain  death
    certificates.  There is also an obvious motivation for the appellant to
    say that his parents were killed,  because  this  would  make  it  more
    likely that he would eventually be allowed to  stay  in  the  UK.   The
    absence of any letter from his sister, and the loss of contact, on  the
    other hand, appears to me to be less significant.  It would not  appear
    to me to be surprising that a younger  sister  who  had  not  seen  her
    brother for many years, and had then been absorbed into  her  husband's
    household, would be difficult to trace, and would not, in any event, be
    expected to retain ties.  In the end the matter appears to me to follow
    in line with my overall assessment of the credibility  and  reliability
    of the appellant and of Mr H.  Given that I  have  found  Mr  H  to  be
    credible in most respects it appears to me to follow that  his  account
    of having been informed of the death of the appellant's parents in 2001
    is also more likely than not to be truthful.

Decision and Reasons

30.  I have decided to allow  the  appeal  under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

31.  There was some  discussion  at  the  hearing  about  which  version  of
    paragraph 276ADE was applicable.  That paragraph was changed by HC 532,
    which brought in changes that had effect, for the most part, on 28 July
    2014.  At the initial hearing it  was  agreed,  tentatively,  that  the
    applicable version of paragraph 276ADE was the one that predated the HC
    532 changes.  At the hearing on 18 December, however, Mr Melvyn made  a
    contrary submission, to the effect that the new  version  of  paragraph
    276ADE was the one applicable.  He helpfully provided a copy of HC 532,
    along with a Home Office training note which indicated that there  were
    no transitional arrangements.  It was this that he relied upon  in  his
    submission.

32.  I have decided, however, that the applicable version of 276ADE  is  the
    one that was in force when this decision was taken.  This is because HC
    532 has, at page 2, a section concerned  with  implementation.   Within
    that section the third implementation paragraph deals with the  changes
    to paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH and  Appendix  FM.   The  implementation,
    apart for Article 8 claims from foreign criminals,  where  the  changes
    were immediate, only applied to decisions taken on  or  after  28  July
    2014.  This decision was taken in May 2013, and the applicable  version
    of paragraph 276ADE was therefore the one in force at that date.

33.  Looking at paragraph 276ADE it was accepted on the  appellant's  behalf
    that he had not lived continuously in the UK for at least twenty years.
     By the date of the hearing he had been in the  UK  for  about  fifteen
    years, five  years  short  of  that  figure.   The  unlawful  residence
    requirement was increased from fourteen years to twenty years  in  July
    2012, shortly before the appellant's application was made.

34.  It was also accepted that the appellant had not lived  continuously  in
    the UK for at least seven years before he turned 18.  By  the  time  he
    turned 18 in 2004 he had been in the UK for five years, not seven.   In
    any event the requirement in 276ADE(iv) is in the  present  sense,  and
    the appellant was well over 18 by the date of this application.

35.  It was  also  accepted  by  the  appellant's  representative  that  the
    appellant was not able to meet the requirement in 276ADE(v),  of  being
    between 18 and 25 years in age and having spent at least half his  life
    residing continuously in the UK.  The appellant turned 25  in  December
    2011, and this rule was not introduced until July 2012.   By  the  time
    this application was made he was therefore over 25.

36.   The  only  remaining  aspect  of  paragraph  276ADE,  therefore,   was
    276ADE(vi) which was as follows:

    "(vi)    is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously  in  the  UK
         for less than twenty years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
         but has no ties (including social, cultural  or  family)  with  the
         country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK."

37.  The key issue, therefore, is  whether  the  appellant  has  established
    that he has no ties to Pakistan.   The  meaning  of  "no  ties"  within
    paragraph 276ADE was considered in Ogundimu (Article  8  -  new  rules)
    Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC), by the then  President  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Blake J.  At paragraph 14 of that decision reference was made
    to Home Office written submissions on the point.  The no ties test,  in
    that case in paragraph 399A of the Rules,  was  said  to  mean  "taking
    account of their background as  a  whole,  the  person  has  so  little
    connection with that country as to mean that the consequences for  them
    establishing a private life there would be unjustifiably harsh."  There
    was also a reference to an IDI stating  that  consideration  should  be
    given to whether a person had sufficient knowledge of or connections to
    the country of origin to be able  to  form  an  adequate  private  life
    there.  At paragraphs 122 to 125 of the decision general  guidance  was
    given on the no ties test, also with  reference  to  paragraph  276ADE.
    Ties were said  to  involve  something  more  than  merely  remote  and
    abstract links.  There needed to be a continued connection to  life  in
    the country; something that tied the claimant to his or her country  of
    origin.  It was recognised  that  the  test  under  the  Rules  was  an
    exacting one.  The assessment must be a rounded  one,  considering  all
    the relevant circumstances, and not limited only  to  social,  cultural
    and family circumstances.  The Tribunal also observed  that  each  case
    would turn on its own facts.  In that particular case they decided,  in
    the context of deportation, that a person who was now 28, and had  come
    to the UK as a 6 year old, did not retain any ties to Nigeria.

38.  This particular case appears to me to fall  in  more  of  a  borderline
    area than the facts considered in Ogundimu,  but  nevertheless  I  have
    decided that the appellant does meet the test  of  having  no  ties  to
    Pakistan.  The length of residence in the UK and the age  at  which  he
    arrived appears to me to be central.  Having arrived as a 12  year  old
    his formative years have all been in the UK.   It  is  clear  from  his
    level of English, and the photographs with  his  partner,  that  he  is
    highly westernised.   It  is  true  that  he  has  lived  within  Asian
    communities in London and Scotland, that he continues  to  be  able  to
    speak Urdu and Punjabi, and that he therefore
 retains significant links to a community in the  UK  that  shares  cultural
    and linguistic reference  points  with  Pakistan.   Having  said  that,
    however, he has departed in a very significant way from his culture  by
    establishing a relationship with an Indian national who is a Sikh,  and
    it would also be a mistake to draw a direct link between British  Asian
    communities on the one hand and communities in the Indian  subcontinent
    on the other.

39.    In East London the appellant will  have  grown  up  in  a  culturally
    diverse environment, mixing with people of many different  backgrounds,
    all using English as  a  common  language.   The  fact  that  he  is  a
    practising Muslim, with strong links with Asian families, should not in
    my view be regarded as a matter that somehow makes him less  integrated
    in the UK.  In London in particular, but also in other parts of the UK,
    Asian and other minority ethnic communities are an  important  part  of
    the fabric of British life.

40.  Despite the reservations expressed  above  I  have  accepted  that  the
    appellant's parents were killed in 2001.  I have also accepted that  he
    has lost all contact with his only sibling.  In any  event,  given  the
    role and status of  women  in  Pakistan,  his  sister  will  have  been
    absorbed into her husband's household, and would not be in  a  position
    to offer support or accommodation to the  appellant.   Overall,  taking
    all of the circumstances into account, it therefore appears to me  that
    the consequences for this appellant in  seeking  to  establish  private
    life in Pakistan  at  the  age  of  28,  after  around  fifteen  years'
    residence in the United Kingdom, having been brought here as a 12  year
    old child, would be unjustifiably harsh, bearing in mind in  particular
    the lack of contact with any relatives or friends in that country.

41.  Turning to the public interest factors in the new part 5A of  the  2002
    Act (inserted by section 19  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014),  117B(1)
    counts against the appellant to a significant extent.  This is  because
    he entered illegally, and has remained illegally over a lengthy period.
     The one proviso is that he could not be held responsible, as a 12 year
    old child, for the actions of his father, or his father's  friend.   As
    for 117B(2) the appellant's English was good.  There  are  certificates
    showing that he has taken some English courses.  His level  of  English
    reflects the long period that he has spent in the UK, and this  is  not
    therefore a factor that counts against him.

42.  As for 117B(3) the appellant appears  not  to  have  been  a  financial
    drain during his time in the UK.  He appears to have  been  willing  to
    work.  He is in good  health,  despite  having  had  to  have  a  minor
    operation recently.  Overall it appears likely that, if permitted to do
    so, the appellant would,  based  on  his  past  actions,  work  and  be
    financially independent.

43.  117B(iv) indicates that little weight should  be  given  to  a  private
    life or  a  relationship  established  when  a  person  is  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.  This applies to and  counts  against  the  appellant,  but
    paragraph 276ADE represents the Secretary  of  State's  view  of  those
    circumstances in which applicants can succeed on private life  grounds.
    Both 117B(iv) and 117B(v) cannot be interpreted as having the effect of
    counteracting or reversing the Immigration Rules, and it appears to  me
    that the matters here do not alter the outcome under paragraph 276ADE.

44.  It has not been suggested at any stage  that  the  appellant  has  been
    involved in any criminal activity, or that there are any issues  giving
    rise to the application of the  public  interest  factors  relevant  to
    deportation.

45.  In relation  to  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his  partner  it
    appears to me that this adds  little  either  way.   If  the  appellant
    succeeds in his own right on the basis of having no ties  to  Pakistan,
    under paragraph 276ADE,  then  he  is  not  seeking  to  rely  on  this
    relationship.  In any  event  his  partner's  presence  in  the  UK  is
    temporary.  It is not clear whether she will be given further leave  as
    a  student.   If  the  situation  changes  in  the  future,  then   the
    relationship may become the central  issue,  from  the  perspective  of
    either the appellant or his partner, but at present I have decided that
    the case turns on  the  appellant's  private  life,  through  paragraph
    276ADE.

46.  It has not been suggested that there is any need for anonymity in  this
    appeal, and I make no such order.  Neither side made any mention of any
    fee award.  It is not clear whether a fee was paid.  In any event, even
    if one was paid, I would not make  a  fee  award  because  the  outcome
    turned on oral evidence.

Notice of Decision

47.  The decision dismissing the appellant's appeal is  set  aside  for  the
    reasons given above.  The decision in the appeal is remade as follows.

48.  The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules,  with  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE.
