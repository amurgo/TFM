For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                                  DECISION

   1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for  convenience
      I will refer to the parties as they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal.

   2. The appellants are citizens of Iran.  The first and second  appellants
      are married and the third and fourth appellants are their daughter and
      son respectively.  The appellants were born on 26 May  1963,  23  June
      1963, 16 February 1993 and 19 February 1996 respectively.

   3. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom on  24  May  2008  with
      entry clearance until 16 April 2009  as  a  business  person.   On  14
      December 2009 the first appellant was granted leave to remain  in  the
      United Kingdom until 14 December 2012 as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) under
      the Points Based System in the  Immigration  Rules.   On  10  December
      2012, the first appellant applied  for  further  leave  as  a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) Migrant under para 245DD of the Immigration Rules.   On
      3  April  2013,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   appellant's
      application and made a decision to remove him  by  way  of  directions
      under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   At
      the same time, the Secretary of State refused the applications of  the
      first appellant's family as his dependents under paragraph 319H of the
      Immigration Rules.  The latter applications necessarily failed as they
      were dependent upon the  success  of  the  application  of  the  first
      appellant.

   4. The first appellant (together with his family) appealed to the  First-
      tier Tribunal.  In a determination promulgated on 29 July 2013,  Judge
      Archer allowed the first appellant's appeal and those of his family as
      his dependents.

   5. First, Judge Archer found  that  the  appellant  met  the  maintenance
      requirements of the Rule under Appendix C as, taking into account  the
      first appellant's overdraft facility of �5,000 during the relevant  90
      day period, he had the required  funds  of  �2,700.   Secondly,  Judge
      Archer found that the Secretary of State had acted unfairly in  breach
      of her "evidential flexibility policy" in failing to request from  the
      first appellant signed P11s for  his  employees  as  required  by  the
      Immigration  Rules.   Consequently,  the  Judge  allowed   the   first
      appellant's appeal (and that of his family) to the extent that refusal
      to vary his leave to remain  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.
      Finally, the Judge also allowed the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
      removal decision under s.47 applying the Upper Tribunal's decisions in
      Admally and Jaferi [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC) and Ahmadi  v  SSHD  [2012]
      UKUT 00147 (IAC).

   6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the  basis  that
      the Judge had been wrong to take into account the overdraft facilities
      available to the first appellant in determining  whether  he  had  the
      required funds under Appendix C.  The grounds rely upon  the  decision
      of the Court of Appeal in R (On the  Application  of  Adeyemi-Doro)  v
      SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 849 where at [9] Sullivan LJ stated that:

           "9.   In my judgement where the Rules  says  that  an  applicant
                 "must have the funds specified..." or the  policy  requires
                 migrants to demonstrate that "they hold the required  level
                 of funds", those words "have" and "hold" do not  mean  that
                 an applicant would  qualify  if  he/she  has  an  overdraft
                 available to  them  either  up  to  or  in  excess  of  the
                 specified level of funds.  In the context of Appendix C  to
                 the Rules and in the context of the  policy,  an  applicant
                 has or holds funds of �800 if their credit balance is  �800
                 or more.  That accords with a common  sense  interpretation
                 of the Rules and policy and indeed it is reflected  in  the
                 guidance that was and still is applicable as to the  manner
                 in which the Tier 1 policy in respect of Maintenance  Funds
                 will be applied by the respondent."

   7. On 13 August 2013, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Landes) granted  the
      Secretary of State permission to appeal.

   8. In a Rule 24 response, the appellant accepts  that  Judge  Archer  may
      have made an error of law  in  taking  into  account  the  appellant's
      overdraft facility.  Nevertheless,  the  appellant  in  that  response
      argues that that error was not material.  First, Judge Archer had left
      open consideration of Article 8 and, on the facts, it is  argued  that
      he would have determined  that  issue  in  favour  of  the  appellant.
      Further, it is stated that Judge Archer was right to allow the  appeal
      on the basis that the Secretary of State's decision was unfair and was
      in breach of her evidential flexibility policy.

   9. At the hearing, Ms Hulse accepted that the appellant could not succeed
      under the Rules in reliance upon his overdraft.  She drew my attention
      to the Secretary of  State's  flexibility  policy  and,  although  she
      initially submitted that the Judge  had  been  correct  to  allow  the
      appeal on that basis, having drawn to her attention para 245AA of  the
      Immigration Rules Ms Hulse acknowledged that the appellant  could  not
      succeed under para 245AA.  She  submitted  that,  nevertheless,  Judge
      Archer had failed to consider Article 8 and a decision remained to  be
      made in respect of that.

Discussion

  10. There is no doubt that the Judge erred in  law  in  finding  that  the
      appellant could succeed under the Immigration Rules.  The decision  of
      the Court of Appeal in Adeyemi-Doro) is clear.  In order to  establish
      that he had the required maintenance funds of at least  �2,700  for  a
      period of 90 days prior to the date of application under  Appendix  C,
      the first appellant could not rely upon his  overdraft  facility.   He
      had to show that those funds were actually in his bank account at  the
      relevant time.  In paragraph 27 of his  determination,  Judge  Archer,
      therefore, erred in law  in  finding  that  taking  into  account  the
      overdraft facility the maintenance requirement in Appendix C was  met.
      The appellant could not  establish  this  requirement  and,  for  that
      reason alone under the Immigration Rules failed.

  11. Secondly, in paras 28 and  29  the  Judge  found,  applying  Rodriguez
      (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 0042 (IAC),  that  the  Secretary  of
      State had failed to give the first appellant an opportunity to provide
      documents in proper form (namely signed P11s) in order to rectify  the
      shortcomings of his application when he had submitted unsigned P11s.

  12. At the hearing, there was some discussion about the relevant policy in
      force at the date of the Secretary of State's decision made on 3 April
      2013 in response to the first appellant's application which  was  made
      on 10 December 2012.  Both Ms Hulse and Mr Richards provided me with a
      Home  Office  document  entitled  "Points-based  System  -  Evidential
      Flexibility".  Those documents - one dated 20 May 2013 and  the  other
      dated  7  November  2013  -  make  reference  to  para  245AA  of  the
      Immigration Rules.

  13. Paragraph 245AA has  been  amended  on  a  number  of  occasions.   As
      inserted from 6 September 2012 (by  HC  565)  para  245AA  is  in  the
      following terms:

           "245AA.     Documents not submitted with applications

           a) Where Part 6A of any appendices referred to in Part 6A  state
              that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  UK  Border
              Agency will only consider documents that have been  submitted
              with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider  documents
              submitted  after  the  application  where  subparagraph   (b)
              applies.

           b) The sub-paragraph applies if the applicant has submitted:

                  i) a sequence of documents and some of the  documents  in
                     the sequence have been omitted (for  example,  if  one
                     bank statement from a series is missing);

                 ii) a document in the wrong format; or

                iii) a  document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                     document,  the  UK  Border  Agency  will  contact  the
                     applicant  or  his  representative  in  writing,   and
                     request  the   correct   documents.    The   requested
                     documents must be received by the UK Border Agency  at
                     the address specified in the request within 7  working
                     days of the date of the request.

           c) The UK Border Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
              specified document has not been submitted   (for  example  an
              English language certificate is missing),  or  where  the  UK
              Border  Agency  does  not  anticipate  that  addressing   the
              omission or error referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will  lead
              to a grant because the application will be refused for  other
              reasons."

  14. Para 245AA was further amended by HC 760 on 13 November 2012 and  most
      recently by HC 628 on 1 October 2013.  Those amendments,  inter  alia,
      allow for more flexibility in accepting non-compliant documents rather
      than requesting compliant ones.  In particular, the  amendments  allow
      "exceptionally" for an application to be granted where,  for  example,
      genuine documents are submitted which are not in the correct format or
      are copies.

  15. The version of para 245AA applicable to this appeal is that which came
      into force on 6 September 2012.  As  the  guidance  makes  clear,  the
      amendment made  by  HC  760  on  13  November  2012  only  applies  to
      applications made on or after  13  December  2012.    The  appellant's
      application was made on 10 December 2012 and so is  governed  by  para
      245AA as amended on 6 September 2012 which I have set out above.   For
      completeness, the amendments made by  HC  628  apply  to  applications
      (according to the guidance) decided on or after 1 October 2013.

  16. In my judgement, para 245AA now sets out in the Immigration Rules  the
      Secretary of State's so-called "evidential flexibility"  policy.  That
      is clear from the guidance which in relation to applications  governed
      by para 245AA incorporates as  its  contents  the  substance  of  para
      245AA.  In other words,  since  the  introduction  of  para  245AA  as
      amended from 6 September 2012 (previous versions  were  not  concerned
      with 'flexibility'), there has been no "evidential flexibility" policy
      in existence outside the Rules.

  17. Para 245AA applies to "specified documents" that must be  provided  by
      virtue of Part 6A and any appendices of the Rules.  First,  it  states
      that the UKBA will only consider "specified documents" which have been
      submitted with the application  unless  the  documents  are  submitted
      after the application because para 245AA(b) applies.   Secondly,  para
      245AA(b) applies where an applicant has submitted: (i) a  sequence  of
      documents and some of that sequence are omitted; (ii)  a  document  in
      the wrong format; or (iii) a copy rather than  an  original  document.
      Thirdly, if that document or documents are omitted or a  non-compliant
      document is submitted then the UKBA  will  contact  the  applicant  or
      representative and request that the correct document or  documents  be
      sent within 7 working days.   Fourthly, the UKBA will  not  request  a
      document where the "specified document" has simply not been  submitted
      (unless it is missing from a sequence of documents) or where the  UKBA
      does not anticipate that, even if the specified document is submitted,
      that will lead to a "grant" because the application  will  be  refused
      for other reasons.

  18. Applying the terms of para 245AA, the Secretary of State was not under
      an obligation to  request  further  bank  statements  from  the  first
      appellant.  The first  appellant  did  not  omit  a  document  from  a
      sequence of documents; he did not submit bank statements in the  wrong
      format and he did not submit copies when originals were required.  The
      first appellant submitted the relevant documents  for  the  period  of
      time under the Immigration Rules over which he had to  establish  that
      he had the required funds.  This was simply a case where the documents
      - complete in themselves - did  not  establish  that  the  maintenance
      requirement of the Rules was met.

  19. As regards the P11s, by contrast para 245AA(b) did apply.  These  were
      documents in the "wrong format" in the  sense  that  a  signature  was
      omitted from them.  Nevertheless, the Secretary of State was not under
      an obligation to request corrected documents from the first appellant.
       That  is  because,  by  virtue  of  para  245AA(c),  even  with  that
      documentation the application would be refused  "for  other  reasons",
      namely  the  first  appellant's  failure  to  meet   the   maintenance
      requirement.

  20. Consequently, Judge Archer erred in concluding that the  Secretary  of
      State had acted contrary to her  "evidential  flexibility"  policy  in
      failing to give the first appellant  an  opportunity  to  rectify  the
      omission of signatures from the P11s.  The Judge relies upon the Upper
      Tribunal's decision in Rodriguez.  That case was  concerned  with  the
      Secretary of State's flexibility policy prior  to  para  245AA  coming
      into existence (see [24]).   Para  245AA  did  not  assist  the  first
      appellant in this appeal.

  21. For  these  reasons,  Judge  Archer  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
      appellant's appeal as not being in accordance with the law.

Decision and Disposal

  22. Having indicated that was my  view  at  the  hearing,  Ms  Hulse  took
      instructions in relation to the issue of Article  8.   It  was  common
      ground between the parties that as Judge Archer had failed to reach  a
      decision on whether the appellants' removal would breach Article 8,  a
      decision was now required.  After some discussion with the appellants,
      Ms Hulse invited me to retain the appeal in  the  Upper  Tribunal  but
      adjourn the  hearing  in  order  that  further  preparation  could  be
      undertaken to present the appellants' Article 8 appeal.   Although  Mr
      Richards initially invited me to remit the appeal to Judge  Archer  in
      order to reach findings under Article 8, in the light  of  Ms  Hulse's
      invitation he did not seek to resist the retention of  the  appeal  in
      the Upper Tribunal.

  23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the first appellant's
      appeal involved the making of an  error  of  law.   I  set  aside  the
      decision to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules  and  on  the
      basis  that  the  respondent's  decision  in  relation  to  the  first
      appellant was not in accordance with the law.  The  decisions  of  the
      remaining appellants (as the first appellant's dependants) also cannot
      stand.

  24. I remake the decisions. The  first  appellant's  appeal  is  dismissed
      under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  respondent's  decision  was  in
      accordance with the law.  The appeals of the  other  dependants  under
      the Immigration Rules are also dismissed.

  25. The Judge's decisions to allow the appeals against  the  decisions  to
      remove the appellants under s.47 of the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Act
      2009 stand.

  26. The appeals will be relisted before me  for  a  resumed  hearing  (the
      agreed date is 2 January 2014) in order to  remake  the  decisions  in
      respect of Article 8 of the ECHR.

  27. To the extent that either party wishes to rely on further evidence  at
      that hearing (not before the First-tier  Tribunal),  the  parties  are
      reminded of the need to comply with rule 15A of the Tribunal Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  Any such evidence should be  filed  with
      the Upper Tribunal and served upon the other party no less than 7 days
      before the resumed hearing.
