                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and background

 1. This is an appeal by Mr Aslam (the  appellant)  who  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan born on 23 January 1985.
 2. The respondent refused further leave to remain  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on  human  rights  grounds  on  the  basis  that  there  were
    insurmountable   obstacles   to   him   continuing   his   longstanding
    relationship with  Narender  Kaur  Dhaliwal  if  he  were  returned  to
    Pakistan.  The refusal under the Immigration Rules  was  on  the  basis
    that the appellant did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM of  the
    Immigration Rules and secondly that  he  did  not  meet  the  financial
    requirements of those Rules; both the eligibility requirements and  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM.  The respondent also  considered
    the application under the European Convention on  Human  Rights  (ECHR)
    but  concluded  that  there  were  no  exceptional  reasons   why   the
    application for further leave to remain should be allowed  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.


 3. The appellant appealed the respondent's refusal to Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Clarke (Judge Clarke) who on 28 April 2017 dismissed  the
    appeal. The appellant subsequently  appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    (FTT/UT) Judge Pooler decided that there were several  aspects  of  the
    decision which, arguably, were unsatisfactory.  He  also  said  it  was
    arguably wrong for the judge to fail to make findings as to whether the
    appellant  satisfied  the  �18,600  threshold  set  by   appendix   FM.
    Secondly, it was just arguable that the appellant had been entitled  to
    a further consideration of his claim under the  evidential  flexibility
    policy and thirdly it was  arguable  that  the  Immigration  Judge  had
    failed  to  consider  certain  evidence  in  relation   to   interfaith
    marriages. Finally, it was arguable  that  the  immigration  judge  had
    misdirected himself  in  relation  to  the  precarious  nature  of  the
    appellant's immigration status.

The Hearing

 4. The appellant was represented before me by Mr  Turner  of  Counsel  who
    submitted that two evidential gaps in the application to the respondent
    had been filled. The appellant's partner's pay slips were  included  at
    page 48 of the appellant's bundle produced for the First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing.  That pay slip for April 2015, had not, however, been included
    with the original  application.  The  second  missing  document  was  a
    missing bank statement for  September  2015.  That  document  was  also
    produced in the above-mentioned bundle at the hearing (at  page  60  in
    the bundle of documents).  Mr Turner submitted that the  correct  level
    of maintenance in  this  case  was  �18,600.  It  was  plain  from  the
    documents just mentioned that the appellant met the requirements of the
    relevant appendix to the Rules at that time.  He went on to submit that
    the Islamic law in relation to the country  from  which  the  appellant
    came Pakistan was so strict that it would not  tolerate  an  interfaith
    marriage such as the one on which he had embarked with  Miss  Dhaliwal.
    It was his submission that the Immigration Judge was wrong to say there
    was no credible evidence of the family's difficulties in  reintegrating
    into Pakistan.  The Immigration Judge had failed to have regard to  the
    general interfaith position in Pakistan. If the Immigration  Judge  had
    properly looked at  the  documents  which  were  produced  as  well  as
    considered the objective material, he would have  reached  a  different
    decision. That decision was plainly wrong.  Indeed, Mr Turner  went  so
    far as to describe it as "perverse" to  find  that  the  appellant  can
    continue his family life in Pakistan with Miss Dhaliwal.  He also  said
    that paragraph 276ADE (6) of the Immigration Rules, which provided that
    where an applicant was aged 18 and above and had lived in  the  UK  for
    less than 20 years,  there  had  to  be  "very  significant  obstacles"
    preventing the applicant's return to the country to which he  would  go
    if required to leave the UK. However, he appeared to say  that  in  his
    submission that test  was  satisfied.  Assuming  Paragraph  276ADE  (6)
    applied, the question was whether the  appellant  and  his  wife  could
    relocate to Pakistan.  The answer was "no".  In  his  submission  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to their doing so.  The Immigration Judge
    had not properly dealt with this issue, indeed,  had  perversely  dealt
    with this issue in her decision.

 5. For the reasons just summarised, I was asked to find a  material  error
    of law.  It was accepted by Mr Turner  that  if  I  were  to  find  the
    material error of law it would be necessary to remit the matter  either
    to the Secretary of State for further  consideration  or  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.


Discussion

 6. Having had  an  opportunity  to  thoroughly  consider  the  Immigration
    Judge's decision, I find it to have been adequately reasoned. As  Judge
    Clarke pointed out, in paragraphs  33  et  seq  of  her  decision,  all
    evidence in support of the application should have been submitted  with
    that application (see E - LTR  P.3.1).   It  is  regrettable  that  the
    present Rules are something of an obstacle course to be overcome, and I
    sympathise with an  applicant  trying  to  negotiate  those  obstacles.
    However, I find as a fact that he did not submit the relevant documents
    with his application. Specifically, the appellant failed to  supply  at
    least one payslip (see page 5 of the refusal dated 4 December 2015) and
    he had not provided a letter from his employer who issued  the  payslip
    confirming his employment and gross salary which complied in full  with
    the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  I  understand  it  to  be
    conceded that these documents had not been supplied to  the  respondent
    at that time. It is now contended that the payslip was not produced  to
    the respondent in support of the application. However,  it  is  claimed
    that this payslip  was  produced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    understand it to  be  accepted  that  there  was  no  letter  from  his
    employer, as was clearly required by the Rules,  with  the  appellant's
    application either. This was conceded  by  his  representative  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal. Plainly, I find, the appellant  had  not  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.


 7. It was submitted that the appellant was under an  obligation  to  apply
    the "evidential flexibility policy". By that policy,  first  introduced
    under the points-based scheme, provided that the appellant is guilty of
    only an innocent oversight it is incumbent upon the respondent to point
    out minor positions which can easily be  rectified.  Guidance  in  this
    respect is now to  be  found  in  decision-makers  own  guidance  notes
    available online from the Home Office website  (see  Appendix  FM  1.7:
    Financial Requirement August 2017). The policy describes  a  discretion
    on  the  part  of  decision-makers  to  defer  consideration   of   the
    application pending submission of missing evidence. I  do  not  believe
    there was any obligation respondent in these circumstances, where it is
    not obvious the missing documents would-be supplied within a reasonable
    time or at all. The Upper Tribunal when it considered  the  application
    for permission to appeal in this case described this  ground  as  being
    "just arguable". It is contended in the  grounds  of  appeal  that  the
    respondent failed to follow her own policy,  but  the  grounds  do  not
    specify in what way or ways. Having considered that submission  I  have
    concluded that I not been shown a letter from the appellant's  employer
    that would satisfy the requirements of the Rules.  There  has  been  no
    application under Rule 15A of the  Regulations  2008  to  submit  fresh
    evidence before the Upper Tribunal.  It  was  unclear  precisely  which
    other letters and other documents were relied on, but these should have
    been the subject of a formal application.  Both those would have  post-
    dated the decision in the sense that they were not submitted in support
    of the application. By virtue of the provisions of section  85  (4)  of
    the 2002 Act these documents could have been considered by an appellant
    court but for the reasons given I think it right not to do so  at  this
    late stage.  In the circumstances, they would not be documents  that  I
    should attach weight to.

 8. Secondly, the Immigration Judge dealt fully dealt  fully  with  whether
    there were insurmountable obstacles to  the  appellant  continuing  his
    family life with the sponsor in Pakistan. It  was  incumbent  upon  the
    appellant to show that there were very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    reintegration into Pakistan.  The  Immigration  Judge  noted  that  the
    appellant had been in the UK for less than nine years. He first entered
    the UK with valid leave as long ago as  2008.   The  relationship  with
    Miss Dhaliwal was a longstanding one in  that  they  had  been  married
    since 2012. There was no dispute by the Secretary  of  State  that  the
    marriage is an interfaith one or that their relationship was a  genuine
    and subsisting one. I find the decision not to  have  been  a  perverse
    one.  Judge Clarke did her best to deal with  what  was,  obviously,  a
    difficult issue. The evidence at great length and in some  considerable
    detail. All the relevant authorities were referred to together with the
    objective material consisting of the Country Information  and  Guidance
    on Pakistan: Interfaith Marriage version 1.0 January 2016.


 9. Judge Clarke also considered the refusal in the context of Article 8 on
    the basis that the case could not succeed under the Immigration  Rules.
    I note that as this appeal post-dated the commencement  into  force  of
    the Immigration Act 2014 that is in fact the only basis upon which  the
    appellant could appeal First-tier  Tribunal  (see  section  82  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002). The question  for  Judge
    Clarke was therefore whether it was necessary in order to  respect  the
    appellant's right to family life between himself and the sponsor, or to
    facilitate their future family life together to,  exceptionally,  allow
    the case outside the Immigration Rules under  the  ECHR.  Judge  Clarke
    fully considered this issue against the background of recent  authority
    including the leading cases and Parliament's intervention  in  sections
    117A - 117D of 2002 Act. As Judge Clarke pointed  out  the  Immigration
    Rules included a proportionality exercise.  She  decided  the  case  in
    favour of the public interest in applying  legitimate  and  established
    immigration rules fairly and equally to the facts of the  case.  In  my
    judgment that  decision  was  plainly  open  to  the  on  the  evidence
    presented. The real issue was whether the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
    could continue the family life they had formed together in  the  UK  in
    Pakistan.  In my judgment Judge  Clarke  rightly  concluded  that  they
    could.

Conclusions

10.  Having concluded that I do not think the decision  to  be  perverse,  I
    have also concluded that although another immigration judge might  have
    reached a different conclusion than Judge Clarke, there was no material
    error of law in the way she dealt with the  issue  of  the  appellant's
    protected human rights. I agree with Mr Tarlow that the present  appeal
    amounts  to  a  disagreement  with  the  conclusions  reached  by   the
    Immigration Judge. Her conclusions on the appellant's  protected  human
    rights were clearly justified and the Upper Tribunal will not interfere
    with that decision.

Decision

11.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the  decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to dismiss the appellant's appeal against the application
    to the respondent to refuse leave to remain is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
