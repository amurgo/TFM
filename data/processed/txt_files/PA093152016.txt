               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr C McGinley, Solicitor, Gray & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Kempton dismissing an appeal on protection  and  human  rights
    grounds.



 2. Permission to appeal was granted, in particular, because  of  seemingly
    inconsistent findings in the decision.  It was further contended in the
    grounds that the judge applied too high a standard of proof and did not
    deal adequately with the risk on return, having found the appellant was
    a draft evader.



 3. The appellant is an Iranian Kurd and a Sunni Muslim.  He claims to have
    formed an attachment with a non-Kurdish Iranian girl, "S", whose  faith
    was Shia and whose father was an Imam.  His mother disapproved  of  the
    relationship because of the difference in faith and  ethnicity  so  the
    appellant stopped seeing the girl.  He then discovered  that  the  girl
    was pregnant by a friend of his,  "M",  whose  father  worked  for  the
    Etelaat.  The girl's family blamed the appellant for the pregnancy and,
    as the appellant had no one to protect him,  he  fled  from  Iran.   He
    feared  the  Imam  would  have  him  executed   for   unlawful   sexual
    intercourse.  The Imam disliked  the  appellant's  family  because  the
    appellant's father  had  supported  the  KDPI,  as  did  the  appellant
    himself.  The appellant's father had  been  shot  and  wounded  by  the
    Etelaat and left disabled as a result.  At around the time he left Iran
    the appellant was called up for military service.



 4. The  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  findings  of  fact  at
    paragraphs 35-41.  At paragraph  40,  in  considering  the  appellant's
    relationship with the girl, the judge recorded: "It  is  possible  that
    his account of this relationship was true and that the events he  spoke
    of did occur leaving the appellant exposed as the fall guy of the tryst
    between [S] and [M].   If  [S]  were  in  fact  pregnant,  which  seems
    unlikely, unless [M] forced himself upon her, one  could  see  how  [S]
    might have been forced to confess there was  a  relationship  with  the
    appellant, having been put under pressure  by  [M]  to  lie  about  his
    involvement.  However, all this is speculation as the appellant  really
    knows very little about the matter.  The appellant's position  is  that
    [M]'s father was in a powerful position in the village but  this  comes
    latterly from his mother as he knows  nothing  of  the  matter  direct.
    Clearly the appellant and [M] would not have moved in the  same  social
    circles and so the appellant might not know much about that  other  boy
    and his family."



 5. At paragraph 41, the judge records: "The appellant's account  is  vague
    on many levels and yet it has remained consistent  in  its  account  of
    this relationship having been turned against him."



 6. Then, at paragraph 43 the  judge  expresses  further  findings  in  the
    following terms: "I suspect that the catalyst for  his  departure  from
    Iran, was being called up for military service.  It may  well  be  that
    his father is disabled as a result of long  past  KDPI  activities  and
    that his mother works in a bakery.  However, the  relationship  with  a
    Shia girl, who is the daughter of the local Imam seems highly unlikely.
     I cannot accept that the appellant  would  be  so  naï¿½ve  as  to  even
    imagine that such a relationship could ever be possible, especially  if
    he believed the Imam to be involved with the Etelaat, the enemy of  his
    father's ideological past with the KDPI.  The whole scenario is  simply
    not believable at all."



 7. In the space of a few paragraphs the judge moves from a position  where
    the appellant's account of his relationship with [S] and its  aftermath
    is possibly true and has remained consistent to one where it is "simply
    not believable at all".  In  addition,  in  expressing  her  underlying
    thoughts it would seem that the judge has laid herself open to the same
    criticism she makes of the appellant  -  that  of  "speculation".   The
    judge's  findings  are  unclear  and  are  not  supported  by  adequate
    reasoning.  Because of this the findings cannot stand.



 8. Mr Matthews mentioned the issue of  draft  evasion  in  his  submission
    before me.  It appears that the judge was not addressed on this at  the
    hearing, although she referred to it in relation to the risk on return.
     Mr  Matthews  cautioned  against  conflating  the  issues  surrounding
    illegal exit from Iran with  those  arising  from  draft  evasion.   He
    acknowledged that it was difficult to be satisfied that the judge dealt
    with risk at the point of return from an informed point of view.



 9. I am satisfied that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law
    by  not  making  clear  findings  supported  by   adequate   reasoning.
    Accordingly her decision is set aside.  As proper findings of fact  are
    still to be made, the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to
    be reheard by a different judge  with  no  findings  by  Judge  Kempton
    preserved.


    Conclusions

10. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.



11. The decision is set aside.



12. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the  decision  to
    be re-made at a hearing before a different judge with no findings  from
    the earlier decision preserved.

Anonymity

13. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity  direction.   As  the
    asylum appeal is to be reheard I will make such a direction to preserve
    the positions of the parties until the appeal is  decided.   Unless  or
    until a tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  no  report  of  these
    proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant or  any
    member of his family.  This direction applies to the appellant  and  to
    the respondent.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  may  lead  to
    contempt of court proceedings.
