Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant Akmal Hussain born 15th October  1988  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan. He applied for leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant under the Points Based System  and  this  was
    refusal by the Respondent on 23rd September 2014.

 2. The Appellant entered the UK  as  a  student  in  March  2011  and  was
    thereafter granted a renewed student  visa  valid  until  30th  January
    2014. He followed this with his Tier  4  application  and  it  is  that
    application which was refused by the Respondent.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the Respondent's decision and his appeal
    came before Judge Wilson on 29th December 2014. The Appellant  attended
    the hearing accompanied by a Mackenzie  friend.  The  Judge  took  oral
    evidence from the Appellant, considered the documentary evidence before
    him and in a thorough and detailed determination dismissed his appeal.

 4. The central issue before the Judge revolved around whether at the  date
    of decision, the Appellant had achieved the 30  points  required  under
    Appendix A with reference  to  paragraph  245ZX(c)  with  reference  to
    paragraph 116(c) of the Immigration Rules (attributes).

 5. The Judge found that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the  attributes
    requirements because he did not have a valid Confirmation of Acceptance
    for Studies (CAS). This was because the Appellant's college sponsor had
    withdrawn the Appellant's CAS. Thus the Judge found the  Appellant  did
    not meet the requirements for the attributes and dismissed the appeal.

 6. The Appellant sought and was granted permission to appeal. The  grounds
    seeking permission are set out in the FtT's grant  and  are  reproduced
    here  as follows;


         "The unrepresented appellant's grounds are that:
          a) the Judge erred in his construction  of  the  Policy  Guidance
             v.10/13 as ï¿½40 of the Guidance states that "Where your CAS has
             been withdrawn or cancelled,  the  same  procedures  apply  as
             where a CAS becomes invalid";
          b) the Judge should  have  allowed  the  appeal  given  that  the
             respondent did not follow her own published guidance i.e.  she
             issued the refusal notice without delaying the refusal for  60
             days and without writing to the appellant informing him of the
             date by which he should provide a new CAS;
          c) the appellant made no admissions as to  the  validity  of  his
             CAS;
          d) there is a legitimate expectation that the  application  would
             be dealt with in a timely manner;
          e) the Judge misapplied EK (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ
             1517."

    In granting permission the FtT said;


         "The purported admission in [10] merely indicates that at the  date
         of hearing the appellant did not have a valid CAS, not that his CAS
         was invalid at the date of  application  (16.01.2014)  or  decision
         (23.09.2014). It is clear from the "CAS Details"  produced  by  the
         respondent that the CAS was assigned on 14 January 2014 and expired
         on 15 July 2014, and was thus expired and/or withdrawn prior to the
         date of decision on 23 September 2014. Consequently, it is arguable
         that the appellant has been the victim of  delay,  particularly  as
         the respondent's refusal letter gives no other reason for it having
         been withdrawn."

Thus the matter comes before the Upper Tribunal.

UT Hearing/Error of Law

 7. The Appellant did not attend the hearing which was set down at Bradford
    on 22nd June 2015. I was satisfied that notice of the hearing had  been
    properly served upon him at his last registered address. No message  or
    other communication was relayed to  the  Tribunal  explaining  his  non
    appearance. In the circumstances I saw no reason not  to  proceed  with
    the hearing forthwith.

 8. Mrs Pettersen on behalf of the Respondent made  submissions.  In  short
    her submissions amounted to saying that the decision of the FtT  was  a
    clear reasoned one and that the Judge had  properly  directed  himself.
    She added that Judge Wilson had clearly grasped the point on  why  this
    Appellant's case was not on all fours with  EK  (Ivory  Coast)  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1517. The grant of permission was incorrect. The  point
    being that this is not a  case  where  the  college  licence  has  been
    withdrawn; it is a case that the Appellant's licence has been withdrawn
    by the college. There is evidence in the documents that the  withdrawal
    of the CAS was made on 9th July 2014 (Annex  D)  and  that  is  a  week
    before 15th July 2014 expiry date of the CAS. There has been no delay.

 9. Mrs Pettersen further submitted that the  grounds  granting  permission
    are wrong in implying that the Respondent was at fault for her  refusal
    letter not providing a reason for the CAS being withdrawn.  That  is  a
    matter for the college; not for the Secretary of State. The simple fact
    is that the college withdrew the CAS before it  expired  and  thus  the
    Appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules.

Consideration

10. I find merit in Mrs Pettersen's  submissions.  The  Appellant  has  not
    taken the opportunity to pursue his claim. Judge Wilson in a clear  and
    thorough determination makes a finding which deals with  the  issue  of
    delay in [10]. He goes on to set out fully in [11] the lack of interest
    shown by the Appellant in engaging or  finding  out  why  the  CAS  was
    withdrawn. After making clear findings that  the  Appellant  could  not
    meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  the  Judge  went  on,
    possibility unnecessarily, to see if  the  Appellant's  claim  was  one
    which provided good grounds for settling his appeal outside the  Rules.
    He found that any application made outside the Rules had no merit.

Decision

11.  For the foregoing reasons the decision of  Judge  Wilson  contains  no
    error of law. The determination shall stand. This appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
