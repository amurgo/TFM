Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The claimant whom I shall refer to as the appellant as she  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal is a citizen of Nigeria and her date  of  birth
    is 17 May 1985.

2.   On 23 January 2014 the  appellant  made  an  application  to  vary  her
    leave.  On 24 January 2012 she was granted leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Migrant.  This leave expired  on  24  January  2014.   Her
    application was considered by the Secretary of  State  under  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  It was the view of the  Secretary  of
    State that the appellant could not meet the requirement  of  276ADE(vi)
    of the Rules because it was not accepted that  she  had  no  ties  with
    Nigeria.

3.   The Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  there  were  no  exceptional
    circumstances preventing the appellant continuing  family  and  private
    life outside the UK.  The date of the Secretary of State's decision  is
    21 February 2014.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and her appeal was allowed by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Upper Tribunal Judge Joshi in a decision that  was  promulgated  on  16
    March  2015.   Judge  Joshi  allowed  the  appeal  under   Article   8.
    Permission to appeal against that decision was granted to the Secretary
    of State by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page on 5 May 2015.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   The appellant's case rested on her claim to private life  here  in  the
    UK.  She has a Masters degree here and has held  various  positions  of
    employment here.  At the date of the hearing she  was  employed,  on  a
    full-time basis, by Transport for London as customer services assistant
    and she was earning ï¿½29,140 per  annum.   Her  evidence  was  that  she
    supports her family.  Her parents are in Nigeria and her father  is  in
    poor health.  She has two brothers, one in the United  States  and  the
    other in Cyprus.  Both are studying and she supports them.  Her life in
    the UK revolves around writing poetry, employment and the church.  Some
    of her poems have been published in a magazine and on various  websites
    and she attends creative writing and poetry workshops and  performances
    here.  Her evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that in  Nigeria
    the internet is expensive and she would not have work, accommodation or
    money.  She would struggle to continue to write there.  The judge found
    the appellant to be credible and accepted her evidence.

6.   The judge made the following findings:

         "23. In relation to Article 8 and exceptional circumstances, I have
             considered the decision in Regina v Secretary of State for the
             Home Department ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, in particular,
             the 5 step approach to dealing with Article 8 cases.  Firstly,
             I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  removal  will   be   an
             interference by a public authority with the  exercise  of  the
             appellant's  right  to  respect   for   private   life.    The
             appellant's private  life  consists  of  her  voluntary  work,
             poetry,  writing,  employment,  friends,  family,  Church  and
             childcare.


         24.  Secondly, I have considered  whether  such  interference  will
             have consequences of such gravity  as  potentially  to  engage
             Article 8.  I am  persuaded  that  the  consequences  for  the
             appellant and her family if she is  removed  from  the  United
             Kingdom will be grave.  Her brothers are unlikely to  be  able
             to continue with their education and she  is  unlikely  to  be
             able to pursue her writing and poetry activities in Nigeria to
             the extent that she can do so  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
             appellant's parents are likely to be financially dependent  on
             her and will face difficulties to pay for  their  medical  and
             living expenses if she is forced to  give  up  her  employment
             with Transport for London.


         25.  I have also considered whether the appellant's  removal  would
             be  in  accordance  with  the  law,  whether  the  removal  is
             necessary  in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
             safety, economic well-being  of  the  country,  prevention  of
             crime, protection of health/morals or rights and  freedoms  of
             others.  I have also taken into account whether the removal is
             proportionate to the legitimate public aim to operate  a  fair
             and coherent system of immigration control.   I  am  satisfied
             that the appellant does not pose a risk to  national  security
             or public safety, she has been law-abiding since  her  arrival
             in the United Kingdom.  She is benefitting the economic  well-
             being of the country by working and paying her taxes.  Section
             19  of  the  Immigration  Act   2014   introduced   into   the
             Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,   Part   5A
             containing sections 117A-117D.   I  have  considered  sections
             117A-117D  as  set  out  in  statutory  guidelines.   I   have
             considered sections 117A-117D and conclude that the  appellant
             speaks English; has not committed any crimes and has been self-
             sufficient since her arrival in the United Kingdom.   She  has
             undertaken several educational courses and has  been  employed
             in numerous jobs since she was given leave to work.   She  has
             provided evidence of her active involvement and commitment  to
             public service by volunteering for charities, volunteering for
             children's  groups,  attending  her  local  Church  and  local
             community groups.  I am satisfied that she would not  be  able
             to  freely  undertake  the  activities  that   she   currently
             undertakes  and  her  brothers   and   parents   will   suffer
             financially and emotionally if she were to be removed from the
             United Kingdom.  Her job prospects and life ambitions will  be
             gravely restricted.  I am satisfied that her removal would not
             be proportionate after balancing the need to  operate  a  fair
             and coherent system  of  immigration  control  as  against  an
             individual's right to respect for private life.


         26.  The appellant gave credible evidence at  the  hearing.   I  am
             satisfied that the appellant's passion for poetry and ambition
             to become a published author and  poet  is  one  of  her  main
             goals.  She demonstrated that she is a young woman whose  life
             revolves around her creative writing, poetry and  performance.
             She is passionate about her art and has  future  ambitions  to
             progress and further her interest.  She appears to be a gifted
             poet having had some of her work published and  she  regularly
             undertakes and organises spoken word  performances.   She  has
             established a website with  a  blog  on  which  she  regularly
             uploads her articles and poetry  and  she  connects  with  and
             supports other  writers.   The  appellant  stipulates  in  her
             witness statement that her creative writing and poetry is  her
             life and that if she is made to return to Nigeria this part of
             her life would end.  I am satisfied  that  this  is  her  main
             passion in life and that an interference  with  her  right  to
             enjoy her artistic freedom could, taken  with  other  factors,
             amount to a breach of her right to respect for private life.


         27.  I accept Mr Shane's helpful submissions  that  Nigeria  has  a
             functioning economy and that she  is  likely  to  be  able  to
             access the internet in Nigeria and should be  able  to  update
             her website and write her blogs, although she  may  experience
             some  difficulties  relating  to  electricity   supplies   and
             connections.  I do not accept, however, that she will be  able
             to perform, network, and attend workshops to anyway  near  the
             extent that she is currently able to in the United Kingdom.


         28.  I accept the respondent's reasoning in so far as the  standard
             of living will not be the same for the appellant  in  Nigeria,
             however, I find that there are good reasons to add  weight  to
             her  claim  for  leave  on  human  rights,  compassionate  and
             discretionary grounds, after  taking  into  account  her  life
             being  defined  by  her  passion  and  ambition  for  writing,
             childcare, financial  contribution  to  the  economy  and  her
             family.   I  have  taken  into  account  the  decision  in  UE
             (Nigeria) and  others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2010] EWCA Civ 975 and LU 30.10.2010 in which  the
             Court of Appeal held that the issue of community value can  be
             one  factor,  but  not  necessarily  the  main  factor,   when
             assessing proportionality.  The public interest  in  retaining
             in the United Kingdom someone who is of value to the community
             could be relevant to the exercise of immigration  control.   I
             accept that this factor in isolation would not  be  sufficient
             to shift the balance in favour of the appellant but  it  is  a
             relevant consideration.  The appellant's  voluntary  work  and
             contributions to the Church, children's nurseries and creative
             writing blogs  has  benefitted  the  community  and  it  is  a
             relevant  factor  when  considering  the  legitimate  aim   of
             immigration  control  and  the  private  life  claim  of   the
             appellant.  I find that the loss of a positive contribution to
             the community affects the issue  of  public  interest  in  the
             proportionality test under Article 8.


         29.  I have borne in mind the decisions in the cases of  Nasim  and
             others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 25 (IAC) where the judgments of
             the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v Secretary of State for
             the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72 were considered.   However,
             the facts  of  the  appellant's  case  can  be  differentiated
             because of the contribution she makes to her community, to her
             family and to the economy.  I have  considered  the  financial
             contribution she makes to the United Kingdom economy  and  the
             financial contribution she makes to her family.  The appellant
             provided  plausible  evidence  of  her  attempts   to   secure
             employment  in  Nigeria.   At  the  hearing,   the   appellant
             confirmed that the only employment she was able to secure  was
             either voluntary work through contacts or one job that offered
             to pay her 50,000 Naira [equivalent of ï¿½160 per  month].   Her
             current salary from her employment with Transport  for  London
             is significantly more, in the region of ï¿½2,400 per  month.   I
             am satisfied that  her  job  prospects  in  Nigeria  would  be
             limited and her earning capacity would be minimal compared  to
             the salary that she is earning in  the  United  Kingdom.   She
             stated that she is unlikely to maintain the financial  support
             that she provides for her family should  she  be  required  to
             leave the United Kingdom.


         30.  The appellant's  brothers  have  immigration  restrictions  on
             working.  The appellant is therefore financially  contributing
             to the cost of her brother's university fees.  I accept, on  a
             balance of probabilities, that it is highly likely  that  they
             will not be able to afford their university  fees  should  the
             appellant be required to leave the United  Kingdom  and  hence
             lose her job with Transport of London.  A  further  factor  is
             the support she provides to her parents and in particular, her
             father who is in ill-health.  Her evidence at the hearing  was
             credible and  I  am  satisfied  that  she  also  supports  her
             parents.  The appellant described  at  the  hearing  that  her
             parents are now living in a room at her  grandparent's  house.
             Her uncle and his family also live there.  This was consistent
             with the letter provided by her mother confirming the evidence
             that she gave at the hearing.  The appellant also stated  that
             if she is returned to Nigeria she will not have a  home,  work
             or money to support herself.  I have considered  the  decision
             of the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  39.
             In this case the court considered whether or  not  a  Tribunal
             should consider the family life of  all  the  relevant  family
             members, when considering an appeal that raised Article 8,  or
             whether the Tribunal should only consider the family  life  of
             the individual who had brought the appeal.  The House of Lords
             decided that the  family  life  of  all  the  relevant  family
             members should be considered.  I have borne this in mind  when
             assessing the proportionality of removing the  appellant  from
             the United Kingdom."


Grounds of Appeal and Oral Submissions

7.   The grounds of appeal are threefold.  The  first  ground  is  that  the
    judge failed to properly consider Article 8 in the context  of  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act.  The second ground  is  that  the  judge  wrongly
    applied the case of Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL  39  and  the  third
    ground is that the judge  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  why  the
    appellant would be unable to pursue her goal of  becoming  a  published
    author should she return to Nigeria.

8.   I heard oral submissions from  both  parties.   Mr  Kandola  made  oral
    submissions in the  context  of  the  grounds  of  appeal.   Mr  Chohan
    submitted that there was no error of law in the decision of  the  judge
    who found the appellant to be credible.  She had always had leave  here
    in the UK and had always been here legally.  The  judge  accepted  that
    the appellant was a gifted and talented  writer  and  this  amounts  to
    exceptional circumstances.  In addition the dependency of her  brothers
    on the appellant amounted to exceptional circumstances.  Her  situation
    was  unique  and  it  was  open  to  the  judge  to   find   compelling
    circumstances and allow the appeal under Article 8.

Error of Law

9.   I am satisfied that the judge did  not  have  regard  to  the  relevant
    parts of Section 117B of the 2002 Act.   The  judge  did  not  properly
    direct  himself  to  the  effect  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is in the public interest according to Section 117B
    (1). I am not satisfied that the judge had  proper  regard  to  Section
    117B (5) which states that little weight should be given to  a  private
    life established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
    status is precarious.  She has been in the UK since 2010. Initially she
    came here as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant and she  subsequently  obtained
    further leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant which expired on 23
    January 2014.  Having had regard to the recent decision of AM (S  117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260, it is clear that on the facts of this case the
    appellant's immigration status though not unlawful is precarious.

10.  The judge impermissibly extended the judgment in Beoku-Betts v SSHD  to
    benefit the appellant in this case.  The appellant's brothers, as found
    by the judge, dependent on her; however, they do not form part  of  her
    family life in the UK.  There will be no  disruption  to  their  family
    life in the UK should the appellant be removed. The judge did not  find
    that she would have no prospects as a writer in  Nigeria  but  that  it
    such a career would be more difficult to pursue.

11.  For the above reasons I find that the judge materially erred and I  set
    aside the decision to allow the appeal under Article 8(2)  pursuant  to
    Section 12(2) (a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007
    ("the 2007 Act").  Both parties agreed that should the decision be  set
    aside I could go on and remake it and that there was no need for a  re-
    hearing. There was no further evidence submitted.  The judge found that
    the appellant is a credible witness and accepted her account and  there
    was no reason for me to go behind  those  findings  as  they  were  not
    challenged by the Secretary of State and are lawful and sustainable.

12.  The appellant's claim rests solely on her private life here in the  UK.
     Although there is no general proposition that leave to  remain  should
    only be granted in exceptional cases, this is  an  appeal  that  relies
    solely on private life which has been established in the United Kingdom
    at a time when the presence of the appellant was precarious  and  where
    there are no children involved.  There is no challenge to the  decision
    of the Secretary of State that the appellant is not able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and the Tribunal is  required  to
    give the new Rules "greater weight than as merely a starting point  for
    the consideration  of  the  proportionality  of  an  interference  with
    Article 8 rights" (see Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  551.   The
    appellant's interests at stake are not in this case of such a  pressing
    nature that leave should be granted outside the rules.

13.  The appellant would be able to work, write and contribute in  some  way
    towards the upkeep of her family should she return to Nigeria.  She  is
    well educated and has varied work experience.  She has been here for  a
    relatively short period of time and has family in Nigeria.  Having  had
    regard to the relevant sections of  117B  as  outlined  above  and  the
    decisions of Nasim and Others (Article 8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025  and  MG
    (Assessing interference with private life) Serbia and Montenegro [2005]
    UKAIT 00113, I conclude that the decision of the Secretary of State  is
    proportionate.

14.      Mr Chohan stated that  the  appellant  intended  to  serve  further
    evidence which would establish that she has been sending money  to  her
    brothers abroad.  I indicated to him that the  evidence  has  not  been
    served in accordance with the directions of the Upper Tribunal and,  in
    any event, such evidence would not be material because it was  accepted
    by the First-tier Tribunal that she sent money to her brother and there
    was no reason to interfere with this finding.

Notice of Decision

15.  I dismiss the appeal under Article 8 of the 1950  Convention  on  human
    rights.

16.  No anonymity direction is made.
