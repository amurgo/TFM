Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Adophy, Counsel, instructed by Saintta
                    International Lawyers UK
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of China and are mother and daughter,  born
    on 10 October 1968 and 20 September 1998, respectively. Where  I  refer
    to "the appellant", that is a reference either to the  first  appellant
    or to both appellants.  On 12  December  2014  the  respondent  refused
    their  applications  for  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  and  child,
    respectively, with reference to Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.
    Their appeals against those decisions came before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Roots ("the FtJ") at a hearing on 21 April 2016, following  which
    the appeals were  dismissed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

 2. For the detailed reasons given in the notice of decision by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer ("ECO"), it was not accepted that the  appellant  and
    the  sponsor  were  married  or  that  any  such  marriage  was  valid.
    Accordingly, the decision was refused in that respect with reference to
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM and  E-ECP.2.7.   Furthermore,  it
    was concluded with reference to  E-ECP.2.6  and  2.10  that  the  first
    appellant had not established that her relationship with the sponsor is
    genuine and subsisting or that they intend to live together permanently
    in the UK.

 3. So far as the financial requirements of the Rules are concerned, it was
    concluded that the appellants had not demonstrated, with  reference  to
    the specified evidence, that the sponsor earns a  gross  income  of  at
    least �22,400 from self-employment.  The amount of cash savings was not
    held continuously for the previous six months  and  in  any  event  was
    below the required threshold of �72,000.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The FtJ set  out  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  in  terms  of  the
    eligibility, relationship requirements, and the financial requirements.
     In terms of the relevant period that needed to be satisfied  in  terms
    of those financial requirements, it was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that the required income needed to be  shown  for  the  last
    full financial year, which in the case of the  application  before  him
    made in November 2014, would have been April 2013 to  April  2014.   It
    was submitted that the 12 months prior to the date of  application  was
    the relevant period.

 5. Noting that neither party had referred him to the  relevant  paragraphs
    of Appendix FM-SE, the FtJ referred to paragraph 13, which  is  to  the
    effect that for a self-employed person the gross annual income  is  the
    total of his gross income in the last full financial year.  Given  that
    the sponsor's company was only registered on  1  August  2013,  it  was
    accepted on behalf of the appellant that the appellant could  not  show
    the required income for the 2013 - 2014 financial year.   He  concluded
    that the relevant period is the last full financial year, according  to
    paragraph 13(e) of Appendix FM-SE.

 6. In relation to the  submission  that  the  sponsor's  income  could  be
    augmented by savings, he concluded that that submission was contrary to
    paragraph 13(f), which is to the effect that a  person  cannot  combine
    their gross annual income with specified savings in order to  meet  the
    level of income required under Appendix FM.

 7. In terms of the submissions to the effect that  evidential  flexibility
    should have been applied, the FtJ was not referred to any Rule in  that
    respect.

 8. In relation to the financial requirements of the Rules, he  found  that
    the appellant was not able to establish that  those  requirements  were
    met, the appellant not being able to show the required income  for  the
    2013  -  2014  financial  year  for  the  sponsor.   Furthermore,   the
    appellants had failed to submit specified evidence, as set out  in  the
    decision letter.

 9. In terms of the relationship requirements of the Rules,  the  FtJ  said
    that because the appeal could not succeed under the Rules in  terms  of
    the financial requirements, he did not need to make a  finding  on  the
    marriage or the relationship.  He said  that  there  were  "significant
    doubts" about the validity of the marriage and whether the relationship
    is genuine and subsisting.  He noted that the appellants relied in part
    on documents which were not properly translated, also noting  that  the
    evidence of ongoing contact was limited.   The  evidence  of  financial
    remittances he described as "sporadic".  He stated that if  he  had  to
    make findings they would probably be that the parties were married  but
    that the relationship is no  longer  genuine  and  subsisting  "as  the
    evidence for this is weak, given that the sponsor has been  in  the  UK
    since 1999, as set out in the decision letter".

10. Nevertheless, he went on to state that for the purposes of Article 8 he
    would assume that there was a valid  marriage  which  was  genuine  and
    subsisting.

11. In dealing with Article 8 outside  the  Rules  he  concluded  that  the
    appellants had provided little evidence to  support  their  case.   The
    sponsor had lived in the UK since 1999, when the second  appellant  was
    aged about 1 year.  He concluded that the evidence of  contact  by  the
    sponsor with his family in China since then is very limited.  He  noted
    that the respondent's decision dealt with Article 8  proper  only  very
    briefly, and had  said  that  no  exceptional  circumstances  had  been
    advanced.  He referred to the grounds of appeal,  which  only  made  an
    extremely brief reference to Article  8  but  no  details  having  been
    given.  He noted the  witness  statements  of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor, and the details of their relationship and their child.

12. He referred to the fact that there were a few undated  photographs  and
    some QQ  Chat  records  for  a  limited  period,  but  in  Chinese  and
    untranslated.  He afforded those documents little weight, he said.   He
    noted that there was some limited evidence  of  financial  remittances,
    and some further evidence in that respect provided at  the  hearing  of
    two  transactions  in  mid-2015  but  again   unsupported   by   proper
    translations.  Again, he gave that evidence little weight.

13. It was concluded by the FtJ that there were no compelling circumstances
    requiring a consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules, finding  that
    it  would  be  difficult  to  see  how  there   could   be   compelling
    circumstances when the parties had lived apart for over 16  years.   In
    any  event,  he  found  that  even  if  there  were   such   compelling
    circumstances requiring such consideration  outside  the  Rules,  there
    would  in  any  event  be  only  very  limited  interference  with  the
    appellants' private and family lives.  The appellants  had  given  very
    sparse details of any such claimed  interference  and  they  had  lived
    apart from the sponsor for 16  years.   He  found  that  matters  could
    continue as they had done for the past 16 years.

14. In the alternative however, he stated that if he was wrong about  those
    earlier conclusions, it was nevertheless the case that any interference
    would be proportionate.  He referred to the considerations under s.117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the  2002  Act"),
    which he had previously quoted.  He  referred  to  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control and the failure of the appellants  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules.  He said that that  was  clearly  a  weighty
    factor.  He found that there was no evidence that the appellants  could
    speak English and they have not shown that they  would  be  financially
    independent as the sponsor had not met the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules as  at  the  date  of  application.   He  repeated  that  the
    appellants had provided very little evidence as to  how  their  private
    and family lives would be impacted by  the  decision  in  circumstances
    where they had lived apart from the sponsor for  16  years.   He  noted
    that very limited submissions on proportionality were made on behalf of
    the appellants.

15. Lastly, noting that  there  had  been  delays  since  the  respondent's
    decision and the appeal hearing, he said  that  the  matter  goes  both
    ways, the appellants having had ample time to bolster their  Article  8
    arguments and evidence, which they had failed to do.

    The grounds of appeal and submissions

16. Although permission to appeal was only granted on grounds 3  and  4,  I
    set out all the grounds, for the sake of clarity.   Ground  1  asserted
    that a strict interpretation of the  Rules  led  the  FtJ  to  reach  a
    perverse conclusion in terms of the sponsor's income.  The sponsor  had
    provided evidence that he had been self-employed and  paid  tax  for  a
    period of 12 months, and the proper course would have been for the  FtJ
    to conclude that the Rules were not a complete code and that he  should
    have gone on to consider whether or not the 12 months' evidence met the
    financial threshold.

17. Ground 2 states that the FtJ made no finding of  fact  on  whether  the
    appellant and the sponsor have a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.
    In terms of the FtJ's hypothetical  conclusion  that  if  he  had  been
    forced to decide he would have decided that the  relationship  was  not
    subsisting, it is argued that that was a conclusion that was  in  error
    on the facts.  It was argued in the grounds that the failure to make  a
    proper finding on the relationship is an error of law which feeds  into
    the Article 8 assessment.

18. Ground 3 asserts error in the conclusion that the appeal did not reveal
    any compelling circumstances  warranting  consideration  of  Article  8
    outside the Rules.  The factor of separation for a period of  16  years
    was a relevant factor, and a rational decision-maker would  have  found
    compelling circumstances requiring the family to be  brought  together,
    after such a long period of separation.  It is  further  asserted  that
    the conclusion that matters could continue as they  had  done  for  the
    past 16 years was unexplained.

19. Ground 4 contends simply that the FtJ failed to mention that the appeal
    involved a child, and the failure to consider the rights of  the  child
    and how the decision affects them (presumably the family) is a material
    error of law.

20. In submissions, Mr Adophy relied on his skeleton argument provided  for
    the hearing before me.  It was submitted that although  permission  was
    only granted on two of the grounds, the grounds comprised  a  composite
    whole.   It  was  submitted  that  there  were  "very  many  evidential
    failings" in the FtJ's assessment.  There was clear  evidence,  it  was
    submitted, to show that monies had been remitted to  the  appellant  by
    the sponsor and that the first  appellant  had  undertaken  an  English
    language test.  There was evidence in the appellant's bundle of  visits
    by the sponsor to China, correspondence between them  and  evidence  of
    communication via QQ Chat, as well as telephone communication.

21. Although the FtJ concluded  that  the  sponsor  had  not  provided  the
    specified evidence as to income, that does not mean that the  funds  do
    not exist.  That was a factor to be taken into account in the Article 8
    assessment.

22. Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  the  appellants  had  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements  of  the  Rules.   They  needed  therefore,  to  establish
    compelling circumstances for a consideration of Article 8  outside  the
    Rules.  It does not matter that  there  was  evidence  that  money  was
    available.  The Rules were not met.

23. Furthermore, the parties had  been  separated  for  16  years  and  the
    sponsor appears to have  gone  back  only  four  times.   The  FtJ  was
    entitled to conclude that that situation could  continue.   The  s.117B
    provisions applied to entry clearance cases.  Reliance  was  placed  on
    the decision in Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo)
    & Ors [2015] EWCA 387.

24. Even if it could be said that the grounds incorporate  a  challenge  to
    the FtJ's factual findings, the assertions do  not  indicate  that  any
    error in those respects could have affected the outcome of the  appeal.
    The FtJ had considered the appeals in the alternative.

25. In reply, Mr Adophy submitted that if the FtJ had believed  that  there
    was no genuine and subsisting relationship,  the  enquiry  should  have
    ended there.  That indicates that the decision  is  materially  flawed.
    The sponsor came to the UK and was granted indefinite leave  to  remain
    in 2010, becoming a British citizen in 2014.  It was  conceivable  that
    he was not able to return to China until 2010 and  there  was  evidence
    that he did not go back before then.

    My conclusions

26. As previously indicated, permission was not granted on grounds 1 and  2
    and there was no renewed application for permission in respect of those
    grounds.  It is not therefore necessary for  me  to  say  much  further
    about grounds 1 and 2.  Suffice to say, the appellant plainly failed to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules for the  detailed  reasons
    given in the ECO's decision, as found  by  the  FtJ.   In  relation  to
    ground 2, that relates to a hypothetical finding by the FtJ in terms of
    the appellant's  relationship  with  the  sponsor.   Had  he  concluded
    definitively that there was no valid marriage, and the relationship was
    not genuine and subsisting, those would have been conclusions  entirely
    open to him on the evidence, in the light of the  detailed  conclusions
    given by the ECO in the decision.

27.  As  regards  the  FtJ's  conclusion  that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances meriting consideration of Article 8  outside  the  Rules,
    again that was  a  conclusion  that  was  entirely  open  to  him.   No
    compelling circumstances were evident in the appeal, and none have been
    identified, either before the FtJ or  in  the  grounds  or  submissions
    before  me.   The  appellant  plainly  failed  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules.  It is not sufficient to  say  that  because
    the appellant has some evidence of income of the  required  level  that
    that in itself, or in combination with any other factor evident in this
    appeal, amounts to compelling circumstances.  That  argument  fails  to
    take into account the requirements of the Rules for  the  provision  of
    specified  evidence.   The  financial  requirement  in  terms  of   the
    provision of specified evidence plainly has an important function.   It
    is to provide certainty, clarity and  transparency  in  terms  of  what
    information needs to be provided.  To decide  simply  that  because  an
    appellant is able to provide evidence of income in a  manner  otherwise
    than as specified in the Rules, is to allow for the sort of  dispensing
    and free-wheeling Article 8 consideration which has  been  held  to  be
    impermissible.

28. Furthermore, the arguments on behalf of the appellants fail to  grapple
    with  the  FtJ's  pertinent  observation  about  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant having lived apart for 16 years.  He was entitled to conclude
    that  there  would  only  be  a  very  limited  interference  with  the
    appellants'  private  and  family  life,  and  he  observed  that   the
    appellants  had  given  very  sparse  details  of  any   such   claimed
    interference.  The conclusion that matters would continue as  they  had
    done before, for the past 16 years, is a significant statement of fact.
     It does not need further explanation.

29. The argument that the FtJ's Article 8 consideration fails to take  into
    account the Article 8 rights of the second appellant has no  substance.
    The FtJ pointed out that the sponsor had lived in the  UK  since  1999,
    when the second appellant was aged about 1 year.   He  found,  and  was
    entitled to find, that the evidence of contact between  the  appellants
    and the  sponsor  was  very  limited.   No  compelling  arguments  were
    advanced before the FtJ in terms of the second  appellant's  Article  8
    rights,  as  the  FtJ  also  pointed  out.   Furthermore,  if   further
    explanation needed to have been given by the FtJ, he could  justifiably
    have found that it was in the  second  appellant's  best  interests  to
    remain living with the  person  who  had  brought  him  up;  the  first
    appellant, and amongst people  of  his  own  culture,  nationality  and
    language.  Again, as the FtJ observed, the appellants had provided very
    little evidence as to how their  private  and  family  lives  would  be
    impacted by the decision.

30. It was submitted that the first appellant had in fact passed an English
    language test, and accordingly the FtJ was wrong to say otherwise,  and
    thus the conclusion in that regard with reference to s.117B was flawed.
     However, even if the FtJ was wrong in that  respect  (and  it  is  not
    clear when any English language test was passed),  the  appellants  can
    claim no positive benefit from the first appellant's ability  to  speak
    English, having regard to the decision in AM (S.  117B)  Malawi  [2015]
    UKUT 0260 (IAC).   Even  if,  therefore,  the  FtJ  was  wrong  in  his
    conclusion in that distinct respect, that does not amount to  an  error
    of law in his conclusions overall, or if it does, it is not an error of
    law that requires the decision to be set aside.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of  law.   Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeals
    therefore stands.

    Anonymity


    No anonymity direction is made. The second appellant is not a minor. No
    application for anonymity was made, as  far  as  I  am  aware,  and  no
    reasons for granting anonymity are evident.
