Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Khan
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a  citizen  of  the  Philippines  born  in  1974.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent made on 11 July  2013  to
    refuse his application for discretionary leave outside the  Immigration
    Rules; on the basis of his private life pursuant to paragraph 276ADE of
    the Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The history is that the Appellant first arrived in the UK in March 2007
    with leave to enter as a student until May 2009.  In May 2009 he sought
    further leave but it was not until February 2012  that  the  Respondent
    informed him that his Sponsor's licence had been revoked and he had  to
    find alternative sponsorship.

 3. In March 2012 he applied to vary his leave. In May 2012 he  received  a
    refusal letter stating that his Tier 4 application (made in  May  2009)
    had been refused.

 4. He appealed against that refusal and a hearing took place before  Judge
    Bennett on 17 August 2012.   By  his  determination  promulgated  on  5
    September 2012 the judge allowed the appeal as not being in  accordance
    with the law. Also on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 5.  He found that the Appellant had suffered unfairness due to  the  delay
    by the Respondent but that such could be rectified by the  grant  of  a
    period of leave of sufficient length of time to enable him to work  and
    accumulate the funds necessary to pay the first year fees of �9,000 and
    the required two months' maintenance (�1,200) and thus to qualify for a
    grant of leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant.

 6.   In his directions he ordered that the Appellant be granted  a  period
    of leave outside the Immigration Rules with an initial  grant  of  four
    months and that no later than 56 days after  the  promulgation  of  the
    determination the Appellant must send documentary evidence vouching the
    estimated or actual fees payable for the course, his  proposals  as  to
    the length of time it would take him to accumulate  the  required  sums
    and all documentary evidence on which he sought to rely.

 7. There was no appeal by the Respondent against Judge Bennett's  decision
    or directions.  He was granted six months  discretionary  leave  on  19
    December 2012 to remain in the UK.

 8. On 4 June  2013  he  applied  for  further  discretionary  leave.   The
    application was refused.  In the refusal letter  the  Respondent  noted
    that the Appellant had been granted six months discretionary  leave  to
    remain to enable him to accumulate the funds needed to  satisfy  NVQ  4
    Health and Social Care.  He  was  then  advised  to  submit  a  Tier  4
    application for leave to remain as a student once  he  had  accumulated
    these funds.  However, in the time frame given he  did  not  accumulate
    the funds necessary to apply for the course and so  did  not  submit  a
    Tier 4 application.

 9. The Respondent further considered that the Appellant did not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  in
    particular under 276ADE(vi), in that while he  was  aged  18  years  or
    above and had lived continuously in the UK for less than  twenty  years
    (since 2007), he had ties with the country to which he would have to go
    if required to leave the UK.  There was no breach of his Article 8 ECHR
    rights because there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  which  would
    warrant a grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.

10. He appealed stating that the six months leave granted by the Respondent
    was not sufficient to enable him to accumulate funds as most  employers
    would not employ him for such a short length of time.

11. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sweet at Hatton
    Cross on 4 December 2013.  His findings are brief.  At  paragraph  [20]
    he noted:

         'The Appellant explained why it was difficult  to  find  employment
         when he had only a six month visa and it is clear from the  letters
         from two prospective employers ... that they were not  prepared  to
         employ him for such a short length of time.'

12. The judge concluded: (at [21])

         '... The Appellant has not realistically been given the opportunity
         to satisfy the Respondent that he can provide the  necessary  funds
         for his proposed studies.  I therefore direct that  the  Respondent
         should grant him a twelve month extension to his existing right  to
         remain in the UK to enable him to obtain alternative employment and
         to provide satisfactory evidence to the Respondent  authorities  of
         his ability to raise and save the necessary funds  ...  as  to  the
         proposed course fees and maintenance.  To  this  limited  extent  I
         allow the appeal.'

13. The Respondent sought permission to appeal  which  was  granted  on  10
    January 2014.  The grounds, repeated at the error of law hearing,  were
    that the judge made no findings in relation to Article 8 and  that  any
    previous injustice in failing to grant the Appellant 60 days to find  a
    new college had by now been rectified.  It was inappropriate  to  grant
    someone leave to work to meet the  financial  requirements  within  the
    Rules.  Following Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Article 8 is not engaged  merely
    because someone wants to study in  the  UK.   The  judge  had  directed
    further leave on no lawful basis.

14. Mr Khan's position, in summary, was that the Respondent had  failed  to
    observe the terms of the directions given by Judge Bennett in September
    2012 which included that the  Appellant  be  granted  leave  to  remain
    within fourteen days of the Tribunal's decision.  It took three  months
    to grant leave.  The Respondent also ignored correspondence sent by the
    Appellant about his inability to get employment because the  period  of
    leave granted was too short.  Judge Sweet was entitled to conclude that
    the Respondent had not obeyed the directions set out by  Judge  Bennett
    and that as a result the decision to refuse to vary leave made in  July
    2013 was not in accordance with the law.  The Respondent, in Mr  Khan's
    submission, should make  a  fresh  decision  applying  Judge  Bennett's
    directions.

15. I consider that the  decision  of  the  First  tier  Tribunal  shows  a
    material error of law.

16. Firstly, it shows an unjustified assumption that the  Appellant  should
    have been given a longer period of leave than he  was  in  fact  given.
    The original direction was for a period of four months.  He  was  given
    six months.  There was no unfairness.  It does not matter that it  took
    three months from the Tribunal's decision rather than fourteen days  to
    grant the leave.  The result was he received significantly longer leave
    than was directed.

17. The judge should have considered whether the Appellant  had  any  basis
    for stay on human rights  grounds.   In  having  regard  to  irrelevant
    matters and not having regard to relevant matters the judge  materially
    erred.

18. The determination is set aside to be remade.

19. The evidence before me is that the Appellant is 40 years old.   He  has
    been in the UK for six years and eleven  months.   He  has  been  in  a
    relationship with a partner, also a citizen  of  the  Philippines,  for
    three years.  She has leave to study.  He has friends  and  involvement
    with a church.  He has been law-abiding.  The delay in the Respondent's
    decision has resulted in his establishing himself and building  a  life
    here.

20. I see no reason to doubt any of that evidence.

21. However the Appellant cannot succeed  on  human  rights  grounds  under
    Article 8 within the Rules.  As the Respondent noted, the Appellant who
    is over 18 years of age and has resided in the UK for less than  twenty
    years, lived in the Philippines until the age of 32  before  his  first
    entry to the UK.  As such he has spent the vast majority of his life in
    the Philippines, including the entirety of  his  formative  years.   He
    clearly has  cultural  ties  to  that  country.   He  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules.

22. Nor can he meet the family life  provisions  under  Appendix  FM.   His
    partner is not a British citizen, present and settled in the UK  or  in
    the UK with refugee leave or as a person with humanitarian  protection.
    She is a citizen of the Philippines with leave on the  temporary  basis
    of study.

23. I do not see there to be good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules such that it  is  necessary  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules.

24. The Appellant has been here a considerable length of time  (approaching
    seven years) but has spent the vast  bulk  of  his  life  in  his  home
    country.  His partner has been here a shorter time.  I accept that  the
    effect  of  delay  by  the  Respondent  has  been   to   deepen   their
    relationship.  However the Appellant cannot satisfy the Rules.  It  was
    for him to utilise the period of leave granted  by  the  Respondent  to
    accrue the costs to enable further study.  He was unable to do so.   In
    all the circumstances I fail  to  see  how  these  circumstances  could
    properly be described as compelling or the outcome unjustifiably harsh.
     There is thus no proper basis to go on to consider Article 8  ECHR  on
    the facts of this case.

25. Even if I were to apply Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules on  the  basis
    of the matters set out above I fail to see  how  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent could be regarded as disproportionate.  They both came  here
    on a temporary basis.  The approach to studies and Article 8  noted  in
    Patel [2013] UKSC 72 indicates that the application of Article 8  where
    education is concerned is severely more  limited  than  has  previously
    been thought.  They can continue to develop any family life  they  have
    in their home country.

26. In the circumstances, for the  reasons  set  out  the  appeal  must  be
    dismissed.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law such that the decision is set aside.

I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
