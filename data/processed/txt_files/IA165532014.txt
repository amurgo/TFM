                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 7th  October  1980.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 26th March 2014  to
    refuse to issue  him  with  a  residence  card  as  confirmation  of  a
    derivative right  of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to
    Regulation  15A  (4A)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations  2006  ("the  2006  Regulations").   The   basis   of   the
    Appellant's application was that he was the primary carer of his father
    a British citizen who would be unable to reside in the  United  Kingdom
    if the Appellant was required to leave. His appeal was allowed at first
    instance by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Morgan sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 22nd April 2015.  The Home Office appeals with  leave  against
    that decision and the matter therefore comes before  me  in  the  first
    place as an appeal by the Respondent.  For the reasons which I set  out
    below at paragraphs 10 to 12 I have set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal by reason of material error of law and have proceeded  to
    rehear the matter.  For  the  sake  of  convenience  therefore  I  will
    continue to refer to the parties as they were known at first instance.

2.   Regulation 15A as amended  took  effect  from  8th  November  2012  and
    provided that a person who is not an exempt person  and  who  satisfies
    the criteria in paragraph 4A  of  this  Regulation  is  entitled  to  a
    derivative right to reside in the United Kingdom for  as  long  as  the
    person satisfies the relevant  criteria.   Paragraph  4A  defined  that
    criteria as meaning that the person must be  the  primary  carer  of  a
    British citizen and that the British citizen is residing in the  United
    Kingdom and would be unable to reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  in
    another EEA State  if  the  applicant  were  required  to  leave.   The
    applicant is to be regarded as a primary carer of another person if the
    applicant is  the  person  who  has  primary  responsibility  for  that
    person's care but will not be regarded as having responsibility  for  a
    person's care on the sole basis of  a  financial  contribution  towards
    that person's care.  The burden  of  proof  of  establishing  that  the
    requirements of the Regulation are met rests upon the Appellant and the
    standard  of  proof  is  the  usual  civil  standard  of   balance   of
    probabilities.  The circumstances are to be considered at the  date  of
    the hearing.

The Proceedings at First Instance

3.   At paragraph 7 of his determination Judge Morgan set  out  the  factual
    background to the matter as follows:

         "The Appellant's father first arrived in the United Kingdom in 1980
         and has been a British citizen since September  2003.   The  father
         has owned a shop in the United  Kingdom  for  over  24  years.   He
         worked full-time in the shop until two years ago  when  he  was  no
         longer able to continue because of ill-health.  He  now  rents  out
         the shop and receives rent payments of �700 per week which  enables
         him to financially support himself and his  family  in  the  United
         Kingdom.  The Appellant has been looking after his father since his
         father was forced to give up work two years ago.  The father  is  a
         diabetic with  high  blood  pressure,  heart  problems,  difficulty
         breathing and walking and other  related  illnesses.   He  requires
         daily care and assistance.  The father's mobility is  poor  and  he
         suffers from back and knee problems.  The support provided  by  his
         son starts first thing in the morning when the Appellant helps  his
         father out of bed.  The Appellant is with his  father  24  hours  a
         day.  The Appellant regularly massages his  father  and  takes  his
         father to his doctor's  appointments  and  physiotherapy  sessions.
         The Appellant takes his father to the park for fresh air  and  does
         the shopping for his father.  When the Appellant's  father's  hands
         cramp up the Appellant assists the father in feeding himself."

4.   The Respondent's case was that even if the Appellant was  his  father's
    primary carer requiring the Appellant to  leave  would  not  cause  the
    Appellant's father to be unable to reside in the United Kingdom.  There
    was no evidence  that  the  primary  care  currently  provided  by  the
    Appellant could not be provided by  outside  agencies  such  as  Social
    Services if required.  Where the British citizen in question  was  over
    18 a higher level of  evidence  was  required  to  demonstrate  primary
    responsibility because it can generally be assumed that adults have the
    capacity to care for their own daily needs.

5.   The Appellant argued that it was wrong to  suggest  that  the  father's
    primary care could still be provided by the State.   If  that  was  the
    case neither children nor adults would ever  be  able  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of paragraph  15A  of  the  2006  Regulations.   What  was
    required was simply an assessment of the level of care provided by  the
    primary carer in this case the Appellant.  If it were to be removed the
    British citizen would be unable to provide for his or her  own  day-to-
    day needs. The Judge indicated at paragraph 11 he was persuaded by this
    counter argument.  At paragraph 11 the Judge wrote:

         "Whilst I accept the Respondent's submission that adults  generally
         have the capacity to  care  for  their  own  daily  needs,  on  the
         particular facts of this case, given the Appellant's  father's  age
         [he was 63] and infirmity I find that he does require the round the
         clock care provided by his son the Appellant and without this  care
         he would be unable to reside in the United Kingdom".

    The Judge found as a fact that the Appellant was  the  person  who  had
    primary responsibility for his father's care and allowed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

6.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing  that  the  Judge
    had failed to resolve conflicts of opinion  and  had  made  a  material
    misdirection of law.  No definitive evidence had been provided to  show
    that the Appellant's father would be unable to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom in the  Appellant's  absence.   The  Sponsor  claimed  to  have
    various ailments but there was no medical  evidence  to  support  those
    assertions or show that they necessitated the  personal  attendance  of
    the Appellant.  The Appellant had had over a year since the decision to
    obtain the documentary evidence  which  had  been  called  for  in  the
    refusal letter yet had produced none of it.  It was for  the  Appellant
    to submit sufficient credible evidence to address  the  issues  in  the
    refusal notice and prove on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    Appellant  satisfied  the  requirements  of  Regulation  15A(4A).   The
    Sponsor had said he had rented out his shop and received  �700  a  week
    which was used to support himself and his family.  There may  therefore
    be other members of the family present in the United Kingdom who  would
    be able to provide the Appellant's father with any assistance needed if
    the Appellant were required to leave.

7    The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta  on  31st  July  2015.   In  granting
    permission to appeal she wrote that:

         "The determination shows that the IJ made findings  without  cogent
         evidence apart from the Appellant's' and Sponsor's preference, that
         the Appellant was the Sponsor's primary carer  without  considering
         that there were other members of the family and that there  was  no
         independent evidence of the Sponsor's medical  condition,  physical
         needs or alternative sources of help.   It  is  arguable  that  the
         overall findings reached were not properly open to the Judge on the
         evidence".

    There was no  Rule  24  reply  from  the  Appellant  to  the  grant  of
    permission.  Following the grant the Upper Tribunal  made  a  direction
    that the parties should prepare for  the  forthcoming  hearing  on  the
    basis that if the Upper Tribunal decided to set aside the determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal any further evidence including supplementary
    oral evidence that the Upper Tribunal might  need  to  consider  if  it
    decided to remake the decision could be so considered at that hearing.

The Error of Law Stage

8.   In consequence of the grant the matter  came  before  me  to  determine
    whether there was an error  of  law.   In  submissions  the  Presenting
    Officer relied on the grounds for  permission.   Apart  from  the  oral
    evidence of the Appellant and the Sponsor there had  been  no  evidence
    given that the Sponsor needed the care which the Appellant was said  to
    provide.  There was a  need  for  such  evidence.   It  was  completely
    inadequate to say that the Sponsor needed round the clock care  without
    such evidence.  It was difficult  to  know  where  the  Judge  got  his
    assertion from that reliance on Social Services  was  irrelevant.   The
    Judge should have investigated the question  of  whether  other  family
    members could offer care.  There was not enough of an evidential  basis
    to justify the Judge's findings.

9.   In reply the Appellant's solicitor stated that the Judge did  not  make
    any errors of law but applied the facts as he found them.  The  Sponsor
    the Appellant's father was suffering from medical problems and  it  was
    open to the Judge to conclude in the light of the evidence he  received
    that the Sponsor required the care of  the  Appellant.   As  the  Judge
    pointed out, both the Appellant and the Sponsor had come  under  fierce
    cross-examination during the hearing.  Their evidence was unshaken  and
    the Judge made adequate findings.

10.  Having heard the submissions I  announced  my  decision  that  I  found
    there was a material error of law in the  determination  such  that  it
    fell to  be  set  aside  and  the  matter  reheard.   The  Respondent's
    challenge in this case was essentially a reasons-based one.  The  Judge
    had based his findings both that the Sponsor needed care and  that  the
    Appellant was the only one who could provide it on the  oral  testimony
    of the Appellant and the Sponsor.  He had no medical  evidence  of  any
    substance on which to base either conclusion.  It is not the case  that
    corroborative evidence is required in an immigration appeal as a matter
    of course.  However where it is reasonable to  expect  that  supporting
    evidence will be available, but it is not produced such evidence should
    be forthcoming. This is particularly so where the Respondent (as in the
    case here) had specifically written in  the  refusal  letter  that  the
    Appellant  had  not  submitted  sufficient  documentary   evidence   to
    demonstrate that the Sponsor would be unable to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom if the Appellant were required to leave.

11.  Basing his decision solely on the oral testimony of  the  parties  when
    the absence of medical or documentary evidence  had  been  specifically
    flagged up by the Respondent was in my view an error of law because  it
    meant that the Judge could not adequately explain his  reasoning.   The
    Judge had not explained why the Sponsor's  age  at  63  meant  that  he
    required round the clock care.  The issue was the claimed infirmity  of
    the Sponsor.  It was not possible for the losing party,  in  this  case
    the Respondent to  understand  why  they  had  lost  the  appeal.   The
    determination was insufficiently reasoned which amounted to an error of
    law.

12.  The Sponsor as a British  citizen  would  be  entitled  to  appropriate
    Social Services' care if that was  required.   There  was  no  evidence
    before the Judge that any enquiries had been made of Social Services to
    see what if any care the Sponsor might need.  In those circumstances it
    was a further error of law to reject the Respondent's point  which  was
    not that no one could ever succeed because they always  would  have  to
    have recourse to Social Services (as to which see paragraph 18  below).
    Rather the point being made in the refusal letter was  that  preference
    and convenience were not sufficient reasons for the Appellant to assert
    that another responsible adult procured  privately  or  through  Social
    Services would be unable to  care  for  the  Sponsor.   In  failing  to
    address that point correctly the Judge had also erred.

The Substantive Rehearing

13.  Following on from the finding of a material error of law was the  issue
    of whether I should proceed there and then to rehear the matter in  the
    light of the directions from the Upper Tribunal (see paragraph 7 above)
    or whether I should remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal to
    be considered afresh.  The latter course  was  urged  upon  me  by  the
    Appellant's solicitor but I declined to do so because there had already
    been a hearing at which substantial evidence had been given in the form
    of the oral testimony of the Appellant and the Sponsor.  There  was  no
    fresh medical evidence and the matter was a question of construction on
    the basis of the existing evidence rather  than  consideration  of  any
    fresh evidence.  The matter proceeded thereafter.

14.  As the Appellant's solicitor indicated he did not wish to  call  either
    the  Appellant  or  the  Sponsor  to  give  evidence  I  proceeded   to
    submissions.  For the Respondent it was argued that there  was  nothing
    to demonstrate that the Sponsor would have to leave the United  Kingdom
    if the Appellant had to leave.  The Appellant and Sponsor had now had a
    very long time indeed to provide evidence and the only  conclusion  one
    could draw as to why that evidence had not been provided was because it
    did not exist.  There was no evidence to show that the Appellant  could
    satisfy the requirements of the 2006 Regulations.

15.  In closing for the  Appellant  his  solicitor  indicated  that  he  had
    already made his submissions on the merits  of  the  case.   There  was
    medical evidence that the Sponsor was suffering from multiple injuries.
     This was a reference to a page which was in  the  Respondent's  bundle
    apparently submitted with the application.  It was a  letter  addressed
    to 'Whom it may concern' from the  Appellant's  and  Sponsor's  General
    Practitioner, Dr Vinay Sharma whose surgery was in Newcastle upon Tyne.
     The last entry on this record was 22nd January 2010 which stated  that
    the Sponsor had chronic obstructive airways  disease  and  had  been  a
    chain smoker for  his  first  29  years.   It  listed  some  long  term
    medications which the Sponsor was taking although this too was not  up-
    to-date as it referred to tablets taken in April and July 2013.   These
    included benovate cream for the skin and eye  drops  for  allergic  eye
    symptoms.

Findings

16.  Beyond the assertions  of  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  that  the
    Sponsor required round the clock care from the Appellant which only the
    Appellant could provide, there was no evidence at all  indicating  that
    the Sponsor required any form of medical or other assistance.   The  GP
    record such as it was was already old by the time it was  submitted  in
    November 2013.  Nothing has been obtained in  almost  two  years  since
    then to indicate: (i) that there is any need for care; (ii)  that  only
    the Appellant can provide it or (iii) that the Sponsor  would  have  to
    leave the United Kingdom if the Appellant was not here.   The  evidence
    received by the Judge at first instance was not credible on  the  point
    that the Sponsor required such care and that only the  Appellant  could
    give it.  It was difficult to resist the conclusion (as  was  submitted
    to me by the Respondent)  that  the  evidence  had  not  been  provided
    because it did not exist.

17.  In the recent case of Ayinde [2015] UKUT 00560 the Upper Tribunal  made
    clear that the provisions of Regulation 15A as amended apply  when  the
    effective removal of the carer of a British citizen renders the British
    citizen no longer able to reside in the United Kingdom  or  in  another
    EEA State.  This requires the carer to establish as  a  fact  that  the
    British citizen will be forced to leave the  territory  of  the  union.
    Mere assertions by the Appellant and Sponsor that that  is  what  would
    have to happen is not sufficient as the Respondent pointed out  in  the
    refusal letter.  As I have indicated the Judge made a material error of
    law by accepting the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor's
    unsupported evidence as sufficient to establish  that  the  Appellant's
    father would have to leave if the Appellant were required to leave.

18.  The Upper Tribunal pointed out in Ayinde the requirement is not met  by
    an assumption that the citizen  will  leave  and  does  not  involve  a
    consideration of whether it would be reasonable for the carer to  leave
    the United Kingdom.  In remaking  the  decision  in  Ayinde  the  Upper
    Tribunal  specifically  addressed  the  issue   of   Social   Services'
    involvement.  In that case the Sponsor needed to reside in  the  United
    Kingdom in order to  receive  certain  medical  treatment.   The  Upper
    Tribunal continued:

         "This leaves the tasks that are performed by the Appellant  in  the
         form of routine assistance  in  helping  [the  Sponsor]  to  bathe,
         preparing food, shopping and ensuring that the bills are paid.   If
         these cannot be performed by carers under the supervision of Social
         Services, then [the Sponsor] will need to  go  into  a  care  home.
         Either way it is simply impossible to claim that she is  unable  to
         remain in the United Kingdom once [the Appellant] leaves".

19.  Applying the ratio in Ayinde to the facts in this case,  the  Appellant
    may be carrying out what was described in Ayinde as routine  assistance
    (although as I have indicated there is no medical evidence to show that
    the Sponsor requires even a routine level of care).  The Tribunal found
    in Ayinde that even if carers under the supervision of Social  Services
    were not available it was still open to the Sponsor to go into  a  care
    home.  Thus the relevance of Social Services' provision is a factor  to
    be taken into account and not as the Judge at first instance did to  be
    disregarded.

20.  In this case the evidence does not get  that  far  since  there  is  no
    objective information to show that the Sponsor requires  anything  like
    the assistance which both the Appellant and Sponsor claimed  was  being
    provided.  If it was being provided it is reasonable to  have  expected
    such evidence to have been produced but it was not.   I  conclude  that
    the Appellant is unable to meet the requirements of Regulation 15A.  It
    is not possible to say from the medical evidence such as it is what the
    Sponsor is said to be suffering from.  Certainly to be 63 is not so old
    that it can be assumed that a person of that age  would  require  round
    the clock treatment without more.

21.  No argument appears to have been raised at first  instance  concerning
    Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of  the  Human
    Rights Convention and no such argument was raised before me.  That must
    be right because in the absence of removal directions or a section  120
    notice there can be no human  rights  appeal  in  an  EEA  appeal  (see
    Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  00466
    (IAC) ). That decision is subject to appeal to the Court of Appeal  but
    in any event if the Appellant cannot succeed under Regulation 15A it is
    difficult to see how he can establish  that  his  relationship  to  his
    father extends beyond normal emotional ties. It  is  not  a  compelling
    and/or compassionate  circumstance  such  that  his  appeal  should  be
    allowed outside the Immigration Rules.  In relation to his private life
    the Appellant has only been in the United Kingdom for some  nine  years
    during which time he has had leave to remain as a student. His  removal
    would be in accordance with the legitimate aim of immigration  control.
    His status was precarious and little weight could be  attached  to  any
    private life he may have established during that time when assessing he
    proportionality of any  interference  with  his  private  life  in  the
    balancing exercise under Article 8. I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I have remade the decision by  dismissing  the
Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse  to  issue  a
residence card.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was payable by  the  Appellant  on  lodging  his  appeal.   In
allowing the appeal Judge Morgan made a fee award of the amount of  any  fee
which had been paid as he found that the Appellant had  persuaded  him  that
the residence card should have been  granted  by  the  Respondent.   I  have
reversed that decision and I therefore revisit the fee award in  this  case.
Given that I find that there was a material error of law in  the  First-tier
decision for the reasons which I have set  out  above,  I  rescind  the  fee
award made in this case such that no fee is payable  by  the  Respondent  to
the Appellant.
