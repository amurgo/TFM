                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Moan, promulgated on 5th November 2018, following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 23rd October  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the  appeal  of  the  Appellants,  whereupon  the  Appellants
    subsequently applied for, and were granted, permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife.  Both are  citizens  of  Pakistan.
    The first Appellant, the husband, was born  on  18th  July  1983.   The
    second Appellant, his wife, was born on 2nd November 1992.  In 2016 the
    first Appellant applied for leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, as a Tier 1 Migrant  and  subsequently  on  the  basis  of  long
    residence, having completed ten years in the UK.  On 2nd February 2018,
    the Respondent refused that  application.   This  appeal  before  Judge
    Moan, was against that decision.

The Issue

 3. The issue before Judge  Moan,  was  the  fact  that  in  the  principal
    Appellant's previous applications for leave to remain, he had submitted
    evidence of his earnings which were  not  accurate.   He  had  provided
    information as to his earnings for the tax year 2010 to  2011  and  for
    2012 to 2013.  His stated earnings for those years did not accord  with
    the tax returns to HMRC.  The first Appellant  sent  in  revised  self-
    assessments  as  late  as  January  2016  and  incurred   further   tax
    liabilities as a result.  The first Appellant's  explanation  was  that
    his previous accountant had been responsible for the original erroneous
    self-assessment tax returns.  The first Appellant sent  a  letter  from
    CBS Accountants dated 28th June 2017 (who are currently acting for him)
    which indicated that they conducted a review of the Appellant's  income
    and found a discrepancy on his tax returns for the years 2010  to  2011
    and 2012 to 2013.  It was then that the Appellant informed the HMRC and
    provided revised tax returns for those years.  The Appellant's previous
    financial advisors had been MSCO Accountants.  There was a letter  from
    them dated 12th January 2011.  They confirmed that they acted  for  the
    first Appellant as his accountants.

 4. The first Appellant's explanation for the discrepancies was set out  in
    his witness statement of 25th June 2018.  He explained that the  income
    details sent to the Home Office were indeed correct.  He accepted  that
    the tax returns for 2010 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013 were  incorrect.   He
    said that the mistakes in his tax returns were made  by  a  Mr  Ansari.
    This man had led the Appellant to believe that he was working for  MSCO
    Accountants.  Mr Ansari, however, was an immigration  consultant.   The
    first Appellant believed that he  passed  the  financial  documents  to
    someone else at MSCO to draft their accounts.  Mr Ansari was instructed
    to complete the tax returns after April 2011 and this was also done for
    2011 to 2012 and then for 2012 to 2013 tax years.  The  Appellant  said
    that he could not contact Mr Ansari in 2015 as Mr Ansari had now  moved
    to Dubai.  The first Appellant approached CBS Accountants  who  noticed
    the errors on his tax returns and this was how the  discrepancies  were
    allegedly corrected.





The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge had regard to the Home Office guidance on the general Grounds
    for Refusal in relation to the application of paragraph  322(5).   This
    refers to "grounds on which leave to remain and variation of  leave  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused",  and
    it goes on to refer to "the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person
    concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his  conduct,
    character or associations or the fact that he represents  a  threat  to
    national security".

 6. The judge, in looking at  the  Home  Office  guidance,  underlined  the
    guidance which stated that,

         "A person does not need  to  have  been  convicted  of  a  criminal
         offence for this provision to  apply.   When  deciding  whether  to
         refuse under this category, the key thing to consider is  if  there
         is reliable evidence  to  support  a  decision  that  the  person's
         behaviour calls into question their character and/or conduct and/or
         their associations to the extent that it is  undesirable  to  allow
         them to enter or remain in the United Kingdom" (paragraph 14).

 7.  The  judge  also  had  regard  to  the  fact  that   the   Appellant's
    representative, on the day of the hearing, attempted to rely  upon  the
    unreported decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor in  the  case
    of Kadin, which was dated 1st May 2018.  This made it clear  that,  not
    declaring  all  relevant  income,  whilst  highly  regrettable,  cannot
    properly be described as conduct which impacts  upon  character  and  a
    person being undesirable.  The judge stated  that  reliance  upon  this
    decision would not be helpful to her in coming to the decision.

 8. Having heard the Appellant's evidence, the  judge  concluded  that  the
    first Appellant's  evidence  was  simply  not  credible  and  that  the
    Respondent was correct in applying paragraph 322(5) and refusing  leave
    to remain.

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law because as
    a first step, the burden of proof was on the Respondent  to  show  that
    the Appellant's character or conduct fell within the scope of paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  This had been well-established  since
    the cases of IS (marriages of convenience) Serbia  [2008]  UKAIT  0031,
    and the case of AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773.  The failure  of  the
    judge to consider this as a preliminary issue meant that the judge  had
    assumed that the Respondent had discharged the burden of proof upon her
    simply by asserting that the Appellant's  character  and  conduct  fell
    within  paragraph  322(5).   This  conclusion  was  unsustainable  (see
    paragraph 20 of the determination).  That being so, on this basis alone
    the decision should be set aside on the basis of an error of law.

11. Second, it was asserted that  the  judge  had  wrongly  disallowed  the
    reliance that the Appellant sought to be  placed  upon  the  unreported
    decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor,  given  that  no  other
    decision was precisely on the point that was before the  Tribunal,  and
    assistance was plainly to be gained from that decision.  The judge  had
    said that such a decision could only be relied upon  by  giving  notice
    but there was nothing in the practice statement to this effect.

12. Third, it was stated that the HMRC itself had not taken the  view  that
    the Appellant should be fined or be subject to any criminal  sanctions.
    Their view appears to have been that the Appellant was simply  careless
    or negligent, having failed to take reasonable care in filling his  tax
    return, and this being so, it was once again not  permissible  for  the
    Tribunal to say that the conduct fell under paragraph  322(5),  without
    further ado.

Submissions

13. At the hearing before me on 12th February 2019, Mr Moan,  proceeded  to
    rely upon the grounds of application.   He  explained  that  the  well-
    established decision in AA (Nigeria)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  773,  required
    there to be a finding of "dishonesty" before a person could be  charged
    with fraudulent conduct.  This had not been done.  The approach of  the
    judge was accordingly flawed.

14. Secondly, that to say that the unreported determination  could  not  be
    relied upon because no notice had been given to  the  other  side,  was
    misconceived.  The Practice Direction required no  such  notice  to  be
    given.  In any event, given that reference to the  unreported  decision
    was made and the skeleton argument which was served on  the  Respondent
    at the beginning of the day, and the hearing  did  not  commence  until
    12.35pm later in the afternoon, it was arguable that notice had  indeed
    been given to the other side.

15. Third, the Appellant's conduct had been categorised, by  all  accounts,
    as far as the HMRC was concerned, on the basis that  he  did  not  take
    reasonable care when filing his tax return, or  that  he  was  careless
    when doing so.  The HMRC did not  categorise  the  first  Appellant  as
    someone who deliberately made an incorrect tax return.   The  Appellant
    was not fined.  If one looks at the supplementary bundle (see pages  73
    to 78), the HMRC Rules are set out there.   There  are  four  different
    categories.  The first  one  is  where  the  Appellant  has  not  taken
    reasonable care.  The second  one  is  where  the  Appellant  has  been
    careless.  The remaining two categories are those where there has  been
    deliberate deception, whereby the HMRC may cause such a  person  to  be
    fined.  In the instant case, nothing of the sort had  been  done.   The
    failure of the judge to have regard to this meant that she  had  fallen
    into error.

16. Finally, the judge had stated (at  paragraph  29)  that  there  was  no
    explanation why the first Appellant thought  that  his  self-assessment
    tax returns were wrong in 2016 but not so before.   The  Appellant  had
    given a full explanation why he did not realise the mistake  until  CBS
    Accountants told him about this in 2016 (see paragraphs 9 to  19).   In
    fact, CBS Accountants even provided a letter to confirm that  they  had
    told the Appellant about  the  discrepancies  in  his  tax  returns  in
    December 2015/January 2016 (see page E1 of the Respondent's bundle).

17. For her part, Ms Isherwood submitted that nothing better  explains  the
    reason why this case properly fell to  be  considered  under  paragraph
    322(5) than the refusal letter of 2nd February 2018, itself.  This sets
    out, under the heading  "Refusal  of  Your  Application  for  Leave  to
    Remain" (at J4), how it was that the Appellant had, over  a  number  of
    years from 2010 to 2011 and then  from  2012  to  2013,  whilst  making
    further applications for leave to remain, declared his income in such a
    way as to have been awarded 20 points, which  he  would  otherwise  not
    have been awarded.

18. As the refusal letter makes clear (at J4) if those 20  points  had  not
    been granted, he would have failed to obtain leave under  Tier  1.   It
    was not sufficient to say, submitted Ms Isherwood, that  the  Appellant
    had brought to light the true state of affairs, long before he made his
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten  years'
    residence in the UK, given that during previous periods,  when  he  was
    making applications for Tier 1 leave to remain, he  had  misrepresented
    the correct position.

19. Second, if one has  regard  to  the  reported  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Khan (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT
    384, this makes it clear that it is not sufficient  "for  an  applicant
    simply to blame his or her accountant for an 'error' in relation to the
    historical tax return" as this "will not be  the  end  of  the  matter,
    given that the accountant will or should have asked the  tax  payer  to
    confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed the tax return"
    (see  the  headnote  at  (iv)).   This,  submitted  Ms  Isherwood,  was
    precisely the position here.

20. The judge had not erred in law.

21. In reply, Mr Saeed submitted that one had to take proper cognisance  of
    the decision in Khan.  This was a JR case.  It  was  not  binding  upon
    this Tribunal.  But in any event, the case of Khan, did make  allowance
    for the fact that a mistake can be remedied in time.  It  must  not  be
    overlooked that in this case, the Appellant had applied for  indefinite
    leave to remain on 23rd September 2016, which was nine months after  he
    had alerted the authorities about the mistake in his tax  affairs.   In
    the case of Khan (see paragraph 8 of the decision), the  Appellant  had
    only alerted of the authorities five days before his  application.   Mr
    Saeed submitted that I should allow the appeal.

No Error of Law

22. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.   First,  in  what  is  a  clear,
    comprehensive, and careful determination, the judge had regard  to  the
    Home Office guidance (at paragraph 14) to the effect that a person does
    not need to have been convicted of a criminal offence and that the  key
    thing is to consider whether there is reliable evidence  to  support  a
    decision  that  the  person's  behaviour  calls  into  question   their
    character.  In this respect the judge had properly directed herself.

23. Second, in relation  to  the  unreported  decision  of  "Kadin"  it  is
    important not to misconstrue what actually happened  at  the  Tribunal.
    The judge was again very careful in her  treatment  of  this  piece  of
    evidence.  Although it is the  case  that  the  judge  stated  that  an
    application should have been made on notice, this was  purely  for  the
    purposes of enabling the other party "to respond to the application for
    admission and  to  ascertain  if  there  are  any  contrary  decisions"
    (paragraph 16).  This was an  entirely  reasonable  statement  to  make
    given that  the  judge  also  pointed  out  that  "there  are  contrary
    unreported decisions such as the  decision  of  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Birrell in the case of Tahir who found that "the failure to  file
    tax returns as sufficient to engage paragraphs 276B(ii)  and  paragraph
    322(5) as conduct making it  undesirable  to  allow  leave  to  remain"
    (paragraph 17).

24. However, most importantly, the judge pointed out that, given that there
    were contrary  authorities  on  this  issue,  that  she  would  not  be
    materially assisted by the determination of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
    Taylor because the issue was "still a contentious  one  and  one  which
    requires  an  authoritative  reported   determination   for   guidance"
    (paragraph 18).  That was the conclusion that was entirely open to  the
    judge to make.

25. Finally, and no less importantly, is the fact that the judge was simply
    not impressed by the explanation given by the Appellant.  The  failings
    of the Appellant lay not only with regard  to  the  substantial  under-
    disclosure of his earnings.  As the judge pointed out, in 2010 to  2011
    the first Appellant claimed to have  an  income  of  �44,063.   He  had
    initially declared his income to HMRC  to  be  just  �20,732  for  that
    period.  The revision that he then made was in 2016 when he  said  that
    his income was �44,177 (paragraph 21).  However, the Appellant had  not
    only "significantly increased the figure  for  his  self-employment  to
    support his Tier 1 application", but his figure for employment was also
    incorrect, and the judge was clear that "this should have  been  easily
    ascertainable from his payslip or his employer" (paragraph 22).

26. Second, however, the judge  was  clearly  far  from  impressed  by  the
    Appellant's explanation in relation to his engagement of a  Mr  Ansari.
    As the judge explained, the Appellant did not explain how  he  came  to
    engage Mr Ansari if he had never attended the offices of MCSO.   Indeed
    MCSO accepts  that  the  first  Appellant  did  ask  them  to  complete
    accountancy services during two periods.  It was  implausible  that  Mr
    Ansari would be seen as an employee or  agent  of  MSCO  if  the  first
    Appellant had never gone to their offices" (paragraph 26).   Mr  Ansari
    would be seen as an employee or agent of MSCO if  the  first  Appellant
    had never  gone  to  their  offices"  (paragraph  26).   Therefore,  in
    stating, as the judge did, that "I was unable to accept his explanation
    that  someone  else  was  responsible  for  the  errors  in  the   HMRC
    submissions or that he was not aware of those errors"  (paragraph  28),
    the judge was acting entirely in accordance with the  strictures  given
    by Khan [2018] UKUT 384.  Accordingly, there is no error of law.

Notice of Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  a  material
    error of law.  The decision shall stand.

28. No anonymity direction is made.

29. This appeal is dismissed
