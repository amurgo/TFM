                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by an Entry Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  against  a
        determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ghaffar, promulgated  on
        the 3 June 2014, in which the Judge allowed the appeal against  the
        refusal of entry clearance for settlement as the spouse of a person
        present and settled in the United Kingdom.


     2. The ECO was not satisfied that Ms Yasmin  had  supplied  sufficient
        evidence  to  establish  that  she   could   meet   the   financial
        requirements of the Immigration Rules, as  the  sponsor's  deposits
        into his bank account did not match the  wage  slips  supplied  and
        evidence of previous years earnings were not as great as the amount
        he now claimed to be earning. It was therefore concluded  that  the
        sponsor was not earning the amount required by Appendix FM or  that
        he had not provided specified evidence of same.


     3. Having read the documentary evidence and having heard oral evidence
        from the sponsor the Judge set out  his  findings,  in  very  brief
        form, in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the determination in the following
        terms:


              15.  I have carefully considered all the evidence before me as
      well as the          oral evidence of the Sponsor. I find  that  there
      is a plethora of                   evidence of the Sponsor's  earnings
      which were independently               verified by the Tax Office. The
      Sponsor had provided all  the                 Specified  Evidence  and
      explained the few pounds of  his  earnings             that  were  not
      banked   each   week.    This   was   explained   in   the    covering
      letter sent with the application. I find, based on the evidence before
                   me that the Sponsor had provided all evidence required of
      his                  earnings in excess of �18,600 gross per annum.


               16.   I  find  that  the  Sponsor   fulfils   the   financial
      requirements of Appendix           FM of the Immigration Rules  and  I
      allow the immigration appeal.



Discussion



     4. Although not raised as a  ground  of  appeal  it  is  important  to
        remember that it is not the sponsor who needs to show  they  fulfil
        the requirements of the Rules but the applicant.   The  ECO  sought
        permission to appeal on the  basis  Appendix  FM-SE  sets  out  the
        nature of the evidence required to establish the income earned, the
        periods they cover, and the format they should be in.  One  of  the
        requirements is that the wage deposits must  be  reflected  in  the
        sponsor's bank account which the evidence showed has  not  occurred
        in this appeal. It is stated the First-tier Tribunal had no  regard
        to this requirement in its findings and therefore failed to  comply
        with the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


     5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by another judge of  the
        First-tier Tribunal on the basis Judge Ghaffar had  given  adequate
        reasons for finding that the  Appellant  before  him  had,  on  the
        balance of probabilities, showed a gross annual income in excess of
        �18,600 and that the  grounds  failed  to  take  into  account  the
        explanation proffered by the sponsor and accepted by the First-tier
        Tribunal that he banked all but a few pounds of his weekly earnings
        which were paid to him in cash. The application was renewed to  the
        Upper Tribunal and granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on  the
        basis that the grounds as pleaded were arguable.


     6. The refusal of entry clearance, dated 16th  June  2013,  noted  the
        information provided with  the  application  but  found  that  that
        information did not meet the specified  guidance  set  out  in  the
        Immigration Rules. The ECO also noted that the  amounts  and  dates
        shown on the payslips for The Spice Lounge do not  match  the  cash
        credits shown on the bank  statements.  The  ECO  records  that  in
        making the decision account had been taken of previous earnings  as
        confirmed by HMRC and listed in the refusal. Thereafter the refusal
        states:


              "The earnings listed above  demonstrate  that  your  sponsor's
      highest              earnings in any one previous tax year  were  only
      �10,155 (2009-2010). I also         note  that  your  sponsor  was  in
      receipt of Job Seekers Allowance at the         latter end of 2011 and
      that he received Housing and Council tax benefit  up           to  and
      including January 2012. In view of the  discrepancies  noted  above  I
      am not satisfied that he is now earning the salary  claimed  currently
      which        is  significantly  higher  at  �18,720.   As  such  I  am
      satisfied that your           sponsor's earnings have  been  contrived
      for the purposes of this               application and to  demonstrate
      that  he  has  met  the  financial  maintenance        rules.  He  has
      therefore not demonstrated an income of �18,600 per annum          and
      not submitted the specified guidance in respect of his  employment  in
      the UK."


     7. Appendix FM is a very detailed provision of the  Rules  which  sets
        out the requirements for individuals making applications for  leave
        to enter or remain in the various classes provided for. There is an
        additional section within Appendix  FM,  headed  Appendix  FM-SE  -
        Family members - Specified Evidence, which sets out  the  specified
        evidence applicants need to provide to  meet  the  requirements  of
        relevant provisions within Appendix FM.


     8. Paragraph D (a) of Appendix FM-SE  provides  that  in  deciding  an
        application in relation to which  this  appendix  states  specified
        documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   or
        Secretary of State ("the decision maker") will  consider  documents
        that have been  submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only
        consider  documents   submitted   after   the   application   where
        subparagraph (b) or (e) applies.  Subparagraph (b) is not  relevant
        to this matter. Subparagraph (e) states that where a decision maker
        is satisfied that there is a valid reason why a specified documents
        cannot be supplied, e.g. because it is not issued in  a  particular
        country or has been  permanently  lost,  he  or  she  may  exercise
        discretion not to apply the requirement  for  the  document  or  to
        request alternative  or  additional  information  or  documents  be
        submitted by  the  applicant.   Such  wording  appears  to  confirm
        discretion upon a decision maker but the term 'decision  maker'  is
        specifically defined in the Appendix  to  include  an  ECO  or  the
        Secretary of State only and such a discretion is  conditional  upon
        there being a valid reason why documents cannot be supplied,  which
        is not the issue in this case. Therefore, although Mr Khan accepted
        that discretion had been exercised by the ECO from his reading  the
        notice that may not necessarily be so, although  he  also  accepted
        that if the discretion had been exercised the way in which  it  was
        exercised has not been challenged in the grounds of appeal and  was
        therefore not a live issue before the First-tier Tribunal.


     9. Appendix FM, paragraph 1, sets out a number of  general  provisions
        in relation to evidencing the financial requirements in Appendix FM
        which are to be found in sub paragraphs (a) to (l) of paragraph  1.
        Of these the only one Mr Khan though may assist  is  paragraph  (k)
        which states:


              "where the gross (pre-tax) amount  of  any  income  cannot  be
      properly             evidenced, the  net  (post-tax)  amount  will  be
      counted, including towards a       gross income requirement."


    10. The difficulty in relying upon this provision is  that  it  is  the
        Appellants case that a number of wage  slips  were  provided  which
        proved the gross income asserted as being paid to the sponsor. Such
        wage slips and documents from HMRC were  relied  upon  as  properly
        evidencing the gross income.


    11. Mr Khan also sought to argue that if there is merit  in  the  ECO's
        grounds in relation to the evidence of income paid  into  the  bank
        accounts, the First-tier Tribunal should have been able  to  accept
        the evidence of the funds paid into the account as the gross income
        corroborated by the fact  such  income  is  recorded  in  the  bank
        statements. If such an approach is adopted the appeal must fail  as
        it was calculated that on such a  basis  the  gross  income  proved
        would only be between �17,000 and �18,000 per annum, less than  the
        minimum required sum.


    12. After the general provisions of Appendix FM-SE a number of specific
        provisions are to be found.  Paragraph  2  contains  provisions  in
        respect of salaried employment in the United Kingdom,  in  relation
        to which it states "all of the following evidence must be provided"
        (my emphasis). Subparagraph (a) relates to wage slips for requisite
        periods, (b) to a letter from the  employer  who  issued  the  wage
        slips confirming specified evidence relating to salary,  length  of
        employment, period for which the level of salary being relied  upon
        in the application has been paid, the  nature  of  the  employment,
        and, at (c) personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the  same
        period(s) as the wage slips at paragraph 2  (a)  showing  that  the
        salary has been paid into an account in the name of the  person  or
        in the name of the person and their partner jointly.


    13. This part of Appendix FM-SE creates a  mandatory  requirement  that
        these requirements are met. In this case it is  conceded  that  the
        requirements of paragraph 2 (c) were not met. The submission by  Mr
        Khan that this paragraph does not state that all the salary had  to
        be paid into an account,  hence  admitting  part  payment,  as  the
        wording does not specifically make such a statement has no arguable
        merit. The wording of the provision is clear that "the salary" must
        be paid into the account. It does not state that  part  payment  is
        acceptable and the reason for the requirements that all the  salary
        shown in the wage slips must be paid into that person's account  is
        to allow the evidence of the claimed income to be corroborated.


    14. The fact the sponsor paid less than his alleged net income into the
        account has been established by the ECO and was also conceded by Mr
        Khan as was the fact the requirement  to  have  paid  all  the  net
        income into the account is mandatory and that his client was unable
        to satisfy this requirement of the Immigration Rules.


    15. On this basis I find the Judge  has  materially  erred  in  law  in
        failing to make adequate findings in relation to why the  Appellant
        was able to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  and  to
        specify the legal basis on which the appeal could be allowed  under
        the Rules.


    16. The Judge states in the determination that the  Appellant  provided
        specified evidence. When Mr Khan was asked which evidence the Judge
        was referring to he stated it was to  the  wage  slips,  employer's
        letter, and bank statements. Whilst this description indicates  the
        type of documents required  by  the  Rules  were  provided  such  a
        finding does not show that the requirements of the Rules  are  met.
        It is not a requirement to provide bank statements but  to  provide
        bank statements corresponding to the relevant  period  showing  the
        alleged net income being paid  into  that  account.   There  is  no
        flexibility within the Rules allowing that requirement to be met by
        a part payment of alleged income having been made or to state  that
        as the amount paid in is near to but not quite  the  same  as  that
        reflected in the bank statements, that it could be taken  that  the
        requirements of the Rules have been met. To do so would import into
        an assessment of  the  ability  to  meet  the  Rules  a  near  miss
        principle which case law has established does not exist.


    17. The determination shall therefore be set  aside.  In  remaking  the
        decision Mr Khan was asked how he believed his client was  able  to
        satisfy the requirements of the Rules to which his response was  to
        assert that the HMRC document which was not available  to  the  ECO
        but which had come into existence prior to the hearing  before  the
        First-tier Tribunal confirmed the  gross  income  received  by  the
        sponsor reflected in his wage statements.  Such a submission raises
        an interesting point which  is  whether  an  individual  unable  to
        satisfy the requirements of the Rules relating to the proof of  the
        minimum available income  by  mandatory  means  is  still  able  to
        succeed if they are able to establish by other documentary evidence
        that the required minimum level of income is being earned.  Mr Khan
        submitted that a later  amendment  to  the  Rules  allows  such  an
        approach to be adopted but it is settled law that it is  the  Rules
        in force at the date of decision that are applicable to any  appeal
        and no such flexibility has been shown to exist in the Rules  being
        considered in relation to this appeal.


    18. Appendix FM sets out in some detail requirements that needs  to  be
        met by applicants, a number of  which  are  mandatory.   These  are
        prescriptive rules approved by Parliament designed to  ensure  that
        those not entitled to enter the United Kingdom are  prevented  from
        doing so. The Rules also reflect the Secretary of State's  view  of
        the minimum requirements an individual must meet to avoid  being  a
        burden upon society and the public purse in the United Kingdom,  as
        evidenced by the minimum required income levels.  It is also a  sad
        reality in relation to immigration and asylum matters that although
        the vast number of applicants are genuine individuals who would not
        think of, let alone attempt, to use fraud and deception in relation
        to applications, there are  a  number  who  do.  As  a  result  the
        requirements contain a number of checks and balances to ensure that
        if a statement is  made  supported  by  documentary  evidence  from
        source A, such as wage statements,  the  fact  such  employment  or
        remuneration is genuine and not contrived for the  purposes  of  an
        application can be  checked  by  the  provision  of  the  mandatory
        information from source B, such as  evidence  of  the  actual  sums
        received being paid into a bank account. The  Rules  make  separate
        provision for those who are self-employed or who may not have  wage
        statements  and  provide  the   required   degree   of   evidential
        flexibility  for  individuals  unable  to  provide  the   mandatory
        information for justified reasons.


    19. Mr Smart in his submissions also commented  upon  the  relationship
        between the payments made and alleged net income  received  by  the
        sponsor, differences in the amounts, and the general pattern of the
        sponsor's income which was clearly of concern to the ECO. The  fact
        the sponsor appears to have paid a sum into his account  less  than
        that he states he received on his wage slips as a result he  claims
        of his retaining the difference in cash, with  such  sum  deposited
        being withdraw shortly thereafter. Such withdrawal is not a  matter
        prohibited by the Rules but does appear to be a  pattern  prevalent
        in this case.


    20. Having considered the matter further I make a finding of fact  that
        the Appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon  her
        to the required standard to show that she is able  to  satisfy  the
        mandatory requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules,  with  specific
        reference to paragraph 2 (c) of Appendix FM-SE.  Her  inability  to
        satisfy such a mandatory requirement is fatal to the appeal.

Decision

    21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    22. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.


    23. In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal
        by dismissing it, I have considered whether to  make  a  fee  award
        (rule  23A  (costs)  of  the  Asylum   and   Immigration   Tribunal
        (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
        Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).


          I have had regard to the Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee
   Awards in           Immigration Appeals (December 2011).


          I make no fee award.


          Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
