Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A. Briddock, instructed on behalf of the
Appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India.

 2. The Appellant, with permission, appeals against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, who, in a determination promulgated  on  the  13th
    June 2017, dismissed her appeal against the decision of the  Respondent
    made on the 17th June 2015 to refuse entry clearance.

 3. Permission to appeal was refused initially by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but on renewal was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Perkins  on  the  25th
    January 2018.

 4. It is not necessary to set out in any detail the factual background  to
    this appeal or the decision reached by the First-tier  Tribunal  judge.
    That is because both parties are in agreement that the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal judge did involve the making of an error on a point
    of law. At the hearing before me, both advocates agreed that in view of
    the grounds that had been advanced when seeking renewal that  the  only
    outcome was for the decision to be set aside and for the appeal  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing. In addition, it is
    accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the  judges'  finding
    that the relationship  was  genuine  and  subsisting  since  1989  (see
    paragraph 62 of the determination) should be preserved.

 5. Given that the parties are in agreement, it is only  necessary  to  set
    out why I agree with the course set out above.

 6. The Appellant made an application for entry clearance as a spouse on 24
    March 2015. A decision was  made  on  that  application  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer on 18 June 2015  who  refused  the  application.  The
    reasons given were that the ECO was not satisfied that the parties  had
    submitted a genuine marriage certificate and  that  the  Appellant  was
    married to the sponsor given the anomalies which the ECO set out within
    the decision letter. Furthermore, the ECO was not  satisfied  that  the
    relationship with  the  sponsor  was  genuine  or  subsisting  or  they
    intended to live together permanently in the UK. As  to  the  financial
    requirements, in order to meet financial  requirements  of  Rules,  the
    sponsor needed to demonstrate an income of ï¿½18,600 per annum. The Entry
    Clearance Officer considered the documents that had been provided  with
    the application and reached the conclusion that the Appellant's sponsor
    had not provided the necessary specified documents under Appendix FM-SE
    and  refused  the  application  on  that  ground  also.  There  was  no
    consideration of any human rights claim or Article 8  in  the  decision
    letter.

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal and the  appeal  came  before
    the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  26  May  2017.  In  a  determination
    promulgated on 13 June 2017 the Judge dismissed the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds (Article 8).

 8. There is no dispute between the parties  that  the  judge  applied  the
    wrong statutory framework and decided the appeal by taking into account
    repealed statutory provisions (sections 82(2), 85 (5) and  85A  of  the
    2002 Act). In particular, at paragraph [37] the judge made reference to
    the following, "the 2002 Act is quite  clear  on  the  exceptions  that
    apply in relation to new evidence. The rules are further clear  on  the
    mandatory nature of the specified evidence."  At  paragraphs  [43]  and
    [45] the Judge took into account that the Appellant  had  not  provided
    any additional documentation with the appeal to be reviewed by the  ECM
    and whilst the Appellant had provided further evidence relating to  the
    appeal, the judge did  not  consider  that  evidence  when  reaching  a
    conclusion  on  whether  the  Appellant  could   meet   the   financial
    requirements in the  findings  of  fact  paragraphs  30  -  57  of  the
    determination. As Mr Jarvis conceded, the reason that evidence was  not
    taken into account was because they had been a misdirection made by the
    judge that she was unable to take those  into  account.  As  Mr  Jarvis
    conceded, that was  a  wrong  application  of  the  2002  Act  and  was
    therefore in error.

 9. It is further agreed between the parties  that  the  only  ground  upon
    which the appeal could be brought to the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    the decision to refuse the Appellant entry clearance was unlawful under
    Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 that  is,  it  was  contrary  to
    Article 8 of the ECHR. The issue for the judge to decide was  not  only
    to decide whether the Immigration Rules had  been  satisfied  (although
    this is a matter  of  weight  in  determining  the  proportionality  of
    denying any entry clearance) but whether refusing entry clearance would
    be contrary to Article 8 of the ECHR.  The  Immigration  Rules  reflect
    the Secretary of State's (and the ECO's) view as to  where  the  public
    interest lies in the proportionality  assessment  under  Article  8.  A
    failure to lawfully assess whether the requirements of  the  Rules  are
    met clearly impinges on the assessment of  where  the  public  interest
    lies in  the  overarching  proportionality  assessment  required  under
    Article 8.

10. It is further accepted that the Judge was required to consider  Article
    8 outside the rules. That task had not been undertaken by the  Tribunal
    and it was accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State that the  judge
    was required to engage with the substance of the claim made outside the
    rules.  As  the  grounds  set  out,  the  balancing  exercise  was  not
    adequately considered at paragraphs 76 - 78 of the determination.

11. In the light of the agreement reached between  the  parties  and  as  a
    result of the matters  set  out  in  the  preceding  paragraphs,  I  am
    satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  judge  involved
    the making of an error of law and therefore the decision  cannot  stand
    and shall be set aside.

12. One of  the  findings  made  by  the  judge  related  to  the  marriage
    certificate. The grounds seek to challenge the  findings  made  by  the
    judge as to its validity. As Mr Jarvis submits,  the  judge  also  made
    alternative findings on the basis of the reliability of  the  document.
    However in the light of the issues  relating  to  validity,  I  do  not
    preserve those adverse findings of fact and as set out in the preceding
    paragraph the only findings of fact to be preserved are those  set  out
    at paragraph 62 where the judge accepted that the Appellant sponsor had
    been in a subsisting relationship since 1989 and they had two  children
    as a result of that relationship. Furthermore the findings at paragraph
    63 should also be preserved as there has been  no  challenge  to  those
    findings.

13. Thus the appeal shall be remitted to the first-tier Tribunal  where  it
    is anticipated further evidence will be given and factual findings made
    on all outstanding issues applying the correct legal framework.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law and the appeal is remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
