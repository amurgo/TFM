Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Ren�, Counsel, instructed on a Direct Access
basis
For the Respondent:    Mr Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant  to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Troup (the judge), promulgated on 4 May 2017,  in  which
    he dismissed the Appellant's appeal.  That appeal had been against  the
    Respondent's decision of 1 February 2016,  refusing  his  human  rights
    claim.  The application giving rise to that refusal was based upon  the
    Appellant's relationship with MP, a British citizen, and her  daughter,
    N, also British and aged 14 years at the relevant time.

The judge's decision

 2. The judge first dealt with what he described as  the  ETS  issue.   The
    Respondent had asserted that the  Appellant  had  previously  practised
    deception  in  obtaining  an  English  language  certificate.    Having
    considered all of the evidence before him, the  judge  found  that  the
    Respondent had failed to make out her case and that there had  been  no
    deception [14 - 19].  In respect of the Article 8  claim,  the  judge's
    findings are set out at [39 - 43].   The  judge  first  concludes  that
    Article 8 was not engaged but then goes on to consider the claim on the
    basis that it was.  There  is  reference  to  section  117B(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as amended.

 3. The judge goes on to consider the best interests of N, having regard to
    medical evidence contained in the bundle before him.  He observes  that
    there was no evidence about the provision of certain  medical  services
    in Bangladesh and no evidence from relevant  social  services  in  this
    country as to how N's best interests  would  be  affected  whether  she
    remained in this country or went to Bangladesh.

 4. Finally, having weighed up certain matters set out in [43],  the  judge
    concludes that Article 8 would  not  be  breached  by  the  Appellant's
    removal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The grounds focus, perhaps unsurprisingly, on section  117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act and on the issue of N's best interests.  It is  asserted  that
    the judge failed to deal with the first point at  all  and  the  second
    inadequately.

 6. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Robertson  on  15
    November 2017.

The hearing before me

 7. Although it is the Appellant's appeal, I first turned to Mr  Kotas  and
    asked him for his view on the section 117B(6) issue.  He submitted that
    the evidence before the judge indicated that the Appellant did not have
    a parental relationship, but could be  better  described  as  an  uncle
    figure or at least somebody who provided some support to N.   He  noted
    that it was unclear as to how precisely the Appellant's case  had  been
    put to the judge.

 8. Mr Ren� pointed me to the evidence from MP and N  (contained  in  their
    respective witness statements), the medical evidence at 125  -  126  of
    AB1, the fact that the judge accepted there to be family  life  between
    the Appellant and MP and N, and finally to a paragraph at page 3 of the
    reasons for refusal letter.  It was, Mr Ren�  submitted,  obvious  that
    section 117B(6) was potentially engaged and that the judge should  have
    engaged with it.  His failure to do so was a material error.

 9. Mr Ren� further submitted that even if section 117B(6) was not  engaged
    because there was no parental relationship, there was still  the  issue
    of N's best interests to be considered and the judge had not dealt with
    this adequately.

Decision on error of law

10. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that the judge
    materially erred in law.  He did so in two ways.

11. First, he failed to deal with section  117B(6).   I  accept  Mr  Kotas'
    point that it is somewhat unclear whether this particular provision was
    raised at the hearing or in advance by the Appellant's  representative.
    The Record of Proceedings was not clear on the point and there  was  no
    skeleton argument before the judge.

12. Notwithstanding this lack of clarity, this particular mandatory  factor
    under the 2002 Act was, in my view, an obvious issue that  fell  to  be
    considered.  The combined effect  of  the  witness  statements  of  the
    Appellant, MP and N all went to show that the former is regarded as the
    stepfather of N, at least on a subjective  level.   That  evidence  was
    before the judge of course.  In addition, the medical evidence referred
    to by the judge in [42] of his decision  refers  to  the  Appellant  as
    being the stepfather of N.   The  reasons  for  refusal  letter  itself
    expressly accepted that the Appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with both MP and N.  Finally, what is said in [41 and  42]
    of  the  decision  indicates  that  the  judge  was   considering   N's
    circumstances in the context of her relationship with the Appellant.

13. All of these matters pointed in one direction  only,  namely  that  the
    issue of whether  there  existed  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship between  the  Appellant  and  N  was  one  which  required
    consideration and a clear finding one way or the other.

14. The second material error is in the alternative to the first.  Even  if
    it was never suggested that the Appellant had a  parental  relationship
    with N, there was still the issue of N's best  interests,  she  clearly
    being a child affected by the Respondent's decision.  Indeed, the judge
    did begin to consider N's best interests at [42].  However, although he
    notes that there was an absence of evidence on particular issues, there
    was evidence (in the form of witness  statements  from  N  and  MP  and
    medical evidence) which provided a platform upon which  clear  findings
    on the best interests could and should have been made.  However,  there
    are no clear findings in [42 or 43]  as  to  what  precisely  the  best
    interests were, how strong they were in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    presence in N's  life  as  a  support  mechanism,  and  what  effect  a
    departure would be on those best interests.

15. As a result of my conclusions I decided that I  should  set  aside  the
    judge's decision.

Re-making the decision

16. Both representatives were agreed that I  should  re-make  the  decision
    based on the evidence before me and in light of further submissions  to
    be made.   I  gave  Mr  Kotas  time  to  read  relevant  parts  of  the
    Appellant's large  appeal  bundle  (which  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal) and he confirmed that he was content to proceed  having  done
    so.  There was no need for further oral evidence.  Both representatives
    were agreed that the ETS issue was no longer live.

17. Mr Ren� submitted that the Appellant did have a genuine and  subsisting
    parental relationship with N.  He placed particular reliance  upon  the
    passage in the reasons for refusal letter, and the  witness  statements
    of the Appellant, MP, N and N's maternal grandmother.  He  referred  me
    to 125 - 127 of AB1.  He submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  been  an
    influential supporting figure in N's life, particularly since he  began
    living with her and her mother in August 2015.  I was referred to 1 and
    4 of AB2.  Mr Ren� submitted that the  evidence  from  the  police  was
    particularly significant.  I was referred to the decision of the  Upper
    Tribunal in RK [2016] UKUT 00031 (IAC).   The  first  limb  of  section
    117B(6) was met.  In respect of the second limb, Mr Ren� submitted that
    in all the circumstances it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  N  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

18. In respect of the alternative argument that the Appellant could  go  to
    Bangladesh and make an entry clearance application, Mr Ren�  relied  on
    the  totality  of  the  family  unit's  situation.   Even  a  temporary
    separation would arguably be disproportionate given the state of health
    of both N and MP.

19. Mr Kotas accepted that in light  of  N's  particular  circumstances  it
    would not be reasonable to expect her  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, he submitted that in this case the Appellant did  not  have  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with N.  He relied on  the
    fact that the relationship had not been in existence for a particularly
    long period of time.  He also referred me to 819  of  AB1  and  it  was
    noted that he was not named as part of  N's  household  or  as  another
    significant person in her life.  The same applied to page 191  of  AB1.
    It may be that the Appellant was close friends with N, but he  had  not
    stepped into the shoes of a parent.

20. In reply Mr Ren� referred me to pages 133  and  138  -  139  AB1.   The
    Appellant had in fact been present at a case conference  with  relevant
    agencies relating to N's wellbeing.  This was another indicator that he
    was regarded by relevant professionals as being the stepfather of N.

21. At the end of submissions I reserved my decision.  I indicated  to  the
    parties that if I found that section 117B(6)  did  not  apply  I  would
    invite  further  written  submissions  from  both  parties  as  to  the
    possibility of the Appellant being required to return to Bangladesh and
    make an entry clearance application from there.





Findings of Fact on the Re-make decision

22. There are very few, if any, factual disputes left in this appeal.   For
    the sake of completeness and for the avoidance of  any  doubt,  I  find
    that the Appellant did not practise any deception  in  respect  of  the
    English language certificate.  This matter is no longer in dispute.

23. I find that the Appellant has been living with MP and  N  since  August
    2015.  In respect of N, it is abundantly clear  that  she  has  had  an
    extremely troubled life and continues to suffer from significant mental
    health problems, without there being a need to go  into  detail  as  to
    what these are and/or the causes thereof.

24. Mr Kotas was correct to accept that it could in no  way  be  reasonable
    for this young woman to  be  expected  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    Again, for the avoidance of any doubt, I set out the  relevant  factors
    which no doubt informed Mr Kotas' concession and would form  the  basis
    of my finding in any event:

      i) N is British;

     ii) she has resided in this country all her life and is  now  15  years
         old;

    iii) she has had and still has significant mental health problems  which
         have included attempts on her life and self-harm;

     iv) she is a subject of specific social services intervention;

      v) she has received specialist education;

     vi) she has been assessed  as  at  least  a  medium  risk  to  herself,
         particularly if she goes out and engages with certain  people  away
         from the family home;

    vii) very recently she has been the victim of an  alleged  very  serious
         sexual assault, in  respect  of  which  police  investigations  are
         ongoing.

25. In light of the above it would be perverse to  conclude  that  N  could
    reasonably be expected to leave this country.

26. I turn to what I consider to be the core issue in this  appeal,  namely
    whether  the  Appellant  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
    relationship with N.  Having considered the evidence as a whole, I find
    that he does and this is so for the following reasons.

27. First, the Respondent expressly accepted at page 3 of the  reasons  for
    refusal letter  that  the  Appellant  had  a  "genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with" MP and N.  This is clearly a relevant factor for  my
    consideration.

28. Second, the clear and, in my view, compelling evidence  from  not  only
    the Appellant and MP but, importantly, N herself, as contained  in  the
    witness statements, shows that the three members  of  the  family  unit
    regard themselves as being just that: a family unit, with the Appellant
    acting as stepfather to N.  In respect of N's own evidence I take  into
    account her overall circumstances and the  importance  which  she  must
    clearly attach to having a supportive and  stabilising  figure  in  her
    life.

29. Third, the  Appellant's  relationship  with  MP  and  N  has  not  been
    particularly lengthy.  However, I view the temporal aspect of the  case
    in view of the circumstances as a whole.  The evidence  indicates  that
    the Appellant has had a significant positive impact  on  the  lives  of
    both MP and N even in the short time that he has known  them.   In  the
    context of N, she has taken him into her circle of  confidence,  as  it
    were, and that, in my view,  counts  for  a  lot,  notwithstanding  the
    relatively short duration of their relationship.

30. Fourth, the letter from the Children's Society at 1 AB2 clearly regards
    the Appellant, MP and N as a single family unit.  The police letter  at
    4 AB2, which I regard as being of particular  significance,  refers  to
    the Appellant as N's stepfather and makes it clear that he has attended
    appointments with the police in support of N.  I note as well that  the
    medical evidence at 126 AB1 also refers to the Appellant as  being  N's
    stepfather.   The  combined  effect  of  this  evidence  from  relevant
    professionals, all clearly independent sources,  is  that  there  is  a
    wider and considered view that the Appellant is in fact acting  as  N's
    stepfather.

31. Fifth, Mr Kotas raised the concern that the Appellant was not named  as
    part of N's household or as another significant adult in  her  life  in
    the document starting at 819 AB1.  At first glance, his point is a fair
    one.  It does appear odd that  the  Appellant  is  not  named  in  this
    document.  However, Mr Ren� then directed me to the report of  a  child
    protection  conference  which  took  place  on  28  February  2017,  in
    particular at 134 and 138 AB1.  Here, not only is the  Appellant  named
    as having attended the  conference,  but  he  is  referred  to  as  N's
    stepfather and is included in the body of the report as being a  person
    to be involved in decision-making on her behalf, along with MP.  In  my
    view this is a strong indicator of the views of the  relevant  agencies
    as to the Appellant's true position in  N's  life.   It  also  provides
    sufficient evidence to show that the omission of the  Appellant's  name
    from the document at 819 AB1 is either an error or oversight.

32. Sixth, I have taken into account the decision in  RK.   Cases  such  as
    this are fact-specific.

33. Taking all of the matters set out above into account, it is in my  view
    clear that the Appellant has stepped into the  shoes  of  a  parent  in
    respect of his relationship with N.

Conclusions

34. In light of my findings above the Appellant can satisfy the first  limb
    of section 117B(6).  He does have a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with N.  Mr Kotas has  quite  properly  conceded  that  it
    would not be reasonable to  expect  N  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    Therefore, the second limb under this  mandatory  factor  is  met.   In
    light of the Court of Appeal judgments in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ
    705 and AM (Pakistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 180 the satisfaction  of  Section
    117B(6) is sufficient for the  Appellant  to  succeed  in  his  appeal.
    Nothing more need be shown in respect of the Article 8 claim (Mr  Kotas
    has certainly not sought to argue to the contrary).

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of  law
and I set it aside.

I re-make the decision in this appeal and  conclude  that  the  Respondent's
refusal of the Appellant's human rights claim is unlawful  under  section  6
of the Human Rights Act 1998.

The Appellant's appeal is therefore allowed.
