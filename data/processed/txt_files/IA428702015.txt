For the Respondent:    Mr S Winter, instructed by McGill & Co, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above, but the rest of this  determination
    refers to them as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, whose date of birth is recorded
    as 1 January 1943.  She sought to remain in  the  UK  on  human  rights
    grounds.  In a letter dated 24 March 2014 the respondent found that she
    has no dependency on her adult relatives in the UK going beyond  normal
    emotional ties so as to amount to  family  life  within  the  scope  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  That decision did not give rise to a  right  of
    appeal.  Following various procedure, the SSHD issued a further  letter
    dated 28 October 2014 which says that as the appellant entered  the  UK
    as a visitor any application for leave to remain as an adult  dependant
    relative would fall to be refused; she does not meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules in respect of private life; there would be no  significant
    obstacles to her return to Pakistan; and her medical condition  is  not
    such as to require a grant of leave by reference to Articles 3  and  8.
    An accompanying removal decision was made, giving rise to  a  right  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant brought such an appeal, on these grounds:

         The decision is unlawful because it is incompatible with Article  8
         ECHR rights of the appellant and her family members.   Removal  ...
         would be unlawful because it would be incompatible with her and her
         family's rights under Article 8 ...

         The decision is otherwise not in accordance with the law.

         The decision is not in accordance with  the  Immigration  Rules  at
         paragraph 276ADE(vi).

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyd  allowed  the  appeal  by  determination
    promulgated on 4 June 2015.

 5. The SSHD appeals to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

      A. Section 117 Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act 2002

         The judge  fails  to  engage  with  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 (S.117) - both in substance and form.

         ... this is a material misdirection of law: it  is  incumbent  upon
         the judge to have due regard to all  the  public  interest  factors
         contained  therein,  and  the  public  interest  more  widely,   in
         determining whether there is a breach of  the  appellant's  private
         life under Article 8.

         While regard is given to 117B(4) at [49] the judge fails to  engage
         with any of the remaining public  interest  considerations,  namely
         that effective  immigration  control  is  in  the  public  interest
         (117B(1)) and that A [the appellant] must demonstrate that  she  is
         financially independent.  The  judge  should  have  had  particular
         regard to the significant expense A has  already  cost  the  public
         purse  and  the  relatively  limited  income  of  her   sponsor   -
         approximately �15,000-�17,000 per annum, see [19].

      B. Proportionality

         Moreover, having recognised at [49] that little  weight  should  be
         given to A's private life ... this ought to have been borne in mind
         substantively  or  at  least  acted  as  the  starting  point  when
         considering a proportionality assessment.

         ... the judge's conclusion that the 'balancing' exercise  falls  in
         A's favour is fundamentally flawed having regard to the  Tribunal's
         initial findings, namely that A:

               i) was 68 years old when she entered the UK [36]  (she  lived
                  in the family home for 15-20 years [11])

              ii) would have a carer in Pakistan [38]

             iii) would have access to suitable accommodation [40]

              iv) would have financial support [42]

               v) is not prevented from travelling [42]

              vi) would have access to  appropriate  care  is  available  in
                  Pakistan [48] and

             vii) having regard to the limited weight to be attached to  A's
                  private life as a starting point.

         Despite such explicit findings the judge then goes on  to  rely  on
         A's ill health and "roots"  to  conclude  that  her  removal  would
         amount  to  a  disproportionate  interference.   This  appears   at
         complete odds with the findings set out above.

         Moreover, in the "balancing exercise" no weight  is  given  to  the
         findings of fact that are demonstrative that A  would  be  able  to
         form a private life in her country of nationality, a country  where
         she has lived for all but 4 years  and  has  relatives,  and  where
         there is  access  to  medical  treatment  (albeit  perhaps  not  an
         equivalent standard to the UK).  In addition  to  this  the  public
         interest as set out at Ground A above is  not  engaged  within  the
         relevant assessment.

         The  judge  also   erroneously   considers   that   it   would   be
         disproportionate for the appellant to "perhaps ultimately come back
         to the UK" [54].  Since A has not succeeded under the provisions of
         Appendix FM as an adult dependant  relative  in  this  appeal,  and
         given the findings of fact set out above,  there  is  no  basis  to
         conclude that an application for Entry Clearance on essentially the
         same provisions would have any success either.

         Finally, as the Court of Appeal have reiterated in GS (India) & Ors
         v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40
         "the "no obligation to treat" principle must apply equally  in  the
         context of Article 8" [�111].  It was made plain that:

             "First, the absence or inadequacy of medical  treatment,  even
             life-preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be
             relied on at all as a factor engaging Article 8:  if  that  is
             all there is, the claim must fail.  Secondly, where Article  8
             is engaged by other factors, the fact  that  the  claimant  is
             receiving medical treatment in their country which may not  be
             available in the country of return may  be  a  factor  in  the
             proportionality exercise; but that factor cannot be treated as
             by itself giving rise to a breach since that would  contravene
             the "no obligation to treat" principle."

         The judge has  plainly  not  directed  himself  appropriately  when
         considering the issue of proportionality.



Submissions for SSHD.

 6. After the discussion and findings in the determination,  in  particular
    from paragraph 37 onwards, it came as  a  complete  surprise  that  the
    eventual conclusion was that the appeal was allowed.  At paragraphs  51
    and 52 the judge found that for Article 8 purposes there was no  family
    life but only private life.  Although in Singh v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    630 at paragraph 25 it was said that debate whether an applicant had or
    had not family life for Article 8 purposes was "liable to be  arid  and
    academic" that did not apply to a case involving part 5A  of  the  2002
    Act, which draws a sharp distinction between private and  family  life.
    It was significant that this case was allowed  on  private  life  only.
    The judge said at paragraph 49 that he was "urged" by section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act to give little weight to private life, but the  judge  was
    required to apply that provision in its terms.  He was  bound  also  to
    apply the considerations in section 11B(2) of the appellant's inability
    to speak English and in  section  117B(3)  of  her  lack  of  financial
    independence.  The judge had simply not factored in these matters.   He
    found at paragraph 45 that the appellant would have a  degree  of  care
    available in Pakistan.  At paragraphs 37-39 he did not find it credible
    that family  members  would  be  unable  to  assist  her  if  required,
    including in respect of care at home in Pakistan.  It  was  plain  that
    there were public costs arising from the presence of the  appellant  in
    the UK - paragraph 44 and 46.  The appellant had not  shown  that  care
    she needed would not be available in Pakistan,  and  in  any  event  GS
    established that non-availability of care could not by itself give rise
    to a breach, there being no obligation to treat. The conclusion was  at
    odds with all the earlier findings, and amounted to a failure  lawfully
    to carry out the balancing exercise.  The determination should  be  set
    aside.  The outcome should be reversed, either because  Article  8  was
    not  engaged,  or  because  the  respondent's  decision   was   plainly
    proportionate.

Submissions for appellant.

 7. The judge went wrong by finding that  there  was  no  family  life  for
    Article 8 purposes, but that was an error which could only  rebound  in
    favour of the appellant.  Gurung v SSHD [2013] 1 WLR at paragraphs  45-
    46 showed that family life was a question  of  fact,  and  might  exist
    between adult  parents  and  children.   To  correct  the  error  would
    significantly assist the  appellant's  case,  because  even  if  little
    weight were to be given to private life, that did not apply  to  family
    life.  Section 117A(2) required the Tribunal to "have  regard"  to  the
    considerations listed in section 117B.  At paragraphs 49  and  55,  the
    judge did so.  He might have erred in thinking that there  firstly  had
    to be a good arguable case to look outside  the  Rules,  but  that  was
    another error which could only rebound in favour of the appellant.  The
    judge had regard to all relevant considerations both  in  form  and  in
    substance, as every relevant factor was set out in  the  determination.
    There was no material misdirection in law.  The  judge's  reference  to
    Part 5A of the Act encompassed recognition in terms of section  117B(1)
    that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in the  public
    interest.  As to financial implications, paragraph 19 recorded evidence
    to  the  effect  that  the  appellant's  sons  would  pay   for   house
    improvements carried  out  for  the  appellant's  benefit,  from  which
    evidence it could be implied that there  would  be  no  burden  on  the
    state.  In her original application to the respondent (page 84  of  the
    appellant's first bundle on the First-tier Tribunal) the appellant  was
    asked if she was receiving any public funds and  answered,  "No".   The
    grounds were not justified in suggesting that the judge had  no  regard
    to evidence regarding cost to the public purse.  There was no  evidence
    that the appellant would be a burden.   The  considerations  listed  in
    section 117B had to be taken into account, but they were  not  intended
    to be exhaustive.  The judge had taken those factors into account.  The
    statute was to the effect that certain matters should be  given  little
    weight, not that they should be given no weight.  The grounds  did  not
    go so far as to say that the  outcome  of  the  case  was  perverse  or
    irrational, and so it must be held to have been within the scope of the
    judge at first instance.  The grounds amounted finally to no more  than
    disagreement with the judge's striking of the proportionality  balance.
    In Mukarkar v SSHD [2007] Imm AR 1 Carnwath LJ said:

         [40] Factual judgments of this kind are often not  easy,  but  they
         are not made easier or better  by  excessive  legal  or  linguistic
         analysis.  It is  the  nature  of  such  judgments  that  different
         tribunals, without illegality or irrationality, may reach different
         conclusions on the same case ... The mere fact  that  one  Tribunal
         has reached what may seem an unusually generous view of  the  facts
         of a particular case does not mean that it has made an error of law
         ...

 8. Mr Winter also cited MA (Somalia) v SSHD [2011] Imm  AR  2,  where  the
    Supreme Court made general remarks on  the  degree  of  caution  to  be
    exercised in finding error  of  law  in  cases  like  this,  saying  at
    paragraph 45:

         "... The court should not be astute to characterise as an error  of
         law what, in truth, is no more than a disagreement with  the  AIT's
         assessment of the facts."

 9. The present case did not turn only on  the  health  of  the  appellant.
    There was also her age, the level of extended family support she has in
    the UK, and private life which is in reality extended family life  with
    her closest relatives.  No errors of law had been made out.

Determination reserved.

10. There was before the Tribunal an application  by  the  appellant  under
    Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  for
    consideration of further evidence on availability of care in  Pakistan.
    Mr Winter said that he would move for admission of that  evidence  only
    if the case proceeded to the  stage  of  remaking  the  decision.   The
    appellant's preference was that if matters  did  move  to  that  stage,
    there should be a further hearing.  I indicated that  in  this  case  I
    would rather reserve my determination on the error of  law  issue,  and
    decide on any further procedure in light of the  outcome.   Mrs  Saddiq
    concurred with that course.

Discussion and conclusions.

11. It is perhaps unfortunate that neither party paid much attention to the
    question whether the appellant might have qualified under the Rules  as
    an adult dependant relative, if she were  permitted  to  make  such  an
    application.    The  answer   might   have   borne   significantly   on
    proportionality.  However, not having been explored in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that must be put aside, as far as error of law goes.

12. The obligation in terms of Part 5A is to have regard in  all  cases  to
    the considerations  listed  in  section  117B.   It  might  be  thought
    inaccurate for the judge to say that  section  117B  "urged"  him  that
    little weight was to be given to private life in a case such  as  this.
    However, every sentence in a determination does not have to be  written
    so as precisely to reflect statutory language.

13. Regarding the aspect of the burden on tax payers, Mr Winter relied upon
    paragraph  19.   The  determination  there  records  that  one  of  the
    appellant's sons said (on the matter being put to him)  that  he  would
    reimburse the local authority for improvements to a house made for  the
    appellant's benefit.  That is a narration of evidence, not  a  finding.
    It was not shown that the appellant's family was  likely  to  keep  the
    public purse free of cost.

14. Having acknowledged the above, I do not think that the SSHD  has  shown
    that the judge failed to "engage with" part  5A  of  the  2002  Act  in
    either substance or form.  The grounds overstate the aspect of part  5A
    on which specific reliance is placed.  They assert that  the  appellant
    "must  demonstrate  that  she  is  financially  independent";  but  the
    provision is that it is in the  public  interest  that  she  should  be
    financially independent, not an absolute requirement for her  to  prove
    it.   The judge mentioned all matters bearing on  Part  5A  which  were
    aired before him, and said in his last paragraph  that  he  was  "fully
    taking into account the import of section 117A and B".   He  should  be
    credited with having done as he says.

15. As the grounds and submissions pointed out,  the  judge  set  out  many
    factors weighing against the appellant,  perhaps  to  the  extent  that
    until the last two paragraphs the appeal appeared to have little  hope.
    He found the appeal "extremely finely balanced".  The factors  he  went
    on to weigh on the other side were that the appellant is an  old  woman
    (not doing well for her age); she has been here for over 4  years;  her
    conditions are  largely  degenerative;  the  return  journey  would  be
    extremely stressful, and might impact on her health; and her  two  sons
    and her grandchildren are settled in the UK.

16.  I note Mukarkar also at paragraph 38:

         "Since neither Article 8 nor the case law lays  down  any  specific
         limits to what may reasonably be regarded as "exceptional" in  this
         context, a legal challenge would have to be one of perversity."

17. The statutory framework, the case law  and  the  Rules  in  respect  of
    Article 8 have all moved on since 2007.  There has been much discussion
    of how to formulate the scope of Article 8 outside the Rules.  However,
    the final judgement remains fact-sensitive.

18. It might have been difficult for the appellant  legally  to  fault  the
    result if the conclusion had gone the other way.   However,  I  do  not
    think that the second  ground  of  appeal  amounts  to  more  than  re-
    assertion of (and perhaps  improvement  upon)  the  case  made  by  the
    respondent in the decision letter and in the First-tier Tribunal.   The
    outcome might be seen by some as unusually generous.  Not  every  judge
    would have come to the same conclusion.  However, it  is  not  said  to
    have been outside the judge's scope.  I do not find any  error  of  law
    such as to entitle or require the Upper Tribunal to interfere.

19. No anonymity order has been requested or made.

                    6 November 2015
