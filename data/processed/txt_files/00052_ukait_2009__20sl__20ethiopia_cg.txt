Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr B Bedford instructed by Sultan Lloyd Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Petryszyn, Home Office Presenting Officer (on

     Mr J Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer (on 4 August)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


A foreigner who wishes to be employed in Ethiopia will only be  able  to  do
so if there is no qualified Ethiopian for the activity in question.   A  UK-
based non-Ethiopian without particular skills is therefore very unlikely  to
obtain a work permit in Ethiopia, though a short-term visit is  unlikely  to
be problematic.

1.   The first appellant is a citizen of Somalia and  the  second  appellant
    is  her  younger  sister,  dependent  on  her.   The  first   appellant
    (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) appealed to  an  Immigration
    Judge against the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision  of  15  December
    2008 refusing to grant her and her sister leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom as respectively  the  spouse  and  dependent  relative  of  the
    sponsor Isa Fos Sharif, a person present  and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  It seems that the appellants have lived together  since  2005
    when they lost their parents.

2.   The Immigration Judge accepted that the appellant and the sponsor  were
    in a subsisting relationship. She found, however,  that  the  appellant
    could not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules in  respect
    of maintenance.  As regards Article 8, she found that there was  family
    life between the appellant and the sponsor and allowed the appeal under
    Article 8.

3.   The Secretary of State sought reconsideration  of  this  decision,  and
    reconsideration was ordered  by  a  Senior  Immigration  Judge.   On  8
    December 2008 it was concluded by a Senior Immigration Judge that there
    was required to be a reconsideration  of  the  Article  8  issue.   The
    findings on the Immigration Rules were to stand.  The decision  of  the
    Senior Immigration Judge is attached to this determination.

         "1.  This is a reconsideration of the decision of Immigration Judge
             O'Garro who on 9 July 2008  allowed  the  appellants'  appeals
             under Article 8 of the ECHR but dismissed their appeals  under
             the Immigration Rules, in respect of the first named appellant
             paragraph 281 of HC 395.


         2.   The Immigration Judge concluded on all of the evidence  before
             her that the marriage was genuine and subsisting  between  the
             appellant and the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom,  which  had
             been an issue taken by the ECO.  No challenge is made to  that
             finding in her determination.  However she also  concluded  on
             the evidence that the appellant could not meet the requirement
             to show that she and her spouse (the sponsor) would be able to
             maintain themselves  and  any  dependants  adequately  without
             recourse to public funds.   The  Immigration  Judge  carefully
             considered the evidence of the sponsor's finances in  relation
             to this finding and concluded that his income fell well  below
             the public benefit level which is the yardstick to be used.


         3.   However, when she came on to consider the appellant's  Article
             8 ground of appeal, the  Immigration  Judge  having  concluded
             quite properly that there was family life in existence between
             the appellant and the sponsor, found at paragraph 39 that  the
             appellant could not enjoy family life with her  sponsor  where
             she currently lives in Ethiopia because the  sponsor  had  not
             legal right to enter Ethiopia for settlement.  The sponsor had
             not long been granted refugee status in UK and  had  begun  to
             form a settled life there.  In addition the rest of his family
             was in the United Kingdom.   Neither  party  could  of  course
             return to Somalia, their original country of origin, to  enjoy
             family life.


         4.   Whilst recognising that the state did not have  an  obligation
             to respect an applicant's choice of country of residence,  the
             Immigration Judge found for  those  reasons  that  there  were
             clear insurmountable obstacles to the family  enjoying  family
             life anywhere other than in the United Kingdom.   In  reaching
             this conclusion she also took into account that the  appellant
             herself fled Somalia to seek refuge in Ethiopia and was living
             under harsh conditions and was a vulnerable single woman  with
             two young children.  She also took  into  account  the  impact
             their separation would have on the sponsor who  wished  to  be
             reunited with his family.


         5.   In the grounds of the application the respondent submits  that
             the Immigration Judge has given a lack of reasons for  finding
             that there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  appellant
             enjoying family life outside of the UK.  It was submitted that
             the reason that the Immigration Judge gave were  not  adequate
             and that the statement that the  appellant  was  living  under
             harsh  conditions  and  was  a  young  single  woman  was  not
             sufficient.   The  error  was  further  compounded,   it   was
             submitted, because it was accepted the sponsor had visited the
             appellant in Ethiopia which resulted in her becoming pregnant.
              There was no evidence before the Immigration Judge  that  the
             sponsor could not settle legally in Ethiopia.


         6.   The Senior Immigration Judge who ordered reconsideration  also
             identified the fact that the judge appeared not to have  taken
             any account of her finding that the appellant could  not  meet
             the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  relation  to
             maintenance and weighed that in the balance between the public
             interest and the private right.


         7.   In his submissions Mr Smart said that  the  Immigration  Judge
             had no evidence at all before her  that  the  sponsor  had  no
             legal right to reside in Ethiopia and no evidence  as  to  the
             circumstances in which the appellant was living  in  Ethiopia.
             In addition she appeared to have failed to take  into  account
             what the ECO had  said  about  the  conditions  in  which  the
             appellant had to live in Ethiopia in his notice  of  decision.
             He submitted that the Immigration Judge  had  failed  to  take
             properly into account the fact that the  appellant  could  not
             meet the maintenance requirements of the Rules and that as the
             Deputy President in KA (Adequacy of maintenance)  had  pointed
             out, it was extremely undesirable to foster  situations  where
             immigrant families might have to  exist  on  money  less  than
             social benefits, which in  turn  would  create  a  much  lower
             standard of living for those persons.  In this case the family
             would be living below the breadline and it was material factor
             to take into account in deciding the  proportionality  of  the
             respondent's decision.


         8.   In response, Mr Pipe who had filed a Rule 30 reply in which he
             relied said that the sponsor had only visited Ethiopia on  one
             occasion.  He  also  submitted  the  judge  properly  directed
             herself as to the  relevant  law.   The  sponsor  has  refugee
             status  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  it  was  relevant  that
             consideration should have been given, as the judge did, to the
             consequences of the sponsor having to give  up  his  residence
             and status here to live in a country  where  his  standard  of
             living would not be nearly as good.  In addition, the  sponsor
             had extended family in the  United  Kingdom.   The  judge  had
             recognised  the  state  has  no  obligation  to  respect   the
             applicant's choice of residence but she  then  identified  the
             circumstances in which the appellant was  living  in  Ethiopia
             and the fact she had originally had to flee Somalia.  She  was
             living with the second appellant, her 6 year old  sister,  and
             had recently given birth to the  couple's  first  child.   She
             would therefore be a young woman living in Ethiopia  with  two
             very small children, one  a  babe  in  arms.   The  judge  had
             considered the continued separation of the family  and  indeed
             the rights of all  members  of  the  family  in  reaching  her
             conclusion.  He submitted that  the  judge  had  given  proper
             reasons for finding that it was not reasonable to  expect  the
             sponsor to join the appellant in Ethiopia.


         9.   In relation to the adequacy  of  maintenance  point,  Mr  Pipe
             submitted  that  although  the  judge  had  made  no  specific
             reference to this, she would not have considered Article 8  at
             all had she found that the provisions of  paragraph  281  were
             met.  Although he accepted the shortfall  in  the  maintenance
             requirements implicitly had to be considered in  the  balance,
             it  did  not  outweigh  the  other  considerations  that   the
             Immigration Judge had taken into account.   He submitted there
             was no material error of law in her determination.


         10.  I find the judge has materially erred in law in  her  approach
             and for the reasons  that  follow,  there  should  be  a  full
             reconsideration of the Article 8 ground of the appeal.


         11.  It  is  not  correct,  as  Mr  Pipe  submitted,  that  if  the
             Immigration Judge found that paragraph 281 was met,  that  she
             would not have needed to go on to consider  Article  8.    The
             appeal on Article 8  grounds  is  separate  and  distinct  and
             although an Article  8  balancing  exercise  will  clearly  be
             influenced by an out of country ... .. the appellant's ability
             to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, that is not
             the end of the matter.  However in  my  view  the  Immigration
             Judge in reaching her conclusion on the Article  8  ground  of
             the appeal did fail to take into account a number of  material
             issues, not least of which was that she  failed  to  give  any
             weight at all to the fact that the appellant and  her  husband
             cannot show that they have adequate money to live on,  bearing
             in mind that there are now two children to support.  That  was
             a  material  consideration  it  should  have  weighed  in  the
             balance.   However, it is not the sole factor and there are  a
             number of other relevant factors that had to be considered and
             in  my  view  the  Immigration  Judge  has  failed  to  do  so
             adequately and properly.


         12.  First of all, the Immigration  Judge  reached  the  conclusion
             that the sponsor would not be able to live in Ethiopia without
             giving  any  reasons  at  all,  save  that  she  accepted  the
             appellant's case that that was the position.  The  Immigration
             Judge noted that the  sponsor  had  visited  Ethiopia  on  one
             occasion.  There is no indication in the determination for how
             long he visited or on what basis he was granted  admission  to
             the country. The determination does not make it clear how long
             the sponsor  has been living in the United  Kingdom;  when  he
             was granted refugee status, nor does it make it clear what was
             the evidence as to the extended family he has  in  the  United
             Kingdom and what kind of relationship he has with  his  family
             members.  In short, there is  very  little  detail  about  the
             sponsor's life in the United  Kingdom  save  for  the  details
             about his work.


         13.  Consideration should have been given clearly to the fact  that
             this is not a case of  removal  from  the  UK  but  rather  an
             appellant who wishes to come to the United  Kingdom  to  enjoy
             family life here.  In those circumstances the  fact  that  the
             sponsor has refugee status here and has settled will have less
             impact than in the case of a British  citizen  who  has  lived
             here all of his or her life - AB (Jamaica) v SSHD [2007]  EWCA
             Civ 1302.  There is no indication in the determination of  how
             the appellant and the sponsor came to meet in the first place.
              There are no  reasons  given  by  the  Immigration  Judge  at
             paragraph 41 for why she concluded the  appellant  was  living
             under conditions and it is not  clear  on  what  evidence  she
             based that conclusion, particularly in the light of the  ECO's
             comments in the notice of decision.    The  Immigration  Judge
             placed some weight on the fact that the children  needed  both
             parents to offer them nurturing and guidance and yet failed to
             weigh in the balance  that  this  is  an  application  by  the
             appellant to join the sponsor in the United Kingdom and he has
             to date not spent any significant periods  of  time  with  the
             appellant and her sister.


         14.   The  Tribunal  concludes  that  the  Immigration  Judge   did
             materially err in law for these reasons and  that  the  proper
             course now is for a reconsideration of the Article 8 ground of
             the appeal so that the evidence can be  reconsidered  in  full
             and the balancing exercise carried out taking account  of  all
             the factors identified above.  For these reasons the  Tribunal
             directs that none of the findings of Immigration Judge O'Garro
             in relation to the Article 8 ground of the appeal will stand."



4.   The hearing before me took place on 19 February 2009.   Mr  B  Bedford,
    instructed by Sultan  Lloyd  Solicitors,  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant.  Mr L Petryszyn appeared on behalf of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.

5.   It was accepted by Mr Bedford in light of what had  been  said  by  the
    Court of Appeal in AS (Somalia) [2008] EWCA Civ 149 that the effect  of
    Section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  is
    that that subsection is applicable not only to Immigration Rules issues
    but also Article 8 issues and therefore under Section 85(5)  any  post-
    decision events which generate or enhance a human  rights  based  claim
    for entry clearance can  be  the  subject  of  a  fresh  claim  and  if
    necessary  a  fresh  appeal,  and  therefore  there  is  no  breach  of
    Convention rights in the factual matrix in respect  of  the  Article  8
    issue being restricted only to the circumstances  appertaining  at  the
    time of the decision to refuse.

6.   In light of that Mr Bedford argued that the  issue  was  whether  there
    was an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  the  appellant  and  her  husband
    enjoying family life if the appellant did not obtain a grant  of  entry
    clearance and the issue therefore was whether the  sponsor  could  join
    her in Ethiopia. It was a question of whether if he could go  he  would
    be able to earn a living there but most importantly whether he would be
    entitled to enter and remain there.  On  that  there  was  no  evidence
    other than comments in the explanatory statement.  There was a  concern
    as to whether the Tribunal was in a position today  to  deal  with  the
    reconsideration in the absence of such evidence.

7.   Mr Petryszyn said that he had such evidence in the form of  an  extract
    from the January 2008 COIR on Ethiopia at section  32  of  that  report
    and, he produced a copy of this and there was a  brief  adjournment  to
    enable Mr Bedford to consider it.

8.   Mr Bedford thereafter argued that it would be necessary  for  there  to
    be an adjournment in order for the appellant to apply to the  Ethiopian
    Embassy to see if there were insurmountable obstacles to his  going  to
    Ethiopia to work.

9.   Mr Petryszyn argued that this would be quite inappropriate and  on  the
    basis of what was said there there was sufficient evidence  before  the
    Tribunal and it was not necessary for him to apply and see  what  would
    happen but the matter could and should be determined on  the  basis  of
    the evidence before the Tribunal.

10.  After consideration I concluded that it would  not  be  appropriate  to
    adjourn.  There was sufficient evidence in what was said at part 32  of
    the January 2008 COIR on Ethiopia for the matter to  be  argued  today.
    However there was a relevant point in respect  of  Article  11  of  the
    proclamation regulating the issuance of travel documents and visas  and
    registration of foreigners in Ethiopia, no. 271 of 1969, as referred to
    at (v) on page 168 of the report.  That Article was not produced in the
    COIR.   I  agreed  to  delay  determining  the  appeal  to  enable  the
    representatives to address me on this, and accordingly seven days  from
    the first hearing was  allowed  for  both  sides  to  provide  evidence
    relating to Article 11 and its contents and implications and thereafter
    a further seven days to make submissions on what they had to say  about
    the evidence they and the other side had produced.

11.  Thereafter the sponsor, Isa Fos Sharif,  gave  evidence.  He  confirmed
    that his statement dated 12 February 2009 was  true.   He  had  visited
    Ethiopia in 2007.  He had arranged the visit.  The appellant  had  been
    in Djibouti and from there she had gone to Ethiopia when  he  had  told
    her to go there.  He had approached the Ethiopian Embassy  for  a  visa
    around the summer of 2007.  It had taken about  four  weeks  to  get  a
    visa.  He could not remember  how much it had cost,  but  it  had  been
    affordable.  He had not been interviewed. He had  had  to  produce  his
    travel document, by which he meant an ID document and proof of address.
    He had not been required to show an airline ticket.  The visa had  been
    for three months, the maximum. The air fare was �550-600 approximately.



12.  He currently worked as a production operator in a food factory. He  had
    had about four day's training on the job.  He had arrived in the United
    Kingdom in 2002 when he was aged 14 or 15, and  was  now  21.   He  had
    obtained an Esol qualification in English literacy at level 3 and  also
    a BTech Intro and a BTech level 1. He spoke English and Somali  but  no
    Arabic and no Ethiopian language.  When he had been in Ethiopia he  had
    spoken English and Somali.  He had had dealings with the Ethiopians  at
    the airport and had some problems with the guards as they did not speak
    English but then they had got someone who spoke English and after  that
    they had let him go.  He did not have concerns about the fact  that  he
    had been interviewed.  There had been simple questions  concerned  with
    why he had come and how long he was staying and  he  had  filled  in  a
    form.  He had told them he was visiting his  wife.   He  had  not  been
    questioned about his wife or about her nationality nor how  much  money
    he had with  him.

13.  When he had been in Ethiopia for nearly four weeks he had  lived  in  a
    residential area of Addis Ababa. The people who lived there were mainly
    Ethiopians and there  were  Somalis  also.   His  wife  did  not  speak
    Ethiopian.  She did not work.  She survived on the  money  he  sent  to
    her.

14.  In the United Kingdom he had his mother, grandmother,  sister  and  two
    brothers, an uncle and cousins.  He had come to the United Kingdom with
    his mother and his sister who was aged 18 or 19, and his  brothers  who
    were aged 16 and 22.  His siblings did not work,  they  were  students.
    His mother worked as a carer for the elderly.  His grandmother did  not
    work.  He lived alone.  His uncle was about 15 and  his  mother  looked
    after him and his oldest cousin was about 16 and none were working that
    he knew of.  They were students.

15.  He had not taken any money other than his own money with  him  when  he
    had gone to Ethiopia.  None of his relatives sent money  to  people  in
    Ethiopia.  His mother looked after four people,  his  sister,  brother,
    uncle, cousin and grandmother. He did not really know what  his  mother
    earned.

16.  On cross-examination the  sponsor  said  that  he  began  to  work  for
    Ranstad on 24 November 2006.  At the date of refusal therefore  he  had
    been working for them for eleven months.  He had  gone  on  paid  leave
    when he had visited Ethiopia.  He could  not  remember  how  much  paid
    annual leave he was entitled to by the year at that  time  and  it  was
    different now anyway.  When he had applied for the  visa  he  had  told
    them he  was  going  to  see  his  wife.   She  was  living  in  rented
    accommodation and had been there for a few months in October 2007.   He
    had been paying the rent since she moved to Ethiopia, initially for the
    hotel  she  was  in  and  then  in  the  current  accommodation.    The
    accommodation was a shared home, like a bungalow.   Her  part  had  two
    bedrooms and  a  shared  bathroom  and  a  shared  kitchen.  There  was
    electricity.  With  regards  internal  plumbing,  there  was  a  normal
    African kitchen with firewood to light  and  a  stove.  The  house  had
    access to water if the water was running and if it was not running then
    it was necessary to buy it.  He did not know how many rooms there  were
    in the rest of the house, nor  who  lived  there.   There  were  a  few
    families there, he did not know how many.  If his wife wished to access
    her part of the building then she would go through a gate  in  an  open
    area and then straight through a door to the rooms.

17.  There was no re-examination.

18.  In his submissions Mr Petryszyn relied on the refusal  notice  and  the
    explanatory statement.  The appeal had failed on maintenance, and AS as
    referred to above was relied on in respect of  the  Article  8  aspect.
    The refusal of entry clearance  would  not  be  disproportionate.   The
    appellant could re-apply if there were up-to-date evidence that changed
    the situation.  It was a  question  of  the  date  of  decision.    The
    sponsor had visited for a three and a  half week period and contact had
    been maintained.  He had gone to Ethiopia on a tourist  visa.   He  had
    told them the purpose of the application, that  he  was  visiting  his,
    wife and they were  not  interested  in  documents  beyond  the  travel
    document and ID and he had not been interviewed.  He had  had  a  short
    interview on arrival and there was no interest in his earnings  or  his
    wife's nationality but just the purpose and duration of the visit.   It
    was therefore possible to get a tourist visa for a short period and  he
    had no problems in arriving or leaving.  He could  go  and  extend  his
    visits by entry visa as could be seen at (2) of page 168 of  the  COIR.
    He would be able to go and establish himself in  business  or  on  some
    other basis. The issue of what Article 11  said  was  to  be  addressed
    subsequently in written submissions.  Family life could be  maintained.
    It was possible to get a visa or a residence permit.  The circumstances
    for the appellant were  not  unduly  harsh  on  the  basis  of  today's
    evidence.  She had been supported by the sponsor for  some  time.   The
    appeal should be dismissed.

19. In his submissions Mr Bedford started from the premise that there was a
    finding of family  life  that  was  protected.   The  denial  of  entry
    clearance would be an interference in line with what was  said  by  the
    Court of Appeal in AB (Jamaica).  The burden of  proving  proportionate
    interference was on  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  where  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the couple enjoying family life other  than
    in the United Kingdom.  The Entry Clearance Officer could  not  satisfy
    that burden.  Mr Bedford referred to the point at paragraph  6  of  the
    first stage reconsideration concerning the  order  for  reconsideration
    and the issue of failing to take into account the inability to meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules as part of the Article 8 balance.
     There was a reference by the Senior Immigration Judge  to  a  material
    factor of the family living below the breadline in the United  Kingdom.
    Counsel's argument, which had been taken into account,  and  hence  the
    appeal was originally allowed under Article  8  though  not  under  the
    Rules, was set out at paragraph 8 and paragraph 9.  There it  had  been
    accepted that the shortfall in the maintenance requirements  implicitly
    had to be considered in the balance but it was argued that it  did  not
    outweigh the other considerations. The  Senior  Immigration  Judge  had
    nevertheless found there to be a material  error  of  law  and  it  was
    necessary to  determine  whether  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  could
    justify the interference.  It was argued that there were insurmountable
    obstacles to the sponsor living with the appellant  in  Ethiopia.   The
    reference in the explanatory statement to the Somali community and  the
    support it could offer was unsourced.  It would seem therefore that  in
    the reference to informal job opportunities it was  suggested  that  it
    was possible to get round the immigration  controls  and  work  in  the
    black economy, but it was argued that the Entry Clearance Officer could
    not rely on a person working illegally in another country in  order  to
    maintain family life.  It was for the Entry Clearance Officer to  prove
    that Article 7 of the proclamation was current in Ethiopia and not just
    a theoretical possibility and that there was a  real  prospect  of  the
    sponsor getting a residence permit entitling him to work or  set  up  a
    business, albeit that he had  no  job  offer  or  business  set  up  in
    Ethiopia.  The existence of a power to grant  residence  under  (v)  at
    page 168 of the COIR was illusory. There were no  inherent  discretions
    in the Ethiopian law and what was set out there did not necessarily set
    out the legal position.  Paragraph (v) appeared to provide a discretion
    and it was not reasonably foreseeable  that  the  Ethiopian  government
    would allow the sponsor to settle until he had a job or a business  and
    would not let him live with an appellant who lacked residence status.

19.  The absence of a provision to extend the residence visa  did  not  mean
    that there was untrammelled  power  to  do  so  or  it  would  be  less
    difficult to get a residence permit than a transit visa  or  a  tourist
    visa.  There was a lack of  provision  for  extension  of  a  residence
    permit which indicated there was no such provision.  This could be seen
    from (v) again.  The sponsor's job in  the  United  Kingdom  was  at  a
    fairly low level and was described as low skilled. It did  not  support
    the argument that he could be optimistic about work  in  Ethiopia.   AB
    (Jamaica) was not authority for what it was said to be  by  the  Senior
    Immigration Judge at paragraph 13 of the stage 1 determination. Such  a
    person was no less entitled to  family  life  than  a  British  person.
    Article 8 applied to all people who were subject to  the  authority  of
    the particular high contracting party and there was no  differentiation
    between UK nationals and others. The burden of proof was on  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to show that the decision was proportionate.  In that
    particular case it had been allowed outright.  There  was  no  evidence
    from the Entry Clearance Officer  to  satisfy  the  Tribunal  that  the
    sponsor in this case could go  to  Ethiopia  lawfully  and  live  there
    legitimately and get work. There was no evidence  that  his  mother  or
    other relatives could send him money.  Visits,  contrary  to  what  was
    argued on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer, could not properly  be
    an alternative, given the finding of family life and interference.   It
    was unclear how the appellant's  living  conditions  in  Ethiopia  were
    relevant to the issue of insurmountable obstacles.

20.  I reserved my determination.

21.  Subsequent to the hearing I received from Mr Petryszyn details  of  the
    Ethiopian Regulations relating to entry, exit, visas, residence permits
    and deportation.  In a covering  note  Mr  Petryszyn  stated  that  the
    Proclamation N 271 of  1969  referred  to  in  the  Country  of  Origin
    Information Report for Ethiopia  of  January  2008  had  in  fact  been
    repealed on 3 July 2003 when Immigration Proclamation N  354/2003  came
    into force  and  there  was  also  an  Immigration  Council  Minister's
    Regulation N 114/2004 which  came  into  force  on  11  September  2004
    providing further clarification of Proclamation N  354/2003.   He  made
    brief submissions in respect of the Proclamation and the Regulations.

22.  As a consequence of receipt of this communication I caused a  direction
    to be made on 5 May 2009 deeming the reconsideration to be  part  heard
    and giving the appellant an opportunity if she so wished to  commission
    an expert report.  Subsequently, on 3 August 2009, an expert report was
    received.

23.  The hearing reconvened on 4 August 2009.  Mr Bedford again appeared  on
    behalf of the appellant.  On this  occasion  Mr  J  Singh  appeared  on
    behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer.

24.  Mr Singh referred to the date of  decision  as  22  October  2007,  and
    noted that the matter was proceeding under Article 8 only,  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules having been dismissed.  It was  a  question
    of whether family life could be enjoyed  in  Ethiopia  by  the  sponsor
    relocating.  On the sponsor's evidence he had been in Ethiopia  between
    27 August and 21 September 2007 and had successfully obtained  a  three
    month visa for that visit which  was  valid  between  3  August  and  3
    November 2007.  He was either familiar with the application process  or
    had been well-advised.  The question  was  whether  he  could  continue
    family life in Ethiopia or what obstacles existed.  It was argued  that
    he could settle there.  He had obtained asylum  status  in  the  United
    Kingdom and work.  The COIS had now been updated with respect  to  what
    the sponsor would have to do to be able to  settle  in  Ethiopia.   The
    Regulations and Proclamation were the  equivalent  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Initially the sponsor would get a three  month  immigrant  visa
    under Article 13(1)(b) of the Proclamation, and  once  there  he  would
    need to register and could application for temporary residence  a  year
    at a time.  The Ethiopian Regulations said that after three years' stay
    he could apply for a permanent visa there.  The appellant had no status
    in Ethiopia but there was capacity in the Regulations for her to  apply
    for an alien passport, as could be seen from page 18 of the bundle,  so
    she could get registered and become settled  there.   The  report  even
    showed the levels of fees at page 27.  The hardship seemed to be in the
    United Kingdom where the couple could  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 281 of HC 395.  Article 8 was not absolute, and  family  life
    could be enjoyed in Ethiopia by way of visits there as  had  been  done
    previously.

25.  Mr Singh asked that the expert report be treated  with  caution.   From
    the expert's background it could be seen that he had been  barred  from
    entering Ethiopia in the past so he did not have an open mind  but  had
    been previously wanted by the  Ethiopian  authorities.   He  had  never
    given evidence before a  Tribunal  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  key
    section was paragraph 114 onwards.  He said the sponsor could not  live
    in Ethiopia as he would not satisfy the Ethiopian Regulations,  but  no
    source was given for this statement and it was just his opinion and  he
    had not stated any figures and had not interviewed  the  appellant  and
    did not take into account  the  previous  success  of  the  sponsor  in
    visiting Ethiopia.  The second sentence of paragraph  114  displayed  a
    general focus rather than concentrating on the date  of  decision.   It
    was a question of what the sources were  for  paragraph  116.   It  was
    evidence, but it was limited.  He did not advance the case as  at  date
    of decision.  The appellant had failed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Family life could be continued in Ethiopia.  There was nothing to  show
    that the sponsor could not repeat his previous stay and  the  situation
    was akin to the various probationary periods that were  required  under
    United Kingdom immigration law.  The appeal should be dismissed.

26.  In his submissions Mr Bedford referred to the expert report and  argued
    that on the face of the Regulations and the  Proclamation  they  denied
    the sponsor the possibility of residing in Ethiopia.  The question  was
    whether it was reasonable for the appellant  to  continue  family  life
    with the sponsor in Ethiopia and it could not be reasonable if he would
    not be allowed to go there.

27.  Mr Bedford referred to page 20 of the Secretary of  State's  bundle  at
    paragraph 17 which showed the circumstances in which an immigrant  visa
    would be issued.  It could be seen that none of these  applied  to  the
    sponsor.  He needed to be able to work  and  the  Regulations  did  not
    allow him to do so.  In effect that was an  end  to  the  matter.   The
    expert had referred to the Regulations and what they stated.   He  also
    considered the alternative of the appellant being a registered  refugee
    and having the sponsor join her under Ethiopian  refugee  law,  but  if
    that happened, paragraph 115 had to be borne in mind.  It was far  from
    being a United Kingdom-type family reunion policy.  There was also  the
    possibility of the sponsor being allowed to join the appellant  despite
    this but again paragraphs  121  and  122  dealt  with  that.   So  even
    allowing for this possibility, it was not a reasonable option.  If  the
    sponsor could not work then it could not be said that  the  alternative
    of the  appellant  joining  the  sponsor  in  the  United  Kingdom  was
    unreasonable.  It was necessary in the light  of  Beoku-Betts  for  the
    appellant and the dependants to be considered.  The  appeal  should  be
    allowed.

28.  I reserved my determination.

29.  It will be  appropriate  if  I  set  out  first  of  all  the  relevant
    provisions of Ethiopian law as provided under cover of  Mr  Petryszyn's
    letter of 20 February 2009.

30.  First there is the Immigration Proclamation N 354/2003 which came  into
    force on 3 July 2003.  I do not propose to set out  the  whole  of  the
    Proclamation but rather to set out the relevant  paragraphs.   Part  5,
    paragraph 12 lists the different types of visas that exist:

        "12. Types and issuance of visas


             1)    Visas to be issued in accordance with  this  Proclamation
                 and Regulation issued hereunder shall be the following:

        Part Six


        Registration of Foreigners and Residence Permit


        13.  Registration

                     visa, within 30 days of the date of his arrival;

                     days, within 30 days of the date of his arrival;


                 (d)   without prejudice to Article 14 of this Proclamation,
                     anybody who enters Ethiopia without a visa pursuant to
                     Article 4 of this Proclamation and intends to stay for
                     more than 90 days, within 30 days from the date of his
                     arrival.


             2)    The conditions of registration  shall  be  prescribed  by

                 be.


             2)    Minor children shall be recorded in the residence permits

             3)    The conditions of issuance of residence permits shall  be
                 prescribed by Regulation to be issued hereunder."

31.  Thereafter at Regulation 22 the earlier Proclamation  is  repealed  and
    this Proclamation is stated at paragraph 24 as coming into force on the
    third day of July 2003.

32.  Next there is a Council  of  Ministers  Regulation  N  111/2004.   This
    provides further clarification  of  the  Proclamation.   The  following
    provisions of this are of relevance:

        "7.   Alien passport


         An alien passport shall be issued to a resident foreigner  who  is
             unable to  obtain  his  national  travel  document  or  who  is

                 reside in Ethiopia, and to members of their families;


            2)    family members of foreigners holding permanent  residence
                 permits in Ethiopia;


            3)    foreigners coming to reside in  Ethiopia  without  either
                 being engaged in  any  gainful  activities  or  becoming  a
                 public burden, and to members of their families.


        26.  Registration


             1)     An  application  for  registration  in  accordance  with
                 Article 13 of the Proclamation shall be made by filling  in

                     in accordance with directives issued by the Authority.


             2)    The applicant shall, in addition to those required  under
                 sub-Article (1) of this Article, furnish his photograph.


        27.  Residence Permit


             1)    Any foreigner who has been registered in accordance  with
                 Article 26 of this Regulation shall, upon  payment  of  the

                 a permanent or temporary residence permit, as the case  may
                 be, in accordance with Article 28 or 29 of this Regulation.


             2)    Any foreigner who has been issued with a residence permit

                 the time of registration,  particularly  a  change  in  his
                 name, nationality, occupation, marital status or address of
                 workplace or residence, within 30 days  from  the  date  of

             3)    Any foreigner shall have the obligation  to  present  his
                 residence permit  or  the  identity  card  referred  to  in

                 with which he entered Ethiopia  whenever  required  by  the
                 appropriate authorities.


        28.  Permanent Residence Permit


             1)    A  permanent  residence  permit  shall  be  issued  to  a

                 this Regulation.


             2)    Without prejudice to sub-Article  (1)  of  this  Article,

                 (a)   established his domicile in  Ethiopia  and  lived  in
                     Ethiopia  for  at  least  three  years  preceding  the
                     submission of his application;


                 (b)   sufficient and lawful source of  income  to  maintain
                     himself and his family; and

             3)    Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-Article (2) of this
                 Article, a permanent residence permit may be  issued  to  a
                 foreigner who is married to an Ethiopian national if  there
                 is a lapse of at least one year since the conclusion of the
                 marriage.


             4)     A  foreigner  engaged  in  investment  or   humanitarian
                 activities in Ethiopia or who has made or  is  expected  to
                 make outstanding contributions in the interest of  Ethiopia
                 may  be  issued   with   a   permanent   residence   permit
                 irrespective of the waiting period  provided  for  in  sub-
                 Article (2)(a) of this Article.


             5)    A foreigner who has obtained a permanent residence permit
                 shall be issued with a work  or  an  investment  permit  in
                 accordance with the appropriate laws.


        29.  Temporary Residence Permit


             1)    A temporary residence  permit  shall  be  issued  to  any
                 foreigner  who  has  been  registered  in  accordance  with
                 Article 26 of this Regulation and who is not entitled to  a
                 permanent residence permit.


             2)    A temporary residence permit shall be valid for a  period
                 not exceeding one year from the date of issuance and  shall
                 be replaced by a new one where it becomes necessary to stay
                 longer."

33.  It is relevant at this point to turn  to  the  expert  report  of  Herr
    G�nter Schr�der.  Herr Schr�der describes himself as an  historian  and
    social anthropologist by training and has been working for  many  years
    as an independent researcher and consultant.  He  has  regular  contact
    with most of the various armed liberation movements fighting in Eritrea
    and Ethiopia as well  as  many  other  political  movements  from  both
    countries and in 1975 was barred from entering Ethiopia due to critical
    articles he had published and some seven years later was apparently  on
    a death list as a political opponent of the then regime.   Subsequently
    he was enabled to visit Ethiopia in November 1991 and in June 1992  was
    a member of the German  election  observer  team  sent  by  the  German
    Foreign Ministry  and  then  between  1993  and  1998  was  permanently
    stationed in Ethiopia as the unofficial country representative for  the
    German Protestant Churches Development Services, having agreed to abide
    by a condition not to write on political issues.  Between 1998 and 2000
    he worked on secondment from the  Lutheran  World  Federation  and  the
    German Protestant  Churches  Development  Services  for  the  Ethiopian
    Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church as an advisor on  its  territorial  and
    administrative reform.  In June 2000 however he  was  given  24  hours'
    notice to leave Ethiopia by the Ethiopian security  services.   He  has
    maintained a close interest in Ethiopia  and  other  countries  in  the
    region and has written extensively on the region but,  it  would  seem,
    has not been able to go back to Ethiopia since 2000.

34.  Herr Schr�der makes the point at the foot of page 2 of his report  that
    in Ethiopia the official law and policy documents do  not  reflect  the
    real situation  and  in  many  areas  of  governmental  action  current
    practice does not really correspond to the letter of the law and  there
    is no real rule of law in Ethiopia and the government  often  blatantly
    disregards its own laws and Regulations and acts in open  violation  of
    them.  He refers to the highly personalised and arbitrary  exercise  of
    state power at every level and the need for personal experience of  the
    realities of Ethiopia in order properly to understand  and  assess  the
    situation in the country.

35.  Herr Schr�der then goes on to refer to  the  relevant  legal  documents
    which are the two I have mentioned above and in addition Proclamation N
    409/2004: Refugee Proclamation (RP), entry into force 15 June 2004.  He
    makes the point that paragraph 12 of the Refugee  Proclamation  enables
    family members of asylum seekers  and  recognised  refugees  living  in
    Ethiopia to be permitted to enter and remain  in  Ethiopia,  though  he
    notes  that  neither  the  Proclamation  nor   the   Regulations   deal
    specifically with  this  category  of  immigrant.   He  says  that  the
    Ethiopian policy on business and immigrant visas is  in  practice  very
    restrictive and there is a high level of mistrust regarding  foreigners
    and the thresholds for granting business and immigrant visas  are  very
    high.  He notes that there is a relatively small number  of  foreigners
    legally residing in Ethiopia, paragraph 8 on page 4 of his report.

36.  He deals in some detail with the position of refugees in  Ethiopia  and
    general country conditions.  Herr Schr�der states at paragraph  114  of
    his report that it seems from the information available to him that the
    appellant is living as an  undocumented  and  unregistered  refugee  in
    Addis Ababa as she  apparently  did  not  register  within  the  period
    prescribed by the Refugee Proclamation with the  Ethiopian  authorities
    as a refugee and she therefore, he says, cannot benefit from the family
    unity clause of the Refugee Proclamation.  He  considers  that  if  she
    were now to register with the authorities as a refugee  and  apply  for
    refugee status she would most likely be sent to one of  the  camps  for
    Somali refugees.  As a registered asylum seeker she would  be  entitled
    to benefit from the family unity  clause  but  he  considers  that  the
    wording of the Refugee  Proclamation  as  well  as  Ethiopian  practice
    strongly suggests that this clause is meant to benefit  family  members
    of refugees having arrived in Ethiopia together with the applicant  for
    refugee status or joining the  applicant  later  from  the  country  of
    origin.  He says at paragraph 116 that there are no cases known at  all
    of  the  Ethiopian  government  authorising  family  reunification  for
    recognised refugees living within Ethiopia with family  members  living
    in third countries through resettlement of the latter to Ethiopia.

37.  Herr Schr�der  considers  that  the  sponsor  is  not  entitled  to  an
    immigrant visa as he does not fall within  the  categories  of  persons
    entitled to such a visa.  In this regard he makes the  point  that  the
    sponsor is not married to an Ethiopian citizen, his wife is not a legal
    resident in Ethiopia and he does not have the means to live in Ethiopia
    without seeking  employment  or  engaging  in  business  activities  or
    becoming a public burden.  Herr Schr�der says at  paragraph  5  of  his
    report that business visas are accorded for various short-term and long-
    term business activities  including  employment  activities.   For  the
    latter, visas are only issued if  the  relevant  Ethiopian  authorities
    have ascertained that there is no qualified Ethiopian for the  activity
    in question. After arrival, holders of  a  business  visa  who  entered
    Ethiopia for employment put roses have to obtain a work  permit  and  a
    temporary residence permit.

38.  It is clear if one looks at  Regulation  17  that  the  sponsor  cannot
    satisfy either sub-paragraph (1) or sub-paragraph (2).  Whether or  not
    he can  satisfy  Regulation  17  sub-paragraph  (3)  depends  upon  the
    interpretation of the phrase  "without  either  being  engaged  in  any
    gainful activities or becoming a public burden".  Herr Schr�der clearly
    interprets  this  as  meaning  that  the  sponsor  cannot  satisfy  the
    requirement of having the means to live  in  Ethiopia  without  seeking
    employment or engaging in business  activities  or  becoming  a  public
    burden.  Though the matter is not entirely free from doubt, I  consider
    that his interpretation is a proper reading of sub-paragraph  (3).   In
    other words to satisfy this requirement a person  must  be  engaged  in
    gainful activity and not become a public burden.  It would hardly  make
    sense for a person to be granted a  visa  enabling  him  to  reside  in
    Ethiopia on the basis of showing that he was not going to be engaged in
    any gainful activities.  It is possible to interpret it as referring to
    somebody who is entirely self-sufficient, and even  if  that  were  the
    case, it is very difficult to see how the sponsor  could  satisfy  that
    requirement since he has been unable to assist his wife in showing that
    she can be maintained without recourse to public funds  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He might be able to travel to Ethiopia with sufficient  funds
    to enable him to show he would not be a charge on public funds  in  the
    short term, but an inability to work would fairly  soon  mean  that  he
    would become a charge on public funds, and on my interpretation of  the
    relevant provisions, he would certainly be unable to obtain a permanent
    residence  permit,  as  the  implication  from  sub-paragraph  (2)   of
    paragraph 27 of the Regulations  is  that  a  foreigner  who  has  been
    registered with a residence permit, since he has to notify such matters
    as change of the address of his work place, implies that he is a person
    who has employment or some other form of lawful income.

39.  Herr Schr�der goes on to state that theoretically the sponsor  will  be
    entitled to reunite with his family under the family  unity  clause  of
    the Refugee Proclamation,  but  then  refers  back  in  effect  to  his
    paragraph 116 concerning the absence of any cases of this  being  done.
    Even if that were not the case and he were allowed to reunite with  his
    family he would not acquire a permanent  residence  right  but  only  a
    registration as a recognised refugee with limited  legal  security  and
    would  only  be  restricted  under  paragraph  21(3)  of  the   Refugee
    Proclamation which would restrict his freedom of movement and work such
    as, as set out at paragraph 122 of the report, he would not be able  to
    open a business legally or legally seek salaried employment to maintain
    his family but at best would only be  able  to  work  illegally.   Herr
    Schr�der makes the point that  Ethiopian  authorities  in  Addis  Ababa
    currently tolerate such violations of the letter of the law  for  their
    own political reasons, but there is no  guarantee  whatever  that  they
    would continue to do so  and  this  would  expose  the  appellant,  the
    sponsor and their family to a considerable risk of economic  insecurity
    and harassment by the Ethiopian authorities.  Lacking legal status  and
    the financial means to rent lawfully  adequate  accommodation  for  the
    sponsor and his family  would  force  them  to  live  in  low  quality,
    overpaid and overcrowded accommodation or even in a refugee camp.

40.  I am satisfied from reading Herr Schr�der's report that he is  properly
    to be regarded as an expert with  a  good  deal  of  knowledge  of  and
    insight into Ethiopian affairs and the relevant legal provisions that I
    have set out.  The fact that he does not always source his  information
    is beside the  point:  as  an  expert  who  has  displayed  significant
    knowledge of Ethiopia, he is entitled to express views and comment upon
    matters without having to provide sources on every occasion, though  it
    is clearly very helpful where an  expert  is  able  to  do  that.   For
    example, when he states at paragraph 116 that there are no cases  known
    at  all  where  the  Ethiopian   government   has   authorised   family
    reunification for recognised refugees in Ethiopia for resettlement with
    a family member living in a third country, a matter with which Mr Singh
    took issue, I consider that Herr Schr�der is entitled to state this  on
    the basis of his knowledge of the situation in Ethiopia and his regular
    monitoring of developments in Ethiopia as he sets out at paragraph 2 of
    his report where he refers to the various ways in which he keeps up  to
    date on developments in Ethiopia and other countries  in  the  Horn  of
    Africa.

41.  Bringing these matters together, I consider that the sponsor has  shown
    that he would not be able to work legally in  Ethiopia.   He  would  be
    able to visit for a period of time as he did previously  and  be  self-
    sufficient during that period, but he would not be able to  remain  for
    any longer period without  having  a  work  permit,  and  there  is  no
    indication that there is any opportunity for work available to  him  in
    Ethiopia; in particular, it seems unlikely that there is  no  qualified
    Ethiopian available given the sponsor's lack of particular  skills  and
    if he were forced to work illegally in circumstances described  by  the
    expert, I consider that that would not be reasonable  for  the  reasons
    Herr Schr�der gives.

42.  This is of course not the end  of  the  matter.   It  is  necessary  to
    evaluate the Article 8 claim on the proper structured basis as set  out
    in particular by the House of Lords in Razgar and further explained  in
    subsequent decisions.  The first point  is  whether  or  not  there  is
    family life between the appellants and the sponsor.   I  have  referred
    generally to the appellant but of course it must be borne in mind  that
    there  are  two  appellants,  the  second  appellant  being  the  first
    appellant's young sister, who has lived with her since  2005,  and  who
    was born in April 2002, and there is also now of course  the  child  of
    the appellant and the sponsor.  The sponsor's evidence, as set  out  in
    his witness statement, is that he married the first appellant  in  July
    2006 in Djibouti, they having known each other prior to their  marriage
    as they lived close to each other in Mogadishu in  Somalia.   It  seems
    that the sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2002.  He said that  the
    appellant fled Somalia and went to Djibouti in 2005 and while  she  was
    living there they made contact with each other and he flew  there  from
    the United Kingdom and they married there.  She went on to Ethiopia and
    he came back to the United Kingdom and visited her for three and a half
    weeks in August and  September  2007,  during  which  time  she  became
    pregnant with their child, who was born on 19 June 2008.   The  sponsor
    also said in his statement that the couple had kept in touch by  email,
    letters, photographs and telephone calls.

43.  On the basis of this evidence  I  accept  that  there  is  family  life
    between the appellant and the sponsor, albeit that it  is  family  life
    that has only been enjoyed to the extent of their being in each other's
    company for very limited periods.  It is not clear from  the  sponsor's
    evidence how long he  was  with  the  appellant  at  the  time  of  the
    marriage, and as has been set out above, they have spent some three and
    a half weeks in each other's company after the marriage.

44.  It must be accepted that refusal of entry clearance has  a  significant
    effect on their family life.  The next question  is  whether  there  is
    such interference as potentially to engage the operation of Article  8.
    In this regard, clearly the extent of family life enjoyed by the couple
    when physically together cannot be enjoyed by being kept apart, but the
    family life that has very largely existed  during  the  time  of  their
    relationship could continue to be enjoyed since they could still remain
    in contact by means of letters, photographs and telephone calls.  It is
    relevant also to note the sponsor's evidence that the appellant is  now
    unable to send him regular emails as she finds it  hard  to  leave  the
    house with the baby.  However, if one goes on to assume that there will
    be such interference as potentially to engage the operation of  Article
    8, which I think on balance is a reasonable conclusion to come to, then
    it is clear that such interference is in accordance with the  law,  and
    the issue then arises as to whether it is  necessary  in  a  democratic
    society in the interests of national security,  public  safety  or  the
    economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention  of  disorder  or
    crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection  of
    the rights and  freedoms  of  others.   In  this  regard  I  find  such
    interference to be necessary in the interests  of  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control as well as to the economic  wellbeing  of
    the country, and in this regard it is particularly  important  to  note
    that the couple have been unable to satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules concerning maintenance, and therefore there would  be
    a clear charge on public funds were the two appellants  and  the  first
    appellant's child to join the sponsor in the United Kingdom.

45.  The final issue then, as so often in Article 8 cases, is  whether  such
    interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved, and in this regard the burden is on the Secretary of State.

46.  In this  regard  I  bear  in  mind  the  conclusions  I  have  come  to
    concerning the reasonableness of the sponsor going  to  live  with  the
    appellants in Ethiopia.  Though the appellants' living conditions there
    on the evidence  do  not  appear  to  be  particularly  onerous,  I  am
    satisfied on the evidence that the sponsor would not be  able  to  work
    legally and do not consider it can be said to be reasonable for him  to
    work illegally or for the appellants to make a belated application  for
    registration with the Ethiopian authorities as  refugees  and  for  the
    couple together with the two children then to go and live in a  refugee
    camp.  It is clear therefore that family life between the  sponsor  and
    his family in terms of living together cannot be carried on in Ethiopia
    and the resulting question is therefore whether any lack of respect for
    family life that would obtain as a result  of  the  couple  being  kept
    apart, indeed the family being kept  apart,  by  the  appellants'  non-
    admittance to the United Kingdom is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
    public end which is sought to be achieved.   Clearly  the  sponsor  can
    visit the appellants as he did before when he obtained a visa for up to
    three months and was apparently able to obtain leave from work for  the
    period  of  nearly  a  month  during   which   he   visited   Ethiopia.
    Communication by letters and  photographs  and  telephone  calls  would
    appear to be able  to  be  maintained,  I  note  the  difficulty  being
    experienced by the first appellant in sending emails given the problems
    of leaving the house with the baby.   It  is  also  not  an  irrelevant
    matter to bear in mind that the sponsor, who is clearly an enterprising
    young man, may in the future earn at a level allowing the  requirements
    of the  Immigration Rules to be met; hence restricting the duration  of
    the period of limited cohabitation.  It is also  relevant  to  bear  in
    mind, as I have noted above, that, even bearing in mind the constraints
    caused  by  living  in  different  countries,  the  couple  have  spent
    relatively little time together.  The sponsor has been  in  the  United
    Kingdom since 2002, and since then when the  first  appellant  went  to
    Djibouti in 2005 they made contact and he flew there  from  the  United
    Kingdom and they married there and were together for an unspecified but
    relatively brief period of time.  Since then, as I have set  out,  they
    have spent some three and a half weeks in each other's company.  In  my
    view, having considered the evidence set out above, it has  been  shown
    on behalf of the Entry  Clearance  Officer  that  the  interference  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.  Such
    family life as the couple have can be maintained in the way in which it
    has existed for nearly all of their married life, bearing in  mind  the
    legitimate public end which is sought  to  be  achieved,  the  economic
    wellbeing of the country and the maintenance of  effective  control  of
    immigration, a relevant aspect of which in this case is  the  inability
    of the appellant to satisfy the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    on maintenance.  I therefore conclude that the appeal under  Article  8
    is dismissed.
