For the Respondent:    Ms J Vidyadharan, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Boyd sitting at Glasgow on  6  August  2014)
    dismissing the appellant's appeal on the papers against the decision by
    the Secretary of State to refuse to grant him leave to remain as a Tier
    4 Student Migrant, and against her concomitant decision to  remove  him
    from the United Kingdom by way of directions under Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider that such  a
    direction is warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of India, whose date of  birth  is  21  May
    1980.  He was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom on 13  December
    2009 as a Tier 4 Student Migrant until 28 October 2013.  On  that  day,
    he applied for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

 3. The application was refused on 21 November 2013 on maintenance grounds.
     The appellant needed to show that he was in possession of �2,000 for a
    consecutive 28 day period.  But he had  provided  no  evidence  of  the
    funds available to him.

 4. The appellant appealed this decision, and his appeal came before  Judge
    Turnock sitting at Bradford on 20 February 2014  for  determination  on
    the papers.  The case advanced by the appellant in his notice of appeal
    was that, contrary to what was said in the  refusal  decision,  he  had
    provided a number of bank statements with his application.  He was  now
    submitting with his appeal "a further copy of those statements".

 5. Judge Turnock observed that the copy statements were dated 30  November
    2013, and so could not have been identical to any statements  submitted
    with the application.

 6. However, he indicated that in his  view  the  respondent  had  breached
    evidential flexibility principles,  as  in  his  application  form  the
    appellant had indicated that  he  was  submitting  bank  statements  in
    support of his application.  Judge Turnock  held  that  the  respondent
    ought to have sought clarification under Rule 245AA of the  Rules,  and
    therefore a lawful decision on the application remained outstanding.

 7. On 10 April 2014 the Home Office wrote to the appellant asking  him  to
    produce bank statements covering a period of 28  days,  which  must  be
    dated no earlier than 31 days before the  date  of  application  on  28
    October 2013.  If he failed to produce the information requested within
    the time given, he was warned that his application would be  considered
    on the basis of the information currently available.

 8. On 12 May 2014 the Home Office gave  their  reasons  for  refusing  the
    application on reconsideration.  The appellant had submitted three bank
    statements from Barclays Bank.  The opening and  closing  date  of  the
    first statement was 28 November  2013  to  1  April  2014;  the  second
    statement was dated 7 March 2014 to 29 April 2014; the third  statement
    was dated 3 February 2014 to 1 April 2014.  These bank statements  were
    dated after his application date and so they were unable to take  these
    documents  into  account  when  assessing  his  funds.   He   had   not
    demonstrated that at the time of his application he had  the  level  of
    funds required.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appellant asked for his appeal to  be  determined  on  the  papers.
    Judge Boyd dismissed the appeal on the basis set  out  in  the  refusal
    letter.  The appellant had not shown that he had the required funds  of
    �2,000 for  a  consecutive  period  of  28  days  as  at  the  date  of
    application.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

10. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    arguing that Judge Boyd had missed the point.  The bank  statements  in
    the respondent's bundle covered the period up to 28 October  2013,  and
    they showed that he was holding  �2,314.11  for  the  relevant  28  day
    period prior to the date of application.

The Grant of Permission

11. On 6 October 2014  Judge  Cox  granted  permission  for  the  following
    reasons:

         I have carefully considered the determination in  relation  to  the
         grounds and further grounds.  The grounds in essence  contend  that
         the judge failed properly to engage with or to understand the facts
         and history of the case with the result that he erred in  law  when
         assessing whether the appellant met the maintenance requirements of
         Appendix C at the relevant time.  I  find  that  the  grounds  have
         arguable merit, enhanced by the further grounds.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the hearing before me, Mr Amgbah developed the arguments  raised  in
    the application for permission to  appeal,  and  I  reviewed  the  bank
    statements in the respondent's bundle.  Ms Vidyadharan  submitted  that
    there was no error of law because the appellant had not proved that  he
    had provided any bank statements with his application and/or before the
    date of decision.  She handed up a printout from a Home Office computer
    record relating to the appellant. This showed that he was  recorded  as
    of 21 November 2013 as having provided  no  bank  statements  with  his
    application.

Discussion

13. In Khatel and Others (Section 85A: effect  of  continuing  application)
    [2013] UKUT 44, the Tribunal held that Section 85A of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 precluded a Tribunal in a  points-based
    appeal from considering evidence as  to  compliance  with  points-based
    Rules where that evidence was not before the Secretary  of  State  when
    she took her decision.  The Tribunal also held that the Section did not
    prevent a Tribunal  from  considering  evidence  that  was  before  the
    Secretary of State when she took the  decision,  whether  or  not  that
    evidence reached her only  after  the  date  of  application,  for  the
    purposes of paragraph 34F of the Immigration Rules.

14. The second limb of Khatel was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Raju
    and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ
    754.  But the first limb of Khatel remains good law.

15. On the evidence provided by way of appeal against the  initial  refusal
    decision, the appellant showed  in  retrospect  that  he  had  been  in
    possession of over �2,000 for a  relevant  28  day  period  immediately
    preceding the  date  of  application.   This  was  shown  in  the  bank
    statements running up to the end of November 2013, which the  appellant
    had obtained from the  bank  on  2  December  2013.   These  same  bank
    statements were in the Home Office bundle that was before Judge Boyd.

16. However, Judge Turnock rightly did not take  into  account  these  bank
    statements for the purposes of deciding whether the appellant  met  the
    maintenance requirements.  He recognised that they were not  admissible
    for that purpose, as clearly the bank statements relied on  by  way  of
    appeal had not been before the  Secretary  of  State  at  the  date  of
    decision.

17. Judge Turnock is to be taken  as  having  allowed  the  appeal  on  the
    provisional assumption that the appellant was or might be  telling  the
    truth when he said that he  had  provided  a  set  of  bank  statements
    produced on or before 28 October 2013 with his application,  which  the
    respondent had  completely  ignored.  Although  Judge  Turnock  invoked
    Paragraph 245AA, it did not  apply  if  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    provide any bank statements at all: see sub-paragraph (c) of  Paragraph
    245AA. This was not a case of one bank statement being omitted  from  a
    series, so as to trigger a potential duty to make a request under  sub-
    paragraph (b).

18. I recognise that if it were true that the appellant had provided a  set
    of  original  bank  statements  with  his  application,  it  would   be
    difficult, if not impossible, to provide the  same  set  of  "original"
    bank statements many months later.  But the appellant did not  seek  to
    discharge the burden of proving that he had provided a set of  original
    bank statements with his application by, for instance, providing a copy
    set of the same documents; and/or by  providing  confirmatory  evidence
    from the bank that they had produced a relevant set of bank  statements
    immediately before the application  pursuant  to  a  request  from  the
    appellant.

19. It is argued in the grounds of appeal that as the application had  been
    remitted to the Secretary of  State  for  reconsideration,  Judge  Boyd
    ought  to  have  taken  into  account  the  bank  statements   in   the
    respondent's bundle; or alternatively Judge Boyd ought  to  have  taken
    into account the more recent bank statements.  But he  could  not  take
    into account the bank statements in the respondent's  bundle  as  these
    had self-evidently not been before the Secretary of State at  the  date
    of decision.  He also could not  take  into  account  the  recent  bank
    statements, as the appellant was not making a  fresh  application,  but
    was appealing against the refusal of the application made on 28 October
    2013.

20. It would have been helpful if the judge had explained why  he  was  not
    taking into account the bank statements in the respondent's bundle, but
    his failure to do so does not disclose a material error of  law.   For,
    as previously discussed, he simply could not take them into account due
    to Section 85A of the 2002 Act.



Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.
