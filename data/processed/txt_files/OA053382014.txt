                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For the purposes of my decision I shall refer to the Appellant  as  the
    Entry Clearance Officer and the Respondent as the claimant.

 2. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge M P W Harris (Judge  Harris),  promulgated
    on 25 March 2015, in which  he  allowed  the  claimant's  appeal.  That
    appeal was against the original refusal of entry  clearance,  dated  24
    March 2014, in which it was said that the claimant's application  under
    Paragraph 297 of  the  Immigration  Rules  failed  because  the  United
    Kingdom-based sponsor, Mr Frederick Kalemba (the claimant's father) did
    not have sole responsibility for her, and that there were no compelling
    family or other considerations present.

 3. The claimant had had a previous appeal against another  negative  entry
    clearance decision in 2012. First-tier Tribunal Judge Prior  had  found
    that the sponsor did not have sole responsibility for the claimant  and
    that there were no compelling family reasons. The appeal was  dismissed
    on all grounds. This was not successfully challenged.

Judge Harris' decision

 4. Judge Harris first dealt  with  the  sole  responsibility  issue  under
    Paragraph 297(i)(e) of the Rules. In paragraphs 10-20 of his  decision,
    clear findings and reasons are provided for  his  conclusion  that  the
    claimant could  not  satisfy  sub-paragraph  (e).  These  findings  and
    reasons have not been the subject of any cross-appeal by  the  claimant
    and I need say no more about them.

 5. Judge Harris then deals with the compelling  family  reasons  issue  at
    paragraphs 22-31. He found that, taking the evidence  as  a  whole  and
    notwithstanding the  application  of  Devaseelan  *[2002]  UKIAT  00072
    principles, the claimant's relationship with her mother's  partner  had
    broken down to the extent that  she  was  unable  to  reside  with  her
    mother. She was in effect, Judge Harris found, being forced to live  at
    her boarding school, and therefore being separated not  only  from  her
    father in the United Kingdom, but also her mother in Uganda  (paragraph
    29). This was contrary to  her  best  interests.  Given  the  situation
    pertaining in Uganda, Judge Harris concluded that  the  best  interests
    lay in re-joining  her  father  in  the  United  Kingdom:  this  factor
    represented a serious and compelling  family  consideration  (paragraph
    31).

 6. Judge Harris also  found  that  arrangements  had  been  made  for  the
    Appellant's care in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  that  maintenance  and
    accommodation were not in dispute (paragraph 32).

 7. The appeal was therefore allowed under Paragraph 297 and there  was  no
    need to go on and consider Article 8 issues (paragraphs 33-34).

The Entry Clearance Officer' grounds

 8. The succinct grounds assert that because no explanation as to the cause
    of the hostilities between the claimant and her  mother's  partner  had
    been provided, Judge Harris erred in failing to adequately  reason  his
    conclusion that serious and compelling factors existed in this case.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth on 16 June 2015.

The hearing before me

10. Mr Melvin relied on the grounds. In addition he  submitted  that  Judge
    Harris had failed to  take  any  account  of  the  need  for  effective
    immigration control. There was nothing on the ability of the father  to
    visit the claimant in Uganda.

11. Mr Aghayere submitted that Judge Harris had relied not only on evidence
    from the father, but  also  that  from  the  mother.  The  serious  and
    compelling factor was not simply that the claimant was at her  boarding
    school: it was the fact that she could not go and live with her  mother
    at all.

Decision on error of law

12. As I informed the parties at the hearing, I  find  that  there  are  no
    material errors of law in the decision of Judge Harris.

13. The grounds are in essence a reasons challenge.  However,  in  my  view
    Judge Harris has provided  perfectly  adequate  reasons  for  his  core
    finding of fact that the claimant was unable to reside with her  mother
    in Uganda because of the antipathy between the former and  the  partner
    of the latter. The Judge clearly took account of the unreliable  nature
    of aspects of the sponsor's evidence (paragraph 24). He stated,  as  he
    was probably bound to, that the  sponsor's  evidence  alone  could  not
    prove the claim. Then Judge Harris goes  on  to  place  weight  on  the
    mother's written evidence in respect of the existence of antipathy vis-
    ï¿½-vis the claimant  and  the  partner  (paragraph  25).  He  was  fully
    entitled to place weight upon this evidence, notwithstanding  the  fact
    that  religious  differences  were  not  mentioned  in   the   relevant
    declaration. What is clear from that declaration is that the mother was
    stating that the claimant could no longer live with the partner due  to
    "family issues" (see paragraph 6 of the declaration). The fact  that  a
    specific cause was not mentioned did not  preclude  Judge  Harris  from
    placing whatever weight upon this evidence he saw fit.

14. In addition to the foregoing, Judge Harris  took  account,  as  he  was
    entitled to, of the fact that the permanent address stated in the  visa
    application form was that of the  boarding  school,  not  the  mother's
    house (paragraph 26). This was a further reason provided in support  of
    the core finding.

15. On a proper reading of paragraph 23 it  is  also  apparent  that  Judge
    Harris had in mind the claimant's own evidence contained in her  letter
    dated 23 April  2014  (referred  to  in  paragraph  16).  Whilst  quite
    properly not taking post-decision circumstances into  account,  he  was
    fully cognisant of the nature of the "heart of the appellant's  claim."
    That "heart" was the hostility between her and the mother's partner.

16. Therefore, when paragraphs 23-26 are read as a  whole,  there  is  more
    than adequate  reasoning  to  support  the  core  finding  of  fact  in
    paragraph 27 that the claimant was unable, as at the date of  decision,
    to live with her mother.

17. Turning to the remainder of Judge Harris' reasoning process,  there  is
    nothing wrong in what is said in paragraphs  28-31.  He  was  entitled,
    indeed bound, to consider the claimant's  best  interests.  She  was  a
    minor who was clearly affected by  the  decision  under  appeal.  Judge
    Harris was not, as suggested by Mr Melvin, seeking to apply section  55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to the case before
    him. He was simply applying the relevant provision of  the  Immigration
    Rules (Paragraph 297(i)(f)) in  the  context  of  compliance  with  the
    broader requirements  of  the  jurisprudence  on  decisions  concerning
    children. Mr Melvin's submission on this point was beyond the remit  of
    the grounds of appeal, and in any event misconceived.

18. Judge Harris was in turn entitled to treat the  best  interest  of  the
    claimant in being able to reside with at least one parent (in this case
    the father being to only option) as a  serious  and  compelling  family
    consideration,  making  her   exclusion   from   the   United   Kingdom
    undesirable. Again, the grounds have  not  taken  an  issue  with  this
    approach in terms of legal misdirection. In any event, I see  no  error
    of law here at all. Whether one describes the factual circumstances  in
    terms of best interests or serious and compelling  considerations,  the
    result is, in this  case,  the  same:  Judge  Harris  was  entitled  to
    conclude as he did, namely that sub-paragraph (f) was satisfied.

19. As to the suggestion that the serious and compelling consideration  was
    only that the claimant was living in a boarding school, it is  patently
    obvious that Judge Harris based his conclusion on  the  fact  that  the
    claimant was precluded from living with her mother, not simply that she
    was physically staying at the school.

20. Mr Melvin has submitted that Judge Harris erred in failing to  consider
    the need for effective immigration control. However, the  decision  was
    not based upon Article 8. Paragraph 297 (as with  other  provisions  of
    the Rules) has this requirement already factored into it. The Rules are
    the primary tool for effective immigration control. There was  no  need
    for Judge  Harris  to  'double-count'  immigration  control:  once  the
    criteria of Paragraph 297 were met, the  appeal  fell  to  be  allowed,
    without more.

21. Finally, Judge Harris took proper account of the previous  decision  of
    Judge Prior in 2012 (see paragraph  31).  Time  and  circumstances  had
    moved on, and there is no error of approach in respect  of  this  issue
    whatsoever.

Anonymity

22. No direction was made by Judge Harris and none has been requested  from
    me. I make no direction.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal is dismissed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of ï¿½10.00 only. This is to reflect the fact that whilst  the  claimant
has ultimately  succeeded  in  her  appeal,  this  result  is  based  almost
entirely on evidence not submitted with the initial application itself.  The
appellate process was crucial to the outcome.
