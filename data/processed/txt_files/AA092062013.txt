 Representation:


 For the Appellant:    Mr E Nicholson, counsel instructed by Times PBS Ltd
 For the Respondent:   Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ Turquet, promulgated on 4
     February 2015, in which she dismissed the appellant's appeal against a
     decision to refuse to grant her asylum.















                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015





     Background


  2. The appellant last left Albanian in December 2012, travelling by air
     to France. She entered the United Kingdom clandestinely and applied
     for asylum on 20 August 2013. The basis of the appellant's asylum
     claim is that she is a victim of trafficking. That application was
     refused. A previous appeal against that decision was dismissed by FTTJ
     Napthine on 19 December 2013, however that decision was set aside and
     the matter remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.


  3. During the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
     FTTJ heard evidence from the appellant alone. A psychiatric report was
     also submitted on the appellant's behalf along  with  other  evidence.
     The FTTJ dismissed the  appeal  on  credibility  grounds  as  well  as
     concluding that none of the requirements of the Rules, in relation  to
     the appellant's private and family life, had been met.




      Error of law


    4. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought on the basis
       that it was arguable that the FTTJ did not consider the psychiatric
       report prior to making adverse credibility findings; that she erred
       in relying on apparent discrepancies between the screening and
       substantive interview records and that she failed to put alleged
       discrepancies to the appellant prior to concluding that they were
       detrimental to her credibility.


    5. The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge granting permission did so on all
       grounds.

    6. The Secretary of State's response of 1 July 2015 stated that the
       respondent did not oppose the appellant's application for permission
       to appeal on the basis that the FTTJ reached a conclusion on
       credibility before considering the psychiatric report. The Tribunal
       was invited to determine the appeal with a fresh oral hearing on the
       issue of whether the appellant was a refugee.


 The hearing


  7. Mr Tarlow relied on the Rule 24 response  and  both  parties  were  in
     agreement that the manner in which the FTTJ considered the psychiatric
     report amounted to a material error of law. There was  also  agreement
     as to the appropriateness of remitting the appeal  to  the  First-tier
     Tribunal for a de novo hearing.


  8. The FTTJ set out detailed reasons, over 7 pages of the  decision,  for
     concluding that the appellant's account was a fabrication. It was only
     after reaching that  conclusion  that  she  turned  her  attention  to
     Professor Katona's report. While commenting on the psychiatric report,
     the FTTJ reiterated  her  earlier  negative  credibility  findings  on
     several occasions, concluding that the report is not "of  great  value
     in the assessment of credibility." It is abundantly clear from reading
     the decision that the FTTJ failed to  consider  all  of  the  evidence
     before her in the round prior to making findings of fact,  Karanakaran
     v SSHD [2000] INLR 122 applies.

  9. In these circumstances I am satisfied that there  are  errors  of  law
     such that the decision be set aside to be remade. None of the findings
     of the FTTJ are to stand.

 10. Further directions are set out below.



 11. An anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ. I consider it appropriate
     for anonymity  to  be  continued  and  therefore  make  the  following
     anonymity direction:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "


Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the
     making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be re-made.


     Directions





   . This appeal is remitted to be heard de novo by any First-tier Tribunal
     Judge except FTTJ Turquet and FTTJ Napthine.
   . The appeal should be listed for a hearing at Hatton Cross.
   . An interpreter in the Albanian language is required.
   . Time estimate is half a day.
