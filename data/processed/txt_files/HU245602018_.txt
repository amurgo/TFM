For the Appellant:     Mr Janjua, Janjua & Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born in 1990.   He appeals with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Shimmin) to dismiss his human rights appeal.




    Anonymity Order

 2. This decision includes information about the mental health  history  of
    the Sponsor.   Having had regard to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of
    2013: Anonymity Orders  I  am  concerned  that  identification  of  the
    Appellant could lead to identification of the Sponsor.     I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Background and Matters in Issue


 3. On the 15th January 2018 the Appellant made an  application  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom in order to settle with his Sponsor,  a
    British woman whom I shall refer to herein as S.   The application  was
    referred to the entry clearance 'hub' at Sheffield, and a decision made
    on the 7th November 2018.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the
    application on the following grounds:


              i) Suitability: EC-P.1.1(c) read with S-EC.2.2(a) of  Appendix
                 FM.


                 The Appellant stated in 'Appendix  2'  to  his  application
                 that the Sponsor had  never  been  married  before.  Checks
                 (unspecified) by the Respondent found this  to  be  untrue.
                 The Entry Clearance Officer was  therefore  satisfied  that
                 false information had been supplied with the application.


             ii)  Eligibility: EC-P.1.1(d) read with Section E-ECP.


                 The  Respondent,  having  had  regard  to  the   discrepant
                 information  provided  about  the  relationship,  was   not
                 satisfied that the marriage was genuine and subsisting.


                  Further the Entry Clearance Officer could not be satisfied
      that
                 the Sponsor was free to marry the Appellant as no evidence
           had
                 been provided that her first marriage had ended.








            iii) Further and in  the  alternative  the  Respondent  did  not
                 consider  there  to  be  any  exceptional   or   compelling
                 circumstances such that entry clearance would be  justified
                 'outside of the rules'.




 4. Having heard the evidence of S the First-tier Tribunal agreed with  the
    Entry Clearance Officer on each of these matters  and  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.


 5. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan on the  grounds
    that the First-tier Tribunal erred in the following material respects:

              i) Failing to make a finding on the medical evidence.


                 It was the  oral  evidence  of  S  that  she  suffers  from
                 depression, anxiety  and  personality  disorder  which  she
                 believes to "affect her performance when  under  pressure".
                 Although no independent evidence was before the Tribunal in
                 respect of these conditions, there was reference to them in
                 material in  the  Respondent's  bundle  and  they  remained
                 relevant to the Tribunal's assessment of the case.


             ii) Making a finding unsupported by the evidence.

                 The Tribunal concluded that S had not been  free  to  marry
                 the Appellant and as  such  their  marriage  could  not  be
                 considered valid. There was  no  evidence  to  support  the
                 contention that she was not free to marry;  there  was  not
                 even evidence to  suggest  that  she  had  previously  been
                 married by United Kingdom law.


            iii) Error of fact/misdirection.


                 The Appellant is found to have supplied  false  information
                 when he said that his wife had not been married before.  In
                 fact she had not been married according to English law:  he
                 therefore told the truth.



 6. Before me Mr Janjua sought, and was granted, permission  to  amend  the
    grounds.  The detail of these changes is set out  below  but  in  short
    summary it is submitted that Mr Janjua had  prepared  the  case  before
    both First-tier and Upper Tribunals in good faith that what was said in
    the refusal letter about the discrepancies was correct.  He had however
    told the First-tier Tribunal that he had not been in possession of  all
    of the documents relied upon by the Respondent, and in  particular  the
    document 'Appendix 2' which is referred to  in  the  refusal.   When  I
    informed Mr Janjua that the file contains no such document he sought to
    amend the grounds to submit that the Tribunal took  immaterial  matters
    into account, made mistakes of fact and misunderstood the  case  before
    it. Permission was granted on all these grounds.






    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


 7. It is of course the case that the Appellant must succeed on  all  three
    of his pleaded grounds if he is to succeed  in  this  appeal.  That  is
    because a negative outcome on any one of the matters in issue  -whether
    the relationship  is  genuine  and  subsisting,  the  validity  of  the
    marriage or whether  he  lied  -  would  result  in  the  appeal  being
    dismissed.




    Validity of Marriage, False Information


 8.  I take these two issues together, because as I explain, they are  very
    much intertwined. The foundation of the Respondent's decision to refuse
    this application with reference to S-EC.2.2 of  Appendix  FM  was  this
    response to a question put to the Appellant at  interview  on  the  2nd
    October 2018:


         "Q26:    Have you or your spouse been married before?
           A:     No we haven't, this is our first marriage for both of
                  us"


 9. The Respondent noted the evidence found elsewhere that in  fact  S  had
    undergone a nikah in approximately 2010/11 and lived with that  man  in
    the United Kingdom before the 'marriage' ended.  It was  this  evidence
    which led the First-tier Tribunal to agree  with  the  Respondent  that
    this marriage had not been shown to be valid,  and  moreover  that  the
    Appellant had lied at his interview.


10. The answer given by the Appellant at his interview had to  be  read  in
    context of the other  evidence  he  had  given  about  his  wife.  That
    evidence included:


              i) A statement signed by the Appellant on the 9th August  2019
                 in which he says the following  "we  got  engaged  had  our
                 Islamic  nikah  on  2  August  2014  however  due   to   my
                 immigration status we could not register  our  marriage  in
                 the UK" and that subsequently "we registered  our  marriage
                 in Pakistan".  Of his wife's previous Islamic marriage  the
                 Appellant says "I further confirm that at the time  of  our
                 marriage, we were both free to marry each  other.  My  wife
                 was previously in a relationship  with  a  British  citizen
                 which ended in 2011"


             ii) A copy of the 'FLR (FP)' form completed  by  the  Appellant
                 and submitted to the Respondent under cover of letter dated
                 28th October 2014. This bundle was submitted by the HOPO to
                 Judge Shimmin.  It related to an in-country application for
                 leave that the Appellant made after being apprehended as an
                 overstayer, the refusal of which resulted in him  returning
                 to Pakistan.   The  covering  letter  lists  the  documents
                 submitted to the Home Office at the  time,  which  included
                 photographs of injuries sustained by S (as I apprehend  it,
                 allegedly inflicted on her by her former  partner),  and  a
                 photograph  of  her  "divorce"  -   unfortunately   neither
                 document is actually reproduced in  this  bundle.  What  is
                 produced in the bundle is the actual application  form,  in
                 which the Appellant says this [at �7.17]:

                       "wife got married in UK only nika done no registry
                         married.   husband   in   Pakistan   now   divorced
Islamically"

                 That bundle also contains a series of letters  from  family
                 and friends, the contents of which need not be set out here
                 save to note that they serve to confirm three things:  that
                 the S was previously in a  relationship  in  the  UK  which
                 ended badly, in the  aftermath  of  that  relationship  she
                 suffered mental health problems, and that the  relationship
                 that  she  now  has  with  the  Appellant  is  genuine  and
                 subsisting and giving her great happiness.

11. I am satisfied that in its assessment of the matters  of  validity  and
    false information the First-tier Tribunal failed to have any regard  at
    all to this important evidence.  What  the  application  form  in  2014
    illustrates is that the Appellant was quite willing  to  disclose  that
    his wife had previously been married according to Islamic  law  in  the
    United Kingdom. He says so himself, she said it in a supporting letter,
    and several people who know the couple signed statements  to  the  same
    effect.  His  evidence  in  his  2019  witness  statement  is  entirely
    consistent with that.    What the evidence also indicates is  that  the
    Appellant understood the difference, as a  matter  of  law,  between  a
    nikah and a  'registered'  -  that  is  to  say  legally  recognised  -
    marriage.   In both the 2014 application and  the  2019  statement  the
    Appellant draws a distinction between the two. The strong inference  is
    that he understood that a  nikah  conducted  in  Bradford  between  two
    British nationals such as S and her first 'husband' was not, as far  as
    English law is concerned, a marriage at all. Thus when he said  at  his
    2018 interview that neither he nor she had been previously married,  he
    was both correct as a matter of law, and telling the truth.   That  the
    interviewing officer  plainly  understood  that  to  the  case  can  be
    inferred from the fact that the alleged 'discrepancy' was not then  put
    to him.  I am satisfied that in its  assessment  of  the  'suitability'
    refusal under  S-EC.2.2  the  Tribunal  has  failed  to  take  relevant
    evidence into account. I set its reasoning aside on that point.


12. As for the validity of the marriage, I am wholly satisfied  that  there
    was no reason to doubt it. The consistent  evidence  of  Appellant  and
    Sponsor, given over a  six  year  period  between  2014  and  2020  and
    encompassing the in-country application as well as this entry clearance
    one,  was that she had previously  undergone  a  nikah  in  the  United
    Kingdom, that marriage was never registered in accordance  with  United
    Kingdom law, and her ex-partner, now in  Pakistan,  had  "divorced  her
    Islamically".  It is of course the case that a bare nikah undertaken in
    the United Kingdom is not, without more, a legally valid marriage.  For
    that reason the dissolution of that marriage  was  not  something  that
    should have concerned the Tribunal. Under the operative Islamic law the
    S would have simply been divorced by oral talaq.   That S was  in  fact
    considered "divorced Islamically" was nevertheless  manifestly  evident
    from the fact that her friends and family recognised her as  such,  and
    that the authorities in Pakistan were so satisfied when her  -  legally
    binding - nikah was contracted and registered in Pakistan in 2015.    I
    am satisfied that there was no evidential basis upon which to doubt the
    validity of the Appellant's marriage at  all.   I  set  the  Tribunal's
    reasoning on that matter aside.




    Genuine and Subsisting?


13. That leaves the question of whether this is a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage. The First-tier Tribunal decision identifies  several  reasons
    for concluding that this marriage was not genuine or subsisting. All of
    them are concerned with the  quality  and  consistency  of  information
    provided at different times.   The  written  grounds  alleged  that  in
    reaching that conclusion the  Tribunal  has  failed  to  weigh  in  the
    balance the evidence of S that she  is  suffering  from  mental  health
    problems which impede her ability to recall and narrate events clearly.
     She finds it difficult to remember things  and  gets  flustered  under
    pressure.  The Respondent resisted that ground of appeal on  the  basis
    that most of the  alleged  discrepancies  arise  from  the  Appellant's
    evidence,  not  hers.  As  I  mention  above,  before  me   Mr   Janjua
    considerable widened the  scope  of  his  challenge.  He  did  so  upon
    confirmation from myself that the file contains  no  'Appendix  2',  of
    which more below, and that the application  form  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle simply does not say what it is recorded  as  saying  in  in  the
    decision.


14. The first 'discrepancy' identified by both  Respondent  and  First-tier
    Tribunal was about when the couple first met.  The  Respondent  asserts
    that the application for entry clearance,  made  on  the  15th  January
    2018, was supported by a statement at  'Appendix  2'  saying  that  the
    Appellant first met his wife on the 5th May  2015  in  Pakistan.   Both
    refusal  letter  and  First-tier  Tribunal   decision   contrast   that
    unfavourably  with  Home  Office  records  demonstrating  that  he  was
    apprehended at her house in Bradford in 2014.

15. As I note above, 'Appendix 2' does  not  feature  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle. I have carefully reviewed the file that was before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  As far as I can see no such  statement  has  ever  been
    produced, and the application form itself says nothing about  when  the
    couple met. In fact it is clear from the transcript  of  the  interview
    conducted with the Appellant on the 2nd October 2018 that  it  was  his
    evidence that he had met  his  wife  long  before  May  2015.  At  that
    interview he is asked [Q7] when and how he first got to  know  her.  He
    says that he met her at Bradford College of Management in 2012 and that
    they chatted and went for dinner.  At no point  does  the  interviewing
    officer challenge that evidence, or put to the Appellant that 'Appendix
    2' indicated anything different.  It seems to me that  the  Appellant's
    spontaneous disclosure at interview that they met in 2012  is  entirely
    consistent with  the  Home  Office  records  which  show  that  he  was
    encountered at the Sponsor's address on the 27th October  2014  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred as a  matter
    of fact  when  it  notes  at  its  �3  "the  appellant  stated  in  his
    application that he first met his sponsor in person in  Pakistan  on  5
    May 2015'.  The application form says no such thing.


16. The second discrepancy identified was concerned with whether or not the
    couple are related outside of marriage.   In the  interviews  conducted
    on the 2nd October 2018 he said that they  were  "far  relatives";  she
    said that they were "not related". This is contrasted with the evidence
    "in the application" that they were first cousins.  Again, I am  unable
    to find any reference in the application form to the  evidence  alleged
    to be in it. Nowhere on the file is there a document  in  which  it  is
    said that the Appellant and S are first cousins. If it was said in  the
    mysterious 'Appendix 2' that document was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. What the Tribunal has done  is  adopt  an  assertion  in  the
    refusal letter as if it were fact.   It is  true  that  there  is  some
    difference between the answers the couple gave  when  interviewed:  the
    Appellant said that they were "far" relatives and it was her view  that
    they were not related at all. In the context of two families  who  come
    from the same area in Mirpur this is  hardly  likely  to  be  material:
    statistically speaking it is highly likely  that  the  Appellant  is  a
    "far" relative to many, if not all, the people in his home village.

17. The third discrepancy is alleged to have arisen in respect of events in
    August 2014. During the interviews both Appellant and Sponsor described
    the ceremony that they underwent in the United Kingdom at that time  as
    an "engagement ceremony".   However  in  his  in-country  October  2014
    application for leave to remain the Appellant had said that this was an
    Islamic marriage, a claim in fact supported  by  the  submission  of  a
    nikahnama.   Although it is unclear what weight the  Tribunal  attached
    to this matter, I am satisfied that there is absolutely no  discrepancy
    arising. It is commonly the cultural practice of Mirpuris  to  treat  a
    nikah, absent the rukhsati or bharat, as an engagement: until the party
    is over and the bride joins the groom's family, social convention would
    hold that the wedding had not yet occurred, notwithstanding that in the
    eyes of God the contract had been signed.

18. The fourth matter of concern for the Tribunal was this:  "it  does  not
    appear that they know each  other's  hobbies  very  well  as  different
    answers were given at  interview".    I  am  not  satisfied  that  this
    reflects a fair, or complete reading of the evidence.  When  asked  his
    wife's hobbies the Appellant says [at Q23] that she likes going to  the
    gym and watching Indian movies. She does not mention Indian  movies  at
    her interview, but she does confirm [at her Q21] that she  likes  going
    to the gym.   He identifies his own hobbies as being cricket and horror
    novels: she says he likes cricket and watching horror  films.  It  does
    not  seem  to  me  fair  to  describe  these  answers  as  "different",
    particularly where no weight at all is given  to  the  many  consistent
    answers provided by the couple.

19. Removing these pillars from the edifice of the reasoning there is  very
    little holding the decision of the First-tier Tribunal upright.  It  is
    true that in October 2018 the Appellant said that he met  his  wife  in
    2012, and she thought it  was  2013.  The  decision  records  S's  oral
    evidence that she was unable to say what course her husband  originally
    came to the United Kingdom to study - ie the course  he  signed  up  to
    before they had ever met.  I  have  already  addressed  the  matter  of
    whether she had been 'married' before above. The one  matter  that  did
    weigh against the Appellant was that in  2014  immigration  enforcement
    officers caught the Appellant at his wife's house in Bradford. He tried
    to lie about who he was and why he was there, before admitting his true
    identity. That does him no credit and  the  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
    weigh  that  matter  in  the  balance  when  considering  his   overall
    credibility as an applicant. It is however  difficult  to  see  how  it
    undermines his claim that this is a genuine marriage.

20. I am satisfied that in its assessment of whether  this  was  a  genuine
    relationship the First-tier Tribunal has erred in  making  mistakes  of
    fact (about what the evidence actually said) and further in failing  to
    take material evidence into account: I return to this below  but  there
    was  copious  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  indicating  'intervening
    devotion' between these two; she has been  to  Pakistan  to  visit  her
    husband on several occasions. Their assertions were supported by family
    and friends. The discrepancies, as I set out above, were a mirage.    I
    am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in its approach to  the
    question of 'eligibility' and I set its reasoning aside.




    The Decision Re-Made

21.  The unchallenged findings are these:


               . The Appellant was in the United Kingdom in 2012 studying at
                 Bradford College
               . The Sponsor was a student at the same college at the time


               . He was apprehended at her property in  the  United  Kingdom
                 2014

               . The couple underwent a nikah in August 2014 in  the  United
                 Kingdom and after the  Appellant's  return  to  Pakistan  S
                 travelled there to have their 'wedding' ie the rukhsati

22. To these skeletal facts I add the following evidence  weighing  in  the
    Appellant's favour:


               . The consistent evidence of both Appellant and Sponsor  that
                 they are in a genuine relationship and intend to live  with
                 one another permanently in the United Kingdom


               . The evidence of  8  other  witnesses,  submitted  with  the
                 application in 2014, to support that claim

               . The fact that when separately interviewed the  couple  gave
                 consistent answers  about  where  and  how  they  met,  who
                 attended their traditional wedding in Pakistan,  how  often
                 she has visited him since, how they maintain  contact,  and
                 their respective interests and hobbies

               . Photographs of the event in Pakistan showing the Sponsor in
                 customarily elaborate dress and make up, a large cake etc

               . Numerous photographs of the couple together

               .  Aeroplane  tickets  evidencing  the  Sponsor's  trips   to
                 Pakistan

               . Western Union money transfers showing money sent from S  to
                 the Appellant

               . Numerous  -  possibly  hundreds  -  of  'whatsapp'  instant
                 messages, calls and images. I note that  the  Appellant  is
                 identified on the Sponsor's phone as "Baby xx"

               . Mobile telephone bills showing numerous - possibly hundreds
                 - of calls made between the two



23. All of that evidence supports the contention that this is a genuine and
    subsisting relationship. Against it I weigh the matters  identified  at
    my �19 above. The Appellant overstayed his visa in the  United  Kingdom
    and when caught at her  house  by  immigration  officials  in  2014  he
    panicked and lied  before  revealing  his  true  identity.   That  goes
    generally to his credibility, and  to  his  willingness  to  circumvent
    immigration control: I therefore  weigh  that  matter  in  the  balance
    against him, but noting as I do that the ECO evidently did not consider
    those matters significant enough to warrant  refusal  on  'suitability'
    grounds - that is an assessment with which  I  respectfully  agree.   I
    attach only very little weight to the fact that one said that they  had
    met in 2012 and the other 2013:  no-one  can  be  expected  to  have  a
    perfect chronological memory of dates  and  events  that  long  ago.  I
    attach no weight at all to the  fact  that  she  could  not,  in  2018,
    identify the name of the course that her husband signed up to  when  he
    applied for entry clearance as a student in 2010.


24. Having taken all of  the  evidence  into  account  I  am  in  no  doubt
    whatsoever that this is a genuine and subsisting marriage. I  say  that
    conscious that I have  found  the  burden  discharged  way  beyond  the
    applicable standard of a 'balance of probabilities'. I say that because
    all of evidence all points one way.


25. Given what I have said above I do  not  think  I  need  to  add  to  my
    findings on validity and the allegation of false  information:  neither
    ground for refusal was properly founded in the evidence. I  do  however
    note that I now have before me confirmation from the  General  Register
    Office that S has not, between 2006 and 2020, registered  any  marriage
    in the United Kingdom.    Thus  any  doubts  that  might  linger  about
    whether this Muslim woman was legally married when she decided to marry
    someone else can be dispelled.


      Decision

26. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.


27. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on human rights grounds.

28. I would add that it has been almost three  years  since  the  Appellant
    made his application for entry clearance to  join  his  wife.   In  the
    circumstances the Respondent will no  doubt  wish  to  prioritise  this
    matter and grant entry clearance without further delay.

29. There is an order for anonymity.
