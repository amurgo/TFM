                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge J Bartlett ("the judge"),  promulgated  on
    16 April 2020, in which she allowed Ms  Palacio's  appeal  against  the
    refusal of a human rights claim made by way of an application for entry
    clearance as the partner of a person present and settled in the  United
    Kingdom.



The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. The appeal against the refusal of human rights claim  was  heard  on  6
    March 2020 with Mr Tester appearing on behalf of  Ms  Palacio  and  the
    Entry Clearance Officer being represented by counsel.

 3. At the end of the hearing the judge  proceeded  to  give  an  extempore
    judgment. The single substantive paragraph of  her  decision  reads  as
    follows:

           "1.  For the reasons given at the oral hearing which took  place
           on 6 March 2020 the  appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  on  human
           rights grounds."

 4. The decision was sent out to the parties under cover of an IA60  notice
    which informed them of the right to make an application for  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal within specified time limits.



The Entry Clearance Officer's challenge

 5. Whilst appearing under the rubric of a failure to provide reasons,  the
    real thrust of the grounds of appeal is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    acted with procedural unfairness by failing to notify the  parties  (in
    particular the losing party) of  the  right  to  apply  for  a  written
    statement of reasons where none had been set out  in  the  decision  to
    allow Ms Palacio's appeal.

 6. Permission to appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  but
    granted on renewal.



The legal context

 7. Rule 29 of the Tribunal Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 (2014/2604) has received little, if any,
    judicial attention.  It provides as follows:

           "Decisions and notice of decisions

           29.-(1) The Tribunal may give a decision orally at a hearing.

           (2) Subject to rule 13(2) (withholding information likely to
           cause serious harm), the Tribunal must provide to each party as
           soon as reasonably practicable after making a decision (other
           than a decision under Part 4) which disposes of the proceedings-

           (a) a notice of decision stating the Tribunal's decision; and

           (b) notification of any right of appeal against the decision and
           the time within which, and the manner in which, such right of
           appeal may be exercised.

           (3) Where the decision of the Tribunal relates to-

           (a) an asylum claim or a humanitarian protection claim, the
           Tribunal must provide, with the notice of decision in paragraph
           (2)(a), written reasons for its decision;

           (b) any other matter, the Tribunal may provide written reasons
           for its decision but, if it does not do so, must notify the
           parties of the right to apply for a written statement of
           reasons.

           (4) Unless the Tribunal has already provided a written statement
           of reasons, a party may make a written application to the
           Tribunal for such statement following a decision which disposes
           of the proceedings.

           (5) An application under paragraph (4) must be received within
           28 days of the date on which the Tribunal sent or otherwise
           provided to the party a notice of decision relating to the
           decision which disposes of the proceedings.

           (6) If a party makes an application in accordance with
           paragraphs (4) and (5) the Tribunal must, subject to rule 13(2)
           (withholding a document or information likely to cause serious
           harm), send a written statement of reasons to each party as soon
           as reasonably practicable."

 8. It can be seen that rule 29(1) allows for  extempore  judgments  to  be
    given in an appeal.  Where the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  relates
    to an asylum or humanitarian protection claim, rule  29(3)(a)  provides
    that written reasons "must" accompany the decision.

 9. Rule 29(3)(b) provides that where the decision relates  to  "any  other
    matter" (which must presumably include a human rights  claim  based  on
    Article 8 ECHR), the provision of  written  reasons  at  the  time  the
    decision is promulgated is not mandated.  However, if no  such  reasons
    are provided with the decision, the First-tier Tribunal  "must"  notify
    the parties of the right to apply for  a  written  statement  of  those
    reasons.  Such notification informs  a  party  that  they  may  make  a
    written application under rule  29(4)  within  the  28-day  time  limit
    stipulated in rule 29(5).

10. The precise method by which the required notification  is  provided  to
    the parties in compliance with rule 29(3)(b) is ultimately a matter for
    the First-tier Tribunal.  As a matter  of  general  good  practice,  we
    offer the following guidance.

11. The wording of rule 29(3)(b) does not expressly require notification to
    be in writing and it is therefore permissible that it be  given  orally
    at a  hearing.   Whilst  this  is  so,  it  may,  if  unaccompanied  by
    confirmation in writing and depending on the circumstances of any given
    case, prove inadequate in achieving the aim of  ensuring  accessibility
    to the procedural steps required to be undertaken by a party  prior  to
    making an application for permission  to  appeal.   The  facts  of  the
    present case do not in one sense  provide  the  best  example  of  this
    potential problem.  It was the Entry  Clearance  Officer  who  was  the
    losing party and had  the  primary  interest  in  obtaining  a  written
    statement of reasons.  She should have been aware of  the  requirements
    of the Rules and it may be thought that she ought to have contacted the
    First-tier Tribunal immediately upon receiving its decision in order to
    highlight the absence of notification under rule  29(3)(b)  instead  of
    lodging an application for permission to appeal.  We are bound  to  say
    that we find it somewhat troubling that the Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    skeleton argument places the author of the grounds of appeal within the
    category of persons in respect of whom it "cannot  be  fairly  assumed"
    will know the Rules.

12. The  greater  risk  of  procedural  unfairness  arises  in  respect  of
    unrepresented appellants.  It is by no means implausible to conceive of
    a judge notifying the parties at a hearing of the right to apply for  a
    written statement of reasons, but this not being fully comprehended  by
    an  appellant  who  may,  for  example,  feel  inhibited   in   seeking
    clarification at the time.

13. The better means of providing notification under rule  29(3)(b)  is  by
    committing it to writing within the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    itself, or at least within the IA60 notice accompanying  that  decision
    when it is sent out to the parties.   Ideally,  notification  would  be
    included in both.  It follows from what we have said, above,  that  the
    requisite notification should be in language  that  is  both  compliant
    with the rule and clear for non-lawyers to understand.



Decision on error of law

14. In the present case, the judge's decision related  to  a  human  rights
    claim based entirely on Article 8.  She was therefore entitled to  give
    an extempore judgment and was not obliged to  provide  written  reasons
    with her decision.

15. On the information before us, we cannot be sufficiently confident  that
    notification of the parties' right to apply for a written statement  of
    reasons was given at the hearing  itself.   Mr  Tester  was  unable  to
    recall if this had occurred (in respect of which we attach no criticism
    whatsoever) and we were informed that counsel's  note  of  the  hearing
    made no reference to this issue.

16. We conclude that the failure to comply with the  mandatory  requirement
    to notify the parties of their right to  make  an  application  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a written statement  of  reasons,  pursuant  to
    rule 29(3)(b) of  the  Rules,  constitutes  a  procedural  irregularity
    amounting to unfairness.  The fact that  this  does  not  rise  from  a
    matter expressly stated in the judge's decision itself does not deprive
    the Entry Clearance Officer of the ability to mount the  challenge,  or
    of the Upper Tribunal to find an error of law.  Section  11(1)  of  the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provides that the  right  of
    appeal is on "any point of law arising from  a  decision  made  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal".   Plainly,  the  failure  to  comply  with  rule
    29(3)(b) of the Rules is an error on a point of law "arising" from  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision.




17. In all the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to exercise our  power
    under section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007 and set the judge's decision aside.




Disposal

18. Initially, we had contemplated remitting this appeal to the  First-tier
    Tribunal with a direction  that  it  would  then  either  be  for  that
    Tribunal to formally notify the parties  of  their  right  to  make  an
    application for a written statement of reasons, or for  Judge  Bartlett
    simply to provide such a statement.

19. However, having considered all relevant materials, Ms Cunha, rightly in
    our view, suggested that  we  should  instead  go  on  and  remake  the
    decision in this case.  Indeed, she went further and conceded  that  Ms
    Palacio's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal  of  her
    human rights claim should be allowed.

20. We entirely agree with  that  fair  and  appropriate  concession.   The
    grounds for refusing the human rights claim were twofold: first, it was
    said that the sponsor was still married and would not therefore be free
    to marry Ms Palacio if she came to the United Kingdom; second,  it  was
    not accepted that the couple's relationship was genuine.

21. In respect of Mr Tester's freedom to marry Ms Palacio were she to  come
    to this country, we are satisfied that the  decree  absolute,  dated  2
    September 2019, was provided in  advance  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing and is in evidence before us.  This addresses the first  ground
    of refusal.

22. The question of whether the couple's relationship was  genuine  was  in
    fact conceded by an Entry Clearance Manager in a review of the original
    refusal, dated 14 November 2019.  Mr Tester informed  us  that  neither
    he, counsel, or the judge had been provided with  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's bundle (a problem that is, unfortunately,  not  rare  enough)
    and it may  well  be  that  everyone  was  unaware  of  this  important
    concession.  In any event, it plainly deals with the second  ground  of
    refusal.

23. It follows that Ms  Palacio  meets  all  of  the  requirements  of  the
    relevant Immigration Rules and that in light of this  her  appeal  does
    indeed fall to be allowed on Article 8 grounds.




Anonymity


24. There is no good reason to make an anonymity direction in this case and
    we do not do so.


Notice of Decision

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


26. We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

27. We re-make the decision by allowing Ms  Palacio's  appeal  against  the
    refusal of her human rights claim.
