                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwyncz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss A Soloman, Legal Representative


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against the decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cox)  to  allow  the  appeal  against  her
   decision to refuse the respondent's  application  for  leave  to  remain,
   outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of his private and family life
   in the United Kingdom.


2. It will be convenient to refer to the parties according to  their  status
   in the First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer  to  Mr  Akinsany  as
   'the appellant' and to the Secretary of State as 'the respondent'.


The decision of the First-tier Tribunal


3. Before turning to consider the grounds of appeal in detail, it  is  first
   necessary to provide an overview of the Tribunal's determination  of  the
   appeal. The Tribunal began by considering whether the appellant  met  the
   requirements, under paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, for  leave
   to remain on the  basis  of  his  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom
   [paragraphs 27 to 36]. Having done so, it concluded  that  the  appellant
   was unable to meet the alternative requirements of  at  least  20  years'
   continuous residence in the United Kingdom or  lack  of  ties  (including
   social,  cultural  and  family  ties)  to  Nigeria.  The  Tribunal   then
   considered the matter outside the Immigration Rules. Before doing so,  it
   reminded itself of precisely the same passage  in  the  determination  of
   Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 that
   is quoted by the respondent in the grounds of appeal:


    ... after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may  be
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is  it
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them


   The Tribunal thereafter proceeded to consider a number of  factors  which
   it considered relevant to the proportionality of the appellant's  removal
   for the purposes of its assessment under Article 8 of the  1950  European
   Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental  Freedoms.
   These factors included the appellant's "particularly  close  relationship
   with his mother" with whom he had lived for most of his  life  [paragraph
   42], his membership of "a  close-knit  family"  upon  whom  he  was  both
   economically and emotionally dependant [paragraph 43],  and  his  private
   life in the UK "through his association with the  local  church  and  his
   charity work" [paragraph 44]. The Tribunal reminded itself of  a  passage
   in the judgement of Patel and others, in which it was said that  sympathy
   for graduates who have been studying in the UK for some  time  cannot  by
   itself provide a ground of appeal under Article  8  [paragraph  52].  The
   Tribunal distinguished the facts of that case on  the  basis  of  factors
   that it considered relevant to  this  appeal,  which  I  have  previously
   summarised [paragraph 52]. It  thereafter  concluded  that  it  would  be
   impossible for the appellant to "replicate" the private and  family  life
   he had in the United Kingdom in Nigeria.  This  was  notwithstanding  the
   availability of "modern forms of communication" for  maintaining  contact
   with family members in the United Kingdom [paragraphs 53 and 54].


The rival arguments


4. At the hearing before me, Mr Diwnyncz said that he wished simply to  rely
   upon the written grounds of appeal. These may be summarised  as  follows.
   Firstly, it is said that the Tribunal 'misinterpreted' and/or 'failed  to
   adopt' and/or 'misapplied' the guidance given in Gulshan (Article 8 - new
   Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640.  Secondly,  even  if  the
   Tribunal  could  be  said  to  have  adopted  the  correct  approach,  it
   nonetheless took account of factors that were "fundamentally normal"  and
   which did not therefore "amount to  compelling  circumstances".  Thirdly,
   whilst the Tribunal had referred to the 'close bond' that  the  appellant
   enjoys with his  family  members  in  the  United  Kingdom,  it  had  not
   established how this bond amounted to more than  normal  emotional  ties,
   "beyond giving limited reference to  emotional  and  financial  support".
   Fourthly, the respondent contends that both the financial  and  emotional
   support afforded to the appellant by his family  members  in  the  United
   Kingdom  can  continue  from  Nigeria,  whilst   he   is   simultaneously
   strengthening his familial ties to relatives in Nigeria. Fifthly,  it  is
   said that the Tribunal misunderstood the judgement in Patel and others  v
   SSHD [2013] UKSC 72, as explained in Nasim and other (Article 8) Pakistan
   [2014] UKUT 00025.


5. In summary, Mrs Soloman submitted that the Tribunal had  directed  itself
   appropriately and reached conclusions that were reasonably open to it  on
   the evidence.


Legal analysis


6. There is no doubt  that  the  Tribunal  formally  adopted  the  two-stage
   approach to the Article 8 assessment that was posited by the Tribunal  in
   Gulshan.   The  respondent's  criticism  is  founded  entirely  upon  the
   Tribunal's consideration of the  appeal  at  the  second  stage  of  that
   analysis.  Thus, the charge that  the  Tribunal  'misinterpreted'  and/or
   'failed to  adopt'  and/or  'misapplied'  the  guidance  in  Gulshan   is
   ultimately dependent  upon  what  is  meant  by  the  phrase  "compelling
   circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  [the   Rules]";   in
   particular, the words "compelling" and "sufficiently".


7. It is important to note that the  phrase  "compelling  circumstances"  is
   not a term of art. There is thus bound to be an element  of  subjectivity
   in the assessment  of  those  circumstances  that  may  be  appropriately
   characterised  as  "compelling",  as  opposed  to  those  which  may   be
   considered (to use the respondent's phrase in this appeal) "fundamentally
   normal".


8.  The  test  in  Gushan  also  contemplates  the  possibility   that   the
   circumstances in question may have received a degree of recognition under
   the Rules, but that the recognition in question may be 'insufficient'.


9. However, whatever the precise  meaning  of  the  test  for  consideration
   outside the Rules may be, Gulshan undoubtedly serves to remind judges  of
   the considerable weight that the new Rules attach to the public interest,
   and also that appeals ought not  to  be  routinely  allowed  outside  the
   Immigration Rules on the basis that  the  appellant's  removal  would  be
   incompatible with Article 8 of  the  1950  European  Convention  for  the
   Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This  was  expressly
   recognised  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at   paragraph   39   of   its
   determination:


    However, in my view, the Tribunal in Gulshan, is not suggesting that  I
    do not consider an article 8 appeal, but is instead reminding judges of
    the weight to be attached to the rules, when assessing  proportionality
    and that many human rights appeal  can  probably  be  considered  on  a
    cursory basis".


10. I therefore conclude that a given set of circumstances may in  principle
   lead to differing but equally reasonable views as  to  whether  they  are
   'compelling', or 'insufficiently recognised by the new Rules'. It is thus
   unhelpful  to  characterise  a  particular  set   of   circumstances   as
   "fundamentally  normal"  because  that  judgement  will   be   ultimately
   dependent upon a subjective view of 'normality'.


Conclusion


11. I remind myself that what   I  have  to  consider,  at  this  stage,  is
   whether the Tribunal made an error of law  in  finding  that  there  were
   compelling  circumstances  in  this  appeal  that   were   insufficiently
   recognised under the new Rules. I consider that I  am  only  entitled  to
   conclude that it did  so  if  its  decision  fell  outside  the  band  of
   reasonable conclusions that were open to the Tribunal on the facts as  it
   found them. It follows from this that I am not entitled to find  that  it
   made an error of law merely  because  I  may  have  reached  a  different
   conclusion upon those facts.


12. I note that the Tribunal  specifically  found  that  the  appellant  was
   financially dependent upon family members  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
   Tribunal did not, as is suggested  by  the  grounds  of  appeal,  make  a
   "limited reference" to that dependency. On the contrary,  it  stated,  at
   paragraph 16, that the appellant's mother gave him between �200 and  �300
   a month, that his brother gave him a further �100 a month, and  that  his
   sister "will also help him out when he needs it".  Questions  of  whether
   that dependency was one of choice or of necessity, and whether (in either
   event) it  could  be  maintained  following  the  appellant's  return  to
   Nigeria, would in my view only arise for consideration if  I  was  called
   upon to remake the decision following a finding that  there  had  been  a
   material error of law. In other words, they cannot inform my decision  as
   to whether there was such an error in the first place.  In  short,  these
   are arguments that either were or should have been made  at  the  hearing
   before the First-tier Tribunal. Finally,  I  note  that  the  grounds  of
   appeal do not specify in what manner the  Tribunal  is  alleged  to  have
   "misunderstood" the judgements in Patel and Nasim, but  it  seems  to  me
   that its reference to a passage in the judgement of the  former  decision
   was intended simply to  emphasise  the  fact  that  it  had  not  allowed
   considerations of sympathy for the appellant to cloud  its  judgement  in
   the overall assessment of the appellant's private and family life.


13. Looking at the matter  overall,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal's
   conclusion that there were  compelling circumstances in this appeal  that
   were insufficiently recognised under the Immigration  Rules  is  not  one
   that falls beyond the range of reasonable conclusions that was open to it
   upon the facts as it found them. Thus, whilst  that  conclusion  may  not
   have been one that I would have reached, I am nevertheless satisfied that
   the Tribunal  did  not  make  an  error  of  law  in  deciding  that  the
   appellant's removal would be incompatible with his right to  respect  for
   private and family life under Article 8 of the 1950  European  Convention
   for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

14. The appeal is dismissed.
