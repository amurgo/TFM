                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of Judge Broe sitting in  the
    First-tier Tribunal dated 12 August of this year.  The judge  dismissed
    appeals from the appellants, who are a mother and  daughter  in  China.
    The first appellant, who is 31 years old, applied for  entry  clearance
    as a wife of the sponsor, Mr Deng, who is here today.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the  application  in  October  last
    year  because  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  would  be
    maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds.   In  the
    application form the first appellant said that she and her daughter had
    never left China before.   Her  husband  was  a  British  citizen.   It
    appears, we say by way of digression, that apparently he had been given
    indefinite leave to remain under  the  so-called  legacy  policy.   The
    application form said that the two of them, a mother and daughter, were
    sent money by the sponsor husband of about �400  a  month.   Apparently
    the first appellant does not work.  In Appendix 1 of  the  application,
    the first appellant said that the sponsor  worked  as  a  self-employed
    decorator earning about �2,000  a  month.   He  had  savings  of  about
    �3,400.  She had savings of approximately �9,000.  She  said  that  the
    sponsor lived with his sister and a husband in a rented house which had
    four bedrooms.  The application form also said  that  the  sponsor  had
    been  a  self-employed  decorator  since  1  September  2011,  and  his
    preceding seven months' income was some �14,282.

 3. As we have said the Entry Clearance Officer refused  the  applications.
    The Entry  Clearance  Office  said  that  he  was  satisfied  that  the
    appellants  met  the  suitability  requirements  and  that  the   first
    appellant was eligible for entry clearance as a partner.  He  was  also
    satisfied that she met the English language requirement.   However,  he
    refused the applications under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM  of
    the Rules.  Under the Rules the appellant had to show that the  sponsor
    had a gross income  of  �22,400,  and  the  evidence  provided  by  the
    appellant showed that his income was less than that, �16,782 per annum.
     As he was self-employed the appellant was required to submit  evidence
    of tax paid and payable, an annual self-assessment and a  statement  of
    account together with proof of registration as self-employed  with  Her
    Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  She had not done that.   There  was  no
    evidence of the sponsor's previous salaried employment.  Her solicitors
    had said that his P60 had been lost.  There was no  evidence  that  the
    sponsor was paying class 2 national insurance contributions.  There was
    no evidence to show that the funds in the sponsor's account  came  from
    his self-employed earnings.

 4. Subsequent to that the appellant  gave  a  notice  of  appeal  in  late
    October last year.  The lawyers acting on her behalf and on  behalf  of
    her daughter said that she had provided a  letter  from  Her  Majesty's
    Revenue and Customs bearing the sponsor's registration number, and  his
    income from self-employment "should  be  about  �22,480".   There  were
    certain documents  provided  including  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's
    accountants, his online tax return for 2011 to 2012, a letter from  the
    tax authorities, a notice of national  insurance  contributions  and  a
    self-assessment statement dated 2 December 2012.

 5. Before the judge, it was said that the sponsor had never  had  recourse
    to public funds.  He was employed  as  a  painter  and  decorator.   He
    produced a copy of a land registry document before the  Tribunal  which
    showed that he and another person had acquired a lease upon a  flat  in
    London in May of this year at a cost of �130,000.  He said that friends
    had provided financial help when he bought his house about  two  months
    ago.  Before then he had  rented  accommodation  costing  some  �600  a
    month.  His evidence was that in October he was earning "not that much,
    about �500 per week".

 6. The judge first  considered  what  version  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    applied.  The first application was made before the Rules had  changed.
    The judge said that he was satisfied that  the  first  application  was
    rejected because the wrong forms had been used.  If that  was  not  the
    case, then the appellants would have had  no  need  to  submit  further
    forms.  Therefore the judge concluded that the new Rules, which came in
    after the first application, applied.

 7. The judge then went on to consider the  evidence  in  relation  to  the
    sponsor's income.  He noted that the letter the  accountants  had  sent
    said that his total income from self-employment from 1  September  2011
    to 5 April 2012 was �14,282.  That was the figure in  the  tax  return,
    where there was also a reference  to  the  income  from  employment  of
    �2,500, said to be income  from  his  employment  with  Sky  Decoration
    Limited.  There was no documentary evidence, the judge noted,  of  this
    employment.  The judge then said that the total income for the tax year
    2011 to 2012 was therefore �16,782.  The sponsor had provided  a  self-
    assessment statement showing a tax payment of some �2,500.   The  judge
    said this at paragraph 31:

         "There is a paucity of evidence  generally  in  this  case  and  no
         further evidence of the sponsor's business or income.  There is  no
         evidence of his income from April 2012 to the date of the  decision
         or thereafter.  I find this surprising, because that financial year
         ended almost  four  months  ago.   He  should  have  been  able  to
         demonstrate his income  for  that  period  with  accounts  and  tax
         returns but has not chosen to do so.   The  savings  to  which  the
         appellant refers are insufficient to meet the requirements set  out
         above.  The only evidence of his income therefore shows  it  to  be
         �16,782 per annum.  These appeals cannot  therefore  succeed  under
         the Rules."

 8. The judge then referred to Article 8.  Taking as a guide the well-known
    case of Razgar, the judge said that  the  first  question  was  whether
    there was an interference with the appellant's rights.  He  said  there
    was no dispute about the marriage and he was satisfied that family life
    existed.   He  therefore  accepted,  as  well,  that  there  had   been
    communication between the sponsor and the appellants.   He  noted  that
    the sponsor was in this country and the appellants in China,  but  that
    was the life that they had chosen, and he was not  persuaded  that  the
    decisions amounted to an interference with the right to enjoy  it.   He
    then went on and said that if he were  wrong  in  that,  he  found  the
    decisions to be lawful and for  a  legitimate  purpose.   He  therefore
    concluded that the interference was proportionate.

 9. The Rules in this case are contained in Annex  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules at E-ECP3.2 and the  evidential  requirements  are  contained  in
    Appendix FM-SE, in particular at paragraph 7.   The  notice  of  appeal
    first of all contended that the judge was in error in  being  satisfied
    that the wrong forms had been used.  No reasons had been  given  as  to
    why the Tribunal had come to that conclusion.  In our view that  ground
    goes nowhere because the judge gave a very good reason as to why he had
    come to that conclusion, namely if the right forms had been used  there
    was no reason for the Entry Clearance Officer to demand submission of a
    new application.

10. The grounds then address the issue of the financial requirements.   The
    submission in the reasons for  appealing  invoke  the  decision  of  MM
    [2013] EWHC 1900.  Those grounds are further advanced in  the  skeleton
    argument which Mr Mandred Adolphi, who was not able to appear  for  the
    appellants this afternoon because of another  commitment.   Essentially
    the submission is that the Tribunal had found that the sponsor's  total
    income was �16,782, and that the tax had been paid on that.  It  cannot
    therefore have been correct for the judge  to  say  that  there  was  a
    paucity of evidence.  The decision ran contrary to the  weight  of  the
    evidence.

11. The grounds mention that  the  sponsor  had  just  received  an  annual
    account which had been completed recently by his accountant  and  there
    were a letter and tax payments in relation to that.  We note that  that
    is information which came after the decision and  therefore  cannot  be
    taken into account.  The grounds also mention that the judge failed  to
    consider that the sponsor had purchased the new home.  We again comment
    that that is irrelevant under the Rules.

12. Turning to the MM point, the submission made in both the grounds and in
    Mr Adolphi's skeleton argument is that this sponsor had a total  income
    of �16,782, had paid taxes on  that  and  that  amount  was  above  the
    minimum income level for an adult on a 40 hour week.  The view that  Mr
    Justice Blake had adopted,  especially  at  paragraph  124  of  the  MM
    judgment, was that there should be a focus on the �13,400  level  which
    had  been  identified  as  the  lowest  maintenance  threshold  by  the
    Immigration Advisory Committee, close to the adult minimum wage  for  a
    40 hour week.

13.  Mr Adolphi in the skeleton argument submits that  the  sponsor  was  a
    British citizen making an application which, as Mr Adolphi puts it, was
    the exercise of a right which was guaranteed  by  law,  and  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer  must  justify  the  grounds  that  render  exclusion
    lawful.  Moreover, there is reference to the provision in Section 55 of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 in  relation  to  the
    position of the second appellant;  In other words, the daughter.

14. In our view it  is  clear  that  this  appellant  falls  short  of  the
    Immigration Rules in relation to the points identified  by  Mr  Justice
    Blake at paragraph 124 of the judgment  in  MM.   The  appellant  falls
    short in a number of respects.  There is not the savings identified  at
    (ii).  There are no third party undertakings.  We note that the sponsor
    was given financial help by friends to buy the lease of the house.  The
    first appellant is not working in China, so there was no evidence about
    her earning capacity in this country.  We, like the judge, are troubled
    by the  evidence,  or  rather  the  paucity  of  evidence,  about  this
    sponsor's income.  There was the surprising assertion (recorded by  the
    judge at paragraph 15 of the judgment) that the  sponsor's  income  was
    over  �22,000  per  annum.   Nothing  in  the  papers  supports   that.
    Moreover, as the judge noted, there was no evidence produced before him
    as to the income for the period 2012 to 2013 (see paragraph 31  of  his
    judgment).  Before us today Mr Deng has asserted that he  has  provided
    evidence relating to his income for that year, which he asserts is some
    �25,000 and he has, he said, paid tax on that.  That of  course  cannot
    come into our consideration today because that  is  evidence  post  the
    decision by the judge.

15. We have concluded that if Article 8 does have a  separate  purchase  in
    this case, we cannot fault the balancing exercise  engaged  in  by  the
    judge.  In our view, it is important in that Article 8 assessment  that
    the income selected in the Rules reflects what the Secretary  of  State
    regards as a legitimate aim of preventing burdens on taxpayers  in  the
    long term, and  promoting  good  integration  of  immigrants  into  the
    community.

16. We of course must give considerable weight to the fact that the sponsor
    is  now  a  British  citizen.   In  terms  of  assessing  the   overall
    proportionality of the impact of the other features of  this  case,  we
    have come to the  conclusion  that  if  the  judge  had  addressed  the
    analysis  which  Mr  Justice  Blake  adopted  in  the  MM   case,   the
    proportionality balancing exercise  would  nonetheless  have  come  out
    against the interests of these appellants.

17. On that basis, we dismiss the appeals.
