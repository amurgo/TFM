                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 1st September 1988 is a  citizen  of  Bangladesh.
    The  Appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  Khan.   The  Respondent   was
    represented by Mr Wilding a Senior Presenting Officer.



Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom on a student visa  from
    3rd May 2011.  He had applied for an extension which was  dismissed  by
    the  Respondent  in  2013  but   remitted   to   the   Respondent   for
    reconsideration.  The Respondent then refused  that  application  on  a
    different basis on 25th October 2016.  The basis of that  decision  was
    that an English language certificate submitted by the Appellant in  his
    application in 2012 had been obtained by deception and his  appeal  had
    been refused  under  paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Appellant had appealed that decision and his appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Oliver  on  23rd  November  2017.   The  judge  had
    allowed the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Respondent had applied to appeal that  decision  on  15th  December
    2017.  Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup on 27th April 2018 on the basis it was arguable  the  judge  had
    misapplied the burden and standard  of  proof  and  failed  to  provide
    cogent reasons to accept the Appellant's innocent explanation said.  It
    is also arguable that relying upon the Appellant's language ability was
    questionable in the light of MA (Nigeria) [2016] UKUT 450.   Directions
    were issued for the matter to be decided firstly as to  whether  as  to
    whether an error of law had been made by the First-tier Tribunal in the
    case.  The matter came before me in accordance with those directions on
    10th July 2018 at Field House.

 4. The following submissions were made on behalf of  both  the  Respondent
    and the Appellant.  I found that a material error of law had been  made
    by the judge in this case for the reasons given in  the  decision  made
    following that hearing.  It was decided that the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal needed to be set aside  and  made  afresh  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The matter came before me in accordance with that history.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 5. I had before me  the  original  bundle  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent
    together with a supplementary bundle containing those documents  listed
    at Items 1 to 7 on the index sheet to the bundle.  I further had before
    me the Appellant's bundle containing those documents listed at pages  1
    to 33 on the bundle

       . Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167;

       . Kaur [2013] UKUT 00344;

       . MA [2016] UKUT 00450;

       . those documents contained within the appeal bundle.

The Proceedings - Evidence

 6. The Appellant was called to give evidence.  He identified his  name  on
    file.  He confirmed his date of birth as being 1st September  1988  and
    his address as  that  being  on  file.   He  referred  to  his  witness
    statement dated 21st November 2017  contained  within  the  Appellant's
    bundle and confirmed that as being true and correct and adopted that as
    his examination-in-chief.   He  said  that  he  did  not  know  why  an
    allegation had been made that he had taken the test by proxy as he  had
    taken the test himself.  He confirmed  that  he  had  booked  the  test
    himself and spoke to the administration office for booking of that test
    and following that booking had a receipt  from  the  centre.   He  then
    attended the centre.  He said that he could speak good English and  had
    taken an English test in his own country in 2010 and had taken  a  test
    prior to coming to the UK.  When he arrived in the UK he had  completed
    a course at level 5 in respect of a diploma in business management  and
    that had been completed in  2012  prior  to  taking  the  ETS  test  in
    question.  He said that was done at the London Guild Hall.

 7. In cross-examination he said that he had paid fees for the college  but
    did not have the receipt nor did he have any evidence of  enrolling  on
    the test.  Following the Home  Office  refusal  he  had  not  contacted
    Westlink College to get evidence that he had attended for the test.  In
    respect of taking the test he said that he had spoken to a lady on  the
    phone and she had asked if he would  pay  �188  cash  for  the  course.
    Since refusal in 2016 he had not contacted Westlink College and he  now
    believed the college was closed.  He contacted ETS and  they  had  told
    him they did not keep details for more than two years.  They  had  told
    him they did not have any records.

 8. I heard submissions on behalf of the Respondent  who  relied  upon  the
    refusal letter.  In respect of the  ETS  test  it  was  said  that  the
    evidential burden had been met.  It  was  submitted  there  were  three
    significant documents namely Operation Fa�ade Report showing  the  high
    percentage of invalid testing namely 75% test work found to be invalid.
     Secondly I was referred to the  ETS  printout  that  demonstrated  his
    tests were found to be invalid.  Finally the evidence of tests taken on
    the day that the Appellant did his tests were  contained  in  Annex  AA
    showing that 63%  of  tests  taken  were  invalid  and  the  rest  were
    questionable.   In  respect  of  any  innocent  explanation  from   the
    Appellant it was submitted there  was  nothing  in  his  evidence  that
    assisted him  in  that  respect.   It  was  further  said  it  was  not
    surprising that he might have known his way  to  the  college  as  that
    would not be inconsistent with a test taken by proxy.  It was submitted
    there was no documentary evidence in support of those matters  asserted
    by the Appellant.

 9. It was further submitted that the Appellant clearly had made  a  change
    of college such matter being referred to earlier.

Submissions on Behalf of the Appellant

10. It was  accepted  by  Mr  Khan  that  the  Respondent  had  passed  the
    evidential burden of proof but it was  submitted  had  not  passed  the
    legal burden.  It was noted that all colleges involved in  the  testing
    were private colleges and Operation Fa�ade had not  made  a  comparison
    with a public college.  It was submitted that  not  all  invalid  tests
    were necessarily done by proxy takers.  It was said  that  there  could
    have been a number of reasons for the invalidation of a result.  It was
    submitted the Appellant had been granted entry clearance in 2010  as  a
    result of English test taken and gained as to the same standard as  the
    test taken in 2012.  It was further said that the  Appellant  had  then
    studied in the English medium for a year before taking  the  ETS  test.
    It was said that the Appellant was of good character and never used  an
    interpreter in hearings before the IAC.

11. In respect of the change of colleges Judge  Elek  had  found  that  the
    Appellant had continued to study at Bedford College and  therefore  the
    Appellant had not breached his condition of leave.   It  was  submitted
    that that had been accepted by the Presenting Officer at  the  hearing.
    It was further said that Home Office  policy  allowed  him  to  take  a
    supplementary course at a different college and it was  said  that  the
    Appellant had not used college A as a vehicle.  The letter from Bedford
    College within the Appellant's bundle showed that the Appellant had not
    abandoned that course.  It was further noted at page 30 that the letter
    from Guildhall College noted that his course of study had started seven
    months after the start of the course at Bedford College  and  therefore
    the Appellant was not in breach of the conditions of his visa.

12. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

Decision and Reasons

13. In the case such as this where the Respondent essentially  is  alleging
    dishonesty or deception on the part of the Appellant the initial burden
    of  proof  lies  on  the  Respondent  to  demonstrate  that  they  have
    evidential proof to support their assertions.  If they are able to pass
    that evidential burden it is then a matter for the Appellant to provide
    an innocent explanation if he can as to the circumstances  and  finally
    therefore an examination  of  totality  of  the  evidence  to  consider
    whether the Respondent  fulfils  the  legal  burden  of  proving  their
    assertion that the Appellant has acted dishonestly.

14. The Appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom on 3rd May  2011  on  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student visa valid until 30th April 2012  to  study  a
    diploma in administrative management at Bedfordshire College.  Prior to
    the expiry of his leave he made a  further  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student to study  a  graduate  diploma  in
    business management and marketing at Swarthmore College.  The Appellant
    as he accepts at paragraph 14 of his witness statement was  aware  that
    prior to making his application for further leave to remain  and  prior
    to the expiry of his current leave to remain in  April  2012  he  would
    have to provide proof of knowledge of English by undertaking an English
    language test approved  by  the  Home  Office  as  being  part  of  his
    application for further leave to remain.  It is in those  circumstances
    that the Appellant took a language test  at  Westlink  College  knowing
    that passing an English language test at the appropriate level  was  an
    essential part of the application he intended to make for further leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom.  It  is  accepted  evidence  that  the
    Appellant took one test on 20th  March  2012  which  consisted  of  the
    speaking and writing test.  A second test which comprised the listening
    and reading components at the TOEIC test were taken at the same  centre
    on 26th March 2012.

15. These cases have routinely come before the Tribunal  over  some  years.
    In the earlier years the Respondent's generic evidence  was  invariably
    inadequate to allow the Respondent to pass the legal  burden  of  proof
    and dubious as to whether it allowed them to pass the evidential burden
    of  proof.   Over  time  the  evidence  provided  by   the   Respondent
    strengthened and in Shehzad and Choudhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 the court
    held that the general evidence relied upon by the Respondent  did  pass
    the evidential burden of proof.

16.  Mr  Khan  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  fairly  conceded  that   the
    Respondent's evidence as contained essentially within the supplementary
    bundle did allow the Respondent to pass the evidential burden of  proof
    although he added the caveat that colleges tested were private colleges
    and Operation Fa�ade tested comparison with public colleges.  I do  not
    find that caveat of any real assistance to  the  Appellant.   The  fact
    that public colleges may well have  emerged  far  better  than  private
    colleges in a comparison of potential dubious  test  results  does  not
    assist in the validation of tests taken either at private  colleges  or
    more specifically an individual college relevant to the case before  me
    namely Westlink College.

17. The evidence provided by the Respondent demonstrates that between  18th
    October 2011 and 18th October2012. Westlink College undertook 915 TOEIC
    tests.  ETS identified 72% of those tests as being invalid and 0%  were
    not withdrawn.  The balance of 28% tests were found to be questionable.
     Further on 15th May 2012 an  ETS  audit  was  undertaken  at  Westlink
    College when a test was taking place.  There are the dramatic  findings
    of that visit as recorded  in  the  Operation  Fa�ade  statement.   The
    findings of the spot check on 15th May 2012 do not allow or suggest  an
    inference that circumstances on that day were necessarily different  to
    the circumstances on any day at least within the period that produced a
    high level of invalid and questionable tests.  The Appellant  took  his
    tests within that period of time.

18. It is accepted and I find the Respondent has discharged the  evidential
    burden in this case.   I  have  therefore  looked  at  the  explanation
    provided by the Appellant and his circumstances generally.

19. The Appellant had arrived in the UK on 3rd May 2011 with a twelve month
    visa only, to study as a student.  He was fully aware that to remain as
    a student in the UK he needed, as part of his application as  such,  to
    prove he could pass English to the required standard.   A  letter  from
    Bedfordshire College dated 20th May 2011 indicated  the  Appellant  was
    enrolled on a full-time diploma in business management  that  commenced
    on 11th March 2011 and continued until 23rd February 2012.   A  further
    letter dated 8th June 2011 confirmed the Appellant commenced the course
    in March 2011 and was due to complete it in February 2012.  On the face
    of it, if the Appellant only arrived  in  the  UK  in  May  2011  which
    appears to be agreed evidence (Appellant's witness statement  paragraph
    4) the Appellant could not have commenced  the  course  in  March  2011
    having only arrived in the UK two months later on what  was  already  a
    short course.  A letter from Bedfordshire College dated 25th March 2012
    stated that although the Appellant's attendance was satisfactory he did
    not "pass any exam attempt at college".  That is not  fully  clear  but
    certainly  it  is  clear  he  did  not  gain  any  qualifications   and
    questionable  whether  he  actually  attended   to   take   any   exam.
    Contemporaneous with his studies at Bedfordshire College the  Appellant
    enrolled at London Guildhall College on 5th September 2011 to  study  a
    level 5 diploma  in  business  management  and  in  February  2012  was
    accredited with all requirements leading to an award at that level.  It
    is said his attendance record is 82%.  It does not give  an  indication
    as to whether this was a full-time or part-time course but perhaps  the
    inference would be that for such a short course it was likely to  be  a
    full-time one.  The letters from Bedfordshire College  do  not  provide
    any clue as to the attendance rate of the Appellant on that course.   I
    have already noted what appears  to  be  an  anomaly  in  that  college
    claiming the Appellant commenced in March 2011 when in reality he  only
    arrived in the UK in May 2011.  However  the  letter  was  specific  in
    stating that the Appellant was enrolled on a full-time basis.

20. I find it unlikely that as a full-time  student  on  an  administrative
    management programme lasting only eleven  months  the  Appellant  would
    practically have been able to undertake another course of study of  any
    magnitude.  That is perhaps exacerbated by the fact that the  Appellant
    on the face of it missed  the  first  six  weeks  of  the  Bedfordshire
    College course, did not pass exams and potentially  did  not  even  sit
    those exams.   In  like  manner  if  a  level  5  diploma  in  business
    management awarded by Guildhall College has any worth then for a course
    lasting only six months (as far as the Appellant was concerned)  it  is
    unlikely to be so part-time as to allow the Appellant to  have  studied
    that course as well as the full-time course  at  Bedfordshire  College.
    His attendance at Bedfordshire College was  described  as  satisfactory
    which does not particularly  assist  in  terms  of  deciding  upon  his
    attendance rates.  I find it highly  unlikely  the  Appellant  operated
    between two full-time courses.  I find that on available  evidence  the
    fact that he attended Guildhall for 82% of the time required and passed
    exams whilst contrasted with his  Bedfordshire  result  indicates  that
    however onerous or not the Guildhall course may have been that was  his
    focal point to the exclusion of any studies at Bedfordshire College and
    accordingly his studies at Guildhall could not be described  simply  as
    either secondary or supplementary.

21. I have considered that aspect of the Appellant's academic  history  not
    only in respect of the Respondent's  assertion  of  a  breach  of  visa
    conditions but also in terms of the Appellant's behaviour and  evidence
    generally when examining any innocent explanation he provides following
    the Respondent's discharge of the evidential burden of proof in respect
    of the ETS matter.

22. I have also carefully  considered  the  Appellant's  written  and  oral
    evidence in respect of his attendance at the test centre.   It  follows
    that his attendance at a test centre would not preclude any proxy taker
    nor would it necessarily lead to a conclusion of a lack of  dishonesty.



23. The Appellant can produce no documentary evidence or other evidence  in
    support of his assertions to have attended and genuinely taken the test
    or his alleged attempts to obtain information from ETS.  I accept  that
    time has passed and gathering some evidence may not  be  easy,  however
    the Appellant has been aware of the  Respondent's  assertions  now  for
    some  time.   I  have  carefully  considered  the  Appellant's  written
    evidence regarding the manner in which tests were taken.  I  accept  he
    has provided detail as to the nature of those tests.  However that does
    not preclude the use of a proxy test taker at the centre  nor  does  it
    exclude the fact that the Appellant may merely  be  providing  evidence
    generally known or available  in  terms  of  the  methodology  of  test
    taking.

24. I have taken into account the fact that  the  Appellant  had  taken  an
    English language  test  in  2010  that  has  not  been  challenged  and
    accordingly he may at an earlier stage have demonstrated a  proficiency
    in the language.  However case law is clear that the fact that  someone
    may demonstrate a proficiency in the English language does  not  itself
    preclude the fact that the person may have cheated in a  test  for  any
    number of reasons.  This was a matter that was raised in  the  case  of
    Qadir.  It is also something referred to at paragraph 57 of the case of
    MA where a number of reasons were provided as to why an individual  may
    resort to deception.

25. I have looked at  the  Appellant's  evidence  and  that  which  he  did
    contemporaneously in that period of time namely the latter half of 2011
    and the first half of 2012.  I am satisfied  that  for  one  reason  or
    another the Appellant struggled with or was unable  to  cope  with  the
    course of study at Bedfordshire College and  decided  to  switch  to  a
    different course at a different college which, by inference  I  presume
    to have been easier for the Appellant to deal  with  than  the  one  at
    Bedfordshire College.  I do not find the switch to London Guildhall  to
    have simply been a supplementary course but was clearly the main  focus
    of the Appellant's attention.  He did not have permission to attend  at
    that college nor did he make any effort to notify the  Home  Office  of
    that change and accordingly was operating within breach of his  student
    visa.  I also find in terms of his  evidence  and  behaviour  generally
    that remaining in the UK on a student visa was potentially  of  greater
    importance to the Appellant than any specific  course  of  study  being
    undertaken.  It is clear that he wanted to move to a different  college
    for a different course and required  as  part  of  his  application  an
    English language test  and  required  such  test  at  relatively  short
    notice.  His evidence indicates  that  when  he  attended  at  Westlink
    College he was anxious to be able to take a test and  obtain  a  result
    within a short timeframe in order to complete his application prior  to
    the expiry of his current  visa.   Whilst  the  Appellant  had  a  test
    certificate dating to 2010, which has  not  been  challenged,  if  that
    certificate alone had been sufficient for the Appellant's purposes then
    there would have been no need for him to attend a  further  test  at  a
    language  centre  and  therefore  whatever  ability  in  language   the
    Appellant may have had it was the necessity to take and pass a test  in
    a reasonably short timeframe that was, in  my  view  uppermost  in  the
    Appellant's mind.  The  statistics  surrounding  the  college  that  he
    attended, at that period, are stark and dramatic.  As I have  indicated
    the spot check done on 15th May 2012 did not preclude people  being  in
    attendance at the college and therefore the fact that the Appellant has
    and is able to describe the tests that were undertaken does not  in  my
    view on its own  provide  an  innocent  explanation.   I  have  already
    commented on the lack of documentary evidence to support that which  is
    being claimed by the Appellant.  I also refer to his general  behaviour
    at this time with regard to colleges.  I do not find in  all  of  those
    circumstances that the Appellant has provided an innocent  explanation.
    I find when examining all of  the  evidence  that  the  Respondent  has
    discharged the legal burden in demonstrating the Appellant  acted  with
    deception in respect of the ETS test.  I further find for  the  reasons
    provided above that  the  evidence  points  on  balance  the  Appellant
    essentially studying at a college and on a  course  which  he  had  not
    gained entry clearance and without having notified the Home Office  and
    therefore was in breach of his visa conditions.
