                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Gillespie,
    promulgated on 11 May 2018, on the grounds set out at [1 -  8]  of  his
    application dated 24 July 2018.

 2. Mr Matthews conceded that grounds [1 - 3], at least,  disclosed  errors
    of such significance that the decision could not safely stand.

 3. Those grounds showed that [1] the judge  found  a  discrepancy  in  the
    appellant's evidence about his arrest, where there was  none;  [2]  the
    judge found an omission in an answer  about  injuries  when  there  was
    none, looking at the question asked and bearing in mind the nature of a
    screening interview; and [3] the judge was incorrect in saying that the
    appellant did not mention his injuries at his asylum interview.

 4. Representatives agreed that the outcome should be as follows.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  The nature of the case is such  that  it
    is appropriate under section 12 of the 2007  Act,  and  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.   The
    member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case  are  not  to  include
    Judge Gillespie.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
