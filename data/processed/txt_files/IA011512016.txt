                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. The Appellant did not attend the hearing.  He  had  written  to  the
       Tribunal (6 July 2017) asking for his case to be determined  on  the
       papers due to his ill health. A Duty Judge determined that it  would
       be fair for me  to  determine  the  appeal  having  heard  from  the
       Respondent. I saw no reason to interfere with that  decision  having
       considered the papers.


    2. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
       remain as an entrepreneur on 9 February  2016.  His  appeal  against
       that was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hawden-Beale  ("the
       Judge") following a hearing on 16 March 2016.

    3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane granted permission to appeal (31 May
       2017). He said;

       "it is arguable that the Judge did not arrive at a clear or rational
       finding that Equinox was not  able  to  invest  given  the  arguably
       convoluted manner in which the judge arrived at a  finding  in  ..."
       [16]."

    The Judgement

    4. [16] of the judgement states;

       "As a result of the delay  in  making  a  decision,  the  fact  that
       Equinox were dormant from 2014-2015 and the fact that the  appellant
       has not supplied information to show that even after this length  of
       time Equinox was still able to and interested in  investing  in  the
       company, I have to conclude that, as at the date  of  the  decision,
       the respondent was correct to question  whether  the  appellant  had
       access to that money, given that there was no company  in  existence
       to transfer the funds to. I cannot not conclude that Equinox did not
       have the funds when the application was made because the  respondent
       has not supported her claim in the  appropriate  manner  but,  given
       that the company was dormant  for  2014  and  2015,  I  do  question
       whether Equinox was able to fund the  company  as  at  the  date  of
       decision".

    5. It is also appropriate to set out [15];

       "Having said that there were still issues with the application  from
       the beginning which the appellant had not  addressed,  such  as  the
       evidence of the registration of the company with Companies House and
       his appointment as a director. The appellant has not  produced  that
       evidence even though in his interview on an unknown date at question
       11, he said that he had registered the company at Companies House."

    6. It is also appropriate to set out [17];

       "I also share the respondent's concerns about  the  market  research
       because the appellant said that he did not need to do  any,  knowing
       his market segment as he did. He may  well  have  known  his  market
       segment, but he had to  demonstrate  that  he  knew  it  and  market
       research was the way to show that knowledge. Merely saying he  knows
       the market means nothing."

The parties' arguments

    7. The Respondent filed a rule 24 notice  (12  June  2017)  saying,  in
       essence, that the Judge having noted the  dormancy  of  Equinox  and
       inability of the Appellant to demonstrate it could support  him  was
       entitled to conclude he did not meet the requirements of the  rules.
       Mr Whitwell's oral submissions did not expand on this.

    8. The Appellant submitted in the grounds  that  the  Respondent  could
       have made enquiries of him or Equinox during the 3 ï¿½ years  she  was
       considering the application. Equinox  agreed  to  fund  him.  Market
       research was not mandatory. The Respondent was obliged  to  consider
       exercising discretion outside the rules.

Discussion

    9. The wording of [16] was indeed convoluted with  the  final  sentence
       containing 3 negatives in the first 8 words.  Excluding  2  of  them
       leads to a less convoluted sentence.

       "I cannot  conclude  that  Equinox  did  have  the  funds  when  the
       application was made because the respondent has  not  supported  her
       claim in the appropriate manner"

       This in itself is hard to fathom as the respondent was not making  a
       claim and did not have to  prove  anything.  It  is  not  however  a
       material error of law as  it  has  not  infected  the  rest  of  the
       decision.

   10. The Judge was sufficiently clear in  regards  to  the  rest  of  the
       findings he made in [15], [16], and [17]. If the  tortuous  sentence
       is excluded, the Judgement is clear, namely the Appellant had failed
       to establish that he had access  to  the  funds,  or  a  company  to
       transfer the funds to, or that he had done relevant market research.
       The Respondent was not required to consider exercising discretion.

   11. I am not therefore satisfied that the Judge made a material error of
       law.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

      I do not set aside the decision.
