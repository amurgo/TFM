Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ahmed

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and the  Respondent  is  Mrs  Arosiak  Artin.  For  ease  of
    reference I shall refer to the Secretary of State as  "the  Respondent"
    and Mrs Arosiak Artin as "the Appellant".

 2. This is the review of an appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer Abu
    Dhabi's decision to refuse the Appellant entry clearance to the  United
    Kingdom as a spouse to join her husband who is now a British citizen.

History

 3. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Iraq  born  1st  June  1945.  She  made
    application to join her husband "the Sponsor" Ramzi Hanna who is now  a
    British citizen. The application was refused by the Respondent on  10th
    December 2012 on two main grounds.

      i) The Appellant could not meet the financial requirements of Appendix
         FM to the new Immigration Rules.

     ii) The Respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
         genuine subsisting marriage with the Sponsor.

    It has since been agreed and determined that the Appellant and  Sponsor
    are in a subsisting marriage and the second  ground  plays  no  further
    part in these proceedings.

 4. The Appellant and her husband were both in their late 60s at  the  date
    of decision. They are of Armenian descent and Christians. Their parents
    had settled in Iraq after fleeing the Turkish pogroms of the early 20th
    Century. Although they were brought up in Iraq, both the Appellant  and
    Sponsor spent the majority of their adult life living  and  working  in
    the UAE. They raised their two  children  there  and  their  son  Berge
    remains working in the UAE. Their daughter Alice now lives in the USA.

 5. The Sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2002, leaving his wife in the
    UAE. The Sponsor sought asylum which was refused. He  was  nevertheless
    granted indefinite leave to remain in 2010 and became a British citizen
    in February 2012.

The First-tier Tribunal Hearing

 6.  At the hearing before Judge Kelly it was accepted that  the  Appellant
    could not meet the financial requirement of the Immigration Rules.  The
    Sponsor is in receipt of pension credits from the  UK  government.  The
    Appellant was working in the UAE and it is correct  that  her  son  had
    transferred to her account in November 2012  AED  350,000  leaving  her
    with a closing balance of ï¿½63,622 - but at the date  of  decision  that
    amount had not been held in her account for  the  requisite  six  month
    period under the Immigration Rules.

 7. Judge Kelly went  on  to  consider  Article  8  ECHR  and  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal on the grounds that  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse entry clearance was disproportionate.

 8. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal. In granting
    permission DJ Peart said,

         "It is arguable that in allowing the appeal, Judge Kelly failed  to
         give adequate reasons for finding the Respondent's decision  to  be
         disproportionate. It is arguable there was inadequate reasoning  in
         terms of the parties  claimed  exceptional  circumstances  and  the
         claimed unjustifiably harsh consequences of removal. See  HH  Genoa
         [2012] UKSC".

    Thus the matter comes before me to decide if  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's determination discloses an error of law such that the  decision
    must be remade.

The Hearing Before Me

 9. At the hearing before me I confirmed with both parties that I  had  all
    the documents which were before Judge Kelly. Mr Ahmed served a Rule  24
    response dated 18th September 2013.

10. Mrs Pettersen sought to  rely  in  the  main  on  the  grounds  seeking
    permission. She  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    misdirected himself because he had failed to give  adequate  weight  to
    the Immigration Rules and the Article 8 section of the Rules had to  be
    factored in to any proportionality exercise. The Judge had omitted this
    and thus a key element of the balancing exercise was missing.

11. Further the Judge had found that the Appellant's case  was  exceptional
    and had thereby allowed it under  Article  8.  He  had  approached  the
    question of exceptionality incorrectly. There was  nothing  exceptional
    or compelling on the facts of this Appellant's case, such as  to  bring
    it within Article 8.

12. Mr Ahmed in response submitted that the Judge  had  asked  himself  the
    correct questions when dealing with proportionality. He had taken  into
    account all the relevant factors and at paragraphs 17  and  18  of  the
    determination had considered that the Sponsor on account of his age and
    limited employment prospects could hardly relocate  to  join  his  wife
    abroad. That  would  require  the  Sponsor  to  sacrifice  his  British
    citizenship and financial benefit of remaining in the  UK.  That  could
    not be reasonable. Therefore in order to resume their married life, the
    Appellant would need to join the Sponsor here in the UK.

13. At the end of submissions both parties  indicated  that  there  was  no
    further evidence to call. Mrs Pettersen  accepted  that  there  was  no
    challenge to the facts found by Judge Kelly and therefore it was agreed
    that should I find an error of  law  I  could  go  on  and  remake  the
    decision.

Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the analysis of  Article  8  ECHR  by  Judge  Kelly
    discloses an error of law. The decision shows inadequate  reasoning  on
    why the Appellant's case is one  of  exceptionality.  In  HH  v  Deputy
    Prosecutor  of  the  Italian  Republic  Genoa  [2012]  UKSC  Lady  Hale
    commented in paragraph 32 when discussing  exceptionality  said,  "Some
    particularly grave consequences are not out of the run of mill at  all.
    Once again, the test is always whether the gravity of the  interference
    with family life is justified by the gravity  of  the  public  interest
    pursued. Exceptionality is a prediction just as it was  in  Razgar  and
    not a test".

15. What are the facts relied upon in this appeal?  Firstly  the  Appellant
    has lived apart from her husband for a number of years. She has been in
    employment and so far as is known is in good health. There  is  nothing
    exceptional there. She is in no reported  danger.  She  enjoys  contact
    with the Sponsor, according to the evidence  of  her  son,  by  way  of
    Skype.

16. She visited the UK in 2010 and  saw  the  Sponsor  there.  Against  the
    Appellant is the fact that she cannot meet the  financial  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules. Her husband is in receipt of public funds and
    even though Judge Kelly found that  in  the  medium  term  the  overall
    charge on public funds would be actually reduced, this,  is  the  wrong
    approach. What needs to be looked at is whether the  admission  of  the
    Appellant would lead to a recourse to public funds. The answer to  that
    must be "Yes". This is because it is accepted by the parties  that  the
    Appellant cannot meet the Immigration Rules. It is a stark reality that
    not meeting the financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules  means
    that the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  remain  physically  apart.  The
    consequence of not being able to meet the Immigration  Rules  does  not
    render the Respondent's decision to refuse entry disproportionate under
    Article 8. The Respondent's decision  is  made  to  ensure  that  those
    seeking entry the United Kingdom do  not  become  a  charge  on  public
    funds. However there is nothing disproportionate about the Respondent's
    decision to ensure that those seeking entry to the  United  Kingdom  do
    not become a charge on public funds.

DECISION

17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge having made an error  of  law,  I  hereby
    remake the decision. The Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance
    Officer Abu Dhabi's decision to refuse entry clearance is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made
