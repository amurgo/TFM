For the Appellants:    Mr Abdullah Khurram (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Boylan-Kemp, promulgated on 22nd August 2016, following a hearing
    at Birmingham Sheldon Court on 1st August 2016.  In the  determination,
    the  judge  allowed  the  appeal,  on  human  rights  grounds,  of  the
    Appellants, whereupon the Respondent Secretary of  State,  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants comprise a  family,  of  two  parents  and  their  three
    children. The first Appellant, the father, was born on 8th May 1977 and
    is a Bangladeshi national. The second  Appellant,  the  wife,  together
    with the third, fourth and fifth  Appellants,  the  children,  are  all
    nationals of the Philippines. Their dates of birth are 16th June  1974,
    [ ] 2003, [ ] 2006, and [ ] 2013.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The Appellants' claim is that the first Appellant,  who  the  principal
    Appellant, upon whom the others are dependent,  entered  the  UK  on  a
    student visa on 8th February 2005 with valid leave to remain until 31st
    March 2006, following which there were various extensions of  his  stay
    in this country.  On 13th January 2015, he applied for indefinite leave
    to remain on the basis of ten years' lawful continuous residence in the
    UK.  This application was  refused  on  1st  April  2015.   The  second
    Appellant, his wife, entered the UK on  25th  March  2008,  on  a  work
    permit valid from 25th February 2008 until 20th April 2009.  Her  first
    two children were born in the Philippines, but the  youngest  has  been
    born in the UK.  They appeal the Respondent's  refusal  decision  dated
    1st April 2015 to the effect that the first Appellant has not  had  ten
    years' continuous lawful residence in the country,  because  his  valid
    leave expired on 31st  July  2007,  and  he  did  not  submit  a  fresh
    application for leave to remain until 4th September 2007.   This  meant
    that he overstayed for a period exceeding 28 days during  those  dates.
    The  Respondent  decided  that  the  Appellants  did  not  satisfy  the
    requirements  of  Appendix  FM  or  paragraph  276ADE(1).   The   first
    Appellant and his dependent wife was neither  a  British  citizen,  nor
    settled in the UK, and nor had they been granted refugee status in this
    country.  They did not satisfy the long  residency  requirements  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) to (v) as the first Appellant was aged over 25
    years old and had not lived in the UK for twenty years.  The Appellants
    also did not satisfy paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence that the first Appellant had completed his MSc
    in International Business from Birmingham City University, and  he  had
    obtained employment in May 2007 with a company.  The evidence was given
    before the Tribunal that the Appellant was not technically  responsible
    for  the  delay  in  submitting  his  relevant  visa  application,   as
    responsibility for this had been placed upon  his  employers,  as  they
    were his work Sponsor, but unfortunately they were a few days  late  in
    making the application.

 5. The judge went on to say that  he  recognised  that  besides  this  one
    incident the Appellant has had a "faultless  immigration  record",  and
    this issue occurred due to the delay caused by his employers, who  were
    acting as his Sponsor, not due to the direct actions of  the  Appellant
    himself (paragraph 13).

 6. Second, the judge went on to record that,

         "There is also a wealth of evidence in the Appellants' bundle about
         the children's lives, as well as statements  from  the  two  eldest
         children explaining how settled they are in the UK  in  respect  of
         their schooling and social life" (paragraph 19).

 7. Third, the judge observed that her English  was  the  children's  first
    language now, and applying Section 55 of the BCIA 2009, the judge  held
    that, what I find that it would not be  reasonable  for  the  third  or
    fourth Appellant to leave the UK as they have  both  established  lives
    here in the UK by moving either to Bangladesh or the  Philippines"  and
    added that this would be "to a level that I find cannot  be  justified"
    (paragraph 20).

 8. Finally, the judge had regard to Section 117B(6) of the 2002  Act.   He
    concluded that, bearing all these factors in mind, that

         "It will be unreasonable to require the parents of other sibling of
         the third and fourth Appellants to leave the UK as to do  so  would
         result in an unjustifiable division of the  family.   Therefore,  I
         find that the Appellants'  right  in  this  respect  outweighs  the
         public interest in effective immigration  control  ..."  (paragraph
         21).

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law in failing
    to  consider  the  public   interest   factors   in   determining   the
    reasonableness of requiring the minor  children  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

10. On 23rd  November  2016,  permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  the
    Tribunal.  On 13th January 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered by  the
    Appellants' solicitors.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 9th May 2017, Mr Mills, appearing on behalf
    of the Respondent Secretary of  State,  accepted  that  the  period  of
    overstaying here was relatively short (see paragraphs 13 to 14).  There
    was also here a non-custodial driving offence committed  by  the  first
    Appellant.  The  judge  also  wrongly  concluded  that  the  elder  two
    children could come under paragraph 276ADE  and  Appendix  FM,  because
    they had not been in the UK quite seven years, but just over six years.
     Whereas none of this may be material to  the  eventual  decision,  the
    judge misconstrued the application of Section 117B(vi), in  determining
    whether it will be reasonable for the children to leave the UK, because
    the judge focused only on the "best interests" of the children, and not
    on the period of unlawful stay in this  country.   These  matters  were
    important because the Appellants could not meet the  Immigration  Rules
    (see paragraph 20).  They were also important because contrary  to  the
    position previously, the judgment in Treebhoven now makes  clear,  that
    all aspects of Section 117B need to be looked at together and that they
    are not independent of Section 117B(vi).  Therefore, the fact that  the
    principal Appellant was only earning �18,000, and not even �18,600, was
    a factor that ought to have militated against their  being  allowed  to
    remain in this country.  All in all, therefore, the judge had erred  in
    law.

12. For his part, Mr Khurram, relied upon the Rule 24 response  dated  13th
    January 2017.   He  submitted  that  if  Mr  Mills  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, had  accepted  that  the  decision  with
    respect to paragraph 276ADE was not material, to the overall outcome of
    the appeal, then the only  issue  that  remains  is  Section  117B(vi).
    However, the judge addressed all the relevant issues at  paragraph  21,
    at paragraph 20, at paragraph 10, and at paragraph  19,  where  in  the
    latter case,  it  is  expressly  stated  that,  apart  from  the  short
    overstaying by the Appellants, for  which  they  were  not  responsible
    themselves, "the Appellant has had a faultless immigration record" (see
    paragraph 13).

13. There was no reply by Mr Mills.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge,  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007), such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons  are
    as follows.

15. First, the principal basis of the  challenges  that  the  judge  overly
    concentrated on the "best interests" of the children, and neglected the
    public interest in immigration control.  This is not so.  The judge did
    give the public interest in immigration control  proper  consideration.
    Not only is there an  express  reference  to  this  in  the  concluding
    paragraph (at paragraph 21), but the judge is clear (at  paragraph  31)
    that, "the Appellant has had a faultless immigration record"  and  that
    this "occurred due to the delay caused by his employers who are  acting
    as his Sponsor and not due to the  direct  actions  of  the  Appellant"
    (paragraph 13).  Second, the judge gave express recognition to the fact
    that, "the Respondent ... granted him a  period  of  limited  leave  to
    remain for 24 months" (see paragraph 8).   Third,  in  looking  at  the
    position of the children, the judge had regard to the fact that, "there
    is a wealth of evidence in the Appellant's bundle about the  children's
    lives, as well as statements from the two  eldest  children  explaining
    how settled they are in the UK" (paragraph 19).  Fourth, one aspect  of
    this evidence is that, "regarding their family life in the UK  and  the
    fact that their children are settled into English culture having  spent
    most of their formative lives here" (paragraph 11).  Finally, it was in
    the context of the aforesaid, that the judge eventually concluded that,
    "therefore, I find that the Appellants' rights in this respect outweigh
    the public interest in effective immigration control"  (paragraph  21).
    These conclusions were not perverse.  They were entirely  open  to  the
    judge on the evidence that he heard.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
