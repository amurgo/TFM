Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr M Steward, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:    Miss S K, (Sponsor)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of State. The Respondents
    are DC and KC (twin siblings  born  15th  January  1999)  and  who  are
    citizens  of  Zimbabwe.  For  ease   of   reference,   throughout   the
    determination I shall refer to DC and KC as "the  Appellants"  and  the
    Secretary of State as "the Respondent".

 2. The Respondent seeks a review of the decision of a First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge (Judge Turnock) who in a determination promulgated on  20th  June
    2013, allowed the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decision
    made on 11th July 2012, refusing them entry clearance as the  dependent
    children of their mother Mrs SK "the Sponsor" a woman now settled here.

History

 3. The Appellants who are twin siblings were born on 15th January 1999 and
    they are now 14 years of age. In 2002 when the twins were 3 years  old,
    the Sponsor arrived in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  twins  remained  in
    Zimbabwe being looked after  by  their  grandmother.  The  Sponsor  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2010. She has two other
    children living with her here; T who is now 20 years of age  and  G,  2
    years of age. The Sponsor's husband is the Appellants' father  and  the
    father of G but not of T. The Sponsor reports that  her  husband  is  a
    British citizen and she understands he is in the UK but his whereabouts
    are unknown.

 4. The Sponsor on behalf of the Appellant's made application for  them  to
    join  her  as  her  dependent  children.  The  Respondent  refused  the
    application on 11th July 2012 as the Appellants were unable to meet the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules  under  paragraph  297.
    There was no evidence that the Sponsor was in  employment;  indeed  she
    was in receipt of a host of benefits including a student grant, student
    allowance and job seekers allowance.

 5. When the appeal came before Judge Turnock,  he  dismissed  the  appeals
    under the Immigration Rules but allowed them under Article 8 ECHR.  The
    Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal.

The Permission

 6. The main grounds seeking permission stated  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    taking   into   account   post-decision   evidence    when    assessing
    proportionality  under  Article  8.  Further  having  found  that   the
    Appellants could not meet the Immigration Rules because of  a  lack  of
    finances, he should have given weightier consideration, to  the  public
    interest element of proportionality. UT Judge Reeds granted  permission
    and the relevant part of that grant reads as follows,

         "The grounds make a number of  assertions  concerning  the  judge's
         assessment of the legal issues in this appeal; that the judge erred
         in law in failing to have regard to the new  Immigration  Rules  in
         force at the date of decision and in this context, in allowing  the
         appeal on "classic" Article 8" grounds the  judge  failed  to  have
         regard  to  take  that  into   account   in   the   assessment   of
         proportionality. Further, the judge found on  the  facts  that  the
         Appellants could not meet the maintenance provisions (see paragraph
         27) yet when considering Article 8 appeared to make a contradictory
         finding (see paragraph 36)".

 7. Thus the matter comes before me to decide initially if  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge has erred; and if so  whether  the  decision  should  be
    remade without a further hearing.

 8. Mr Steward on behalf  of  the  Respondent  drew  my  attention  to  the
    apparent inconsistency between paragraphs 27  and  36  of  the  Judge's
    determination. In paragraph 27 the Judge states,  "The  burden  is,  of
    course on Mrs K. In those circumstances I am not satisfied that she has
    discharged the burden upon her and I determine that  her  appeal  under
    the Rules fails". That of course is incorrect because Mrs K is not  the
    Appellant, her children D and K are. That aside  in  paragraph  36  the
    Judge states, "In terms of the threat to the economic well-being of the
    country it is relevant that Mrs K is now in stable employment with  the
    prospects of future enhancement of salary and that she has  achieved  a
    university degree. It is clear that any additional burden  which  might
    fall on the State is not significant". Mr Steward  submitted  that  the
    Judge has not focussed as he was tasked to do, on the date of decision.



 9. Further paragraph  40  contains  a  factual  error  because  the  Judge
    records, "Importantly they have a  brother  and  half-brother  who  are
    settled in the UK and who have been here for  approximately  12  years.
    Their half-brother is studying in  the  UK  and  also  has  employment.
    Particular regard must be had to the interests of those children". That
    finding cannot be correct because the youngest child G is only 2  years
    of age. Added to this the Judge then carries on in  paragraph  40,  "It
    would not be reasonable to expect the Appellants' mother and brother to
    relocate to Zimbabwe, and it is difficult to imagine their half-brother
    choosing to take that course of action". What the Judge has  failed  to
    make clear is that T is now an adult and  there  was  no  evidence  put
    forward of greater emotional ties between T and the Appellants.

10. Mr Steward concluded his submissions by asking  me  to  note  that  the
    Judge has not properly evaluated the proportionality considerations and
    there is inadequate reasoning, when combined  with  factual  error,  to
    show  why   the   refusal   of   the   Entry   Clearance   Officer   is
    disproportionate. He asked that  I  set  aside  the  determination  and
    remake the decision on the agreed facts before me.

11. Mrs K on behalf of the Appellants said that she is now earning a salary
    of around ï¿½23,000. No documentary evidence of this was put  before  me.
    She accepted that she had left the twins with  their  grandmother  when
    she came to the United Kingdom eleven years ago and that they were very
    young at that time and that they have lived all their lives with  their
    grandmother in Zimbabwe. She wished to emphasise that she has  kept  in
    touch with them by way of phone calls and has returned to  Zimbabwe  to
    see them. They are in education there. She said that she  is  a  single
    parent and has responsibility to look after G.  Her  eldest  son  works
    now and pays towards his own keep.

12. At the end of submissions, neither party sought to adduce  any  further
    evidence. I informed the parties that as there was no real challenge to
    the facts found by Judge Turnock, then if I found an  error  of  law  I
    would be in a position to remake the decision.

13. Having considered matters I have concluded the determination  of  Judge
    Turnock contains a material error of law and should be  set  aside  and
    the decision remade, for the reasons set out below.

14.  In  his  determination,  the  Judge  correctly  identified  that   the
    Appellants could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules. He
    then went on to conduct an Article 8 assessment and concluded that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision to refuse the Appellants entry,  was
    disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR. I am satisfied that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge failed to make adequate and clear findings  on  the
    Appellants' ability to meet (or rather not meet)  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of decision. This failure meant  that
    he did not properly take into account the public interest element  when
    assessing proportionality under Article 8 ECHR. The starting  point  in
    these appeals is that they are  out-of-country  appeals.  The  relevant
    date, even for an Article 8 consideration is the date of decision which
    is 11th July 2012. What the Judge needed to focus on was  the  evidence
    of  the  situation  of  the  parties  at  that  time.  Instead  he  has
    speculated, in paragraph 36  of  the  determination,  because  what  he
    records is as follows, "Mrs K is now  in  stable  employment  with  the
    prospects of future  enhancement  of  salary.  It  is  clear  that  any
    additional burden which might fall on the State is not significant".

15. Having taken into account post-decision evidence and  speculating  that
    any additional burden which might fall on the State is not significant,
    the  Judge  has  erred  when   factoring   those   matters   into   the
    proportionality test under Razgar. Therefore the Judge's decision  must
    be set aside for error and the decision remade.

Remaking the Decision

16. The facts found by Judge Turnock are in the main preserved. I  note  in
    particular that D and K, although minors are  now  13  years  and  have
    spent all their lives in Zimbabwe. I note that although the Sponsor  is
    their mother nevertheless the twins  have  spent  the  last  ten  years
    living with and being cared for  by  their  grandmother.  There  is  no
    suggestion that they are not settled in  Zimbabwe.  They  are  in  good
    health. They go to school. There was no evidence  before  me  or  Judge
    Turnock that their grandmother is unwell or unable to care for them.

17. Their father, although apparently  in  the  United  Kingdom,  does  not
    feature in their lives. Apart from their mother,  the  Appellants  have
    two siblings in the United Kingdom. Their older sibling  T  is  now  an
    adult. Their younger sibling G is two years of age. Therefore I bear in
    mind that although not a paramount consideration the best interests  of
    a child are a primary consideration. This means that D and Ks interests
    together with those of their younger sibling G must be considered first
    but  they  can  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of   other
    considerations SS (Nigeria) [2013]  following ZH (Tanzania) [2012]

18. Whilst I am satisfied that in this appeal Article  8  ECHR  is  engaged
    because there is some evidence of family life  between  the  Appellants
    and  their  mother,  the  real  focus  in  this   case   is   that   of
    proportionality under the Razgar test.

19. The Appellants have been cared for by their grandmother  for  the  last
    ten years in Zimbabwe. They have lived there all their  lives  and  the
    vast majority of their life has been  spent  with  her.  There  was  no
    evidence before me nor the First-tier Tribunal Judge that their day-to-
    day needs were not being met by their grandmother. However at the  date
    of decision, a grant  of  entry  clearance  to  the  twins  would  have
    inevitably led to an increase in the amount of public funds  needed  to
    maintain the family unit. The Sponsor was in receipt of public funds at
    the date of decision. In addition she was in receipt of various  grants
    because she was studying for a degree.  There  would  therefore  be  an
    increased burden upon the tax payer, when there is nothing  exceptional
    about the Appellants' situation in Zimbabwe.

20. I am strengthened in this view by a reference to AAO  [2011]  where  it
    was stated "Strasbourg  and  domestic  jurisprudence  has  consistently
    emphasised that States are entitled to have regard to their  system  of
    immigration control and its generally  consistent  application,  and  a
    requirement that an entrant should be maintained  without  recourse  to
    public funds is an ultimately fair and  necessary  limitation  on  what
    would otherwise become a possibly overwhelming burden  on  all  of  its
    citizens".

21. For these reasons, weighing all  the  evidence  as  I  must,  there  is
    nothing exceptional in these cases, to  outweigh  the  public  interest
    element of the immigration rules, when considering the  proportionality
    test  in  Razgar.  The  Respondent's  decision  is  therefore   not   a
    disproportionate  interference  with  the  Article  8  rights  of   the
    Appellants.

DECISION

22. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I  set  aside  that  decision.  I
    remake the decision. These appeals are dismissed.
