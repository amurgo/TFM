Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Counsel instructed by Z Ranjha, Addison &
                    Khan solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Background

      1. By a decision promulgated on 10 December 2018, on the appeal of the
         Secretary of State, I found an error of  law  in  the  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge M R Oliver promulgated on 11 October 2018
         allowing the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  decision
         dated 21 December 2017.  The  Respondent  refused  the  Appellant's
         application for a residence card confirming his retained  right  of
         residence as the former spouse of a Lithuanian national,  Ms  [RP],
         mainly on the basis that the marriage was one of  convenience.   In
         light of the error of law found in Judge Oliver's decision,  I  set
         aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and gave  directions  for  a
         resumed hearing to re-make the decision.  My error of law  decision
         is annexed hereto for ease of reference.

      2. The factual background to this appeal is set out at [2] of my error
         of law decision and I  do  not  repeat  it.   Judge  Oliver  found,
         contrary to the conclusion of the Respondent, that the  Appellant's
         marriage to Ms [P] was not a marriage of convenience.  I  preserved
         that finding ([20] of my error of law decision).




    The Issues and the Legal Background

      3. As I observed at [17] and [18] of my error  of  law  decision,  the
         issues which remain between the parties  are  quite  narrow.   They
         are,  first,  whether  the  Appellant   satisfies   the   remaining
         provisions of regulation 10 of the Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").  Regulation  10  is
         set out at [16] of my error of law decision and  I  do  not  repeat
         what I say at [17] and [18] concerning  the  further  narrowing  of
         that issue.

      4. Mr Nath confirmed that it is the Appellant's case that  he  is  now
         entitled to a permanent right of residence having spent five  years
         as the spouse or former spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty
         rights or with a retained right of residence under  regulation  10.
         The relevant provision in that regard is regulation 15 of  the  EEA
         Regulations which reads as follows so far as relevant:

             "Right of permanent residence

             15. -     (1)  The following  persons  acquire  the  right  to
                  reside in the United Kingdom permanently-

                  ...

                  (f)  a person who-

                      (i)   has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance
                      with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
                      five years; and

                      (ii)  was, at the end of the period, a family  member
                      who has retained the right of residence."

      5. Mr Kandola accepted  that,  the  Appellant  having  been  issued  a
         residence card as Ms [P]'s family member on 13 June 2012 to 13 June
         2017 and the divorce having commenced  on  28  February  2017,  the
         Appellant has to show that Ms [P] was exercising Treaty  rights  as
         at 28 February 2017, that he was residing before that time  as  her
         family member whilst she was exercising Treaty rights  and that  he
         was himself economically active as  if  he  were  an  EEA  national
         exercising Treaty rights in the period from 28 February 2017 to  13
         June 2017.

      6. As I identified at [10] to [11] of my error of law decision,  there
         is also a potential issue  regarding  the  Appellant's  failure  to
         produce Ms [P]'s original identity document.  I set out the law  in
         that regard in those paragraphs and  gave  a  direction  indicating
         that I would be assisted by having a copy of the  application  made
         leading to the issue of the residence card in 2012 so that  it  was
         factually clear whether the identity  document  was  at  that  time
         produced to the Respondent.  A copy of  that  application  was  not
         forthcoming prior to the hearing.   However,  at  the  hearing,  Mr
         Kandola  confirmed  that  the  Respondent  did  have  the  identity
         document  at  that  time  and  confirmed  that,  in  light  of  the
         Tribunal's decision in Barnett (referred to at [10] and [11] of the
         error of law decision), he did not pursue that point.  He was right
         to do so.  Moreover, the  Appellant  has,  with  his  supplementary
         bundle, provided a copy of the identity document of  Ms  [P]  which
         was produced with the earlier application.

      7. Accordingly, for the above reasons, the issue is whether Ms [P] and
         the Appellant were exercising Treaty rights (or economically active
         in the Appellant's case as if he  were  an  EEA  national)  in  the
         period 13 June 2012 to 13 June 2017.  I therefore turn to what  the
         evidence shows in that regard.




    Evidence: Discussion and Conclusions

      8. The Appellant complied with the direction to file further  evidence
         in relation to the remaining issues.  Unfortunately, that  had  not
         reached the Respondent.  Mr Kandola was however able to peruse  the
         relatively short bundle before and during the hearing and  to  make
         submissions on what that showed.  Unfortunately, also,  the  short,
         written submissions made by the  Appellant  were  not  received  by
         either the Tribunal or the Respondent (although I accept they  were
         sent) but I and Mr Kandola had time to read those and Mr Nath  made
         oral submissions based on those written submissions.

      9. It was agreed that there was no need for the Appellant to give oral
         evidence.  The focus of the  issues  is  the  documentary  evidence
         during  the  relevant  period.   Unfortunately,   the   Appellant's
         evidence was organised in a way which was slightly unfocussed.  For
         example, the written submissions focussed attention only on whether
         Ms [P] was exercising Treaty rights at the date of commencement  of
         divorce and not  for  any  earlier  period.   In  relation  to  the
         Appellant, the submissions relied on one invoice dated  17  January
         2017, one invoice dated 29 November 2018 and  the  evidence  I  had
         identified at [17] of my error of law decision which I declined  to
         set out or make findings on as  the  Respondent  had  not  had  the
         opportunity to make submissions about that evidence.  As a  result,
         time was spent during the hearing establishing  what  the  evidence
         showed about the outstanding issues.  That included  the  need  for
         the Appellant to produce further documentary  evidence  during  the
         hearing.  However, I have  been  to  establish  what  the  evidence
         demonstrates about the exercise of Treaty rights/ economic activity
         in the requisite period which I summarise as follows:

         Ms [P]

           . Tax year 2012-13  (encompassing  start  of  the  period):  tax
             return  for  self-employment  as  Prime   Cleaning   Services:
             turnover �8310, net profit �7568 (handed in at hearing);

           . Tax year 2013-14: tax  return  for  self-employment  providing
             cleaning services: turnover �8277, net profit �7618 (handed in
             at hearing);

           . Employed by B-Tech Solutions from 2 June 2014 to 26 June 2015:
             employer's letters at [AB/19-20]; P60 for tax year to 5  April
             2015 confirming earnings of �7371 [SAB/19]; P45 at  [AB/22-24]
             confirming leaving date as 26 June 2015;

           . Employed by Privilege Security & Services Ltd from 1 July 2015
             to 15 November  2016:  P60  for  tax  year  to  5  April  2016
             confirming   earnings   of   �7514.14   (including    previous
             employment)   ([SAB/10]);   P11   deductions   working   sheet
             confirming  earnings  from  July  2015  ([SAB/11]),   payslips
             February 2016 to September 2016 ([SAB/12-18]); P45 at  [SAB/6-
             9] confirming leaving date;

           . Employed by Innovative Management Solutions from November 2016
             to April 2017: Payslips at [SAB/1-5] - there is no payslip for
             December 2016 but there  are  payslips  either  side  of  that
             month; it appears  that  this  is  simply  an  omission.   The
             payslip for November 2016 suggests that Ms [P] worked for only
             part of that  month,  but  she  did  not  leave  her  previous
             employment until 15 November.

         The Appellant

           . Tax return 2013-14: income from employment and self-employment
             �10,343 ([SAB/65 - 83]);

           . Tax return 2014-15: income from employment and self-employment
             �10,093([SAB/46-64]);

           . Schedule of invoices for interpreting and translation services
             ([AB/31-35]): the invoices are in no particular order but show
             income from that source for the period 19  April  2013  to  20
             July 2018 as follows:

                  2013: �7701.06

                  2014: �9987.12

                  2015: �6659.92

                  2016: �4572.72

                  2017: �1393.09

                  2018: �629.18

             In particular, there are  records  of  income  in  the  period
             February to June 2017 of �179.14  (27  February)  �199.43  (20
             March), �125.75 (19 May);

           . The additional documents for the period February to June  2017
             are as follows:

                  Remittance advice dated 12 July 2017 for an invoice  dated
                  17 February 2017 (�455) ([AB/41]);

                  Invoice dated 4 June 2017 for charges of �500.50 ([AB/42])

                  E-mail dated  21  March  2017  notifying  payment  of  �38
                  (AB/43])

                  Payslips: 28 February 2017 (�34.66)  ([AB/54]),  31  March
                  2017  (-�8.60:  tax  payment)  ([AB/53]),  30  June   2017
                  (�43.26) ([AB/51])

                  P60: year to 5 April 2017 (�43.26: corresponds to  payslip
                  of 30 June) ([AB/52]);

                  Privilege Security & Services Ltd accounts for year to  31
                  March 2017  (Appellant  is  director):  turnover  �82,270,
                  gross profit �6328, net loss �2386 ([AB70-85]);

                  HMRC receipts for  VAT  payments  for  accounting  periods
                  ending March and June  2017  (�1173.06,  �1002.08,  �1200)
                  ([AB/105-107]);

                  Privilege Security & Services  Ltd  employee  pay  details
                  2017-18 and deductions working  sheets  for  same  period:
                  ([AB/112-138])

     10. Mr Kandola accepted that, on the face of the documents relied upon,
         Ms [P] was exercising Treaty rights up to the commencement  of  the
         divorce proceedings.  He accepted that he was unable  to  challenge
         the genuineness of any earnings because the Respondent  had  failed
         to make enquiries of HMRC.  The genuineness of  earnings  had  been
         raised in a previous decision  but  not  on  this  occasion  as  he
         accepted.  He pointed out that the amounts  earned  are  below  the
         income tax thresholds.

     11. Based on the above evidence, I am satisfied that the Appellant  has
         shown that Ms [P] was exercising Treaty rights in the  period  from
         when the residence card was issued up to  and  including  the  date
         when divorce  proceedings  began  and  that  he  has  himself  been
         economically active during the period 28 February 2017 to  13  June
         2017.

     12. I accept that the earnings of Ms [P] are low and below  the  income
         tax thresholds.  That does not  however  mean  that  they  are  not
         genuine earnings.  For the  period  in  question,  based  on  Judge
         Oliver's finding, she was in a genuine marriage with the  Appellant
         and accordingly they would be living on their joint incomes.

     13. I appreciate that the  amounts  of  actual  payments  made  to  the
         Appellant following the  commencement  of  divorce  proceedings  as
         evidenced  are  small.   However,  he  was  self-employed   as   an
         interpreter/translator  and  therefore  amounts  received  do   not
         necessarily coincide with the dates when  services  were  provided.
         Moreover, he was  in  the  same  period  a  director  of  Privilege
         Security & Services Ltd which, although it made a trading  loss  in
         the year in question, had a  fairly  significant  turnover.   I  am
         therefore satisfied that he was economically active as if  he  were
         exercising Treaty rights in that period.




    Conclusions

     14. In light of the conclusions I have reached about what the  evidence
         shows on the narrow issues  which  remain  as  to  the  Appellant's
         ability to  meet  the  provisions  of  regulation  10  of  the  EEA
         Regulations  and  now  regulation  15,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant is entitled to permanent residence as the  former  spouse
         of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights who  has  retained  the
         right of residence following the dissolution of their marriage.  It
         follows that this appeal is allowed.




    DECISION

    The Appellant is entitled to a permanent  right  of  residence  as  the
    former family member of an EEA national exercising  Treaty  rights  who
    has retained his right of residence following the dissolution of  their
    marriage.

    The Appellant's appeal  is  for  that  reason  allowed  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS







    Background

      1. This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department.  For ease of reference, I refer below to the parties as
         they were in the First-tier Tribunal albeit that the  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department is technically the Appellant in  this
         particular appeal.  The Respondent appeals against  a  decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge M R Oliver promulgated on 11 October 2018
         ("the  Decision")  allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
         Respondent's  decision  dated  21  December   2017   refusing   the
         Appellant's  application  for  a  residence  card  confirming   his
         retained right of residence as the former spouse  of  a  Lithuanian
         national, Ms [RP].

      2. The Appellant came to the UK as a student  on  27  September  2006.
         Following his marriage to Ms [P], he was granted a  residence  card
         valid from 13 June 2012 to 13 June 2017.  His leave was revoked  by
         the Respondent on 16 November 2015 following a visit by immigration
         officials to his address on  9  April  2015  and  other  associated
         enquiries.  The Respondent concluded that the marriage was  one  of
         convenience.

      3. The Judge heard evidence from the  Appellant  and  other  witnesses
         (although not Ms [P] who has played no part  in  the  proceedings).
         He found that the marriage was one of convenience.  Based  on  that
         finding, and having considered Article 8 ECHR,  the  Judge  allowed
         the  appeal  under  the  Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

      4. The Respondent appealed on two grounds.   The  first  is  that  the
         Judge erroneously failed to consider whether  the  Appellant  meets
         the other provisions of the relevant regulation (regulation  10  of
         the EEA Regulations).  The second  is  that  the  Judge  failed  to
         address the second point taken in the Respondent's  refusal  letter
         that the Appellant  did  not  produce  the  original  of  Ms  [P]'s
         identity document and had not demonstrated circumstances beyond his
         control for failing to do so.  It is asserted  that  the  Appellant
         therefore fails to meet regulation 21 of the EEA Regulations.

      5. Permission was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lever  on  8
         November 2018 in the following terms so far as relevant:

             "...

             [3] The judge had set out the evidence in detail and had  then
             given somewhat  brief  findings  on  the  issue  of  the  sham
             marriage.  Leaving  aside  the  issue  of  adequacy  of  those
             matters  there  does  appear  to  be  some  confusion  in  the
             concluding paragraphs with reference to the Immigration  Rules
             and A8 neither of which were relevant in this case.  There was
             no reference to the issue of retained rights and those matters
             that were pertinent to that matter.  It is arguable  that  the
             judge misdirected himself in the concluding paragraphs of  his
             decision.

             [4] There was an arguable error of law."

      6. The matter comes  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  Decision
         contains a material error of law and if I so find, to  re-make  the
         decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.




    Submissions

      7. Mr Lindsay relied on the Respondent's grounds  and  the  Tribunal's
         decision in MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013]  UKUT  00641.
         He said that there were  no  or  inadequate  reasons  provided  for
         finding  that  the  Appellant  meets  regulation  10  of  the   EEA
         Regulations.  Although he accepted that the only  points  taken  by
         the Respondent in his decision letter and at the hearing relate  to
         the genuineness of  the  marriage  and  why  an  original  identity
         document could not be produced, he said  that  it  was  nonetheless
         incumbent on the Judge to consider whether the Appellant  otherwise
         met the relevant regulation.

      8. Mr Gajjar accepted that  the  Judge  should  not  have  taken  into
         account Article 8 ECHR, this being an appeal  only  under  the  EEA
         Regulations.  He submitted however that this  was  not  a  material
         error.  In relation to the Respondent's grounds, he said  that  the
         Appellant was entitled to know the case he had to  meet  and  since
         the  Respondent  had  not  taken  issue  with  whether  the   other
         requirements were met, there was no need for the Judge to go on  to
         consider the remainder of the regulation.  There was  no  issue  to
         determine.

      9. He also submitted that any error in this regard was immaterial.  He
         pointed to the date when divorce  proceedings  were  commenced  (28
         February 2017).  He took me to the  application  form  and  to  the
         evidence that Ms [P] was exercising Treaty rights at  all  relevant
         dates.  He referred to the covering letter to the application which
         enclosed six pay slips.  Mr Gajjar accepted  that  these  were  not
         before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, but he passed up what he said
         were those pay slips.  Those show  that  Ms  [P]  was  working  for
         Innovative Management Solutions Ltd from November 2016 to end March
         2017 (at least) which covered the relevant period.

     10. As to  the  Respondent's  second  ground,  Mr  Gajjar  directed  my
         attention to the Tribunal's decision in Barnett  (EEA  Regulations:
         Rights and Documentation) [2012] UKUT 00142 (IAC)  which  in  broad
         summary concludes that the Respondent cannot take issue with a non-
         EEA applicant's failure to produce his  sponsoring  EEA  national's
         original identity  document,  particularly  where,  as  here,  that
         document has been before the Respondent in relation to  an  earlier
         application.

     11.  Mr  Lindsay  accepted  that  the  case  of  Barnett  may   present
         difficulties  in  relation  to  the  Respondent's  second   ground.
         Although  he  did  not  have  the  file  relating  to  the  earlier
         application and could not  therefore  check  whether  the  original
         identity document was produced, he accepted that this was likely to
         be so given that the Respondent had issued the  residence  card  in
         response to that application.  He continued to rely  on  his  first
         ground, however.  He pointed out that, if the pay  slips  were  not
         before the First-tier Tribunal Judge at the earlier  hearing,  then
         if the Judge had gone  on  to  consider  the  other  provisions  of
         regulation 10 of the EEA Regulations as is the  Respondent's  case,
         the Judge could not have concluded that the Appellant satisfied the
         requirement to show that Ms [P] was working at that time.  Although
         he accepted that I could look at this evidence, he submitted that I
         could only find that an error was not  material  if  another  Judge
         could not conclude differently on the  evidence.   He  pointed  out
         that, since the  Respondent  has  concerns  about  the  Appellant's
         credibility, the Respondent may wish to verify the authenticity  of
         the pay slips (including to check whether  those  were  indeed  the
         ones which were with the application made to the Respondent).

     12. Mr Lindsay said that this is a case which should be remitted to the
         First-tier Tribunal for further findings in the event that I accept
         there is a material error of law.  Mr Gajjar was content  to  leave
         that matter to me.  In  the  event,  I  reserved  my  decision  and
         indicated that, if I were minded  to  retain  the  appeal  in  this
         Tribunal, I  would  give  directions  to  allow  both  parties  the
         opportunity to consider the evidence and file further  evidence  if
         necessary.




    Decision and Reasons

     13. As I have already  observed,  this  is  an  appeal  under  the  EEA
         Regulations.  Paragraph 1 of Schedule  2  to  the  EEA  Regulations
         provides that the right of appeal against "an EEA decision"  is  to
         be treated as if it  were  one  under  section  82(1)  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") and as if the sole
         permitted ground under section 84 of the 2002 Act  were  "that  the
         decision breaches the appellant's rights under the EU  Treaties  in
         respect of entry to or residence in  the  United  Kingdom."   As  I
         pointed out to Mr Gajjar in submissions, the burden of showing that
         he meets the provisions of the EEA Regulations is on the  Appellant
         and it is difficult to see how a Judge can find that an appellant's
         rights under EU law are  breached  unless  he  has  considered  the
         question whether they are met.  Given the focus of the Respondent's
         decision letter on the  genuineness  of  the  relationship,  it  is
         unsurprising that the Respondent did not  go  on  to  consider  the
         remaining provisions of regulation 10.

     14. The Judge's conclusions are at [15] to  [17]  of  the  Decision  as
         follows:

             "[15]     The onus is on the appellant in immigration  appeals
             to prove his or her case  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
             subject to the legal  principle  that  "he  who  asserts  must
             prove" which applies where the respondent asserts deception.

             [16]      When the human rights of an  appellant  fall  to  be
             considered under  the  system,  whereby  the  claim  is  first
             considered under appendix FM in respect  of  family  life  and
             paragraph 276ADE of the rules in respect of private  life  and
             only  where  the  appellant  does  not   meet   the   relevant
             requirements is  consideration  given  to  whether  there  are
             strong or compelling circumstances which outweigh  the  public
             interest in maintaining firm but fair  immigration  under  the
             Razgar tests, has  been  approved  by  the  higher  courts  (R
             (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11, MM (Lebanon)  v  SSHD  [2017]
             UKSC 10 & Britcits v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 368).

             [17]      It was submitted for the respondent that  there  was
             no reason not to accept the record [of] the visit, but it  has
             been disputed by the oral evidence of the  appellant  and  his
             witness.  Their evidence was tested in  cross-examination  and
             they gave  explanations  which  contained  criticisms  of  the
             officer's report.  The record, so far as it was quoted in  the
             part of the refusal letter that within the appellant's bundle,
             contained no mention of the  properties  [sic]  second  floor,
             which was confirmed in the house survey report.   The  refusal
             of the appellant's application was based firmly on  a  finding
             that [his] marriage to his ex-wife had been a sham and it was,
             therefore,  for  the  respondent  to   establish   that   fact
             (Papajorgji [EEA spouse  -  marriage  of  convenience)  Greece
             [2012] UKUT 38).  The respondent has  failed  to  do  so.   In
             these circumstances I find that the appeal succeeds."

     15.  The Judge's reference to Article 8 ECHR, whilst otiose,  does  not
         amount to a material error of law.  He did not allow the appeal  on
         that basis.  No doubt  for  that  reason  the  Respondent  did  not
         challenge that  paragraph  of  the  Decision.   Nor  is  there  any
         challenge to the Judge's finding, based on the evidence,  that  the
         Appellant's marriage is not a sham.  However, the Judge should have
         gone on following that finding to consider whether  the  provisions
         of regulation 10 of the EEA Regulations were met, in order to allow
         him  to  conclude  that  the  Respondent's  decision  breached  the
         Appellant's rights under EU law (for the reasons set  out  at  [13]
         above).  That is particularly so  since,  as  the  Judge  correctly
         directed himself, at [15] of the Decision, the burden lies  on  the
         Appellant to establish that he does meet those provisions.   Absent
         an express  concession  by  the  Respondent  that  he  meets  those
         provisions, the Appellant is required to demonstrate that he  does.
         This is not a case of the Appellant needing to know the case  which
         he has to meet as Mr Gajjar submitted, but rather the onus  on  the
         Appellant to meet his own burden of proof.  For those reasons, I am
         satisfied  that  the  Judge  did  make  an  error  of  law  in  his
         conclusions by failing to  consider  the  remaining  provisions  of
         regulation 10.

     16. I turn to consider the materiality of that error.  Regulation 10(5)
         of the EEA Regulations provides as follows:

             "Family member who has retained the right of residence

             10. -     (1)  In these Regulations, "family  member  who  has
                  retained  the  right  of  residence"  means,  subject   to
                  paragraphs (8) and (9), a person who satisfies a condition
                  in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

                  ...

                  (5)  The condition in this paragraph is  that  the  person
                  ("A")-

                      (a)   ceased to be a family  member  of  a  qualified
                      person or an EEA national with a right  of  permanent
                      residence on the termination of the marriage or civil
                      partnership of A;

                      (b)    was  residing  in  the   United   Kingdom   in
                      accordance with these Regulations at the date of  the
                      termination;

                      (c)   satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

                      (d)   either-

                           (i)      prior   to   the   initiation   of   the
                           proceedings for the termination of  the  marriage
                           or the civil partnership, the marriage  or  civil
                           partnership had lasted for at least  three  years
                           and  the  parties  to  the  marriage   or   civil
                           partnership had resided in the United Kingdom for
                           at least one year during its duration;

                           ...

                  (6)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

                      (a)   is not an EEA national but would, if the person
                      were an EEA national, be a  worker,  a  self-employed
                      person or a self-sufficient person  under  regulation
                      6;

                      ...

                  (8)  A person  ("P")  does  not  satisfy  a  condition  in
                  paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5) if, at  the  first  time  P
                  would otherwise have satisfied the relevant  condition,  P
                  had a right of permanent residence under regulation 15.

                  (9)  A  family  member  who  has  retained  the  right  of
                  residence ceases to enjoy that status on acquiring a right
                  of permanent residence under regulation 15."

     17. In light of the unchallenged finding about the genuineness  of  the
         relationship  and  the  respective  dates  of  the   marriage   and
         commencement of divorce proceedings, it is difficult to see  how  a
         Judge could decide other than in the Appellant's favour in relation
         to regulation 10(5)(a) and (d) of the EEA  Regulations.   The  more
         difficult question is whether Ms [P] was exercising  Treaty  rights
         at the relevant date (when the divorce proceedings were begun)  and
         whether the Appellant meets regulation 10(6).  In relation  to  the
         latter,  there  is  substantial  documentation  relating   to   the
         Appellant's own earnings covering the period from 16 May 2013 to 20
         July 2018.  Given the lack of findings  made  in  relation  to  the
         level of those earnings and any gaps in the period  by  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge, and that I did not receive  submissions  about
         this evidence, I do not propose to make  any  findings  about  what
         that evidence shows at this stage.

     18. As I pointed out to Mr Gajjar, the more difficult  question  is  Ms
         [P]'s exercise of Treaty rights.  There is much  less  evidence  in
         that regard covering, at best, the period from 2 June  2014  to  29
         December 2016.  However, as I have already noted at  [9]  above,  I
         was shown pay slips which it is said are the six pay slips referred
         to  in  the  covering  letter  to  the  application  made  to   the
         Respondent.  Leaving aside that the copies I was given are of  only
         four pay slips in number, I have no  way  of  knowing  if  that  is
         right.  It also cannot be said that the error of law  made  by  the
         Judge is immaterial because if the Judge had gone  on  to  consider
         the appeal on the evidence which was before him as I have concluded
         he should, this would not have included evidence that  Ms  [P]  was
         exercising Treaty rights in the UK as  at  28  February  2017  when
         divorce proceedings were begun.

     19. For that reason, I conclude that the error of law  in  relation  to
         ground one is material and  I  set  aside  the  Decision  for  that
         reason.  I do not need to go on to consider  whether  there  is  an
         error of law disclosed by ground two.   I  can  well  see  why  the
         Appellant may find it difficult to produce the original of his  ex-
         wife's  identity  document  following  the  termination  of   their
         marriage (unless the breakdown is particularly amicable).  For  all
         I know, she may no longer be in the UK.  That may well  be  a  very
         good reason why he is unable to produce  it  even  if  there  is  a
         requirement that he do so.   It  will  be  for  the  Respondent  to
         consider whether to maintain the refusal for  that  reason  and  to
         explain, in particular, why the production of the identity document
         at the time the earlier application was made (if it  was  produced)
         is insufficient to establish her identity and nationality.

     20. As I have already observed, there has  been  no  challenge  to  the
         Decision concluding that the Appellant's marriage was not  a  sham.
         I preserve the finding made to that effect at [17] of the Decision.

     21. I have carefully considered whether it is appropriate to remit this
         appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for re-making of the decision.  I
         have concluded that this is not necessary in this case.  The issues
         which remain in  relation  to  whether  regulation  10  is  met  as
         identified at [17] and [18] above are likely to turn on documentary
         evidence.  That evidence can be examined by a  further  hearing  in
         this Tribunal following, if necessary, the filing  of  any  further
         evidence on those issues and submissions by the parties as to  that
         evidence.   It  will  be  open  to  the  Respondent  to  check  the
         additional documents handed up at the hearing together  with  those
         produced with the application and any additional evidence which the
         Appellant files and serves in response to the directions.

     22. For the  foregoing  reasons,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Decision
         discloses a material error of law and I set aside the Decision.   I
         preserve [17] of the Decision  with  the  exception  of  the  final
         sentence of that paragraph.  I have given directions below for  the
         filing and service of  further  evidence  and  written  submissions
         prior to the next hearing.







    DECISION

    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error  of  law.  I
    set aside  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  R  Oliver
    promulgated on 11 October 2018.  I make the  following  directions  for
    the re-making of the decision:




    DIRECTIONS

      1. Within four weeks from the date when this decision is  promulgated,
         the parties shall file with the Tribunal and  serve  on  the  other
         party any further evidence on which they rely.  In particular,  the
         Tribunal would be  assisted  by  a  copy  of  all  documents  which
         accompanied the Appellant's application made on 1 June 2017 and, if
         the Respondent continues to rely on the  absence  of  the  original
         identity document of Ms [P], a copy of the application which led to
         the issue of the residence card valid from 13 June 2012 to 13  June
         2017 or  other  evidence  showing  whether  her  original  identity
         document was sent to the Respondent on that occasion.

      2. Within six weeks from the date when this decision  is  promulgated,
         the parties shall file with the Tribunal and  serve  on  the  other
         party written submissions outlining the issues which they  consider
         remain for determination and referring to any  case  law  on  which
         they rely (and producing those case law authorities).

      3. The appeal will be relisted for a hearing to re-make  the  decision
         on the first available  date  after  eight  weeks  from  when  this
         decision is promulgated.  Time estimate � day.
