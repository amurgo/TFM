Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Unrepresented


This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to face hearing was
not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be determined
in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and neither
party expressed any concern, with the process.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State. However, I will refer  to
      the parties as they were designated in the First-tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of St. Lucia, born in July  1997,  who  has
      been in the UK since 2005 (when  he  was  eight  years  old).  He  was
      granted indefinite leave to remain in February 2008.

   3. He has a partner and son (born in May 2017) who are British nationals.
      He does not live with them but is involved,  and  has  a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship, with  his  son.  The  appellant  was
      diagnosed with autism at the age of 18.

   4. In November 2014 the appellant received a youth conditional order  for
      assaulting his sister.

   5. Since 2016 the appellant has been convicted of multiple  offences.  In
      January 2019 he was sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment. The  summary
      of his offending history given  by  the  respondent  consists  of  the
      following:

        a. On 1 September 2016 he was convicted of possession  of  cannabis
           and aggravated vehicle taking, for which he received a suspended
           sentence.


        b. On 30 November 2016 he was convicted of failing to  comply  with
           the suspended sentence order.

        c. On 13  November  2017  he  was  convicted  of  three  counts  of
           burglary, dangerous driving and driving whilst disqualified.

        d. On 22 January 2018 he was convicted of failing to stop a vehicle
           when required.

        e.  On  19  March  2018  he  was  convicted  of   two   counts   of
           possession/control of articles for use in fraud,  for  which  he
           served one day in custody.

        f. On 31  October  2018  the  appellant  was  verbally  abusive  to
           immigration officials.


        g. On 14 December 2018 he was convicted  of  conspiracy  to  commit
           burglary.


        h. On 7 January 2019 he was sentenced for  the  convictions  of  13
           November 2017 and 14 December 2018 to 42 months' imprisonment.

   6. On 16 January 2019 the respondent served on the appellant  a  decision
      to make a deportation order against him pursuant to section  32(5)  of
      the UK Borders Act, subject to  consideration  of  section  33  (which
      provides that there is an exception  to  section  32(5),  inter  alia,
      where deportation would breach a person's rights under the ECHR).  The
      appellant made a human rights claim arguing that his deportation would
      be contrary to article 8 ECHR. His human rights claim was  refused  by
      the respondent in a decision dated 8 October 2019.

   7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  where  his  appeal
      came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Behan ("the judge"). In a
      decision promulgated on 16 March 2020, the judge allowed  the  appeal.
      The respondent is now appealing against that decision.

Legal Framework

   8. Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the
      2002 Act"), considered together with the rest of Part 5A of the 2002
      Act, provides the framework to evaluate whether deporting a foreign
      criminal will breach article 8 ECHR.


   9. Section 117C provides:

         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
         (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.
         (4)  Exception 1 applies where- (a) C has been lawfully resident in
         the United Kingdom for most of C's life, (b) C is socially and
         culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and (c) there would be
         very significant obstacles to C's integration into the country to
         which C is proposed to be deported.
         (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.

  10. The relationship between the Exceptions in sections 117C(4) and (5)
      and section 117C(6) was explained succinctly in paragraph 36 of NA
      (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Ors [2016]
      EWCA Civ 662 (cited with approval in paragraph 30 of HA (Iraq) v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 1176):


         "In relation to a medium offender, first see whether he falls
         within Exception 1 or Exception 2. If he does, then the Article 8
         claim succeeds. If he does not, then the next stage is to consider
         whether there are 'sufficiently compelling circumstances, over and
         above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2'. If there are, then
         the Article 8 claim succeeds. If there are not, then the Article 8
         claim fails."


  11. The reference in NA to a "medium offender" is to a foreign criminal,
      as defined in section 117D of the 2002 Act, who has been sentenced to
      less than four years imprisonment. The appellant is a medium offender.


Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

  12. The judge found the appellant to be a truthful witness  but  with  one
      exception, which was that he had not been honest about  his  continued
      use of cannabis since leaving prison.

  13. The judge considered whether Exception 2 in Section  117C(5)  applied.
      She found that although the appellant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with a qualifying partner and a  genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship with a qualifying child,  Exception  2  was  not
      applicable as the effect of the appellant's deportation would  not  be
      unduly harsh on either his partner or child.

  14. The judge then turned to consider  Exception  1  in  Section  117C(4).
      There are three conditions that must be met for this Exception  to  be
      satisfied. These are:  (a)  the  appellant  must  have  been  lawfully
      resident in the UK for most of his life, (b) he must be  socially  and
      culturally  integrated  in  the  UK,  and  (c)   there  must  be  very
      significant obstacles to his integration in St Lucia. It was  accepted
      by the respondent that the appellant has been lawfully resident in the
      UK for most of his life. Therefore, it was only the second  and  third
      conditions that were in dispute.

  15. The judge's assessment of the second condition  (social  and  cultural
      integration in the UK) is brief. It is set out in paragraph 41 of  the
      decision, where the judge stated:


           "The respondent concluded [that] the appellant is  not  socially
           and culturally integrated  in  the  UK.  I  do  not  think  this
           conclusion is correct.  The  appellant  committed  very  serious
           offences but he has lived in the UK since he was eight, he  went
           to school and college in the UK, he has worked,  has  family  in
           the UK and has been attending and doing what he characterises as
           voluntary work, at a youth club. Without doubt he has  conducted
           himself in an anti-social way but that  does  not,  in  my  view
           negate the effect of years of socialisation in the UK."

  16. The judge's assessment of third condition (very significant  obstacles
      to integration in St Lucia) is more  comprehensive.  The  judge  found
      that this condition was met for the following reasons:

        a. It was unlikely the appellant would have connections in St Lucia
           who would help him establish himself.

        b. He does not have qualifications or skills that will be of  great
           assistance in St Lucia.

        c. Due to his mild  autism  he  struggles  with  communication  and
           social  interaction,  and  this  will  be   an   impediment   to
           integration in St Lucia.

  17. The judge allowed the appeal on  the  basis  that  the  conditions  of
      Exception 2 in Section 117C(5) were met.


Grounds of Appeal and Submissions


  18. The respondent argues that the judge erred in her  assessment  of  (a)
      whether the appellant was socially and culturally  integrated  in  the
      United Kingdom, and  (b)  whether there  would  be  very  significant
      obstacles to his integration into St Lucia.

  19. With respect to social and cultural  integration,  the  grounds  argue
      that the judge erred in the following ways:

        a. First,  it  is  argued  that  the  judge  failed  to  take  into
           consideration that the appellant lied  about  continued  use  of
           cannabis. It is asserted that this lie, and his continued use of
           cannabis, demonstrates a continuing disrespect for the law.


        b. Second, it is submitted that the judge erred by failing to  take
           into account the history of the  appellant's  convictions  since
           2016 which, it is argued, show a break in the continuity of  his
           integration.

        c. Third, it is contended that the judge erroneously failed to take
           into  consideration  the  judge's  sentencing   remarks,   which
           highlight the harm the appellant caused.

  20. In  written  submissions,  the  respondent  argued  that  the  judge's
      approach was inconsistent with two recent Court of Appeal authorities:
      Binbuga (Turkey) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]
      EWCA Civ 551 and CI (Nigeria) v The Secretary of State for  the  Home
      Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2027. It is  submitted  that,  contrary  to
      these authorities, the judge (a) failed  to  recognise  that  criminal
      conduct is capable of causing discontinuity to  integration;  (b)  did
      not give consideration to the appellant's history  of  offending;  and
      (c) did not consider the facts of the appellant's offending.

  21. Mr Jarvis, in his oral submissions, reiterated the points made in  the
      respondent's written submissions. He  made  the  overarching  argument
      that the judge appears, at paragraph 41 of the decision, to  have  set
      to one side, and not take into consideration,  the  appellant's  anti-
      social and criminal conduct.

  22. With  respect  to  the  judge's  finding  that  there  would  be  very
      significant obstacles to integration  in  St  Lucia,  the  grounds  of
      appeal  argue  that  the  judge  erroneously  diluted  the  very  high
      threshold and failed to appreciate that the question  of  whether  the
      appellant has the ability to form an adequate private life  is  to  be
      measured by the  standards  of  the  country  of  return,  not  by  UK
      standards. It is also argued that the judge  failed  to  consider  the
      appellant's relationship with his son when evaluating his  ability  to
      form relationships. A further submission in the grounds  is  that  the
      appellant's autism, and absence  of  family,  would  not  prevent  him
      seeking employment and establishing a private life in St. Lucia.

  23. At the hearing Mr Jarvis advanced an argument that was also set out in
      the respondent's written submissions, which is that the  judge  failed
      to give consideration to the feasibility  of  the  appellant's  family
      assisting and  supporting  him,  either  directly  or  remotely,  with
      integration into society in St. Lucia.

  24. The appellant, who was not represented, did not address  directly  the
      legal arguments advanced  by  the  respondent.  He  did,  however,  in
      response  to  questions  I  asked  him,  state  that  he  had  studied
      bricklaying at college and, since leaving prison,  was  spending  more
      time with his son. He also stated that his family in  the  UK  do  not
      have any money and therefore would not be able to  assist  him  in  St
      Lucia. He added that there is no one who will be able to help  him  in
      St Lucia. He emphasised that he knew he had done wrong and  was  sorry
      for the crimes he had committed.

Analysis

Social and cultural integration in the UK

  25. In Binbuga (Turkey) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2019] EWCA Civ 551 at [56] - [57], the Court of Appeal stated:
        1. Membership of a pro-criminal gang tells against rather than for
           social integration. In this context, social integration refers
           to the extent to which a foreign criminal has become
           incorporated within the lawful social structure of the UK. This
           includes various incidents of society such as clubs, societies,
           workplaces or places of study, but not association with pro-
           criminal peers.
        1. Similarly, cultural integration refers to the acceptance and
           assumption by the foreign criminal of the culture of the UK, its
           core values, ideas, customs and social behaviour. This includes
           acceptance of the principle of the rule of law. Membership of a
           pro-criminal gang shows a lack of such acceptance. It
           demonstrates disdain for the rule of law and indeed undermines
           it.
  26. In CI (Nigeria) v The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2019] EWCA Civ 2027 "social and cultural integration"  was  explained
      as follows:
           The nature and formation of private life
        1. In assessing whether a "foreign criminal" is "socially and
           culturally integrated in the UK", it is important to keep in
           mind that the rationale behind the test is to determine whether
           the person concerned has established a private life in the UK
           which has a substantial claim to protection under article 8. The
           test should therefore be interpreted and applied having regard
           to the interests protected by the concept of "private life". The
           nature and scope of the concept was explained by the Grand
           Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in �ner v The
           Netherlands (2006) 45 EHRR 14, para 59, when it observed that:
                 "... not all [settled] migrants, no matter how long they
                 have been residing in the country from which they are to be
                 expelled, ne all cessarily enjoy 'family life' there within
                 the meaning of article 8. However, as article 8 also
                 protects the right to establish and develop relationships
                 with other human beings and the outside world and can
                 sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's social
                 identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social
                 ties between settled migrants and the community in which
                 they are living constitute part of the concept of 'private
                 life' within the meaning of article 8." (citations omitted)
        1. Relevant social ties obviously include relationships with
           friends and relatives, as well as ties formed through employment
           or other paid or unpaid work or through participation in
           communal activities. However, a person's social identity is not
           defined solely by such particular relationships but is
           constituted at a deep level by familiarity with and
           participation in the shared customs, traditions, practices,
           beliefs, values, linguistic idioms and other local knowledge
           which situate a person in a society or social group and generate
           a sense of belonging. The importance of upbringing and education
           in the formation of a person's social identity is well
           recognised, and its importance in the context of cases involving
           the article 8 rights of persons facing expulsion because of
           criminal offending has been recognised by the European Court.
           Thus, in the �ner case at para 58, the court considered it "self-
           evident" that, in assessing the strength of a foreign national's
           ties with the "host" country in which they are living, regard is
           to be had to "the special situation of aliens who have spent
           most, if not all, of their childhood in the host country, were
           brought up there and received their education there."
        1. The European Court returned to this theme in Maslov, stating (at
           para 73) that:
                 "... when assessing the length of the applicant's stay in
                 the country from which he or she is to be expelled and the
                 solidity of the social, cultural and family ties with the
                 host country, it evidently makes a difference whether the
                 person concerned had already come to the country during his
                 or her childhood or youth, or was even born there, or
                 whether he or she only came as an adult."
           Relevance of offending and imprisonment
        1. What then in principle is the relevance to the assessment of the
           offences committed by a "foreign criminal" and the period(s) of
           imprisonment to which he or she has been sentenced? In the first
           place, it is clear that the person facing deportation cannot
           place positive reliance on associations with criminals or pro-
           criminal groups to demonstrate social and cultural integration.
           Thus, in Binbuga v Secretary of State for the Home
           Department [2019] EWCA Civ 551, paras 49-60, the Court of Appeal
           held that it was an error of law to regard the appellant's
           involvement in gang culture as a good example of his integration
           into life in the UK, for the reason that social and cultural
           integration in the UK connotes integration as a law-abiding
           citizen.
        1. Criminal offending and time spent in prison are also in
           principle relevant in so far as they indicate that the person
           concerned lacks (legitimate) social and cultural ties in the UK.
           Thus, a person who leads a criminal lifestyle, has no lawful
           employment and consorts with criminals or pro-criminal groups
           can be expected, by reason of those circumstances, to have fewer
           social relationships and areas of activity that are capable of
           attracting the protection of "private life". Periods of
           imprisonment represent time spent excluded from society during
           which the prisoner has little opportunity to develop social and
           cultural ties and which may weaken or sever previously
           established ties and make it harder to re-establish them or
           develop new ties (for example, by finding employment) upon
           release. In such ways criminal offending and consequent
           imprisonment may affect whether a person is socially and
           culturally integrated in the UK.
        1. Clearly, however, the impact of offending and imprisonment upon
           a person's integration in this country will depend not only on
           the nature and frequency of the offending, the length of time
           over which it takes place and the length of time spent in
           prison, but also on whether and how deeply the individual was
           socially and culturally integrated in the UK to begin with. In
           that regard, a person who has lived all or almost all his life
           in the UK, has been educated here, speaks no language other than
           (British) English and has no familiarity with any other society
           or culture will start with much deeper roots in this country
           than someone who has moved here at a later age. It is hard to
           see how criminal offending and imprisonment could ordinarily, by
           themselves and unless associated with the breakdown of
           relationships, destroy the social and cultural integration of
           someone whose entire social identity has been formed in the UK.
           No doubt it is for this reason that the current guidance
           ("Criminality: Article 8 ECHR cases") that Home Office staff are
           required to use in deciding whether the deportation of a foreign
           criminal would breach article 8 advises that:
                 "If the person has been resident in the UK from a very
                 early age it is unlikely that offending alone would mean a
                 person is not socially and culturally integrated."

  27. I am satisfied that the judge's assessment  at  paragraph  41  of  the
      decision as to  whether  the  appellant  is  socially  and  culturally
      integrated in the UK is adequate. I  reach  this  conclusion  for  the
      following reasons.

  28. First, the judge did not ignore the appellant's  criminal  history  or
      treat it as immaterial, as the judge explicitly stated in paragraph 41
      that the appellant committed very serious offences and  has  conducted
      himself in an anti-social way.

  29. Second, the fact that the  judge  did  not  set  out  the  appellant's
      criminal history or specifically refer to the  offences  committed  in
      2016 does not mean these were overlooked, or that  she  did  not  take
      account of the nature and  seriousness  of  the  offences.  The  judge
      referred to serious offences, not to a serious offence, and  there  is
      nothing in the decision to indicate that the judge  was  unaware  that
      the appellant committed offences in 2016  as  well  as  in  subsequent
      years.

  30. Third, it was not necessary for the judge to refer to  the  sentencing
      remarks. Those remarks show that the offence was serious. Plainly, the
      judge appreciated the seriousness of the appellant's offending because
      in paragraph 41 she stated that  the  appellant  had  committed  "very
      serious offences".

  31. Fourth, the fact that the appellant continues to use cannabis and  was
      dishonest about this was not  overlooked  by  the  judge,  as  it  was
      explicitly mentioned in her findings.

  32. Fifth (and most significantly), it is clear from  considering  Binbuga
      and CI that the judge focused on the correct issues and approached the
      question  of  whether  the  appellant  is  socially   and   culturally
      integrated consistently with those authorities. As is  made  plain  in
      Binbuga  and  CI,   although   criminal   offending   and   consequent
      imprisonment can affect whether a person is  socially  and  culturally
      integrated in the UK, the central question for the judge  to  ask  was
      not how many crimes the appellant had committed or  how  serious  they
      were, but rather how deeply he is socially and  culturally  integrated
      into law abiding UK society despite his criminal conduct. This entails
      consideration being given to his  education,  employment,  friendships
      and family relationships, as well  as  to  his  familiarity  with  and
      participation in the culture, traditions and norms of UK society.  See
      Binbuga at [56] and CI at [58]. See also  CI  at  [62],  where  it  is
      stated:

           [A] person who has lived all or almost all his life in  the  UK,
           has been educated here, speaks no language other than  (British)
           English and has no familiarity with any other society or culture
           will start with much deeper roots in this country  than  someone
           who has moved here at a  later  age.  It  is  hard  to  see  how
           criminal  offending  and  imprisonment  could   ordinarily,   by
           themselves  and  unless  associated  with   the   breakdown   of
           relationships, destroy the social and  cultural  integration  of
           someone whose entire social identity has been formed in the UK.


  33. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal is that the appellant  has
      lived the vast majority  of  his  life  in  the  UK,  attended  school
      (including a pupil referral unit)  in  the  UK,  has  undertaken  some
      employment training in the UK (in bricklaying),  and  has  formed  his
      social and cultural identity in the UK. The evidence also  shows  that
      he has relationships with law abiding British citizens which have been
      maintained despite his imprisonment  and  despite  his  autism  which,
      according to the report of clinical psychologist Dr  McNicholas  dated
      17 November 2015 (that was before the First-tier Tribunal), causes him
      to  struggle  with  personal  responsibility,   independence,   social
      relationships and managing emotions. This is  not  a  case  where  the
      appellant relies on relationships with criminals (or  criminal  gangs)
      or time  spent  in  prison  to  establish  that  he  is  socially  and
      culturally integrated: rather, his  social  and  cultural  integration
      arises from legitimate activity in the UK  (primarily  education)  and
      relationships with law abiding British citizens.

  34. For these reasons, I am satisfied that it was open to the  judge,  for
      the reasons she gave in paragraph 41 of her decision, to find that the
      appellant is socially and culturally integrated in the UK.

Very significant obstacles to integration in St Lucia

  35. The meaning of  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  is  not
      defined in the 2002 Act. A clear explanation of how integration should
      be understood, however, was given by  Sales  LJ  in  paragraph  14  of
      Kamara v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
      813 (cited with approval in paragraph 58 of Akinyemi v  The  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2098). He stated:

           "The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment
           to be made as to whether the individual will be enough of an
           insider in terms of understanding how life in the society in
           that other country is carried on and a capacity to participate
           in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted
           there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that
           society and to build up within a reasonable time a variety of
           human relationships to give substance to the individual's
           private or family life."


  36. In Parveen v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]
      EWCA Civ 932 at paragraph 9 the Court of Appeal commented on what is
      meant by "very significant". It is stated:



           "It is fair enough to observe that the words "very significant"
           connote an "elevated" threshold, and I have no difficulty with
           the observation that the test will not be met by "mere
           inconvenience or upheaval". But I am not sure that saying that
           "mere" hardship or difficulty or hurdles, even if multiplied,
           will not "generally" suffice adds anything of substance. The
           task of the Secretary of State, or the Tribunal, in any given
           case is simply to assess the obstacles to integration relied on,
           whether characterised as hardship or difficulty or anything
           else, and to decide whether they regard them as 'very
           significant'"

  37. The judge correctly identified that the test to apply was whether  the
      appellant would face very  significant  obstacles  integrating  in  St
      Lucia. She directed herself to the guidance given in paragraph  14  of
      Kamara and the focus of her assessment was  on  the  difficulties  the
      appellant would face fitting into, and functioning effectively within,
      society in St Lucia. There is therefore no  merit  to  the  contention
      made in the grounds that the judge  applied  the  wrong  threshold  or
      assessed  the  challenges  to  integration  with  reference   to   "UK
      standards".

  38. Nor is there merit to the argument that the judge failed  to  consider
      the appellant's relationship with his son when assessing his  capacity
      to effectively integrate and form relationships in St Lucia.  This  is
      because the fact that the appellant has a good relationship  with  his
      son, who may also be autistic (see paragraph 33 of the  decision),  is
      immaterial to the relevant issue, which is his capability to establish
      and maintain relationships with adults who are not family members  and
      who he has not known previously. On this issue, the judge was entitled
      to rely on the evidence before him, in particular  the  report  of  Dr
      McNicholas,  which  indicated  that  the  appellant  has   significant
      difficulties with social interaction and building relationships.

  39. The respondent argues that the judge failed to  consider  the  support
      that the appellant's family could provide from the UK. The  difficulty
      with this argument is that the judge found that one of the key reasons
      the appellant would face obstacles integrating in  St  Lucia  is  that
      because of his autism he has  problems  with  social  interaction  and
      building relationships. This being the case, even if his family in the
      UK were able to send him some funds  and  visit  him  regularly,  that
      would not change the appellant's difficulty  with  social  interaction
      and building relationships in a society where he  has  no  connections
      and no one he can turn to for practical day to day support. Nor  would
      the assistance of his family in  the  UK  be  likely  to  improve  his
      prospects  of  finding  employment,  given  that   they,   too,   lack
      connections in St Lucia. For these reasons, it was not  necessary  for
      the judge to consider support from family in the UK as this was not  a
      material consideration. In any event, I am in no doubt  that  even  if
      the judge had considered support from the UK, this would not - for the
      reasons given above - have  changed  her  conclusion  on  whether  the
      appellant  would  face  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration.
      Therefore, if the judge did err by failing to consider family  support
      from the UK (which I do not accept) the error was not material.


Decision

  40. The Secretary of State's appeal is  dismissed.  The  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal stands.
