                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 22 May 1972.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 8 October 2006 with entry clearance as  a
    student valid until 31  October  2007.   That  leave  was  subsequently
    extended as a student, as a Tier 1 dependent partner, as a Tier 1 (Post-
    Study) Migrant and as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 25  April  2016.
    On 22 April 2016, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to  remain
    (ILR) as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant which was refused  on  14  December
    2018.  On 26 December 2018, the appellant applied for an Administrative
    Review but that was withdrawn on 12 January  2019  when  the  appellant
    made a human rights application seeking ILR on the basis of ten  years'
    continuous  lawful  residence  in  the  UK  under  para  276B  of   the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. On 16 October 2019, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application under para 276B and Art 8 of the ECHR.  In relation to para
    276B, the Secretary of State concluded  that  the  appellant  had  been
    dishonest in the levels of income he had claimed in his application for
    leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant in 2016 in relation to the tax year
    2012/2013 and in his declared income to the HMRC for that tax year.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   His  appeal  was
    heard on 9 January 2020 by Judge J Hillis.   The  appellant  gave  oral
    evidence before the judge and sought to explain the discrepancy in  his
    declared income to the Home Office  and  the  HMRC  for  the  tax  year
    2012/2013.  He sought to explain the omission of ï¿½43,454 of  undeclared
    income to the HMRC which he had only declared to the HMRC in June  2016
    following his application for ILR as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.

 4. Judge Hillis did not accept the appellant's explanation and that he had
    been honest in his declarations to the Home  Office  and  HMRC.   Judge
    Hillis concluded that para 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules  applied,
    which set  out  a  general  ground  of  refusal,  where  there  was  am
    "undesirability" of permitting  an  individual  to  remain  in  the  UK
    because of his cduct, character or  associations.   As  a  result,  the
    appellant could not succeed under  para  276B  because,  applying  para
    276B(iii), a ground of refusal under the general  grounds  for  refusal
    applied.  Further, the judge found that the appellant's  removal  would
    not breach Art 8, in particular the  judge  did  not  accept  that  the
    appellant had a continuing relationship with his children.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal but, on  26
    June 2020,  the  Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ  Reeds)  granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal only on the ground challenging the judge's finding
    under para 322(5).  The judge refused permission on  grounds  2  and  3
    which challenged the judge's application of Art 8.

 6. In granting permission, UTJ Reeds also made directions in the light  of
    the COVID-19 crisis.  She expressed the provisional view that it  would
    be appropriate to  determine  the  issues  of  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law and whether, if it did, the  decision  should  be
    set aside without a hearing.  The directions invited  submissions  from
    the parties both on the substantive issues and on whether the error  of
    law could be determined without a hearing.

 7. In response, the appellant filed submissions  (together  with  evidence
    not apparently available before the First-tier Tribunal) on 2 September
    2020.  Those submissions  raised  no  objection  to  the  appeal  being
    determined, at the error of law stage, without a hearing.  The grounds,
    instead, focused exclusively  upon  the  substantive  issue  under  the
    ground upon which UTJ Reeds had granted  permission.   The  submissions
    also  invited  the  UT  to  consider  the  other  grounds  of   appeal,
    challenging Art 8, upon which permission was refused.

 8. The respondent did not file a rule 24 reply or submissions in  response
    to UTJ Reeds' directions.

 9. In the absence of any objection from either party, and having regard to
    the interests of justice and the overriding  objective  of  determining
    the appeal justly and fairly and the nature of the legal issues raised,
    I am satisfied that it is appropriate to determine this appeal  without
    a hearing under rule 34 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) and para 4 of the Amended  General
    Pilot Practice Directions: Contingency Arrangements in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal (14 September 2020)  issued  by  (then)
    Senior Vice President and (now) Senior President of Tribunals, the  Rt.
    Hon. Sir Keith Lindblom.

The Law

10. The appellant's application for ILR was made under  para  276B  on  the
    basis of ten years' lawful continuous residence.  So far  as  relevant,
    para 276B provides as follows:

         "276B    The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite
                leave to remain on the ground of long residence in the
                United Kingdom are that:

                (i)    (a)  he has had at least 10 years' continuous lawful
                    residence in the United Kingdom.

                (ii)   Having regard to the public interest there are no
                    reasons why it would be undesirable for him to be given
                    indefinite leave to remain on the ground of long
                    residence, taking into account his:

                    (a)    age; and

                    (b)    strength of connections in the United Kingdom;
                        and

                    (c)    personal history, including character, conduct,
                        associations and employment record; and

                    (d)    domestic circumstances; and

                    (e)    compassionate circumstances; and

                    (f)    any representations received on the person's
                        behalf; and

                (iii)  the applicant does not fall for refusal under the
                    general grounds for refusal.

                    .... ."

    As regards the general grounds of refusal, the  relevant  provision  is
    para 322(5) which provides:

         "322(5)  the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to
                remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct
                (including convictions which do not fall within paragraph
                322(1C)), character or associations ....;"

11. That general ground of refusal is  a  ground  on  which  leave  "should
    normally be refused", consequently it is a  discretionary  rather  than
    mandatory ground of refusal.

12. In Balajigari and Others v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673,  the  Court  of
    Appeal accepted that there were two-stages in applying  para  322(5)  -
    "undesirability" and "discretion".  At [33], Underhill LJ  (giving  the
    judgment of the Court) said this:

         "33. ... Mr Biggs submitted that, properly  interpreted,  paragraph
         322 (5) involves a two-stage analysis. The first stage is to decide
         whether paragraph 322 (5) applies at all -  that  is,  that  it  is
         "undesirable" to grant leave in the light of the specified matters.
         If it does, the second stage  -  since  such  undesirability  is  a
         presumptive rather than mandatory ground of refusal - is to  decide
         as a matter of discretion whether leave should be  refused  on  the
         basis of it. That analysis seems to us correct in principle."

13. The Court of Appeal identified that in relation to the  first  stage  -
    "undesirability" - there were three limbs.  At [34], Underhill LJ said:

         "34. As to the first stage, Mr Biggs submitted that there are three
         limbs to the analysis. There must be: (i) reliable evidence of (ii)
         sufficiently reprehensible conduct; and (iii) an assessment, taking
         proper account  of  all  relevant  circumstances  known  about  the
         applicant at the date of decision, of whether his or  her  presence
         in the UK is undesirable (this should include evidence of  positive
         features of their character). Again, that seems to us a correct and
         helpful analysis of the exercise required at the first  stage,  but
         it will be useful to say something more about the elements  in  it,
         especially as they apply to an earnings discrepancy case."

14. As regards limb (ii), at least in a "earnings discrepancy" case such as
    this appeal, the Court in  Balajigari  recognised  the  need  to  prove
    "dishonesty" by the individual (at [35]-[37]).  At [35],  Underhill  LJ
    said:

         "35. ...Mr Biggs' position was that an  earnings  discrepancy  case
         could constitute sufficiently reprehensible conduct for the purpose
         of paragraph 322 (5) if but only if the discrepancy was the  result
         of dishonesty on the part of the applicant. That was  not  disputed
         on behalf of the Secretary of State, and in our view it is correct.
         The provision of inaccurate earnings figures either to HMRC  or  to
         the Home Office in support of an application for leave  under  Part
         6A as a result of mere carelessness or  ignorance  or  poor  advice
         cannot  constitute  conduct  rendering  it  undesirable   for   the
         applicant to remain in  the  UK.  Errors  so  caused  are,  however
         regrettable, "genuine" or "innocent" in the  sense  that  they  are
         honest, and do not meet the necessary threshold."

15. At [37], Underhill LJ added the following in respect of requirement for
    'dishonesty' when applying para 322(5):

         "37. We should make three other  points  about  dishonesty  in  the
         context of an earnings discrepancy case:

             (1)  We were referred to the recent decision  of  the  Supreme
             Court in Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd [2017]  UKSC,  [2018]
             AC 391, considering the correct approach to  what  constitutes
             dishonesty. The principles summarised by Lord Hughes at  para.
             74 of his judgment in that case will apply  in  this  context,
             but we cannot think that in practice either the  Secretary  of
             State or a tribunal will need specifically to refer to them.

             (2)  Mr Biggs submitted that even dishonest conduct may not be
             sufficiently reprehensible to justify use of paragraph 322 (5)
             in all cases and that it would depend  on  the  circumstances,
             the  guiding  principle   being   that   the   threshold   for
             sufficiently reprehensible conduct is very  high.  We  do  not
             find  it  helpful  to  generalise  about  the  height  of  the
             threshold,  though  it  is  obvious  that  the  rule  is  only
             concerned with conduct of a serious character. We would accept
             that as a matter  of  principle  dishonest  conduct  will  not
             always  and  in  every  case  reach  a  sufficient  level   of
             seriousness, but in the context  of  an  earnings  discrepancy
             case it is very hard to see how the deliberate  and  dishonest
             submission of false earnings figures, whether to  HMRC  or  to
             the Home Office, would not do so.

             (3)  Mr Biggs submitted that dishonest conduct would  only  be
             sufficiently reprehensible if it  were  criminal.  We  do  not
             accept that that is so as a matter of principle,  although  it
             is not easy to think of examples  of  dishonest  conduct  that
             reached the  necessary  threshold  which  would  not  also  be
             criminal. The point is, however, academic in  the  context  of
             earnings discrepancy cases since the dishonest  submission  of
             false earnings figures to either HMRC or the Home Office would
             be an offence."

16. Then, at [38], Underhill LJ said in relation to limb (iii) of stage one
    and the "balancing exercise":

         "38. As for the third limb of the first stage of the  analysis,  Mr
         Biggs submitted that the assessment of undesirability requires  the
         decision-maker to conduct a balancing exercise informed by weighing
         all relevant factors.  That  would  include  such  matters  as  any
         substantial positive contribution to the UK made by  the  applicant
         and also circumstances relating to the  (mis)conduct  in  question,
         e.g. that  it  occurred  a  long  time  ago.  In  support  of  that
         proposition he relied on the judgment of Foskett J in R  (Ngouh)  v
         Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2010]  EWHC  2218
         (Admin), which also concerned the application of paragraph 322 (5),
         albeit in relation to a different kind of conduct: see paras.  110,
         120 and 121. While we would not say that  it  would  always  be  an
         error of law for a decision-maker to fail to conduct the  balancing
         exercise explicitly, we agree that it would be  good  practice  for
         the Secretary of State to incorporate it in  his  formal  decision-
         making process. In so far as Lord  Tyre  may  be  thought  to  have
         suggested otherwise in Oji  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2018] CSOH 127 (see para. 28) and Dadzie v Secretary of
         State for the Home Department [2018] CSOH 128 (para. 28)  we  would
         respectfully disagree."

17. The Court then noted that even if the first stage was established, para
    322(5) required the decision-maker to exercise discretion  and  factors
    which might outweigh, albeit only exceptionally, the  presumption  that
    leave should be  refused  on  grounds  of  "undesirability".   At  [39]
    Underhill LJ said:

         "39. Mr Biggs submitted that at this second stage of  the  analysis
         the  Secretary  of  State   must   separately   consider   whether,
         notwithstanding the conclusion that  it  was  undesirable  for  the
         applicant to have leave to remain, there were  factors  outweighing
         the presumption that leave should for that reason  be  refused.  He
         submitted that it is at this stage that the Secretary of State must
         consider such factors as the welfare of any minor children who  may
         be affected adversely by the decision and any human  rights  issues
         which arise. That seems to us in  principle  correct.  There  will,
         though no doubt only exceptionally, be cases where the interests of
         children or others, or serious  problems  about  removal  to  their
         country of origin, mean that it would be wrong to refuse  leave  to
         remain (though not  necessarily  indefinite  leave  to  remain)  to
         migrants whose presence is undesirable."

18. The burden of proof, on a  balance  of  probabilities,  lies  upon  the
    Secretary  of  State  to  establish  the  general  ground  of  refusal,
    including the individual's dishonesty.

19. In Yaseen v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 157, the Court  of  Appeal  recognised
    that the similar "undesirable" provision found in para 276B(ii) equated
    in large measure to para 322(5), despite each representing  a  discrete
    test, and the approach to para 276B(ii) mirrored that to  para  322(5).
    The Court adopted the approach in Balajigari.

The Judge' Decision

20. Although I have set out both para 276B(ii) and  para  322(5),  in  fact
    before Judge Hillis the respondent only relied upon para 322(5) despite
    having also relied upon para 276B(ii) in the decision  letter.   Before
    Judge Hillis the  respondent's  representative  accepted  that  if  the
    discrepancy in the income submitted  by  the  appellant  in  his  leave
    application and HMRC tax return for 2012/2013 had been made innocently,
    rather than dishonestly, then para 322(5) would not apply (see para  22
    of the  determination).   The  respondent's  submission  was  that  the
    discrepancy had been made dishonestly.  The appellant's contention  was
    that it had been made innocently and the respondent had not established
    to the required standard that the appellant had been dishonest.

21. The judge identified the sole legal issue under the Rules in para 33 of
    his determination as follows:

         "33. The sole issue to be  resolved  in  this  appeal  is  did  the
             Appellant deliberately enter false  figures  in  his  previous
             application  to  mislead  or  deceive  the  Home  Office  into
             granting him leave to remain when he did not meet the  minimum
             annual  income  under  the  Rules?   I  am  grateful  to  [the
             Respondent's representative] for his very  proper  submissions
             that if the figures in the Appellant's application and in  his
             Tax Returns were an  innocent  mistake  that  his  application
             could not have been refused pursuant to  para  322(5)  of  the
             Rules".

22. At para 34, the judge noted, somewhat curiously, that the appellant had
    submitted a document saying that he had withdrawn instructions from his
    legal   representatives   because   of   their   "sub-standard,    poor
    communication and poor preparation of his appeal" but then, before  the
    judge, they represented the appellant.

23. Then at paras 35-41, the judge dealt  with  the  appellant's  oral  and
    documentary evidence which sought to explain the discrepancy of ï¿½43,454
    between his declared income in his 2012/2013 tax return and in his 2016
    application for further leave:

         "35. The Interim Financial Information document at  AB13  is  dated
             25th February, 2013.  I  note  that  he  has  not  signed  the
             declaration at AB15 dated 7th March,  2013  which  states  'In
             accordance with the engagement letter, I approve  the  Interim
             Financial Information which comprises the Trading  and  Profit
             and Loss account, the Balance Sheet and related notes for  the
             period  ended   February   25,   2013.    I   acknowledge   my
             responsibility  for   the   Interim   Financial   Information,
             including the  appropriateness  of  the  applicable  financial
             reporting framework as set out in note 1.1 and  for  providing
             Mantax   Consulting   Limited   with   all   information   and
             explanations for their compilation'.  I conclude that this  is
             an  acknowledgement  by  the   Appellant   that   he   accepts
             responsibility for the information given  to  the  accountants
             used to compile the document.

         36.  At AB17 the gross turnover for the business Kassim Shittu T/AS
             Dewtech Engineering Services was GBï¿½11,906 and the net  profit
             was GBï¿½5,773.  The balance  sheet  shows  net  liabilities  of
             GBï¿½377 and a bank balance of GBï¿½173.  In  my  judgment,  those
             figures  are  vastly  different  from  the  contents  of   the
             Santander  Bank  statement  of  Dewtech  Engineering  Services
             submitted dated from 26th April, 2012 to 5th  April,  2013  at
             AB21 to AB22.

         37.  This account started with an opening balance of GBï¿½1 and had a
             closing balance at the end of the year of GBï¿½1,368.11.  By  my
             calculations they show deposits  totalling  GBï¿½16,525.   These
             figures are wholly at odds with the tax returns at AB25  which
             claims to show a UK income of GBï¿½21,611  with  a  grand  total
             income from all sources of GBï¿½65,065 which includes the figure
             of GBï¿½43,454.  The Tax Return at AB26 shows an income  in  the
             UK of GBï¿½26,534 and a grand total of GBï¿½69,3232.

         38.  The accounts submitted for Qitech  Services  Limited  for  the
             period 1st August, 2012 to 31st July,  2013  are  'abbreviated
             and audited accounts' and include a  Balance  Sheet  detailing
             fixed assets of GBï¿½267 for 2012 and GBï¿½159 for 2013,  cash  at
             bank and in hand of GBï¿½1,600 for 2012 and Nil for 2013.   They
             also show trading losses of GBï¿½4,300 for 2012 and GBï¿½9,218 for
             2013.  The Balance Sheet for 31st July, 2014 at AB83 shows net
             liabilities of GBï¿½9,218 for 2013 and GBï¿½11,298 for 2014.

         39.  The accounts at AB97 for Dewtech Engineering Services  Limited
             for 31st July, 2016 show a  profit  of  GBï¿½269  for  2015  and
             GBï¿½10,786  for  2016  and  the  Balance  Sheet   shows   total
             liabilities of GBï¿½11,029 and GBï¿½96 for 2016.

         40.  The PAYE summaries at AB110 to AB116 do not, in  my  judgment,
             show tax paid  which  is  commensurate  with  the  Appellant's
             claimed income from employment.  Additionally, the schedule of
             'Employee Total Pay Levels' for Dewtech  Engineering  Services
             Limited for 2018 to 2019 are not for the relevant period being
             considered   in   this   appeal.    Additionally,   they   are
             inconsistent with the levels of turnover in the previous years
             of  accounts  set  out  above.   They  claim  that  the  total
             employees' pay for GBï¿½62,475.29 which is  wholly  inconsistent
             with the turnover shown in the previous years and no  evidence
             has been submitted to  show  the  source  of  the  very  large
             increase in turnover which would be needed to pay these wages.

         41.  I further conclude that the contents  of  the  Santander  Bank
             statements at AB120 to  AB147  are,  in  my  judgment,  wholly
             inconsistent with the figures submitted in the Appellant's tax
             returns and his previous application for leave  to  remain  in
             the UK as shown above".

24. In other words, the judge concluded that the documents did not  support
    the appellant's claim that he had income for 2012/2013,  including  the
    discrepant figure of ï¿½43,454, as he  had  claimed  in  his  2016  leave
    application and formed part of his amended income disclosed to the HMRC
    in 2016.

25. Then, at para 42, the judge rejected the appellant's account  and  that
    he had made an honest mistake:

         "42. I do not find the Appellant to be honest and reliable  in  his
             oral testimony before me. He  was  wholly  unable  to  give  a
             credible explanation to the 'coincidences' and inconsistencies
             in   the   figures   highlighted    by    [the    respondent's
             representative] during his cross-examination.   The  Appellant
             has failed to produce documentation  of  his  claimed  foreign
             income from his now dissolved business in Nigeria".

26. The "coincidences" that the judge refers to in  para  42  is  that  the
    discrepancy in income made in his tax return for 2012/2013  of  ï¿½43,454
    and said to be from "Dividends from foreign companies" exactly  matched
    the sum of the additional income he  claimed  that  he  had  earned  in
    additional salary set out in the 2016 amendments he made  to  the  HMRC
    and his 2012/2013 tax return.

27. At para 43 the judge reached his conclusion on the evidence as follows:

         "43. In my judgment, following a careful and  anxious  scrutiny  of
             all the documents submitted by the  Appellant,  including  his
             accounts and in addition to the Appellant's oral  testimony  I
             conclude that the  Respondent  has  shown,  on  a  balance  of
             probabilities, that the Appellant submitted false figures  for
             his  income  to  the  HMRC  and  with  his  relevant  previous
             application for leave to remain in the UK".

28. Reading paras 42 and 43 together, therefore, the judge found  that  the
    respondent had established that the appellant had dishonestly submitted
    false figures either in his income to the HMRC or  in  his  application
    for leave.

29. The judge then went on in paras 44-46, to find that the  appellant  had
    not established a breach of Art 8, in particular based  upon  the  best
    interests of his children whom the judge found  now  lived  with  their
    mother in Scotland and with whom the appellant had no contact.

The Grounds

30. It is helpful to read  the  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  with  the
    submissions made more recently in response to  UTJ  Reeds'  directions.
    As I have already stated, the appellant sought permission to appeal  on
    three grounds: ground 1 relates to  the  application  of  para  322(5).
    Grounds 1 and 2 relate to the judge's approach to Art 8, in  particular
    in relation to his finding that the appellant had no contact  with  his
    children.  UTJ Reeds only granted permission on ground 1.  She  refused
    permission on ground 2 and 3 as not being arguable.  I will  return  to
    these later.  I focus, therefore, upon ground 1.

31. In ground 1, the appellant  raises  a  number  of  points.   First,  he
    contends that the decision was procedurally unfair on  the  basis  that
    the Secretary of State  had  not  carried  out  a  "minded  to  refuse"
    notification in relation to the appellant's tax affairs as required  by
    Balajigari.  Secondly, it is contended that  the  judge  was  wrong  to
    apply the same approach to para 276B(ii) as to para  322(5).   Thirdly,
    the judge's adverse finding on the appellant's credibility and that  he
    was dishonest is said to be  inadequately  reasoned.   Finally,  it  is
    contended that the judge failed to carry out the  "balancing  exercise"
    required by Balajigari in taking into account not only, if established,
    that the appellant  was  dishonest  but  also  his  whole  history  and
    conduct.

Discussion

    Ground 1

32. I will deal with each of the points raised in Ground 1 in turn.

33. First, whilst the Court of Appeal in Balajigari indicated that fairness
    required the Secretary of State,  before  making  an  adverse  decision
    based upon dishonesty in a 'discrepant income  or  earnings'  case,  to
    allow the  appellant  an  opportunity  to  deal  with  that  allegation
    principally through an interview, that complaint has no  traction  when
    the appellant has exercised a right  of  appeal  and  has  had  a  full
    opportunity at an appeal hearing to provide an  'innocent  explanation'
    (see Ashfaq (Balajigari: appeals) [2020] UKUT 226 (IAC)).  It is  noted
    in the headnote:

         "If the decision of the Secretary  of  State  carries  a  right  of
         appeal, the  availability  of  the  appeals  process  corrects  the
         defects of justice identified in Balajigari".

34. Secondly, to the extent that the grounds contend  that  the  judge,  in
    some way, misapplied para 276B(ii), that ground also has  no  merit  in
    this appeal.  As I have already indicated, although  the  Secretary  of
    State in her decision letter dealt not only with para 322(5)  but  also
    para 276B(ii), before the judge the respondent only  relied  upon  para
    322(5).  The judge's findings relate exclusively to that general ground
    of refusal which, of course, the  judge  found  had  been  established.
    Even  if  there  were  some,  albeit  fine,  distinction  between   the
    application in this sort of case of para 276B(ii) and para 322(5),  the
    judge only applied para 322(5).

35. Thirdly, the appellant contends that the judge erred  in  finding  that
    the appellant was  dishonest.   The  correct  approach  in  'discrepant
    income/earnings' cases is set out by Martin Spencer J in R(Khan) v SSHD
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384  (IAC).   It
    suffices to refer to the detailed judicial headnote:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.

         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty.

         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.

         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
             "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be
             the end of the matter,  given  that  the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

36. In Balajigari, the Court of Appeal largely  approved  the  approach  of
    Martin Spencer J in Khan (at [40]-[44])  with  one  caveat.   At  [42],
    Underhill LJ pointed out a "danger" in the  "starting-point"  in  paras
    (i) and (ii) of the headnote as follows:

         "42. Although Martin Spencer J clearly makes  the  point  that  the
         Secretary of State must carefully consider any case  advanced  that
         the  discrepancy  is  the  result  of  carelessness   rather   than
         dishonesty, there is in our view a danger that his "starting-point"
         mis-states  the  position.  A  discrepancy  between  the   earnings
         declared to HMRC and to the Home Office may justifiably  give  rise
         to a suspicion that it is the result of dishonesty but it does  not
         by itself justify a conclusion to that effect. What it does  is  to
         call for an explanation. If  an  explanation  once  sought  is  not
         forthcoming, or is unconvincing, it may at that point be legitimate
         for the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty; but  even  in  that
         case the position is not that  there  is  a  legal  burden  on  the
         applicant to disprove  dishonesty.  The  Secretary  of  State  must
         simply decide, considering the discrepancy  in  the  light  of  the
         explanation (or lack of it),  whether  he  is  satisfied  that  the
         applicant has been dishonest."

37. In this appeal, the judge correctly identified that the respondent  had
    to establish that the appellant had been dishonest (see para 43 of  the
    determination).   There was a significant discrepancy and the appellant
    put forward  an  'innocent  explanation'.   The  judge  gave  extensive
    reasons at paras 35-42 (based  on  the  material  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant) and at paras 42-43 (looking at the appellant's evidence more
    generally) why he did not accept the appellant's 'innocent explanation'
    as to why his tax return in 2012/2013  failed  to  disclose  income  of
    ï¿½43,454.  The grounds,  and  the  submissions  made,  do  not  seek  to
    identify errors  in  the  judge's  reasoning.   The  challenge  is,  as
    expressed in the grounds, one of inadequacy of reasons.

38. The appellant's explanation was undoubtedly a  detailed  one.   It  was
    not, however, always consistent.  Although there is some suggestion  in
    the appellant's documents that the mistake was that of his  accountants
    at the time, that does not appear  to  have  featured  as  a  principal
    contention before the judge.  It would have, in any event,  lacked  any
    real  strength  in  the  absence  of  supporting  evidence,   including
    potentially evidence given orally  and  subject  to  cross-examination,
    from his accountants  (see  Khan;  Abbasi  [2020]  UKUT  27  (IAC)  and
    Ashfaq).

39. The appellant's contention was, in essence,  that  there  was  no  real
    mistake and that all his income  had  been  appropriately  reported  to
    HMRC, albeit not exclusively in the tax year 2012/2013 (see his  letter
    dated 9 March 2018 at pages 8-10 of the appellant's  bundle).   It  was
    this contention which the judge dealt with in detail when examining the
    supporting evidence relating to the appellant's claimed further  income
    totalling ï¿½43,454.  As I have said, that reasoning in  paras  36-41  is
    not subject to any reasoned challenge either in the appellant's grounds
    or in the further submissions.

40. The appellant refers to the fact that the appellant did  not  sign  the
    Interim Financial Information document (at page 15 of  the  appellant's
    bundle) which had been the initial basis upon which the appellant's tax
    return for 2012/2013 was submitted.  It is not entirely clear to me why
    the grounds contend that the judge erred by noting that the  appellant,
    even though it had not  been  signed,  was  responsible  (at  least  in
    principle) for that submission.  He clearly was (see Khan  at  headnote
    para (iv)) and that the accountant should have asked him to confirm the
    contents of his tax return even if the accounts were not signed.

41. Further, there remained the somewhat surprising  coincidence  that,  in
    retrospect, the appellant's now  asserted  income  and  dividends  from
    foreign companies of ï¿½43,454 exactly mirrored each other.  That  was  a
    coincidence that the judge was entitled to take into account as was the
    fact that the correction to his income for the 2012/2013 year was  made
    with HMRC shortly after he made his application for ILR in 2016.

42. In my judgment, the judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    appellant's innocent explanation and his finding that  the  significant
    discrepancy in the income which  he  had  claimed  in  his  2016  leave
    application and in his tax return  for  2012/2013  was  dishonest  and,
    therefore, fell within para 322(5) of the Rules.

43. The final issue raised in the grounds is that, having  found  that  the
    appellant was dishonest, the judge failed to carry  out  the  balancing
    exercise required by limb (iii) taking into account both  the  negative
    aspects of the appellant's circumstances (principally  the  dishonesty)
    and any other positive aspects  of  his  circumstances  in  determining
    whether the "undesirability" element was satisfied.

44. The Court of Appeal, as I have already noted, in Balajigari  recognised
    that a "balancing  exercise  informed  by  weighing  all  the  relevant
    factors"   was   required   in   order   to   determine   whether   the
    "undesirability" element in para 322(5) was met (see  [38]).   However,
    it is important to notice that the Court of Appeal also stated that:

         "We would not say that it would always be an error  of  law  for  a
         decision-maker  to  fail  to   conduct   the   balancing   exercise
         explicitly".

45. On the face  of  it,  Judge  Hillis  concluded  that  para  322(5)  was
    satisfied on establishing that the appellant had been dishonest in  his
    dealings with  the  Home  Office  and/or  HMRC.   In  the  most  recent
    submissions made on behalf of the appellant, it is stated  at  para  20
    that the judge

         "misdirected himself by failing to balance up  appellant's  overall
         conduct and his historical past throughout his over thirteen years'
         lawful residence in the UK".

    The submissions do not, however, point to any particular aspect of  the
    appellant's "history" that the judge should  have  taken  into  account
    other than the fact that the appellant had been, so the grounds assert,
    in the UK lawfully for thirteen years.  At best, it could be said  that
    the appellant has, on the evidence, not been guilty of any offending or
    does not have any other bad character factor which would be relevant to
    his circumstances.  He is, therefore, apart from the dishonesty  issue,
    a person of good character.

46. The appellant relies upon the Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  Yaseen
    where the court remitted to the Tribunal an appeal in  order  that  the
    balancing exercise could be carried out.  At [46], Irwin LJ (with  whom
    Simler LJ and Sir Jack Beatson agreed) said this:

         "46. In my judgment this appeal should  succeed  on  a  simple  but
             important ground.  In all but the most  extreme  cases,  where
             the conduct complained of is such that on any view the balance
             must fall  against  an  applicant,  even  where  a  sufficient
             character or conduct issue is proved, a balancing exercise  is
             required.  In this instance there was at least  some  positive
             material.  I would remit the matter for a re-hearing to permit
             such an exercise".

47. In that case, positive material including character references as  well
    as material  showing  his  employment  and  earnings  and  letters  and
    materials from successive firms of accountants were  submitted  on  his
    behalf (see [11] of the judgment).  Whilst in that case, the  Court  of
    Appeal was not content to conclude that the  balance  must  necessarily
    fall against that applicant, I am satisfied that  it  would  inevitably
    fall against this applicant.  Outside of the issues concerning  Art  8,
    there is little, or no, positive  material  that  could  weigh  in  his
    favour so as to outweigh the dishonesty established by  the  respondent
    to the judge's satisfaction.  His lawful residence  in  the  UK  for  a
    period which would, otherwise, fall within para 276B will  not  suffice
    to override the inevitability of his dishonesty leading to a conclusion
    that  the  "undesirability"  element  in  para  322(5)  was  satisfied.
    Neither the grounds  nor  the  more  recent  submissions  identify  any
    discrete matters of any significance that might  lead  to  the  balance
    being struck in the appellant's favour.  Consequently, any error by the
    judge in failing to carry out the balancing exercise was  not  material
    to his decision that para 322(5) applied.  There  is  no  proper  basis
    upon which the Upper Tribunal should set aside his  decision  for  that
    immaterial error.

48. Consequently, I reject ground 1.  The judge was entitled to  find  that
    para 322(5) applied on the basis of the appellant's dishonesty and,  as
    a result, the appellant could not succeed under para  276B  because  of
    sub-para (iii).

    Grounds 2 and 3

49. As regards the remaining grounds of appeal, as I  have  already  noted,
    the appellant was not granted permission by  UTJ  Reeds  on  either  of
    these grounds.  That was because she did not  consider  them  arguable.
    They plainly are not arguable and, if permission had  been  granted,  I
    would have rejected these grounds.

50. As regards ground  2,  the  appellant  relies  upon  s.117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) and  that  he
    has a "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" with  his  British
    citizen child (or children) in the UK.  If that is the case, then if it
    would not be reasonable for his children  to  leave  the  UK  then  the
    appellant's removal is not in the public  interest.   The  judge  dealt
    with this at paras 44-45 of his determination:

         "44. The letter from the Appellant to the mother of their  children
             dated 20th August, 2013 at AB152 shows that the Appellant  was
             not living with his wife and children as at the  date  of  the
             letter.  There is no indication in his witness statement  that
             he is living with his children or has any access [or] physical
             contact with them.  The documents submitted at AB161 to AB165,
             in my judgment, show, on a balance of probabilities, that  the
             children's mother is now living in Scotland with them and that
             he has no contact with them and does not know  their  address.
             There is no evidence before me to  show  that  there  are  any
             pending legal proceedings before the Courts by  the  Appellant
             to seek contact or access to his children.

         45.  I infer from the evidence taken as a whole that  the  children
             are living happily and safely with their mother  in  Scotland.
             There is no suggestion before me that they would  be  required
             to leave the UK with the Appellant, I conclude it is in  their
             best interests to remain with their mother living in the  UK".



51. Looking at the birth certificates at pages 149-151 of  the  appellant's
    bundle, the appellant would appear to have three  children  in  the  UK
    aged 9, 6 and 4 years old.  The eldest child has a different mother  to
    the other two children: she  is  the  appellant's  ex-wife.   There  is
    mention in his witness statement  of  a  "partner"  (para  14)  but  no
    evidence to support the claim or that she is the mother of the  younger
    two children.

52. The appellant has, with the grounds of appeal, appended evidence  which
    seeks to support a contention that he is pursuing contact  through  the
    courts in Scotland.  That application only relates to the eldest child.
     It is wholly unclear what was  (and  now  is  being)  said  about  the
    appellant's relationship with the younger two  children.   The  grounds
    and documents are wholly opaque.  There  is  (and  was)  no  supporting
    evidence  relating  to  them.   Importantly,  however,   the   material
    concerning the eldest child was not available to Judge  Hillis  as  UTJ
    Reeds  noted  in  refusing  permission  on  this  ground.    The   only
    information before Judge Hillis  was  that  the  last  court  documents
    dealing with contact in England dated back to 2014.   These  also  only
    relate to the eldest child.  The most recent information refers to  the
    appellant as having not seen his child for eight years.  The judge  was
    undoubtedly entitled to find that the appellant's  eldest  child  lived
    with his mother in Scotland.  There were no ongoing contact proceedings
    since the most recent document dated back to 2014.  The appellant  does
    not claim that he has any ongoing relationship with  his  eldest  child
    since the move to Scotland  with  his  mother.   There  is  nothing  to
    support any on-going relationship with the other  children.   In  those
    circumstances, the appellant simply could not establish that he  had  a
    "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" with  is  child/children
    such that s.117B(6) could apply and require the judge to decide whether
    it would be "reasonable" for them to leave the UK.

53. For these reasons, therefore, ground 2 has no merit and I reject it.

54. Turning to ground 3, this seeks to  challenge  the  judge's  conclusion
    that Art  8  was  not  breached  but  again  seeks  to  rely  upon  his
    relationship with his child who lives with his mother in Scotland.  The
    contention appears to be that it was in that child's  "best  interests"
    to continue to have a relationship with the appellant,  his  biological
    father.  Whilst that is no doubt true as a generalisation, in this case
    the appellant had no relationship with his child whom he had  not  seen
    for some years.  His child lived with his mother in  Scotland  and,  in
    the absence of evidence that the appellant's separation from his  child
    was having a deleterious effect upon his child, it was entirely open to
    the judge to find that the best interests of  his  son  were  currently
    fulfilled by his  living  with  his  mother  in  Scotland.   For  these
    reasons, ground 3 is also without merit.

55. There is no other challenge to the dismissal of the appeal under Art 8.



Decision

56. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 did not involve the making of a  material  error  of
    law.  That decision stands.

57. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge  Hillis  made  no  fee  award  as  the  appellant's  appeal  had  been
dismissed.  That decision also stands.
