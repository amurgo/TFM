    Representation:

                            For the Claimant: Mr S Walker a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: Mr P Collins of counsel instructed by Caulker
& Co

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The claimant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ("the
      Secretary of State"). The respondent is a citizen of Somalia  who  was
      born on 1 January 1989 ("the claimant"). The Secretary  of  State  has
      been  given  permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  a   panel
      consisting of First-Tier Tribunal Judge B Lloyd and  non-legal  member
      Mrs F  T  Jamieson  JP  ("the  panel")  who  allowed  on  humanitarian
      protection grounds only the claimant's appeal against the Secretary of
      State's decision of 3 October 13 to make a deportation  order  against
      him under the provisions of section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.
      On the same date the Secretary of State refused to grant the  claimant
      asylum and refused to revoke the deportation order.


   2. The claimant came to the UK in about May 2001 when  he  was  12  years
      old. He joined his mother who made an asylum claim  with  him  as  her
      dependent. The claim was refused on 19  June  2001.  However,  it  was
      reconsidered and on 24 October 2001 both the claimant and  his  mother
      were granted exceptional leave to remain in  the  UK  valid  until  24
      October 2005.


   3. On 19 September 2005 when the claimant was 16 his mother  applied  for
      indefinite leave to remain which was granted to both  of  them  on  29
      December 2005.


   4. The claimant had no criminal convictions until 2 May 2012 when he  was
      23. At Woolwich Crown Court he was convicted of common assault. He was
      ordered to do 80 hours community service and  pay  ï¿½100  compensation.
      Subsequently, the  penalty  was  varied  and  replaced  by  two  weeks
      imprisonment.


   5. On 12 November 2012 the claimant was convicted at Woolwich Crown Court
      on three counts of supplying a Class A controlled  drug  namely  crack
      cocaine on 24 July 2012 and two further counts of possessing a Class A
      controlled drug, also crack cocaine, with intent to supply on the same
      date. The claimant was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment  concurrently
      on each count and the varied order of two weeks  imprisonment  imposed
      at the same court on  20  February  2013  was  ordered  to  be  served
      consecutively.


   6. The claimant appealed  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decisions
      arguing that these were not in accordance with the Immigration  Rules,
      not in accordance with the law, that her discretion had  been  wrongly
      exercised and that the decisions breached the U.K.'s obligations under
      Articles 2, 3 and 8.


   7. The panel heard  the  appeal  on  21  July  2014.  Both  parties  were
      represented and the claimant gave evidence. The panel  concluded  that
      on the particular facts of the claimant's case paragraph 399A  of  the
      Immigration Rules did not apply and he had not shown that  there  were
      exceptional circumstances such that the public interest in deportation
      was  outweighed  by  other  factors.  He  had  not  shown  exceptional
      circumstances in relation to his private and family life. His  removal
      to Somalia would not be a breach of his Article 8 human rights.  There
      were no grounds to revoke the deportation order. However, in  relation
      to his claim for humanitarian protection under Article  15(c)  of  the
      Qualification Directive, in the light of the country guidance  in  AMM
      and others (Somalia) [2011] UKUT 00445 and on the evidence before  the
      panel he had established that he came within the category of civilians
      at real risk of random death or injury from  indiscriminate  violence.
      The appeal against the deportation order was allowed but only to  this
      extent.


   8. The claimant has not sought to appeal against the panel's  conclusions
      that he was  not  entitled  to  succeed  on  any  grounds  other  than
      humanitarian protection. The Secretary of State applied  for  and  was
      granted permission to appeal arguing that the panel erred  in  law  by
      failing to provide adequate reasons why the claimant would be at  risk
      of indiscriminate violence on return to  Somalia.  There  had  been  a
      failure to make an assessment of what  ties  he  had  in  Somalia,  in
      particular what clan ties he might have and whether he had any  family
      support in the light of his evidence that he had half siblings  there.
      He had spent his youth  and  formative  years  in  Somalia,  would  be
      familiar with the culture and customs and could  re-establish  himself
      without being at risk of indiscriminate violence.


   9. Mr Walker  relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal.  There  had  been  no
      assessment of whether the claimant had any cultural or other  ties  in
      Somalia. Whilst he had denied having any half siblings this  had  been
      his evidence at one point. The evidence indicated that both he and his
      mother had lived in Mogadishu. It was the Secretary  of  State's  case
      that he would be returned to Mogadishu. He  was  likely  to  have  had
      contacts with the Somali community in the UK. The level  of  education
      he had obtained in the UK would assist him on his return.


  10. In reply to my question as to  whether  the  Secretary  of  State  was
      suggesting that her grounds including any argument that the  situation
      in Somalia and in particular Mogadishu had changed since AMM  to  such
      an extent that he  would  no  longer  be  at  risk  of  indiscriminate
      violence Mr Walker went no further than to say that the situation  had
      moved on since then.


  11. Mr Collins referred me to the panel's quotation from AMM in  paragraph
      21. There  were  only  a  small  number  of  people  who  might  avoid
      indiscriminate violence if they were "connected with  powerful  actors
      or belonging to a category of middle class or professional persons who
      can live to a reasonable standard in circumstances where  the  Article
      15 risk, which exists for the great majority of the  population,  does
      not apply". He referred me to the head note and to paragraphs 350  and
      351 of AMM. He submitted that the claimant did  not  come  within  any
      part of this exempt category. He was not within a  professional  class
      and the question of whether he  had  retained  cultural  ties  through
      contact with the Somali community in the UK was  irrelevant.  He  came
      here when he was 12 and was now 26. The Secretary  of  State  had  not
      argued that he came within any other exclusion category.


  12. Mr Collins said that the claimant had instructed him that he did  have
      half siblings. They were  the  older  children  of  his  mother  by  a
      previous marriage.  There  was  no  concession  as  to  their  present
      whereabouts. Mr Collins submitted that the presence or absence of such
      half siblings was not relevant to the question of whether the claimant
      would face indiscriminate violence.


  13. Mr Collins argued that on the material before the panel there  was  no
      error of law in the assessment of the post AMM  country  evidence.  If
      there had been such change it would have to be shown that it was "well-
      established and durable". There was no need for the panel to  consider
      the claimant's family circumstances in Mogadishu which was  irrelevant
      to the question of whether he was at risk of  indiscriminate  violence
      and as a result entitled to humanitarian protection. The Secretary  of
      State did not appear to challenge the panel's  findings  in  paragraph
      56. I was asked to find that the panel had not erred  in  law  and  to
      refuse the Secretary of State's appeal.


  14. Mr Walker did not reply except to refer me to paragraph 1.2.57 of  the
      Home Office Country Information and  Guidance  on  Somalia  which  was
      before the panel. I reserved my determination.


  15. I find that the panel did make a proper assessment of  what  ties  the
      claimant had to Somalia. There is reference to his evidence about this
      in paragraph 27. He had been living with his mother in the UK but  had
      lost contact with her. He  had  never  really  known  his  father  and
      assumed from what his mother told him that his father had been killed.
      I do not find any inconsistency in his evidence about whether  he  had
      half siblings in Somalia. At the hearing before me Mr Collins said, on
      instructions, that the claimant had half siblings born to  his  mother
      by an earlier marriage. This is not  inconsistent  with  his  evidence
      referred to in the determination where he denied having half  siblings
      who continued to reside in the country (my emphasis). At the  date  of
      the deportation order he had lived here for 12 years and  four  months
      which had increased to more than 13 years by the time of  the  hearing
      before the panel. His evidence was that he had completely  lost  touch
      with Somalia. He said that he had no means of  support  there  and  no
      social or family network upon which he could rely.  I  find  that  the
      panel  accepted  this  evidence  in  the  conclusions  summarised   in
      paragraph 54 when it was said in relation to his return  to  Mogadishu
      that it would be to; "a country to which he now in our view has little
      or no cultural or personal connection  at  all.  Neither  has  he  any
      familiarity with an environment permeated with extreme danger for  him
      as part of  the  civilian  population."  The  panel's  conclusion  did
      include a proper assessment of whether the  claimant  had  any  family
      support in Somalia.


  16. In the light of the findings which the panel were entitled to  make  I
      am not persuaded that the presence or absence of  any  finding  as  to
      whether the claimant was Ashraf was of any relevance  except  possibly
      to make his position worse. If he was Ashraf he would be a member of a
      minority clan with the possible additional  dangers  that  that  would
      entail. If he was not then it would not help to determine  whether  he
      was within one of those limited classes of  individuals  not  at  risk
      identified in AMM.


  17. I note that at the hearing before the panel the Presenting Officer did
      not argue that the  claimant  came  within  the  exception  categories
      identified in AMM. Whilst Mr Howells now seeks to argue that he  does,
      I am not persuaded that the evidence indicated that the claimant  came
      anywhere near being "connected with powerful actors or belonging to  a
      category of middle class or professional persons, who can  live  to  a
      reasonable standard". I  find  no  merit  in  the  argument  that  any
      education he has received in the UK could put him in the category of a
      professional person. I have not been referred to any  evidence  as  to
      the extent of his education or qualifications.  Similarly,  I  am  not
      persuaded that any contacts he may have with the Somali  community  in
      the UK would assist him to any material degree were he  to  return  to
      Somalia. Again I have not been referred to  any  evidence  as  to  the
      nature or extent of any contacts may have with the Somali community in
      the UK.


  18. The grounds of appeal  do  not  argue  that  country  conditions  have
      changed to the extent that the assessment of  risk  of  indiscriminate
      violence set out in AMM should no longer be followed. This was touched
      on in submissions and I find that the panel did not err  in  law.  The
      submissions of the parties are set out between paragraphs 39 to 47  of
      the determination and on those arguments and the evidence referred to,
      it was open to the panel to conclude that there was no reason why they
      should depart from the guidance set out in AMM. As Mr Collins  submits
      the panel would  have  needed  to  find  that  there  had  been  well-
      established and durable changes  in  order  to  come  to  a  different
      conclusion.


  19. The panel made an anonymity  direction.  I  direct  that  this  should
      continue in force.

  20. I  find  that  the  panel  did  not  err  in  law  and  I  uphold  the
      determination  to  allow  the  claimant's   appeal   on   humanitarian
      protection grounds only.
