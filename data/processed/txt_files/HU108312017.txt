                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant has been given permission to appeal the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge I F Taylor. In a decision promulgated on 7th
      September  2018 the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the
      respondent's refusal of his claim to remain on the basis of her
      article 8 rights.

   2. The appellant is a national of the United States of America. She came
      to the United Kingdom on 31 August 2015 with leave valid until 30
      January 2017 as a student. On 25 January 2017 she made an application
      for leave to remain under appendix FM of the immigration rules. This
      was on the basis of her family life with her partner, Mr James Keith
      Allen. He is a British national.

   3. Her application was refused on 19 September 2017. There were no
      suitability issues and the eligibility grounds, both in terms of
      relationship and immigration status were met. The refusal was based
      solely upon the financial requirements.

   4. A limited company, GG technology services Ltd was established in July
      2016. Her partner is a director. The company provided IT services to
      another company, Willis Towers Watson limited. For the purposes of the
      immigration rule he was classed as being self-employed.

   5. Appendix FM SE sets out specific necessary proofs were income derives
      from a limited company. This must include evidence that the company is
      registered in Companies House and tax returns for the company for a
      full financial year. Audited accounts if required or on audited
      accounts as an accountant certificate were to be provided.
      Furthermore, the company must provide business bank statements for the
      same 12 month period. The difficulty was that these requirements could
      not be met because the company at that stage had not been in existence
      for a full year.

   6. Her partner also received payment of �1499.45 p gross as a member of
      the Army reserve force. The appellant is employed by Apple retail UK
      and her gross annual income totals �10,715.25 p. These 2 incomes total
      �12,214.70 p which do not satisfy the requirement of �18,600 in the
      rules.

   7. No other basis was seen for the grant of leave under the rules and the
      respondent did not see any exceptional circumstances .

The First tier Tribunal

   8. The grounds of appeal refer to section EX 1 of appendix FM and whether
      there were insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside
      the United Kingdom. The grounds also relied upon freestanding article
      8 rights, pointing out that she and her partner have been together for
      over 2 years. It was contended they met the financial requirements,
      with a partner at that stage earning �28,800 per annum. Reliance was
      placed upon a number of decisions including Chickwamba -v- SSHD [2008]
      UKHL 40.

   9. First-tier Tribunal Judge I F Taylor noted that the appeal was
      restricted to human rights grounds and the ability to meet the rules
      was relevant to any proportionality assessment. The appellant was
      asked questions directed towards whether family life could be enjoyed
      in the United States of America.

  10. Under the section headed `my findings' the judge refers to the
      evidential requirements in appendix FM SE. At paragraph 16 the judge
      refers to the more recent financial evidence not being relevant to the
      decision taken because it relates to events post decision. The judge
      then concluded EX 1 did not assist.

The Upper Tribunal

Error of law

  11. There is no dispute that family life exists in addition to private
      life and the sole issue related to finance. The appellant's partner
      change from being self-employed to being an employee on 2 October
      2017.By the time of the hearing further proofs of income were
      available.

  12. The difficulty with the judge's decision is that the judge has looked
      at matters solely through the prism of the immigration rules and at
      the financial situation at that time and does not then look at the
      case outside the rules.in article 8 assessment such as this outside
      the rules the relevant date is the date of hearing.

  13. Ms Kiss has accepted that the judge materially errs in failing to
      refer to considerations outside the rules.

Remaking

  14. Miss Butler referred to the evidence of finance as contained in the
      appeal bundles. The appellant's income and her partners income from
      service in the army has never been in dispute. The earnings are
      documented in the bundles. The document bundle contains her partner's
      payslips, commencing 25 October 2017 when he became an employee
      through to 25 January 2018 . The supplementary bundle contains further
      payslips through to June 2018. Notably the payslip for 23 March 2018
      shows a gross pay to date of �19,573.Tis exceeds the threshold and is
      also recording only payments from 2 October 2017.

  15. There is also a letter from her partner's employer dated 26 June 2018
      confirming he is on a full-time permanent contract earning �35,000 per
      annum.

  16. For the Upper Tribunal hearing a further supplementary bundle has been
      prepared showing payslips up to 26 November 2018. The last payslip
      shows a gross pay of �24,608.49 p.

  17. Miss Butler submitted that it would be disproportionate to expect the
      appellant to return to the United States of America in order to make
      an application which most likely would succeed. She submitted there
      were no strong public interest considerations in requiring this.

  18. There were no section 117 B factors against the appellant. She speaks
      English and has been here lawfully at all times. The evidence
      indicates that she and her partner are financially independent and
      will not be a burden upon the State.

  19. Ms Kiss having considered the evidence about finance did not dispute
      the evidence produced. She indicated she was in agreement with Miss
      Butler that it appeared disproportionate in the circumstance to expect
      the appellant to leave and then reapply.

  20. I indicated to the parties that bearing in mind the arguments advanced
      I was minded to remake the decision and allow the appeal on the basis
      of article 8. Neither representative suggested that there was any need
      to remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal. I am obliged to
      the appellant's representative for the clear presentation of the
      documentation which has greatly facilitated the financial assessment.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge I F Taylor materially errs in law
and is set aside. I remake the decision allowing the appeal on article 8
grounds.
