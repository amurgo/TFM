For the Respondents:   Mr Sowerby, instructed by Ash Norton Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State  against  a  determination
    promulgated on 12 March 2014 of First-tier Tribunal Judge S  Lal  which
    allowed the Article 8 appeal of the respondent.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I refer to  the  respondent  as
    the  claimant  and  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



 3. The background to this matter is that the claimant  is  a  national  of
    Nepal who applied for entry clearance to join her British husband.

 4. The application was refused as it was not found  that  the  maintenance
    requirements contained in Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  were
    met. The claimant accepted that  she  could  only  show  an  income  of
    �15,836 for the sponsor rather than the required amount of �18,600.  In
    so far as  it  found  the  decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  on
    maintenance to have been made correctly,  the  decision  of  Judge  Lal
    stands.

 5. Judge Lal allowed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.  He  set  out
    the correct test of "compelling circumstances" in the first of the  two
    paragraphs numbered [9]. In both of the  paragraphs  numbered  [8],  he
    refers to the case of MM and Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) and
    appears to consider it relevant to the Article 8  assessment  here.  At
    the second paragraph numbered [9]  he  sets  out  the  five  Article  8
    questions from Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 (whilst referring to that case  as
    "Ranger").

 6. At [10] the decision refers to the 12  year  old  British  son  of  the
    claimant and sponsor living with the sponsor in the UK.  The  sponsor's
    evidence was that caring for the son limited his ability to work and so
    meet the maintenance requirements and Judge Lal suggests that this "may
    well be the type of situation envisaged by Blake J in the MM case."

 7. At [11], Judge Lal refers to the couple's second child,  also  British,
    who lives with the claimant and goes on to state that the decision  was
    disproportionate given "this particular family unit  in  terms  of  its
    present constitution."

 8. It was my view that the Article 8 proportionality assessment  discloses
    a number of errors. Judge Lal did not properly apply the ratio of MM as
    he did not identify which, if any, of the relevant factors set  out  by
    Blake, J at  [124]  of  MM  applied  here  such  that  the  maintenance
    requirement could be said to be disproportionate. The difficulty of the
    sponsor in earning enough to meet the maintenance  requirements  as  he
    cares for his son is not one of those factors.

 9. There is also the absence of any consideration of the inability to meet
    the Immigration Rules and take this as a central, starting  point;  see
    Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

10. Further, Judge Lal refers to the second British child living  with  her
    mother but nothing in the material before me that  suggested  that  the
    case was put forward on the basis that the claimant should  be  granted
    entry clearance in order for the younger British child for whom she  is
    primary carer to be able to exercise her rights as  a  EEA  citizen  in
    line with the principles in C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano  and  C-256/11  Murat
    Dereci. It is difficult in any event to read the very general statement
    at [11] that "this particular family  unit  in  terms  of  its  present
    constitution" as a  decision  that  the  appeal  should  succeed  under
    Article 8 in the light of Zambrano and Dereci.

11. It was my conclusion that the matters set  out  above  amounted  to  an
    error on a point  of  law  such  that  the  Article  8  proportionality
    decision of Judge Lal had to be set aside and re-made. I  proceeded  to
    do so.

12. The maintenance requirements here were not met.  That  is  my  starting
    point in the Article 8 assessment and without exceptional or compelling
    circumstances  it  is  sufficient  for  the  decision   to   be   found
    proportionate. It was not shown to me how the factors at  [124]  of  MM
    could assist this  applicant  to  the  extent  that  in  her  case  the
    maintenance requirements could be considered  to  be  disproportionate.
    The evidence about the family circumstances here  is  somewhat  limited
    and did not show me that it was the refusal of entry clearance  to  the
    claimant that was preventing the younger British child from  exercising
    her rights as an EEA citizen. The documents relied on by  the  claimant
    really say nothing about this.  It  did  not  appear  to  me  that  the
    sponsor being a single parent was a matter  which  could  attract  much
    weight, either, certainly not so as to be considered to be a compelling
    or exceptional factor. Without  more,  I  did  not  find  there  to  be
    compelling  circumstances  here  indicating  that  the   decision   was
    disproportionate.

13. I therefore re-make the Article 8 appeal as refused.

Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.

17. I re-make the appeal, refusing it under Article 8 of the ECHR.
