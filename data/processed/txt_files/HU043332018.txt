Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal  brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shore  whose  decision   was
    promulgated on  27  September  2018.   I  shall  refer  however  to  Mr
    Chowdhury as 'the appellant' as he was in the First-tier Tribunal.  For
    reasons which I shall explain later, it is apparent that he appeared in
    person at the hearing which took place on 18 September 2018.

 2. The issue before me is whether or not the  judge  materially  erred  in
    reaching the conclusion that he did.

 3. The broad facts are that the  respondent  had  claimed  to  be  earning
    �26,000 of self-employment income at the material  time;  however,  his
    tax return produced for the benefit of HMRC showed he had self-employed
    earnings of only about �11,000 odd.  There was therefore a  discrepancy
    between his actual earnings and the tax  return  of  something  in  the
    region of �15,000.  That, on its face, was evidence that the  appellant
    had made a misstatement to the Inland Revenue in order to  achieve  the
    benefit of paying less tax.

 4. The Secretary of State in the refusal letter considered the  point  and
    in the Reasons for Refusal Letter said:-

         "It is not credible  that  a  professional,  registered  accountant
         would make such a mistake on your tax return.  Your tax affairs are
         not complex as they are based  on  turnover  minus  cost  equalling
         profit and are considered routine calculations.  As such  you  have
         taken reasonable care when preparing your accounts and it was  your
         responsibility to ensure that your tax return was submitted on time
         with the correct information".

    That was a perfectly sustainable point for the Secretary  of  State  to
    make and it  was  a  claim  that  required  the  appellant  to  answer.
    However, it must not be  forgotten  that  this  was  an  allegation  of
    dishonesty and it therefore fell upon the shoulders of the Secretary of
    State to establish that there was dishonesty and  that  it  was  not  a
    mistake.  The material to which I have earlier referred went so far  in
    establishing that the miscalculation was unlikely to have been  a  pure
    error, but it did not establish on  its  own  the  act  of  dishonesty.
    Instead, it was for the appellant to  give  some  sort  of  explanation
    which may or may not have been accepted by the judge.

 5. The difficulty arises as to what happened at the hearing  itself.   The
    appellant's advocate, Mr Sharma, had booked himself into two courts  at
    Taylor House and was simply absent, notwithstanding the  fact  that  he
    had accepted instruction from Mr Sharma and the judge was  waiting  for
    Mr Sharma to  make  himself  available.   However,  in  the  course  of
    waiting, the Presenting Officer spoke to the appellant.  As a result of
    what was said by the Presenting Officer,  and  understandably  so,  the
    appellant indicated that  he  wished  to  proceed  immediately  without
    representation.

 6. I took the unusual step in the course of the hearing before me to  hear
    what the appellant himself said as to what took place at the hearing in
    Taylor House.  I did  so  because,  on  instructions,  the  appellant's
    advocate, Mr Gajjar, told me that there had been a conversation between
    the appellant and the Presenting  Officer  which  was  material  to  my
    decision.  Subsequently his barrister  told  him  that  the  Presenting
    Officer had not had the benefit of the documentation.  More importantly
    however, the Presenting Officer said  that  he  had  gone  through  the
    documentation that he had.  There was an error with the tax return  but
    that the appellant had paid all that was owing.  The Presenting Officer
    said to Mr Chowdhury,

         I do not see any wrongdoing.  The hearing could be  over  in  about
         two minutes and I do not see any dishonesty in  your  case.   There
         was an error and you corrected it.

    That conversation is a conversation which was not the  subject  of  any
    cross-examination by Mr Wilding, but then he  had  no  instructions  on
    that matter.

 7. The conversation is supported by what is said in  the  decision  itself
    where the judge says (in paragraph 8) that Mr Sharma was not  available
    during the course of the hearing but the judge had been advised by  his
    clerk that the appellant had been speaking to  the  Presenting  Officer
    and that he wished to proceed immediately without representation.  That
    is entirely consistent with the conversation which Mr  Chowdhury  spoke
    of, namely that it was not going to make  any  difference  because  the
    hearing would be done in two minutes and he,  the  Presenting  Officer,
    did not see that there was any wrongdoing.

 8. The judge however continues with what occurred at the hearing by saying
    in paragraph 9,

         I went down  to  discuss  the  case  with  the  Appellant  and  the
    Presenting Officer.

    I am not entirely clear as to what the judge meant when he said that he
    went down to discuss the case, but it appears it was  done  within  the
    context of the formal hearing room.  The judge said:-

         The Appellant was insistent  that  he  wished  to  proceed  without
         representation.  The Presenting Officer said he had read the papers
         provided by the Appellant, including the papers produced on the day
         of the hearing, and thought that the  Respondent  may  be  in  some
         difficulties.  He indicated  that  if  the  Appellant  adopted  his
         witness statement, he would not  be  asking  any  cross-examination
         questions.  He had no authority to make  concessions  or  withdraw,
         but would limit his closing submissions to the refusal letter.

 9. The witness statement supported the appellant's claim that he  did  not
    act with any dishonesty, but more importantly,  it  also  supports  the
    evidence  about  what  happened  at  the  hearing,  namely,  that   the
    Presenting Officer had  effectively  agreed  not  to  put  forward  any
    opposition to  the  appellant's  case.  It  is  doubtful  whether  that
    amounted to a concession because the Presenting Officer apparently said
    he had no authority to make any concessions or withdraw.   But  he  did
    the only thing which was available to him and that was not  to  conduct
    any cross-examination or put to the appellant the  issues  which  could
    properly have been put by him, namely the fact that the appellant  made
    no effort to confront his accountant or to require  the  accountant  to
    provide an explanation,  rendering  the  evidence  from  the  appellant
    largely unsupported.  Nevertheless, that is what the Presenting Officer
    said and did.

10. Paragraph 10 of the decision goes further and says that the  Presenting
    Officer said that the papers showed the appellant had received payments
    into his bank account that matched the income  he  had  claimed  to  be
    earning when he made his 2011 application.  I  am  not  satisfied  that
    this is material.  The material consideration was whether  or  not  the
    appellant had dishonestly submitted a tax return which had  dishonestly
    misstated his earnings.

11. In these circumstances the judge reached  a  conclusion  which  he  was
    invited to make by the parties.  It seems to me inconceivable  that  if
    Mr Chowdhury, the appellant,  was  about  to  be  found  to  have  been
    dishonest that he would not have called for his barrister to be present
    at the hearing.  The fact  that  he  agreed  to  continue  without  the
    assistance of his Counsel strongly suggests that  a  conversation  took
    place that rendered it unnecessary for his Counsel to attend.  The fact
    that there was a conversation between the appellant and the  Presenting
    Officer is also evidenced by the concession, (if I can call it that) or
    the statement  made;  the  statement  falling  short  of  a  concession
    perhaps, that he was in 'some difficulties', that  is  a  term  of  art
    which is often used by an advocate to say 'I  realise  that  I  have  a
    problem in establishing my case.'

12. The Presenting Officer may well have  entirely  misconstrued  what  the
    issues were in this case.  In particular I have had my attention  drawn
    to the case of R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]
    UKUT 00384 (IAC).  There is a suggestion that this case was before  the
    judge and so he was made aware of what are the relevant principles;  in
    particular, the way that these cases are proved. It cannot be said that
    he misapplied the law in that he was aware of the  judgment  of  Martin
    Spencer J in Khan.  In these circumstances,  I  do  not  consider  that
    there was a material error conducted by the judge.

13. There is another matter which I can properly say in  relation  to  this
    appeal.  The grounds of appeal do not properly address the  matters  to
    which I have  referred.   Instead  they  talk  of  the  fact  that  the
    Presenting Officer relied upon the refusal letter,  thereby  indicating
    that this case was fully contested.  I do not think that properly deals
    with the situation as recorded by the judge in paragraphs 8  to  10  of
    the decision.  There is also a reference to two reported cases.   I  am
    not going to refer to those cases in detail, but they are  directed  to
    an entirely discrete point, namely reliance by an  appellant  upon  the
    fact that HMRC has not seen fit to issue a penalty notice.  It does not
    seem to me that that principle was germane to this case.  This case was
    properly directed to whether or not  the  Presenting  Officer  felt  he
    could establish wrongdoing.

14. For these reasons I am satisfied that the judge made no material error.
     It is true that his decision is short, but I  console  myself  by  the
    fact that if I were to be remaking the decision  I  would  require  the
    evidence of Mr Chowdhury as to what  took  place.   I  am  told  by  Mr
    Wilding that there is no note on the  file  in  relation  to  what  the
    Presenting Officer said at the hearing; indeed, it  may  no  longer  be
    possible to contact him.  In those circumstances it is likely that  the
    conversation which took place between the appellant and the  Presenting
    Officer would be uncontroversial, and given the conversation that  took
    place it is apparent to me that the Presenting Officer was not  putting
    forward any viable opposition to what the appellant was saying and  he,
    the Presenting Officer, probably mistakenly thought that that would  be
    enough  for  the  appellant  to  succeed  in  his  appeal.   In   those
    circumstances I do not consider that  the  remaking  of  this  decision
    would lead to any substantially different result.
