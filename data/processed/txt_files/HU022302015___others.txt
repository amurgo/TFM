Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Miah of Counsel instructed by Sony Sadaf Haroon
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are nationals of  Bangladesh  and  are  sisters.   Their
    dates of birth are 22nd December 1999, 11th February 2001 and 27th June
    2003, respectively.  Their mother is their sponsor  who  is  a  British
    national, residing in the United Kingdom.

2.   On 27th April 2015, each of the appellants made an  online  application
    for entry clearance to join their mother in the United Kingdom for  the
    purpose of settlement.  On 18th June 2015,  notices  of  decision  were
    issued to each of the appellants refusing their applications  and  they
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   Their appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  R  R  Hopkins  in
    Birmingham on 2nd November 2016.

4.   The Entry Clearance Officer was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellants'
    mother ("the sponsor") had  sole  responsibility  for  the  appellants'
    upbringing.  The Entry Clearance Officer saw  money  receipts  for  the
    period July 2014 to February 2015, but this did not represent the whole
    of the period since the sponsor had been settled in the United  Kingdom
    and the amount  of  �300  per  month  which  had  been  sent,  was  not
    considered to be sufficient to cover  expenses  for  payments  such  as
    school fees and  daily  living  needs.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    believed that the appellants were also being supported by their father.

5.   The Entry Clearance Officer also concluded that the appellants had  not
    demonstrated serious and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations
    which would make their exclusion from the UK  undesirable.   The  judge
    concluded, having properly  directed  himself  on  the  law,  that  the
    responsibility for the appellants' upbringing  is  shared  between  the
    sponsor, their mother and their father.  As a result, they cannot  meet
    the requirements of paragraph 397(i)(e) of the Immigration Rules.   The
    judge went on to consider the requirements of paragraph  397(i)(f)  and
    did not find that they had been met.

6.    The  appellants  challenged  the  judge's  determination   and   their
    challenge related solely  to  his  findings  in  respect  of  paragraph
    397(i)(e).  At paragraph 31 of his determination, the judge said this:

         "The evidence before me is that the appellants' mother started  one
         of her jobs on 1st April 2014 and her other one on 1st August 2014.
          Therefore, it is understandable that she was not in a position  to
         provide financial support for the Appellants prior  to  July  2014.
         But it does not mean that someone else must have  been  maintaining
         them during the 1� years before  then.   No  information  has  been
         provided  as  to  who  was  doing  this.   In  the  absence  of  an
         explanation, I  consider  that  the  most  likely  person  to  have
         provided that support was their father."

7.   The grounds suggested that the judge erred in considering the issue  of
    sole responsibility.  Whilst assessing financial support  available  to
    the appellants, the judge assumes that prior to the sponsor  commencing
    work in the United Kingdom for the preceding one and a half  years,  it
    likely  that  the  father  was  providing  support.   However,  it  was
    submitted that there was clear evidence in the sponsor's statement that
    was before the judge, in which she  confirms  she  received  a  lot  of
    support from the stepmother when she was alive  and  also  states  that
    "the stepmother had income  from  her  land  which  helped  us".   This
    evidence clearly suggested  that  it  was  the  stepmother  who  helped
    support the children, the  grounds  urged.   In  paragraph  10  of  the
    statement of the sponsor, to which  reference  was  made,  the  sponsor
    said:

         "I have always looked after my children on my own.  I did receive a
         lot of support from my stepmother when she was alive.  She also had
         income from her land which helped us.  I have asked for the help of
         my mother-in-law."

8.   The second challenge suggests that while accepting  that  there  was  a
    strong bond between the children and  accepts  there  was  evidence  of
    contact between the children and their mother while she has been in the
    United Kingdom and having accepted that the mother sends �300 per month
    to the applicants to support  them  financially,  and  the  judge  also
    having  accepted  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  the  appellants   had
    developed a stronger bond with her than with their father and that they
    lived with their mother prior to her departure for the United  Kingdom,
    the judge should have attached more  weight  to  those  issues  and  if
    sufficient weight had been given to those factors, then on the  balance
    of probabilities there was clear evidence that  the  sponsor  did  have
    sole responsibility for the three applicants.

9.   At the hearing before me Mr Miah suggested that the judge had used  the
    wrong approach which is evidenced in paragraph 31.  It is not necessary
    that one parent should be supporting the children for a long period  of
    time; the judge accepted  that  the  mother  had  been  supporting  the
    children since July 2014 and when he says at the end of that  paragraph
    that no information has been provided as to who was doing this, he  has
    overlooked what the sponsor said in paragraph 10 of her statement.   He
    noted in paragraph 32 that money transfers bear someone other than  the
    appellants' father's name, but without a statement from that person  as
    to why that arrangement was made.  The judge said that he could not  be
    satisfied that it has not been done,  because  the  appellants'  father
    could not be trusted with the money and it may simply be  that  it  is,
    because it is more convenient for the individual in question to receive
    the funds.  Mr  Miah  pointed  out  that  the  mother  and  father  are
    separated and she sends funds to the third party, because  she  claimed
    she could not trust her husband.  Earlier  in  his  determination,  the
    judge referred to the respondent criticising  a  lack  of  evidence  of
    contact between the appellants and their mother and  said  he  did  not
    regard the absence of such evidence as  an  indication  that  the  bond
    between them was anything other than a  strong  one.   He  went  on  to
    accept that having brought up the  children  it  was  likely  that  the
    sponsor would  have  remained  in  contact  with  them  regularly.   At
    paragraph 27 the judge accepted the sponsor's evidence that he has been
    living in Saudi Arabia for some considerable time and as a  result  the
    appellants have developed a stronger bond with their mother  than  with
    the father.  These were issues, Mr Miah  suggested,  that  should  have
    been taken into account by the  judge  when  reaching  his  conclusion.
    Inadequate weight has been given to the appellants' evidence.

10.  Mr Mills suggested that  the  determination  was  sound  and  that  the
    grounds amounted only to a disagreement with that decision.  They refer
    to the weight to be given by the judge to the evidence but, that  is  a
    matter for the judge and the judge alone.  Far from suggesting that  it
    was help from the  family  that  supported  the  appellants  until  the
    sponsor started working and making payments to the appellants  in  July
    2014, the sponsor mother said in a paragraph of her statement that  she
    received a lot of support from her mother-in-law when she was alive and
    she also had income from her land which helped her and the  appellants.
    That was not the way in which the case was put before  the  judge.   In
    any  event,  this  is  not  the  only  reason  for  doubting  that  the
    appellants' father has some involvement in their life.  He lives in  an
    adjoining building and it has not been claimed that there is no regular
    contact between the children and the  children's  father.   No  medical
    evidence has been submitted in relation  to  the  appellants'  father's
    claimed  depression.   He  also  referred  to  paragraph  37   of   the
    determination where the judge records  that  the  appellants'  mother's
    statement that her husband's presence was necessary for the welfare  of
    the children, but that he is not capable of taking  responsibility  for
    them is a contradiction.

11.  Responding briefly, Mr Miah suggested that it was wrong  of  the  judge
    to refer to a contradiction.  It was much more of an explanation.   The
    appellants' father was necessary for the appellants' welfare  but  that
    does not mean that he was exercising any responsibility.

12.  I reserved my decision.

13.   What  the  judge  noted,  applying  TD  (paragraph  297(i)(e):   "sole
    responsibility")  Yemen  [2016]  UKIAT  00049  (IAC),  is  whether  the
    appellants' mother has had continuing control and  direction  over  the
    appellants' upbringing, including making  all  important  decisions  in
    their lives.  The fact that she has entrusted day to day care to others
    does not necessarily preclude her from having sole responsibility.

14.  The judge is criticised for what he said  at  paragraph  31  but,  with
    very great respect, I do not believe that he has  materially  erred  in
    law by what he said.  For one and a half years prior to July 2014, when
    the sponsor started  work  and  sent  remittances  to  the  appellants,
    someone must have been maintaining them and the sponsor's reference  to
    her step mother does not say that it was financial help  she  gave,  or
    how frequently she gave help.  The judge says that no  information  has
    been provided to him as to who was doing this and, in  the  absence  of
    any explanation, he considers that the most likely  person  to  provide
    that support was their father.  The appellants assert that this ignores
    what their mother said in her statement.

15.  It is clear  from  the  determination  that  the  judge  has  read  the
    sponsor's statement: he refers to it at paragraph  14.   On  the  other
    hand, all the appellants' mother said at paragraph 10 of her  statement
    was that she received a lot of support from her stepmother when she was
    alive.  She does not claim that this was financial support and she does
    not claim that that was during the period after she had left Bangladesh
    and come to the United Kingdom, but before the time  when  she  started
    supporting the children from  her  own  earnings.   Paragraph  10  also
    continues by suggesting that the stepmother also had  income  from  her
    land which "helped us".  It gives no details of the income, in terms of
    how much it was, or how much she received,  or  the  frequency  of  its
    payments and she certainly has not claimed that in the period after she
    left Bangladesh, but before she was in a position to make  payments  to
    the appellants, it was her stepmother who made the payments.  I do  not
    believe therefore that the judge has materially erred in law in what he
    said at paragraph 13.

16.  At paragraph 32 of his determination, the judge merely points out  that
    he is not satisfied that simply because the  money  was  sent  to  some
    third party, rather than to the appellant's father, that meant that the
    appellant's father could not be trusted with money.  As the judge says,
    it could be simply because it is more convenient for the individual  in
    question to receive the funds rather than the father.  So  far  as  the
    second challenge to the determination is concerned, I am satisfied that
    this is nothing more than a series of disagreements with the  decision.
    Of course, if a judge places greater weight on one  piece  of  evidence
    than he does on another, this is likely to affect his decision, but the
    weight to be given to a particular piece of evidence is  a  matter  for
    the judge and for the judge alone.  It cannot in my view be said that a
    reasonable judge could not possibly have come to the same decision when
    considering the evidence.  It is not asserted that the decision of  the
    judge is  perverse.   I  might  very  well  have  reached  a  different
    conclusion to this judge, but that is not the test.

Notice of Decision

17.  Having listened very carefully to  Counsel's  arguments  and  carefully
    considered the determination in the light of the  grounds  submitted  I
    have concluded that the determination does not contain an error of  law
    and shall stand.
