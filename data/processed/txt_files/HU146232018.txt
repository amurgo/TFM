Appearances:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Hussain, Counsel instructed by Simo Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth 1  February  1990,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision to refuse leave  to  remain,
    made on 27 June 2018.  Her appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge
    M Davies, who decided on 18 January 2019  that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds.   Extensive   grounds   seeking
    permission to appeal were drafted by the Specialist  Appeals  Team  but
    not by the Home Office Presenting Officer who had appeared.  Permission
    to appeal was given on 27 February 2019

2.   In fairness to the Respondent, there was some encouragement  to  appeal
    by the brevity of the judge's decision and, without being critical, the
    somewhat cursory analysis of the law which pertained to Article 8  ECHR
    claims being pursued where a person has not succeeded under the  Rules.
    The substance of the principal criticism of the Appellant was that  she
    had used deception to gain entry into the UK in claiming that  she  was
    single  which  was  clearly  found  not  to  be  so  and  that  in  the
    circumstances there  had  been  a  failure  to  properly  consider  the
    Appellant's immigration status and  circumstances  when  assessing  the
    Article 8 ECHR claim: In particular the  consideration  of  the  public
    interest in the context of Sections 117A and 117B of the NIAA 2002.

3.   Having considered this matter in argument, I note that there may  be  a
    somewhat infelicitous explanation of the considerations of  the  burden
    of proof upon a Respondent, bearing in mind it was ultimately  for  the
    judge whether or not the Respondent's decision was  disproportionate  :
    Rather than the burden being upon the Respondent to discharge a  burden
    of proof that it was a proportionate decision.  Proportionality plainly
    lies at the heart of Article 8 ECHR claims and to that extent, although
    the point was not raised in the  wide-ranging  grounds  of  appeal,  it
    seemed to me that that was also an unfortunate matter to  have  arisen.
    Be that as it may, albeit briefly,  I  concluded  the  judge  had  done
    enough to show that he took into account the issues,  the  Respondent's
    position, the considerations of whether or not Article 8(1) rights were
    engaged and the extent to which the Respondent's decision amounted to a
    significant interference.

4.   I might have written or reached a different decision or  I  might  have
    expressed myself more fully in the context of the basis  of  the  claim
    but  I look at this matter in the round and on the  evidence  which  it
    was not said the judge failed to take  into  account  or  evidence  was
    advanced which otherwise indicated an error by omission by the judge.

5.      In those circumstances I concluded the  Original  Tribunal  made  no
    material error of law and, were it another Tribunal  to  look  at  this
    matter upon the basis of the same facts, it seemed to me unlikely  that
    a different decision would have been reached.

DECISION

The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.  The Original  Tribunal's
decision stands.

ANONYMITY ORDER

No anonymity order was made, nor was one sought, nor was one required.

FEE AWARD

A fee of ï¿½140 was paid.  The judge made no order on the issue of  costs  and
it seems to me that that is, in the factual of the case, probably the  right
outcome, even though it would have been helpful if the judge had set  out  a
decision on that point
