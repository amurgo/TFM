 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal against a decision of First-
    tier  Tribunal  Judge  Greasley  promulgated  on  28   February   2014.
    Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge Zucker on 14 April
    2014. I am told by Mr Goodman-Smith, Mr Deller confirming  this  to  be
    so, that the appellant left  the  United  Kingdom  on  24  April  2014.
    Consequently, by operation of s. 104(4) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, Mrs Huang's appeal is treated as abandoned.

Decision

The appellant's appeal has been  abandoned  and  the  determination  of  the
First-tier Tribunal is to remain standing.
