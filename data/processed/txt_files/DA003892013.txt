                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe who was born on  March  1989.
       He is 24  years  old.  He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the
       respondent made on 17 February 2013  to  make  a  deportation  order
       against him. His appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal  (First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Jackson and  Mr  A  P  Richardson  JP).  In  its
       determination promulgated on 12 June 2013, the panel  dismissed  his
       appeal, concluding that the appellant's  history  of  offending  was
       such as to render his removal  proportionate  and  that  the  public
       interest in favour of his removal outweighed the preservation of the
       private and family life that the  appellant  had  developed  in  the
       United Kingdom.


    The issue - paragraph 75 of Maslov


    2. The appellant has appealed to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  principal
       ground of appeal is that, as a  result  of  the  appellant's  lawful
       presence in the United Kingdom since his arrival as a visitor on  26
       January 2002, he is settled in the United Kingdom and is, therefore,
       subject to the stringent requirements contained within paragraph  75
       of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights  in  Maslov  v
       Austria 1638/03 [2008] ECHR 546, [2009] INLR 47, expressed in  these
       terms:


         "In short, the Court considers that for a settled migrant  who  was
         lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
         youth in the host country very  serious  reasons  are  required  to
         justify expulsion."


    3. In the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  panel  rejected  the  appellant's
       submission that the test set out in Maslov had any application.


    4. Although there is a secondary challenge to the panel's determination
       asserting that the panel erred in law  in  concluding  that  it  was
       disproportionate to remove the appellant,  no  detailed  submissions
       were made before us in relation to this element of the  appeal  and,
       for the reasons that will follow, we reject  it.   Accordingly,  the
       focus of the appeal before  us  was  directed  towards  whether  the
       appellant's case fell to be determined on the basis that  he  was  a
       settled migrant who had lawfully spent all or the major part of  his
       childhood and youth in the United Kingdom  thereby  requiring  'very
       serious reasons' to justify his expulsion.

    5. It is common ground that, were there such a requirement, neither the
       respondent nor the First-tier Tribunal approached the appeal in this
       manner and the appellant was therefore entitled to have its decision
       set aside for error on a point of law and to be able to re-argue his
       appeal, including the production of additional evidence.

Immigration history and the letter of 5 February 2002

    6. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 26 January 2002 with his
       brother and was granted leave to enter as a visitor until 9 February
       2002.  He  was  then  aged  13.  On  5  February  2002,  during  the
       subsistence of his leave to remain as a visitor, his mother wrote  a
       letter to the Home Office (misdated 5 February 2001). The letter  is
       found at A1 of the respondent's bundle. The letter  is  date-stamped
       as received on 13 February 2002 which is after the appellant's leave
       to remain as  a  visitor  had  expired.  However,  throughout  these
       proceedings the respondent has treated this letter  as  having  been
       served on 5 February 2002  and,  therefore,  within  the  period  of
       extant leave. It was not argued by Mr Deller that we  should  depart
       from that position. The letter, where material, stated:



                   Ref: Application for Extension to Stay in the UK


         I hereby apply for the extension of stay for my sons.  I  [am]  the
         mother of the above named children and I am on a student  visa.  My
         sons came into the country on 26 January [2002] and were given  two
         weeks to stay in the UK - up to 9 February [2002]. The  immigration
         officer who attended to them went by the date  that  was  on  their
         tickets. The uncle who purchased tickets  had  requested  for  open
         tickets because they were not so sure when they would  be  able  to
         have them back since their aunt, who has been looking  after  them,
         is not well - she has got cancer of the cervix and I am  told  that
         her condition has since deteriorated. My husband died and presently
         there is no one else, back home, to look after them. So I would  be
         looking after them until the aunt is well."


    7. Nothing was done by the respondent in relation to  that  letter.  It
       is, however, as well to point out that, according to  its  contents,
       the appellant's mother was a student and the Immigration Rules  then
       in force permitted entry clearance to  be  granted  to  children  of
       students in accordance with paragraphs 79 to 81 of the Rules.

The application of 23 May 2005

    8. A further application was made for leave to remain on 23  May  2005.
       This was at a time when the appellant was aged 16 and was made under
       cover of a letter from Circle 5 Ancillary Services Ltd in  which  it
       was said that the applicant's husband and father of the children had
       died in  Botswana  in  1995  where  he  had  worked  as  a  security
       consultant.

    9. The applications made by the appellant's mother and his brother were
       granted on 22 April 2009, each being provided with indefinite  leave
       to remain. However, the application of the appellant was not decided
       as a result of the appellant's  history  of  offending.  The  letter
       dated 13 November 2009  [I1 of the respondent's bundle] stated:


         "Unfortunately, as you have not been granted  Leave  in  line  with
         your mother, you should not be attending college  as  you  have  no
         Leave in the United Kingdom at this moment in time. A decision  has
         yet been made on your case."

The appellant's criminal offending

   10.  On 8 February 2008, the appellant was convicted  at  Kingston  upon
       Thames Crown Court on six counts of robbery, attempted  robbery  and
       assault with intent to rob. He was sentenced to 3 years and 8 months
       imprisonment. The sentencing judge commented as follows:


         "The robberies to which you three have pleaded guilty were numerous
         and serious and they share a number of aggravating features but  in
         essence you are all part of a gang of predators roaming the streets
         of south and south-west London  from  Croydon  through  Wallington,
         right round to Twickenham and many points in between,  looking  for
         vulnerable victims and when you found them stopping  your  car  and
         then robbing them using, if they resisted you, violence  and  doing
         that at night.
         In each case, as I have just said, they were committed at night and
         you, the only inference one can draw obviously, went out  with  the
         express purpose of robbery in mind; accordingly, they were planned.
         You chose victims who were alone, they were not  women,  they  were
         not elderly, they were men, they were not unduly  young,  but  they
         were alone and,  if  possible,  you  chose  victims  who  had  been
         drinking. You were habitually in a  group  when  the  attacks  took
         place, no doubt one of you remaining in the car  while  the  others
         approached, surrounded and  attacked  the  victim,  by  your  group
         behaviour adding greatly to the sense of intimidation of the victim
         you had chosen.
         Sometimes one of you implied that a weapon was present.
         On one occasion  those  who  did  the  robbing  did  actually  use
    violence...
         The offences went on over a period of nearly  4  weeks  throughout,
         therefore, August of last year, more or less.  In  the  result  you
         each committed at least seven offences. In the  case  of  you  [the
         appellant], there were eight...
         [In dealing with whether there was a significant  risk  of  serious
         harm to the public  caused  by  the  appellant  committing  further
         offences] In the case of you [the appellant], I am  bound  to  make
         the assumption that there is such a risk unless I  regard  that  as
         unreasonable and I do not  regard  it  as  unreasonable.  In  other
         words, the assumption is displaced and  the  principal  reason  for
         that is that as a matter of fact, it might even be luck, but  as  a
         matter of fact these activities and your previous  convictions  did
         not result in serious physical harm to any member of the public and
         nor did any of the other previous  convictions  or  those  offences
         achieve that.
         [In relation to the appellant], it cannot be said that you have  no
         relevant previous convictions because you have two convictions  for
         robbery, actually one attempt and one robbery in 2005 and 2006.  I,
         nonetheless, bear in mind in your favour your pleas of guilty...  I
         bear in mind, as in the other cases, that no weapons were used  and
         that no serious injuries were done, although there were injuries to
         some people. You are still only 18..."


   11. The appellant was released on licence. He was subsequently  notified
       that he was liable to automatic deportation on 1 February 2010.  The
       licence was revoked  on  12  April  2010  as  a  result  of  further
       offending which was committed on 14 March 2010 and 12 April 2010.


   12. On 21 October 2010, the appellant  was  convicted  at  Inner  London
       Crown Court of robbery, committed on 10 April  2010  (aged  21)  for
       which offence he was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months imprisonment.
       In his sentencing remarks, HH Judge Chapple said:


         This was a dreadful robbery. The victim has been described as  old.
         She was in fact only 56 years of age but she has  certainly  become
         old as a result of this incident. This innocent, vulnerable  victim
         was walking home after a pleasant  night  out  with  friends  in  a
         suburban part of London in Streatham. On the  doorway  of  her  own
         house she was set upon by three men, one or more  of  them  wearing
         hoods. She was manhandled in a violent and abusive way in  her  own
         house and there she was robbed. Somebody, who  has  got  away,  was
         kicking  her  and  hitting  her   aggressively   and   ferociously.
         That...certainly  was  not  you,  [the  appellant].  There  was  no
         evidence that you struck her at all but this was a joint enterprise
         and you must all accept responsibility for the  fact  that  she  is
         never going to be fully recovered from that incident.  She  is  now
         scared to go out. She has changed the locks of her house. She still
         doesn't feel safe at home. It was a dreadful offence and  you  [the
         appellant] have a very bad record for robberies. However, I  accept
         that those occurred when you were a  juvenile  and  you  have  been
         responding and there is a lot that can be said in  your  favour....
         Bearing in mind that you pleaded guilty at  the  first  opportunity
         and your genuine remorse...[t]he sentence  on  you  is  one  of  3�
         years."


   13. On 25 March 2011, the appellant was convicted at  Blackfriars  Crown
       Court of conspiracy to commit robbery on 14 March  2010  (also  aged
       21), the month before the offences for which he received a  sentence
       of 3 years and 6 months imprisonment. He was sentenced  to  5  years
       imprisonment on  21  October  2010.  On  14  March  2010,  a  family
       jewellery business in Green Lanes was entered just after 6.30 in the
       evening by at least two robbers. It was  likely  that  the  gang  of
       robbers numbered somewhere in the region of six. The  appellant  was
       acting as a lookout. None of the robbers was armed. Two  members  of
       the business were hit and rings were stolen.  The  sentencing  judge
       made the following comments as to the appellant:


         "I want to make it abundantly clear that I accept that you did  not
         go into the shop. I accept that you were in the vicinity acting  as
         a lookout and no more  than  that.  However,  your  record  is  for
         someone of your age almost as bad as one could imagine.  I  suspect
         that the sentence Judge Chapple would have passed  at  the  end  of
         last year at Inner London would have been obviously  in  excess  of
         the 44 months that he passed if he  was  sentencing  you  for  this
         matter as well. I am going to put myself as it were in the position
         that Judge Chapple might have been. I am going to pass a  sentence,
         in other words the sentence I am about to pass will start today but
         it has to be and will be  greater  than  the  44  months  that  was
         imposed on you by Judge Chapple."


   14. This is truly heinous offending in relation to  which  there  is  an
       almost overwhelming public interest  in  removing  its  author,  the
       appellant, notwithstanding his presence in the United Kingdom  since
       2002 when he was aged 13.  The appellant's record since his  arrival
       in the United Kingdom in 2002 involves offences  which  resulted  in
       convictions in 2005 and 2006, in 2008, 2010 and 2011.

The appellant's claim to settled status

   15. Bearing in mind the fact that the appellant, since  his  arrival  11
       years ago on 26 January 2002, has only been granted leave  to  enter
       as a visitor for a fortnight, it  is  perhaps  surprising  that  the
       Upper Tribunal is now invited to treat the appellant as one who is a
       settled migrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part of  his
       childhood and youth in the host country and, for that reason  alone,
       entitled  to  the  more  favourable  treatment  associated  with   a
       requirement that  very  serious  reasons  are  required  to  justify
       expulsion.

   16. The basis for this submission is said to be the  legal  consequences
       that flow from the letter written by the  appellant's  mother  on  5
       February 2002 which we have set out above.  It  is  said  that  this
       letter amounted to a lawful application for a variation of leave  to
       which the  respondent  has  never  provided  a  response;  that  the
       application made for indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  2005  was  a
       variation of it which has not yet been decided and that the combined
       effect of the applications made in 2002 and 2005 has been to  extend
       the appellant's lawful presence by the  operation  of  s.3C  of  the
       Immigration Act 1971 (as  initially  amended  and  subsequently  re-
       amended) so as to render the appellant's presence both  lawful  and,
       (by the judicious application of the  principles  contained  in  the
       decision of ED v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 39), settled.

Continuation of leave pending decision

   17. When the February 2002 letter was written, the Immigration Act  1971
       had been amended by the insertion of s.3C:


         "Continuation of leave pending decision


         (1) This section applies if -
         a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the  United
            Kingdom applies to the Secretary  of  State,  before  his  leave
            expires, for it to be varied ; and
         b) when it expires, no decision has been taken on the application.


         (2) His leave is to be treated as continuing until the end  of  the
         period allowed under rules made under...the Immigration and  Asylum
         Act  1999  for  bringing  an  appeal  against  a  decision  on  the
         application.


         (3) An application for a variation of a person's leave to enter  or
         remain in the United Kingdom may not be made  while  the  leave  is
         treated as continuing as a result of this section.

         (4) But subsection  (3)  does  not  prevent  the  variation  of  an
         application mentioned in subsection (1).


   18. Hence, if the letter  of  5  February  2002  amounted  to  a  lawful
       application it  had  been  made  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the
       appellant's visitor's leave, due to expire on 9  February  2002  and
       which had  not  been  decided  by  then.  Accordingly,  leave  would
       continue until an appealable decision had been made and  would  then
       continue until the time  for  appealing  had  expired.  Further,  by
       operation of Part II of Schedule 4 to the Immigration and Asylum Act
       1999, during the pendency of any appeal, there  would  have  been  a
       further continuation of leave pursuant to paragraph 17 (1).


   19. It was, of course, conceded by Mr Sills, on behalf of the appellant,
       that the application made for indefinite leave to remain on  24  May
       2005 could not  have  the  effect,  in  itself,  of  continuing  the
       appellant's leave because this application was made some years after
       the appellant's leave had expired on 9 February  2002.  Further,  he
       accepted that s.3C (either as amended or  as  re-amended)  prevented
       the appellant making a further application during  the  pendency  of
       the application made on 5 February 2002.  However, by virtue of  the
       re-amended s.3C, this did not prevent, he submitted,  the  appellant
       varying  the  2002  application.  Accordingly,   he   asserted   the
       application for indefinite leave to remain of  24  May  2005  should
       properly be classified as a variation of the  2002  application.  In
       this way, the appellant could rely upon an unbroken chain of  lawful
       continuation leave commencing on 5 February 2002. Thus,  he  submits
       that the appellant has enjoyed the status of a lawful visitor  since
       2002.


   20. Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 was substituted by  operation
       of s.118 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act,  2002  with
       effect from 1 April 2003:


         Continuation of leave pending variation decisionE+W+S+N.I.


         3C (1) This section applies if-
             (a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain  in  the
             United Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State for variation
             of the leave,
             (b) the application for variation is  made  before  the  leave
             expires, and
             (c) the leave expires without the  application  for  variation
             having been decided.


         (2)The leave is extended by  virtue  of  this  section  during  any
         period when-
             (a) the application  for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
         withdrawn,
             (b) an appeal under section 82(1) of the  Nationality,  Asylum
             and Immigration Act 2002 could be brought [while the appellant
             is  in  the  United  Kingdom]  against  the  decision  on  the
             application for variation  (ignoring  any  possibility  of  an
             appeal out of time with permission), or
             (c)  an  appeal  under  that  section  against  that  decision
             [brought while the appellant is in  the  United  Kingdom,]  is
             pending (within the meaning of section 104 of that Act).


         (4)A person may not make an application for variation of his  leave
         to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  while  that  leave  is
         extended by virtue of this section.


         (5)But subsection  (4)  does  not  prevent  the  variation  of  the
         application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).


   21. However the substitution does not significantly alter the  basis  of
       the appellant's contentions or the process by which continuation  of
       leave arises by operation of law. There were transitional provisions
       set out in SI 2003/754. The words in brackets in  subsection  (2)(b)
       and (c) were substituted by s. 11 of  the  Immigration,  Nationality
       and Asylum Act 2006 with effect from 31 August 2006  (SI  2006/2226)
       applying to applications made before that date in respect  of  which
       no decision had been made, as it applies to applications made on  or
       after that date.


   22. It was accepted by Mr Deller that the outcome of the appeal  depends
       upon what the Upper Tribunal construes  to  be  the  effect  of  the
       letter of 5 February 2002.



The former paragraph 32 of the Immigration Rules

   23. As from 30 July 2000 (HC 704), paragraph 32 of the Immigration Rules
       provided:


         After admission to  the  United  Kingdom  any  application  for  an
         extension of the time limit on or variation of  condition  attached
         to a person's stay in the United Kingdom must be made to  the  Home
         Office before the applicant's current  leave  to  enter  or  remain
         expires.
         With  the  exception  of  applications  made  under  paragraph  31A
         (applications  at  the  port  of  entry)  and  paragraph  33  (work
         permits), 33A  (applications  made  outside  the  United  Kingdom),
         paragraphs 255 to 257 (EEA nationals) and  Part  11  (asylum),  all
         applications for variation of leave to enter or remain must be made
         using the form prescribed for  the  purpose  by  the  Secretary  of
         State, which must be completed in the manner required by  the  form
         and to be accompanied by the documents and photographs specified in
         the form. An application for such a variation made in any other way
         is not valid.

   24. Mr Sills submits that the 5 February 2002 letter was an  application
       for a variation of the appellant's leave made on the basis that  its
       refusal (and the concomitant decision to remove the appellant) would
       amount to a violation of  the  appellant's  human  rights  and  this
       application did not  require  a  prescribed  form.  We  reject  that
       submission for two reasons. First, it is accepted by him  that  this
       was an application for variation of leave to remain  in  the  United
       Kingdom. Between January and February  2002,  the  appellant  was  a
       visitor and the letter purports to seek an extension of stay in  the
       United  Kingdom.  Further,  as  a  student,  it  was  open  to   the
       appellant's  mother,  on  the  appellant's  behalf,  to  seek  entry
       clearance as the dependant of the holder of a  valid  student  visa,
       provided the appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
       Rules.   Whilst the appellant's mother was  seeking  permission  for
       her two children to remain with her in the United Kingdom, this  was
       not a human rights claim. Second, even if  it  was  a  human  rights
       claim it did not fall within any of the exceptions contained  within
       paragraph 32 of the Rules as we have set  out  above  and  therefore
       there was a mandatory  requirement  (it  being  an  application  for
       variation of leave to remain) that it be made using  the  prescribed
       form. An application for such a variation made in any other way  was
       invalid.

   25. For these  reasons,  we  are  satisfied  that  there  was  no  valid
       application made by the appellant during a period  of  extant  leave
       sufficient to engage the continuation provisions of  section  3C  of
       the Immigration Act 1971.

   26. There is nothing in the application made in 2005  that  assists  the
       appellant in construing the 2002 application. The application itself
       and the letter under cover of which it was served make no  reference
       to an earlier undecided application or  that  the  2005  application
       seeks to vary it. The application in 2005  was  an  application  for
       indefinite leave to remain on the part of the mother  with  her  two
       children as her dependants. It cannot reasonably be construed  as  a
       variation of the appellant's application contained in  a  letter  of
       February 2002 which did not  seek  any  variation  of  the  mother's
       student's leave. We agree with Mr  Deller's  submission  that  those
       seeking leave to remain do not always understand the nature  of  the
       application that they are making and a certain  amount  of  latitude
       must be provided to applicants in person when considering the nature
       of the application they are making. However,  such  latitude  cannot
       alter the nature of an application to one which  is  unrecognisable.
       The application of 2002 on the appellant's behalf cannot properly be
       construed as the same application that the  appellant's  mother  was
       making in 2005.

Does the appellant enjoy settled status? Maslov and ED (Ghana)

   27. Were we to be wrong, it then becomes necessary for  us  to  consider
       whether an application that was made in  2002  but  has  never  been
       decided, notwithstanding the passage  of  time  of  some  11  years,
       places the appellant in a position  where  he  must  be  treated  as
       "settled" in the United Kingdom within the meaning of that  term  as
       used by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in Maslov.  This  submission,
       of course, pays scant regard for the fact that since at least  2009,
       the Secretary of State has consistently  made  her  position  clear,
       namely, that the appellant's offending was sufficiently  serious  to
       differentiate  between  the  position  of  the  appellant  and   the
       applications of his mother and brother  who  were  each  successful.
       Furthermore, it pays no regard to the letters that were sent to  the
       appellant indicating that in light of his convictions he was  liable
       to automatic deportation; that he was required  to  respond  to  the
       notice of liability to  automatic  deportation  and  submit  further
       evidence relating to his family life.


   28. Before considering what was meant by  the  expression  "settled"  or
       "settled migrant" as used in Maslov, it  is  clear  that  the  Grand
       Chamber did not use the term in the same way as it is defined within
       United Kingdom immigration law or  as  being  equivalent  to  having
       indefinite leave to remain under the Immigration  Rules.  That  does
       not, of course, necessarily mean, as Mr  Sills  submitted,  that  it
       equates to  lawful  presence.   Nevertheless,  its  meaning  is  not
       entirely clear. Whilst we should not  attempt  to  define  what  the
       Grand Chamber meant by it, we can say that it clearly relates to the
       security of residence of a person  present  in  a  country.   It  is
       clearly distinct from the  presence  of  an  entrant  who  has  been
       temporarily admitted or subject to a finite limitation in time.

   29.  In Maslov v Austria 1638/03 [2008] ECHR 546,  [2009]  INLR  47  the
       ECtHR considered the case of a Bulgarian national, Juri Maslov, born
       in October 1984 who at  the  age  of  6,  lawfully  entered  Austria
       together with his parents and two siblings. Subsequently, he  became
       legally  resident  in  Austria.  His   parents   acquired   Austrian
       nationality. The applicant attended school in Austria.  On  8  March
       1999 he was granted an unlimited settlement permit (indefinite leave
       to  remain).   On  7  September  1999   the  Vienna  Juvenile  Court
       convicted the applicant (aged 14) on 22 counts  of  aggravated  gang
       burglary and attempted aggravated gang  burglary;  forming  a  gang;
       extortion; assault; and unauthorised use  of  a  vehicle,  committed
       between November 1998 and June 1999. He was sentenced to 18  months'
       imprisonment, 13 of which were suspended on probation.

   30. On 25 May 2000, the applicant was further convicted on 18 counts  of
       aggravated burglary and attempted aggravated burglary and  sentenced
       him to 15 months' imprisonment. The suspension of  the  prison  term
       imposed by the judgment of 7 September  1999  was  revoked  and  the
       applicant served his prison term.

   31. On 3 January 2001 the Vienna Federal Police Authority imposed a ten-
       year exclusion order on the applicant  on  the  basis  that  it  was
       contrary to the public interest to allow him to stay in Austria  any
       longer.

   32. The applicant submitted that the exclusion order violated his rights
       under Article 8 of the Convention. He also referred to s.38(1)(4) of
       a 1997 Aliens Act, pursuant to which an exclusion order could not be
       issued against an alien who had been lawfully  residing  in  Austria
       from an early age.

   33.  Using  proceedings  akin  to   judicial   review,   the   applicant
       unsuccessfully challenged the decision.  The applicant was  released
       from prison on 24 May 2002 and deported to Sofia in  December  2003.
       The applicant did not commit any further offences  in  Bulgaria  and
       had found employment there.

   34. In the Grand Chamber judgment, the  Court  referred  to  the  United
       Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of  20 November  1989
       and the fact that the  applicant  was  a  Union  citizen  exercising
       Treaty rights and subject to the limitations  imposed  by  Directive
       2004/38 as informing the proportionality on removal.

   35. Neither of these considerations applies  to  the  appellant  in  the
       present appeal as the appellant is  not  a  Union  citizen  and  the
       appellant was not a minor when he committed the later, more serious,
       offences.

   36. In applying the established Article 8 case-law,  including  �ner  v.
       the Netherlands (no. 46410/99) criteria, the Chamber emphasised  the
       fact that the applicant had come to Austria with his family  at  the
       age of 6, spoke German and had  received  his  entire  schooling  in
       Austria, that the offences committed by him, although of  a  certain
       gravity, were rather typical examples of juvenile  delinquency  and,
       with one exception, did not  involve  any  acts  of  violence.   The
       Chamber attached weight to the period of good  conduct  between  the
       applicant's release from prison in May 2002 and his  deportation  in
       December 2003, the solidity of his social, cultural and family  ties
       in Austria and the lack  of  ties  with  Bulgaria,  his  country  of
       origin.  As  regards  his  knowledge  of  Bulgarian,  the  applicant
       asserted at the hearing that his  family  belonged  to  the  Turkish
       minority in Bulgaria. He therefore had no  knowledge  of  Bulgarian.
       It found that there had  been  a  violation  of  Article  8  of  the
       Convention.  These criteria  cannot  assist  the  appellant  in  the
       appeal before us.  The appellant in the present appeal is  not  able
       to draw upon these factors as Maslov was.

   37. The Grand Chamber referred to Boultif (Appn no 54273/2000) in  which
       the Court elaborated the relevant criteria which  it  would  use  in
       order to assess whether an expulsion  measure  was  necessary  in  a
       democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate  aim  pursued
       as set out in para 40 of the Chamber judgment, as well  as  further
       elaborating the criteria to include:


           i) the  best  interests  and  well-being  of  the  children,  in
              particular the seriousness  of  the  difficulties  which  any
              children of the applicant are  likely  to  encounter  in  the
              country to which the  applicant  is  to  be  expelled.   When
              assessing  the  nature  and  seriousness  of   the   offences
              committed by an applicant, it has to be  taken  into  account
              whether he or she committed them as a juvenile or as an adult
          ii) the solidity of social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the
              host country and with the country of destination.


   38. The Court concluded:


       1. In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's stay in the
          country from which he or she is to be expelled and  the  solidity
          of the social, cultural and family ties with the host country, it
          evidently makes a difference whether  the  person  concerned  had
          already come to the country during his or her childhood or youth,
          or was even born there, or whether he or  she  only  came  as  an
          adult. This tendency is also  reflected  in  various  Council  of
          Europe instruments,  in  particular  in  Committee  of  Ministers
          Recommendations Rec (2001)15 and Rec (2002)4 (see paragraphs  34-
          35 above).
       1. Although  Article  8  provides  no  absolute  protection  against
          expulsion for any category of aliens (see �ner,  cited  above,  �
          55), including those who were born in the host country  or  moved
          there in their early childhood, the Court has already found  that
          regard is to be had to the special situation of aliens  who  have
          spent most, if not all, their childhood in the host country, were
          brought up there and received their education there (see �ner,  �
          58 in fine).
       1. In short, the Court considers that for a settled migrant who  has
          lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her childhood  and
          youth in the host country very serious reasons  are  required  to
          justify expulsion. This is all  the  more  so  where  the  person
          concerned committed the offences underlying the expulsion measure
          as a juvenile.
       2. Finally, the Court reiterates that national authorities  enjoy  a
          certain  margin  of  appreciation  when  assessing   whether   an
          interference with a right protected by Article 8 was necessary in
          a democratic society and  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
          pursued.


   39. It is within this context that we have to assess the  words  of  the
       Grand Chamber that for a settled migrant who has lawfully spent  all
       or the major part of his or her childhood  and  youth  in  the  host
       country very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion.   It
       is not a rule of law but a factor to be taken into  account  in  the
       proportionality balance, along with  such  other  factors  (as  they
       applied in Maslov's case) as the fact that he  was  a  juvenile  and
       that the offences were 'typical  examples  of  juvenile  delinquency
       and, with one exception, did not involve any acts of violence'.  The
       term is not a legal  term  and  is  not  to  be  confused  with  the
       definition of that term within the Immigration Act 1971.


   40. Importantly, however, in the context of our appeal is the fact  that
       Maslov had been granted an unlimited settlement permit which we take
       to equate with the grant of indefinite leave  to  remain.   It  thus
       becomes clear why the Strasbourg Court  was  able  to  classify  the
       appellant as a settled migrant who had also lawfully  spent  all  or
       the major part of his childhood and  youth  in  Austria.   There  is
       nothing in this expression to support  the  contention  that  lawful
       periods of residence in the host country  in  themselves  amount  to
       being settled there.  All the more so since Maslov was settled there
       by reason of the grant of indefinite leave to remain in his  favour.
        This is not, of course, to say that periods of lawful residence  in
       the host country are not material in  the  proportionality  balance.
       What it does do, however, is to make it plain that lawful  residence
       and settled status are not synonymous.

   41. As importantly, the nature of continuation leave has  to  be  viewed
       for what it is.  In the case of an entrant who  makes  a  claim  for
       asylum which is found to have no substance in it, the claimant  will
       never have had a right to remain by reason of his claim save a right
       to remain (perhaps more accurately a right not to be removed) during
       the period his claim is  being  considered  and  during  the  appeal
       process, if the claim is refused by the Secretary of State.   During
       this period his presence is lawful only in the limited sense that he
       must be permitted to remain pending the outcome of  his  case  where
       the question of lawfulness is determined solely  with  reference  to
       domestic law, ST (Eritrea), R (on the application of) v SSHD  [2012]
       UKSC 12.  However, in no sense can his  presence  be  classified  as
       settled.  Even if a claimant succeeds or he has  the  benefit  of  a
       successful appeal in this case, he does not, retrospectively  as  it
       were, become settled during the decision-appeal process, far less if
       the claim fails or the appeal does not result in a decision  in  his
       favour.  Settled migrant status is a matter of fact but is not to be
       equated with lawful residence, however long the period of  residence
       might be.

   42. Notwithstanding this, the appellant relies upon the decision of  the
       Court of Appeal in ED (Ghana) (sometimes referred to as  D)  v  SSHD
       [2012] EWCA Civ 39 (31 January 2012).  ED was  born  on  19  October
       1990 and was 21 when his case was considered by the Court of Appeal.
        He was born in Ghana but arrived in the United Kingdom at  the  age
       of 6, in or about May 1997, in the care of his father  and  together
       with a number of his siblings. When aged 11,  his  father  abandoned
       his children when he returned to Ghana. ED lived with foster carers,
       under  the  overall  supervision  of  the   local   authority.   His
       application for indefinite leave to remain was refused on 27 January
       2010 when he was aged 20,  having  spent  14  years  in  the  United
       Kingdom,  because  he  was  not  lawfully  within  the  jurisdiction
       (notwithstanding the fact as a minor this was not under his control)
       but also because of his criminal conduct.  This involved a series of
       what can only be described as not very  serious  offences  the  most
       serious of which resulted in a 16 week suspended prison sentence and
       a 12 month community order for possession of an offensive weapon  (a
       knuckle duster) which resulted in a further court appearance for non-
       compliance.  The appellant failed in his appeal  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and, in the Upper Tribunal,  Judge  Parkes  could  find  no
       fault with the determination.  In granting permission to  appeal  to
       the Court of Appeal Sir  Richard  Buxton  granted  permission  on  a
       limited basis:


         "The case raises the issue of whether the pattern of  offending  of
         moderate seriousness coupled with disobedience to court orders  and
         lack of assurance of future non-offending...can in the  case  of  a
         near-juvenile meet the criterion of seriousness of  offending  that
         is envisaged as required to justify  expulsion  in,  e.g.,  Maslov.
         This  is  a  question  of  some  importance  not  to  my  knowledge
         previously determined, and therefore suitable for a second appeal."

   43. Although it was unclear on the evidence whether  the  appellant  had
       entered the UK lawfully or unlawfully, for the majority of his  time
       in the UK he had been present unlawfully. Consideration was given to
       the passage in  Maslov  by  reference  to  what  had  been  said  in
       paragraph 31 of JO (Uganda) and JT (Ivory Coast) [2010] EWCA Civ 10:



         'The first  sentence  of  the  Maslov  judgement  ('for  a  settled
         immigrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part  of  his  or
         her childhood and youth in the host country, very  serious  reasons
         are required to justify expulsion) does not apply in terms  to  the
         removal of a person who has spent his  life  in  the  host  country
         unlawfully, but the fact that person has been there since childhood
         is  still  weighty  consideration  in  the  article   8   balancing
         exercise'.

   44. The appellant submitted that Maslov v  Austria  established  a  test
       whereby the decision maker  must  find  "very  serious  reasons"  to
       justify the removal of an  individual  to  whom  the  test  relates.
       Although it could not be said that ED had been  present  in  the  UK
       "lawfully" in immigration terms, the "very specific" facts  of  ED's
       case meant that Maslov nevertheless did apply to his case.   If  the
       "very special reasons" test  applied,  then  the  immigration  judge
       failed to apply it thereby falling into error as a  matter  of  law.
       This is exactly similar to the point made by  Mr  Sills  before  us.
       However, in ED the Court of Appeal raised an issue as to whether the
       local  authority  could  or  should  have  taken  steps  during  the
       appellant's minority to regularise his stay in the United Kingdom by
       seeking leave to remain.  Had it done so, the  argument  appears  to
       have suggested, ED would have been granted leave during his minority
       thereby rendering his presence lawful.  McFarlane LJ acknowledged in
       paragraph 27 of his judgment that this  was  an  argument  generated
       from the Bench, rather than resulting from the  careful  preparation
       of counsel and concluded, on reflection, that it took the matter  no
       further in terms of establishing some additional legal factor  which
       stood separately and alone for consideration amongst the others that
       fed  into  'the  ultimate  balancing  exercise  aimed  at  measuring
       necessity and proportionality'.  This last expression is telling; it
       reinforces the view that  these  cases  are  all  exercises  in  the
       conduct of  the  balance  required  to  assess  proportionality.  He
       concluded:


       1. Once the point generated by the court has been laid to rest,  the
          case for the appellant falls back starkly on the argument  raised
          by [the appellant's counsel] that in some way the  very  specific
          facts of this case move ED, as a matter of law, under  the  "very
          special reasons" umbrella of Maslov despite the fact that he  has
          been in this jurisdiction "unlawfully".
       2. For my part, having looked carefully at the extract from  JO  and
          JT to which reference has been made, I cannot see  any  room  for
          manoeuvre that would allow the very specific facts of the case to
          alter what is a strict and  plainly  expressed  legal  structure.
          Either an individual's presence  is  "lawful"  or  "unlawful"  in
          immigration terms. The determination of that status then in  turn
          indicates whether or not the  need  for  "very  special  reasons"
          applies to his case. ED cannot claim "lawful" status.  Therefore,
          as a matter of law, Maslov does not apply to  his  case  and  the
          judge was entirely correct in the approach that she took.


   45. It  is  apparent  from  the  judgment  that  McFarlane  LJ  was  not
       sanctioning the creation of a new legal test in which 'very  special
       reasons' were required to justify removal but  merely  stating  that
       the appellant could not raise this factor in aid in a case where, as
       a matter of fact, the  appellant  had  not  been  present  lawfully,
       albeit during a period of his minority.  The issue  of  whether  the
       appellant was settled in  the  United  Kingdom  was  not  apparently
       raised at all as a discrete issue; indeed, it did  not  need  to  be
       since, if  the  appellant  was  not  present  lawfully,  no  further
       consideration needed to be given to the passage in Maslov.  Mr Sills
       submitted that the Court of  Appeal  equated  lawful  presence  with
       being settled.  We do not agree with that  analysis.   Consequently,
       in the appeal before us, this central plank of the appellant's  case
       collapses.

Conclusions on Maslov and ED (Ghana)

   46. We conclude:

             i) The assessment of  proportionality  requires  the  decision-
                maker to decide the issue on the basis of a consideration of
                all material factors.  In the case of a person who  is  both
                lawfully present and settled in the UK, this will inevitably
                be a material factor in the  assessment  of  proportionality
                such that particularly good reasons - very special reasons -
                will be required to justify expulsion in a way that will not
                arise in the case of a person who is present  unlawfully  or
                who is not settled.
            ii) The passage in paragraph 75 of Maslov that  'for  a  settled
                migrant who was lawfully spent all or the major part of  his
                or her childhood and youth in the host country very  serious
                reasons are required to justify  expulsion'  is  not  to  be
                construed as a statute or a rigid legal test that a decision-
                maker is required to address specifically  so  that,  if  he
                fails to do so, the failure will amount to  an  error  on  a
                point of law.

Article 8

   47. The grounds of  appeal  challenge  the  Judge's  assessment  of  the
       Article 8 claim but do so [paragraph 4 of the grounds] by  reference
       to the fact that the appellant is settled in the UK, a  point  which
       we  have  rejected.   Accordingly,  the  Article  8   challenge   is
       predicated on a misconception.

   48. Whilst paragraph 5 of the grounds of appeal goes on to make a  wider
       challenge, it is little more than invitation to the  Upper  Tribunal
       to attach more weight to the relationship the appellant has with his
       family in the United Kingdom, a matter which the panel  referred  to
       in the determination with some care.  There is no error on  a  point
       of law.

   49. We have already spoken of the extent and gravity of the  appellant's
       offending.   There  is  eloquent  enough   justification   for   the
       respondent's decision to remove the appellant,  notwithstanding  the
       time he has spent in the United Kingdom  and  the  presence  of  his
       family here.    In  reaching  a  conclusion  that  the  respondent's
       decision properly reflected the balance to  be  struck  between  the
       various competing elements in  the  assessment  of  proportionality,
       there is no prospect whatever  of  the  appellant  establishing  the
       First-tier Tribunal's approach and conclusion was unlawful.

DECISION

         The Judge made no error on a point of law and the original
         determination of the appeal shall stand.
