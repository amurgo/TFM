                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant is a citizen of Somalia who  appeals  to  the  Tribunal
    with permission against the determination of an Adjudicator,  Mrs  C  M
    Hawden-Beal, in which she dismissed his appeal against the Secretary of
    State's decision of 29 May 2003 issuing directions for his removal from
    the United Kingdom, asylum having been refused.

2.    The hearing before us took place on 1 November 2004.   Mr  A  Mahmood
    for Blakemores Solicitors appeared on behalf of the Appellant, and Mr J
    Jones appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State.

3.    The only issue before us is that of Article 8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention.  The Adjudicator found the Appellant  to  lack  credibility
    and dismissed his claim under Article 3 and the Refugee Convention  and
    there is no challenge to those findings.   As  regards  the  Article  8
    claim, the point is made in the  grounds  of  appeal  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's wife joining him in Somalia
    since she had been granted indefinite leave to  remain  and  was  of  a
    minority clan and there was no manner in  which  he  could  secure  the
    appropriate documentation to enable him  to  make  an  application  for
    entry clearance from Somalia to return to the United Kingdom.

4.    Before us Mr Mahmood referred to an earlier for  mention  hearing  at
    which  it  had  been  said  by  the  Presenting  Officer  that   postal
    applications could be made to the British High  Commission  in  Nairobi
    for Somalis wishing to apply for entry clearance to come to the  United
    Kingdom, in the absence  of  any  such  facilities  in  Somalia.   With
    typical fairness Mr Jones had furnished Mr Mahmood with a copy  of  the
    recent Tribunal determination in A M  (Somalia)  [2004]  UK  IAT  00276
    which dealt with a similar point.  In particular Mr Mahmood referred us
    to paragraphs 17 and 19 in A M concerning the practical problems for  a
    person in the Appellant's position seeking to make an  entry  clearance
    application from Nairobi.  Mr Jones had evidence which he would produce
    which showed that the situation had moved on, and that it was the  case
    that now the High Commission in Nairobi  was  considering  applications
    but the difficulty was that, contrary to what had been thought that  at
    the directions hearing, they were not  accepting  postal  applications.
    Even if that were possible the question had to be asked whether it  was
    indeed possible to make a postal application in  practical  terms  from
    Somalia.  It was entirely unclear how a Somali national  would  get  to
    Nairobi in order to make  an  application,  and  therefore  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's  family  life  if  he  were
    removed from the United Kingdom.

5.    Mr Jones referred to the  information  that  he  had  received  as  a
    consequence of his research over the weekend in the form of a fax which
    had come via Croydon from the British High Commission in  Nairobi.   In
    that fax it  was  confirmed  that  postal  applications  would  not  be
    accepted and that a person would have to apply  in  person.   The  High
    Commission did not accept Somali passports as establishing  nationality
    and identity but if they were satisfied as to  a  person's  nationality
    and identity then an entry clearance application could be  entertained.
    It was not said in the fax how the High Commission would satisfy itself
    concerning identity and nationality.  The other point  to  mention  was
    that a marriage certificate had been produced  which  showed  that  the
    Appellant had married his wife in  a  registry  office  ceremony  on  9
    January 2004 in Birmingham.  As regards the conclusions of the Tribunal
    in A M, Mr Jones had nothing to add.

6.    We are grateful to both representatives for their submissions and  in
    particular to Mr Jones for  the  very  helpful  research  that  he  has
    carried out in order to clarify the position as of today  and  also  to
    him for furnishing Mr Mahmood with a copy of A M.  In A M the situation
    was that the Claimant like the Appellant in the appeal before us  would
    need to return to Somalia in order to obtain a  passport  in  order  to
    enable him to go to Kenya to apply for entry clearance to join his wife
    in the United Kingdom.  The Tribunal referred at paragraph  13  of  the
    determination to a  letter  of  14  July  2004  from  the  Kenyan  High
    Commission in London confirming that in order to enter Kenya  a  person
    must be in "possession of a valid passport and a visa (where required).
     They must also be returnable to their country of residence."  We  note
    from the file that the Appellant does not have a passport.

7.    The Tribunal went on to note at paragraph 14 of the determination  in
    A M that though informal documentation could be  obtained  in  Somalia,
    the Presenting Officer had very properly not tried to suggest that  the
    Appellant could be expected to enter Kenya by availing himself of  such
    informal documentation.  The Tribunal went on to note that it was clear
    that the UN office  for  the  Co-ordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs,
    Integrated Regional  Information  Network  (IRIN)  which  had  provided
    information  concerning  the  opening  of  a  new  passport  office  in
    Mogadishu in September 2002 did not appear to have direct knowledge  as
    to whether a new passport office had in  reality  been  opened  by  the
    Transitional National Government in 2002.  The situation  in  Mogadishu
    remained uncertain and  the  Tribunal  concluded  that  there  must  be
    significant doubt as to whether the Appellant would in  practice  today
    be  able  to  obtain  from  the  Transitional  National  Government  in
    Mogadishu  a  passport  which  would  be  acceptable  to   the   Kenyan
    government.

8.    The Tribunal went on to note the further problem that existed at that
    time that in fact no new applications for entry  clearance  were  being
    accepted  by  the  High  Commission  then.   We  understand  from   the
    information obtained by Mr Jones that that situation no longer pertains
    and that entry clearance applications are entertained.  It  is  however
    clear on the one hand that postal applications will not  be  considered
    and secondly that even if the Appellant could overcome the problems  of
    obtaining a passport or other documentation  to  enable  him  to  leave
    Somalia on return and go to Nairobi, that  a  Somali  passport  is  not
    accepted as establishing nationality or identity, and  it  is  entirely
    unclear from the fax sent by the High Commission  in  Nairobi  on  what
    basis the High Commission would  consider  itself  satisfied  as  to  a
    person's  nationality  and  identity.   That  is  a  far  from  helpful
    situation, and it is to be hoped that in future clarification  will  be
    provided as to the kind of documentation or information that  might  be
    regarded as acceptable.  As  things  stand  however  we  consider  that
    though the position has moved on since the time when the Tribunal heard
    A M in July 2004, that does not  make  any  material  difference  to  a
    person in the position of the Appellant before us with  regard  to  the
    possibility  of  return  to  Somalia  and  thereafter  obtaining  entry
    clearance from the British High Commission in Nairobi enabling  him  to
    join his wife in the United Kingdom.  As things stand  it  remains  the
    case in our  view  that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant making an entry clearance application from outside the United
    Kingdom.  In all the  circumstances  it  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with his right to respect for family life under Article  8
    to require him to leave the United Kingdom and seek to apply for  entry
    clearance.  Accordingly we consider that the Article 8  claim  in  this
    case must succeed and this appeal is therefore allowed.
