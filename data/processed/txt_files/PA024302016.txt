For the Appellant:     Mr D Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's  protection  claim  for  reasons
    explained in her decision dated 19 February 2016.

 2. The appellant appealed to the FtT, on brief and generic grounds.

 3. FtT Judge Farrelly heard the appeal on 20 December 2016  and  dismissed
    it by decision promulgated on 21 April 2017.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by the UT on the view that the grounds
    disclosed possible error in a misunderstanding by the  judge,  in  that
    the appellant claimed to be only a supporter not a member of Ginbot  7,
    and in failure to make a finding on  whether  the  appellant  had  been
    arrested in the past.

 5. The respondent conceded that the grounds of appeal to the UT  disclosed
    error of law.

 6. Parties were in agreement that the outcome should be as follows.

 7. The decision of the FtT is set aside (other than as a  record  of  what
    was said at the hearing.

 8. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 9. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Farrelly.

10. The FtT made an anonymity direction, although there seems to have  been
    no application for one.  The matter was not addressed  in  the  UT,  so
    this decision has been anonymised.
