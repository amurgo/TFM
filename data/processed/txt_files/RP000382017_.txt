Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Bradley, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. For  reasons  explained  in  her  decision  dated  9  March  2017,  the
    respondent revoked such protection status as the appellant had, refused
    his claim on protection and human rights grounds, and found no  reasons
    why he should not be deported in pursuance of an order made on the same
    date.

 2. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Murray dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal  for  reasons  explained  in  her  decision  promulgated  on  15
    September 2017.

 3. My decision dated 17 and issued on 19 January 2018 explains why I  came
    to the view (although very narrowly) that absence  of  an  adjournment,
    even  on  a  part-heard  basis,  might  have  resulted  in   procedural
    unfairness, apparent or real, such that  the  decision  should  be  set
    aside.

 4. The scope of the further hearing was limited (unless on cause shown) to
    evidence going to the risk of re-offending and to  submissions  on  the
    effect of the level of risk, once ascertained, on the outcome.

 5. 5 March 2018 was agreed as a date which  would  permit  both  sides  to
    prepare.  In the event, the hearing proceeded on 9 March 2018.

 6. On the UT file there is an application by the respondent under rule  15
    (2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  dated  15
    January 2018, seeking to introduce into evidence a minute of  a  multi-
    agency meeting  on  9  January  2018,  noting  agreement  that  if  the
    appellant were to be released he would "present a  very  high  risk  of
    serious harm to young girls  aged  12  -  16  with  a  high  degree  of
    imminence".  The application was not taken further at the error of  law
    hearing, because that did not proceed to the stage of  re-making.   The
    item appears to have been superseded by the "criminal  justice  report"
    mentioned below.

 7. The appellant forwarded two further inventories  of  productions.   The
    first, under cover of a letter dated 7  March  2018,  is  a  report  by
    Sharon Paget, social worker, to the Parole Board for Scotland dated  29
    September 2016 (the "parole board report"). The second, under cover  of
    a letter dated 8 March 2018, comprises 5 articles, all generally on the
    care needs of unaccompanied young migrants and  refugees.   Mr  Bradley
    applied orally at the outset of the hearing for  both  to  be  admitted
    into evidence.

 8. Mr Matthews observed that the application did not comply with  rule  15
    (2A) in respect that there was no written notice under  that  rule;  no
    explanation why the evidence had  not  been  before  the  FtT;  and  no
    explanation for delay.  He also  pointed  out  that  the  evidence  was
    tendered very late in proceedings which had already focused on the need
    for proper notice and preparation.  He said that  nevertheless  he  did
    not oppose the admission of inventory one,  but  inventory  two  simply
    came too late and should not be admitted.

 9. As at the error of law hearing (see �6  of  the  decision),  there  was
    considerable force in these submissions.

10. There is unfortunately a general culture in both the FtT and the UT  of
    disregard for directions and procedural requirements (in which  present
    representatives are no better, but no worse,  than  many  others).   No
    doubt that arises from the reluctance of tribunals to exclude materials
    which might help appellants to make their cases; but there  are  limits
    to that tolerance, especially when they are professionally represented.
     However, the contents of inventory two seemed on brief perusal  to  be
    broadly relevant and uncontentious, and to spring no unfair  surprises.
    Both inventories were admitted.

11. The parole board report states that  in  detention  the  appellant  has
    presented at a medium level of risk of re-offending, but that  analysis
    of additional factors suggests that this is possibly an  underestimate,
    and arrives at a high risk of further sexual recidivism.

12. No reference was made in submissions to anything in inventory two,  and
    I see in those items nothing which might alter the outcome.

13.  Mr  Bradley  indicated  that  the  witness  Mrs  Stark  was  again  in
    attendance, and that he wished to lead further oral evidence from  her.
    He said that this would not be a repetition of her earlier evidence.

14. Mr Matthews submitted that no such  further  oral  evidence  should  be
    admitted, in absence of any further report from the witness.   Plainly,
    from the history of the case to  date,  that  was  a  valid  objection.
    However, it appeared that although  a  copy  of  the  criminal  justice
    report was posted to the appellant's representatives on 27 February  it
    had not arrived promptly due to weather disruption, and that Mr Bradley
    was provided with an email copy on 2 March 2018.

15. The respondent had applied by letter dated 27 February 2018 in terms of
    rule 15 (2A) for admission into evidence of a report by Ms V J  Keenan,
    the criminal justice social worker responsible for the appellant's case
    for over 4 years.  This report ("the criminal justice report")  appears
    to be undated but is recent.  The appellant is found to present a  high
    risk of causing serious harm.  The author does not agree  that  factors
    identified by Mrs Stark reduce this to  a  low  risk.   Ms  Keenan  was
    present.  Mr Matthews sought to ask her a few  further  questions.   Mr
    Bradley did not oppose the admission of the report into  evidence,  and
    said he would wish to cross-examine.

16. I decided that Ms Keenan should give her evidence first, and  that  the
    appellant would then be permitted to lead  further  evidence  from  Mrs
    Stark, limited to matters arising from the report and  evidence  of  Ms
    Keenan.

17. The appellant did not seek to give further evidence, or to  attend  the
    hearing.

18. Ms Keenan and Mrs Stark  were  not  swayed  in  cross-examination  into
    departing from their respective opinions.

19. The nub of the difference in their professional views is that Mrs Stark
    considers that the standard risk assessment tools were  developed  from
    research on populations of offenders in the UK in the 1990's, when  the
    proportion of offenders of recent immigrant and refugee backgrounds was
    very small.  In consequence, the weight given to factors such as family
    resources and availability of accommodation is skewed  in  such  a  way
    that someone of the appellant's background begins with a score well  on
    the way up the scale, even had there been no offending.  The effect  of
    factors  such  as  a  traumatic  childhood   and   different   cultural
    expectations is also underestimated.

20. There is logic in the analysis by Ms Stark that some factors  built  in
    to the risk assessment tools inevitably weigh against a  young  migrant
    with a traumatic history and no family or accommodation in the  UK.   I
    am unable however to accept  her  further  view  that  the  appellant's
    offending has more to do with cultural confusion  and  misunderstanding
    than with an interest in young females.   That  does  not  reflect  his
    ongoing attitudes described in up to date reports,  in  particular  his
    almost complete non-recognition that  his  behaviour  (resulting  in  6
    years' imprisonment) has been in any way wrong.

21. That coincides with the view formed by  Judge  Murray,  who  heard  the
    appellant's oral evidence.  She found in him no acceptance, remorse  or
    empathy with his victims and their families (�55).  She concluded  that
    he represented a high  risk  of  re-offending,  in  particular  against
    females aged 11 to 15 (�57).

22. Although I was asked to find that Ms Paget had better knowledge of  the
    appellant than Ms Keenan and to prefer the parole board report  to  the
    criminal justice report, I do not find it  necessary  to  resolve  such
    conflict as there is.  On either view, the appellant presents a  medium
    to high risk of serious re-offending.

23. The case in the FtT was presented by counsel as having  the  report  of
    Mrs Stark and the level of risk  of  re-offending  at  its  core  (�4).
    Judge Murray considered the report of Mrs  Stark  and  the  submissions
    thereon in detail (�25, 26, 37, 40, 50 - 54).

24. The only ground of appeal to the UT was procedural  unfairness  in  not
    adjourning to hear the oral  evidence  of  Mrs  Stark.   That  exercise
    having been completed, her oral evidence has added little, if anything,
    to the content of her report.

25. The evidence has a whole does not move the dial significantly, and does
    not sensibly lead to a finding of low risk of re-offending.

26. A low risk of  re-offending  would  not  inevitably  translate  into  a
    finding that the case discloses very compelling circumstances over  and
    above those described in paragraphs 399 and  399A  of  the  immigration
    rules; but as the case has developed, a finding of medium to high  risk
    of re-offending is decisive.

27. The decision of the FtT is therefore remade to  the  same  effect:  the
    appeal, as brought to the FtT, is dismissed.

28. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
