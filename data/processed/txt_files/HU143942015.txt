                            DECISION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr R Singer (counsel for Paul John and Co
Solicitors)

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 22 March  2017  to  allow  the  appeal  of
       Amrita Kunwar, a citizen of  Nepal  born  28  November  1994,  itself
       brought against the Home Office decision of 8 December 2015 to refuse
       her application on human rights grounds.


    2. The First-tier Tribunal gives a very full  history  of  the  relevant
       facts. Ms Kunwar first applied to come to the United  Kingdom  on  16
       July 2012. That application was refused. She then entered the  United
       Kingdom on 19 June 2013, with leave as a visitor  until  28  November
       2013. She applied for indefinite leave to remain  before  that  leave
       expired,  as  the  dependent  child  of  persons  settled  here,   an
       application which requires entry for the purpose of settlement.  That
       application was refused, unsurprisingly, entry as  a  visitor  having
       disqualified her from that route, though she  nevertheless  appealed,
       her appeal being dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal on 27  November
       2014, and further attempts to take the case further were defeated  by
       permission refusals, her appeal rights expiring on 27 May 2015.


    3. On 5 August 2015, now aged 20, she applied for  indefinite  leave  to
       remain as the daughter of a person present and  settled  in  the  UK.
       This application was refused on 8 December 2015, on the  basis  that,
       once again, she had not entered the country in a category eligible to
       found such an application, she  had  not  provided  evidence  of  the
       appropriate English language proficiency,  she did not qualify  under
       any of the family life routes under Appendix  FM,  and  she  had  not
       established that she faced a disproportionate interference  with  her
       private life, given  she  faced  no  very  significant  obstacles  to
       integration in Nepal, where she had lived for most of her  life,  and
       she had not put forward any circumstances considered  exceptional  or
       compelling to justify her remaining in the United Kingdom.


    4. The evidence she put forward in  her  appeal  against  that  decision
       showed that her father entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  domestic
       worker in December 2005 and remained in  that  category  until  being
       granted settlement. His wife, the Appellant's mother, joined  him  as
       his spouse on 5 November 2009,  being  granted  indefinite  leave  to
       remain in April 2013. The Appellant's elder sister, Asmita,  came  to
       the United Kingdom in 2010 as her parents' dependent, and she too was
       granted settlement on 3 December  2012.  She  also  had  two  younger
       siblings, [A] (born [ ] 2001) and [M] (born [ ] 2002).


    5. The Appellant explained the circumstances  leading  to  her  original
       arrival in the United Kingdom. Her family had sought to apply on  her
       behalf as her parents' dependent when aged 17,  via  her  uncle  with
       whom she lived with [A] and [M] (and with  her  grandmother  and  her
       uncle's wife, her aunt), but when they attended the  Visa  Processing
       Centre in Nepal, they learned that the Centre had been instructed  by
       the British High Commission to no  longer  accept  such  applications
       because of a  change  in  the  Immigration  Rules  dealing  with  the
       dependents of domestic workers. Accordingly she applied  to  come  to
       the UK as a visitor, and that application was refused; she lodged  an
       appeal, and in fact her visitor appeal was allowed. By the  time  she
       entered the United Kingdom, however, in June 2013, she had of  course
       reached the age of majority, on 28  November  2012.  Accordingly  her
       application was refused.


    6. Whilst the Appellant was in the UK, her grandmother in  Nepal  became
       seriously ill and required the care of the aunt and uncle;  she  died
       in October 2016. By now, [A] and  [M]  had  been  granted  indefinite
       leave to remain as the child dependents of their parents, leaving the
       Appellant as the only  member  of  her  direct  family  unit  without
       settlement in the UK. More recently,  the  earthquake  in  Nepal  had
       destroyed the home at which she had previously resided in  Kathmandu,
       and her uncle and aunt now lived with  their  in-laws  in  Taulihawa;
       there were no relatives residing in Kathmandu  with  whom  she  could
       reside in the future.


    7. The First-tier Tribunal was impressed by the  oral  evidence  of  the
       witnesses and so accepted their evidence, and went  on  to  determine
       the appeal based on the facts just summarised.


    8. The Appellant could not satisfy the Immigration Rules under which she
       had applied, as she lacked the gateway immigration status to found  a
       dependent child application; and there was no provision of the  Rules
       in Appendix FM under which she could apply.


    9. As to her private life,  she  faced  very  significant  obstacles  to
       integration in Nepal because whilst she may not have severed  social,
       cultural or family ties there, she would have no  home  to  which  to
       return in Kathmandu, her previous carer, her grandmother,  had  died,
       and her uncle and aunt had relocated  to  Taulihawa,  their  home  in
       Kathmandu having been  destroyed;  additionally  it  was  normal  for
       unmarried daughters to remain living with their  parents  until  they
       married, and she could not resume her education if she returned there
       and would be unable to obtain employment.


   10. As to her private and family life outside the Rules, she had  clearly
       established family life given her  emotional  dependency  and  giving
       regard to the approach set out in Ghising, and having regard  to  the
       section 117B factors, her  removal  would  be  disproportionate:  she
       spoke good English as the Home Office advocate below recognised, that
       whereas little weight was to be given  to  private  life  established
       during a person's presence in the UK on an unlawful basis,  that  did
       not mean "no weight" should be  afforded  it,  bearing  in  mind  the
       guidance from the Upper Tribunal in Kaur and Rajendran.


   11. Although the Secretary of State was entitled to alter the Immigration
       Rules as time passed, this had nevertheless caused  real  unfairness.
       The broader context of the  case  included  the  fact  that  her  two
       younger siblings had been granted indefinite leave. This  indubitably
       had a bearing on the proportionality  of  the  immigration  decision,
       having regard to the welfare of the entire family  and  the  guidance
       from Huang regarding the serious inhibition to  living  a  full  life
       that separation from the family unit might well entail.  She was  not
       particularly sophisticated or independent, and clearly very dependent
       on her family for support. She could not return to her life in  Nepal
       given that her grandmother was dead and her uncle and aunt had  moved
       away following the destruction of the family home.  Furthermore,  she
       had taught the English language  to  elderly  Gurkhas  to  help  them
       integrate in this country. Overall the First-tier Tribunal found  her
       removal  disproportionate  to  the  public  interest  sought  to   be
       achieved.


   12. The Secretary of State appealed, on the  basis  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law in


      a) Failing to take the approach laid down in Kamara when assessing
         whether she had a reasonable opportunity to be accepted in society
         in Nepal;



      b) Treating a change in the Immigration Rules as unfair when the
         government had the right to change and modify the Rules;



      c) Failing to take account of the possibility of the Respondent
         living with other family members away from her home area in Nepal;



      d) Failing to "adequately explain" the basis of its acceptance that
         family life endured between the Appellant and her parents given
         the choices they made in the past.



   13. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 27  September
       2017 on the basis that the  grounds  were  arguable,  both  in  their
       assault on the approach to "integration" and in  their  challenge  to
       the disposition of the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds  outside  the
       Immigration Rules.


   14. Before me Mr Kotas developed those grounds  of  appeal  with  elegant
       concision, submitting that, firstly, the First-tier Tribunal erred in
       law in applying the wrong test for integration: rather than assessing
       whether a young woman who had lived all her life in  Nepal  and  been
       educated there would be able to negotiate society there on a  return,
       it had effectively simply looked at whether  she  would  be  able  to
       return to conditions approximating to her previous circumstances, and
       illegitimately had regard to her circumstances in this country too.


   15. Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal had failed to explain  how  it  was
       that she continued to enjoy family life as an adult with her parents,
       bearing in mind  she  had  lived  apart  from  them  for  some  time,
       undermining its conclusion as to the existence of  family  life,  and
       its  reasoning  on  proportionality  was  unlawful  given  that   the
       Secretary of State was entitled to change the  Rules  without  notice
       and the First-tier Tribunal had not explained how  it  was  that  the
       Rule change in question was unfair: it had always been  open  to  the
       Appellant to make and pursue an application to join her family whilst
       still a minor.


   16. Mr Singer replied that the reasoning on integration  was  lawful  and
       had regard to relevant considerations; it was  wrong  to  attempt  to
       undermine it given the six clearly stated reasons identified  in  his
       Rule 24 response as underpinning its thinking.


   17. As to the family life claim outside the Rules,  it  was  self-evident
       that the family had been split up for reasons  that  they  had  never
       intended.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not  fully  explained  the
       unfairness that had been pressed upon it at the hearing where he  had
       represented the Respondent, but its reasoning was nevertheless clear.
       There was relevant unfairness when one stepped back from the case  to
       look at the overall circumstances, bearing in mind that but  for  the
       wrongful refusal of a visitor visa to the Appellant, she  would  have
       arrived in the UK whilst still a minor and so would have been able to
       take advantage of the Rules' acceptance of in-country  switching  for
       children whatever the immigration route in which  they  entered.  The
       family had been separated for only a limited period,  given  that  Ms
       Kunwar had lived with her mother and younger sisters until her mother
       came to the UK in November 2009, arrived herself in the  UK  in  July
       2013, whereas her younger sisters joined them in 2014.


Findings and reasons


   18. As summarised by Mr Kotas, there are essentially two broad thrusts to
       the grounds of appeal:  firstly  integration,  secondly  family  life
       outside the Rules.


   19. As stated by Sales LJ in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, the  concept  of
       integration


           "... is not confined to the mere ability to find  a  job  or  to
           sustain life while living  in  the  other  country.  It  is  not
           appropriate to treat the statutory language as subject  to  some
           gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or  tribunal
           simply to direct itself in the terms that Parliament has  chosen
           to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a  broad  evaluative
           judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be  enough
           of an insider in terms of understanding how life in the  society
           in  that  other  country  is  carried  on  and  a  capacity   to
           participate in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to  be
           accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-day  basis  in
           that society and to build up within a reasonable time a  variety
           of human relationships to give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life."

   20. I accept Mr Kotas' submissions that there was a material error of law
       in the approach taken to the prospects  of  integration  abroad.  The
       test for integration is not intended to compare life abroad based  on
       the circumstances to which someone would return compared to how  they
       may have lived in the  past.  The  question  is  whether  she  has  a
       reasonable opportunity to be accepted in,  and  operate  within,  the
       society to which she would return.


   21. The factors identified  by  Mr  Singer  as  indicative  of  a  lawful
       resolution of this issue  are  by  no  means  all  directed  to  that
       enquiry: the fact that her grandmother has sadly passed away or  that
       she would have to relocate  to  part  of  the  country  she  had  not
       previously resided do not really touch on this issue. Rule 276ADE(vi)
       poses a much broader question than whether one  could  pick  up  from
       where one previously left off; it  is  a  high  hurdle  to  surmount,
       requiring not just any obstacles, but only "very  significant"  ones,
       to be demonstrated. Furthermore the Tribunal did not explain  why  it
       was that she would be unable to resume education or find work.


   22. However, Mr Singer's defence of the First-tier Tribunal's conclusions
       is on firmer ground  once  the  second  aspect  of  its  decision  is
       analysed. Its reasoning on the existence of family life is  perfectly
       clear and it took account of a wide range of  issues,  including  the
       statutory factors identified by section 117B of  the  NIAA  2002,  in
       assessing the overall proportionality of the Respondent's  return  to
       Nepal.


   23. The Secretary of State complains that it was not clear why the First-
       tier Tribunal accepted that family life had been maintained. But  the
       chronology of the family's exodus from  Nepal  makes  that  perfectly
       apparent. Only a few years ago, the Respondent lived with her  mother
       and two younger sisters. Indeed she lived with  the  younger  sisters
       until she herself came to the UK,  and  those  siblings  subsequently
       joined the  family  here.  She  has  consistently  lived  in  various
       formulations of the same family unit in  circumstances  where  it  is
       clear that the family never intended for the children to be separated
       from the parents.


   24. The decision of the Strasbourg Court in Advic v UK (1995) 20 EHRR  CD
       125 is sometimes cited for the proposition that the normal  emotional
       ties between a parent and an adult son or daughter will not,  without
       more, be enough: Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31. Buxton LJ emphasised in
       MT (Zimbabwe) [2007]  EWCA  Civ  455  at  [11]  that  Advic,  "whilst
       stressing the need for an element of dependency over  and  above  the
       normal between that of a parent or parent  figure  and  adult  child,
       also stresses that everything depends on the  circumstances  of  each
       case"; the ECtHR in AA v  United  Kingdom  (Application  no  8000/08)
       found on 20 September 2011 that "An examination of the Court's  case-
       law would tend to suggest that the applicant, a  young  adult  of  24
       years old, who resides with his mother and  has  not  yet  founded  a
       family of his own, can be regarded  as  having  'family  life'."  The
       President recently wrote in Lama [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC)  �32  that  "at
       its heart, family life denotes real  or  committed  personal  support
       between or among the persons concerned."


   25. The First-tier Tribunal was plainly aware of this line of  authority,
       citing as it did Ghising (which itself sets out  the  earlier  cases)
       and Lama. It also directed itself to the proposition in Huang already
       identified above, viz that extended life outside the family unit  for
       some individuals can seriously inhibit  their  personal  development;
       given its reference to the vulnerability and relative  immaturity  of
       the Respondent, that principle was clearly in play.


   26. Doubtless Mr Kotas was entitled to refer to  the  evidence  that  the
       Respondent's eventual entry to the UK was in the capacity of visitor,
       but it seems unrealistic to hold it against her that at the time  she
       entered the UK she had intended to return abroad  (consistently  with
       the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules),  if  that  results  in
       turning a blind eye to the self-evident likelihood that  it  was  her
       ultimate ambition to settle with the rest of her family in the UK  if
       that became  possible.  It  is  understandable  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal did not consider that feature of  the  case  undermined  the
       existence of the asserted family life.


   27. The Secretary of State also criticised the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
       its reference to a generalised  conception  of  fairness.  It  is  of
       course true, as noted by Lord Carnwath in Patel [2013] UKSC  72  �62,
       that "It is important to remember that article 8  is  not  a  general
       dispensing power".


   28. As stated by Lord Carnwath and Lady Hale in MM (Lebanon) [2017]  UKSC
       10 �66, it is now generally accepted that  Article  8  considerations
       cannot be "fitted into a rigid template provided by the rules, so  as
       in effect to exclude consideration by the tribunal of  special  cases
       outside the rules ... this would be  a  negation  of  the  evaluative
       exercise required in assessing the proportionality of a measure under
       article 8 of the Convention which excludes any 'hard-edged or bright-
       line rule to be applied to  the  generality  of  cases'".  The  Upper
       Tribunal had already anticipated that thinking  when  discussing  the
       relationship between private and family life  and  the  impact  of  a
       change in the Immigration Rules in Philipson [2012] UKUT 00039  (IAC)
       (headnote at (iv)): "If such a person could not comply with the rules
       on settlement for reasons of a new salary level, there was  a  strong
       claim that leave to remain was required to respect the  private  life
       established in  the  reasonable  expectation  of  settlement  if  the
       conditions for settlement applicable on arrival were adhered to,  and
       a relatively weak case for justifying interference with such  private
       life to promote a legitimate public interest  recognised  by  Article
       8(2) ECHR."


   29. The Judge below clearly understood that the Home Office was  entitled
       to alter the Immigration Rules in a way which  might  be  unfortunate
       for an individual but was nevertheless lawful, but took the view that
       the impact of this  change  on  an  individual  family  member  might
       nevertheless be relevant to proportionality. It seems to me that this
       was a perfectly legitimate application of the  principles  recognised
       by Philipson and MM (Lebanon).


   30. In summary, given the absence of any  failings  to  take  account  of
       material considerations by the First-tier Tribunal,  and  absent  any
       pleaded case  on  rationality,  the  Home  Office  challenge  to  its
       decision amounts to a claim that  the  reasoning  is  inadequate.  As
       noted by Beatson LJ in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 �35, 37:


           "What is required is  that  the  reasons  must  give  sufficient
           detail to  show  the  parties  and  the  appellate  tribunal  or
           reviewing court the principles upon which the lower tribunal has
           acted, and the reasons that led it to its decision, so that they
           are able to understand why it reached its decision. The  reasons
           need not be elaborate, and need not  deal  with  every  argument
           presented ...
           ... judicial restraint should be exercised when the reasons that
           a tribunal gives for its decision  are  being  examined  and  it
           should not be assumed too readily that the tribunal  misdirected
           itself because not every step in its reasoning  is  set  out  in
           it".


   31. It seems to  me  that  the  Tribunal's  reasoning  on  the  issue  of
       proportionality is clear to the  informed  reader.  On  the  accepted
       evidence of  the  Respondent  and  her  family,  which  the  Tribunal
       accepted as credible, they had consistently wished to  remain  living
       together as a family unit, an outcome which the Immigration Rules  in
       principle permitted at the time the father began working in  the  UK,
       and which failed to work in the Appellant's favour  only  because  of
       historic events which had  an  excessive  and  thus  disproportionate
       impact on her parents' intentions.


   32. I accordingly find that there was no material error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

      Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.



Signed:                                            Date: 3 January 2018
