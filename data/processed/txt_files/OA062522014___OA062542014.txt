For the appellants:    Mr A Bandegani, instructed by Parker Rhodes

For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Merajuddin Qazizada, date of  birth  12.3.95,  and  his
    sister, Asima Qazizada, are citizens of Afghanistan.

 2. These are their appeals against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Kelly  promulgated  15.1.15,  dismissing  their  linked  appeals
    against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer, dated 24.4.14,  to
    refuse entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  to  settle  with  their
    father, who was granted humanitarian protection in the UK with  limited
    leave to remain to 8.1.19.  The Judge heard the appeal on 9.1.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 4.8.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Kelly should be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal Judge Osborne purported to find errors
    of law in (1) the alleged failure of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  to
    decide whether the manner in which the appellants would  be  maintained
    in the UK would contravene the requirement that third party  funds  are
    not acceptable in such circumstances; and  (2)  failing  to  take  into
    account  pursuant  to  section  55  of  the  Borders  Citizenship   and
    Immigration Act 2009 the best  interests  of  the  appellant's  younger
    brother, a minor.

 7. With respect to Judge Osborne, at the permission stage the test is  not
    whether there are errors of law in the decision, but whether there  are
    arguable errors of law. It is  not  for  Judge  Osborne  to  usurp  the
    function of the Upper Tribunal to determine whether there are  material
    errors of law in the making of the decision  such  as  to  require  the
    decision to be set aside.

 8. In respect of the best interests of the  appellant's  younger  brother,
    who lives in the UK with the appellant's father, it far from clear that
    the best interests are to have his elder and siblings come  to  the  UK
    when they are adults and inevitably going  to  be  pursuing  their  own
    independent lives. Three of the appellants siblings live in the UK  and
    three others remain in Afghanistan.

 9. At �27 the judge was not satisfied  that  there  was  any  particularly
    strong bond between the appellants and their father,  given  that  they
    are adults, aged 19  and  21  at  the  date  of  decision,  and  living
    independent lives, even though they have financial support  from  their
    elder brother in the UK, and live in the former family home, from where
    the first appellant goes to university. The judge found that the father
    had little apparent interest in the appellants. He spoke with them only
    every two weeks or so, and was unaware of the extent  or  frequency  of
    the financial support provided by the appellant's elder brother, an  IT
    consultant for KMPG. At �21, the judge was  only  just  persuaded  that
    there was any family  life  between  the  appellants  and  their  older
    brother in the UK.

10. It was common ground in the appeal at the First-tier Tribunal  that  as
    adults the appellants could not meet the requirements of the Rules  for
    entry clearance as children.  Neither  did  they  meet  the  very  high
    threshold for adult dependent relatives under Appendix FM, as explained
    in �6 of the decision. However, the fact that they do  not  meet  these
    requirements is highly relevant to any  consideration  of  family  life
    outside the Rules under Article 8 ECHR. The Rules are the Secretary  of
    State's proportionate response to private and family  life  claims  and
    set out the circumstances and the threshold judged to be appropriate to
    grant entry clearance on the basis of family life. In effect, in  order
    to justify granting entry clearance outside the  Rules  the  appellants
    would  have  to  show  that  their  circumstances  are  compelling  and
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules, so that  the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse leave would be  unjustifiably  harsh.
    The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not address this issue, but proceeded
    to consider Article 8 ECHR. However, in the case  of  the  relationship
    between adult children and their father and other siblings, two of whom
    were children at the date of decision, where the  judge  has  found  no
    emotional bonds beyond those to be  expected  of  such  relatives  (the
    Kugathas test), it is difficult to see what justification  there  would
    be for granting leave to enter on the facts of this case.

11. Nevertheless, the judge found  both  family  life  (though  it  is  not
    entirely clear between which relatives and the appellants) and that the
    consequences of  the  decision  were  sufficiently  serious  to  engage
    Article 8 ECHR, but ultimately concluded that  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise between on the one hand the rights of the appellants
    and other family members and on the other the legitimate and  necessary
    aim to protect the economic well-being of the  UK  through  immigration
    control, the balance fell  against  the  appellants  and  so  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was proportionate.

12. I am not satisfied that the  claimed  errors  of  law  at  �20  of  the
    decision are material to the outcome of the appeal.  The  judge  stated
    that there was an absence of detailed evidence of the  elder  brother's
    financial commitments, when such was to be  found  in  the  appellants'
    bundle, and stated that the appellants  would  be  entitled  to  access
    public funds in the UK, when leave would be granted  with  a  condition
    precluding recourse to public funds. Mr Tarlow pointed out that  whilst
    there is  some  evidence  of  the  elder  brother's  financial  income,
    including  a  positive  credit   balance,   there   was   no   relevant
    income/expenditure statement to show what his  outgoings  are  and  who
    else he might be financially supporting. In the circumstances, I am not
    satisfied that there was any error of law in �20.

13. In any event, I find that little relevant to the outcome of the  appeal
    turns on these findings. The appeals were  not  dismissed  because  the
    judge thought that the appellants would be a drain on public funds. The
    appeals were dismissed for the reasons set out  between  �25  and  �27,
    where the  judge  found  there  was  no  particularly  strong  bond  of
    affection between the appellants and their father so as  to  render  it
    imperative that they be  reunited  on  a  permanent  basis.  The  judge
    stated, "It is clear that the appellants are  singularly  unhappy  with
    the current state of their private lives in Afghanistan.  However,  the
    purpose of Article 8 is not to guarantee a happy life. It is  to  guard
    against capricious government interference in the  private  affairs  of
    the individual."

14. I find that the conclusions of the Article 8  assessment  was  entirely
    open to the judge on the evidence and for  which  cogent  reasons  have
    been given.  As  to  the  consideration  in  relation  to  the  younger
    children, I find that the relationship between them and the  appellants
    is so remote that even if the judge should have address section 55  and
    their best interests, I am satisfied that the  outcome  of  the  appeal
    would inevitable have been the same and thus no material error  of  law
    has been identified.

Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an  order  pursuant  to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed.
