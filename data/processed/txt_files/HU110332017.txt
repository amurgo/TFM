For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision promulgated on  3  May  2018  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Monson which  refused  EAK's  protection  and
    human rights appeals, brought in the context  of  a  deportation  order
    made on 21 September 2017.

 2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the appellant's family.

 3. EAK is a citizen of Togo.  He came  to  the  UK  in  1995  and  claimed
    asylum. He also applied for  leave  on  the  basis  of  having  British
    children with his partner. On 17 April 2008 the applicant  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain under the legacy programme. On 21 July  2015
    he was sentenced to  5  ï¿½  years'  imprisonment  for  attempted  sexual
    activity by penetration with a female child. The  child  concerned  was
    his oldest daughter. The respondent's  deportation  order  made  on  21
    September 2017 followed.

 4. The appellant maintained that he could not be  deported  on  protection
    and human  rights  grounds.  His  appeal  came  before  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal on 16 April 2018. He was not represented and did  not  attend.
    The First-Tier Tribunal found that it was in the interests  of  justice
    to proceed where he had been  notified  on  22  February  2018  of  the
    hearing and provided with a guide for unrepresented  appellants  and  a
    production order sent to HMP Highpoint.  Further  on  the  day  of  the
    hearing, the court clerk was informed that the appellant  was  by  then
    detained at Brook House  and  had  declined  to  come  to  the  hearing
    "because he thought his solicitors were withdrawing his case"; see [48]
    of the First-Tier Tribunal decision.

 5. There was no dispute before me that the appellant was  moved  from  HMP
    Highpoint to Brook House on date between 10-16 April 2018.  Nothing  on
    the Tribunal file shows that the Tribunal was  aware  of  the  transfer
    prior to the hearing on 16 April. Indeed,  the  Tribunal  continued  to
    write to the appellant at HMP Highpoint after the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    hearing, sending the appeal determination there on 3 May  2018.  It  is
    obvious, where that is so, that no production order was  made  for  the
    appellant to be produced for the  First-Tier  Tribunal  hearing  on  16
    April 2018.

 6. Even if he had received the notice of hearing whilst at  HMP  Highpoint
    (which he denies emphatically) given the transfer took place only a few
    days (at  best)  prior  to  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  hearing  and  no
    production order was sent to Brook House I accept  that  the  appellant
    did not have the opportunity to attend the hearing on 16 April 2018  to
    represent  himself  and  put  forward  his  evidence.  The  information
    provided by the clerk as to his declining to attend on  16  April  2016
    could not carry weight,  in  my  judgment,  where,  as  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal noted, the  appellant  has  never  been  represented  in  this
    substantive appeal (rather than his bail matters) and it did  not  make
    any sense that he would refer to legal representatives "withdrawing his
    case" when he has always sought to oppose deportation.

 7. I therefore found a procedural error arose where the appellant was  not
    afforded the opportunity to represent himself and give evidence  before
    the First-Tier Tribunal. Where that is so, the decision of  the  First-
    Tier Tribunal must be set aside to be re-made de novo. Where there  are
    no extant findings of fact and the appeal is to be re-made  afresh,  it
    is appropriate for that re-making  to  take  place  in  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside to be remade de novo by the First-tier Tribunal.
