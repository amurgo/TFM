Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Khan, instructed by Abbey Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
The Appeal

 1.  This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   against   a
    determination promulgated on 13 February 2014  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pacey which allowed the Article 8 appeals of the respondents.

 2. For the purposes of this determination, I refer to the  respondents  as
    the appellants and  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



 3. The background to this matter is that the two appellants are  nationals
    of Pakistan. They are mother and son. The first appellant was  born  on
    13 October 1989 and the second appellant, was born on 3 February 2009.

 4. The first  appellant  is  married  to  Mr  Asad  Munsfidar,  a  British
    national, and he is the father of the second appellant and  sponsor  in
    this matter. The couple's second child, Fatima, a British national born
    on 1 January 2012 lives with the sponsor in the UK.

 5. On 7 December 2012, the appellants' application for entry clearance  to
    join the sponsor were refused.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal found that the respondent  had  been  right  to
    refuse the appeals under the Immigration Rules as the sponsor  did  not
    provide the correct documentation to show his earnings of ï¿½24,752.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal went on to allow the appeal under Article 8.

 8. The respondent's challenge to that  decision  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  failed to apply properly the guidance set out  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Gulshun (Article 8 - new rules - correct  approach)  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 and had not applied the correct criterion  when  considering
    whether outside the  Rules  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under them.

 9. I did not find that the respondent's challenge had merit.

10. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  set  out  the  relevant  guidance  from
    Gulshan at [16]. It  is  unarguable  that  she  did  have  the  correct
    guidance in mind when reaching her decision, therefore.

11. Further, in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192  particular  emphasis  is
    placed by the Court of Appeal on substance as  opposed  to  form.   The
    court made clear that what matters is not  so  much  whether  there  is
    consideration of Article 8 inside or  outside  the  Rules  or  under  a
    mixture of both but rather whether the decision-maker has  conducted  a
    substantive assessment taking into account all relevant elements of the
    claim.  Whilst the judge did not  go  on  in  terms  the  language  the
    "exceptional" or "compelling circumstances" when setting out her  views
    on the various aspects of the appellants' cases I am satisfied that her
    approach fulfilled that requirement.

12. In particular, at [27] she  identified  the  very  young  ages  of  the
    children and how that made it "particularly important" for them  to  be
    with both parents and each other. Although the language  is  different,
    that appeared to be me to  be  sufficient  to  show  that  she  had  in
    substance applied her self-direction to the guidance  of  Gulshan.  She
    also specifically considered  the  question  of  reapplying  for  entry
    clearance but found it did not  outweigh  the  best  interests  of  the
    children.

13. I remind myself that it is only open to me  to  interfere  with  a  FtT
    decision if it contains a material error of law;  my  task  is  not  to
    consider whether the decision was necessarily one  that  another  judge
    would  have  come  to.   The  judge's  decision,  although  evinces   a
    substantive consideration of relevant factors weighing for and  against
    the claimant and for the above reasons is not vitiated by legal error.

Decision

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
