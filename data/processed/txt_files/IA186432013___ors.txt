Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Bennett (Irvine Thanvi Nata Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders (Senior Home Office Presenting
                    Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Respondent with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Canavan) promulgated on 23rd April 2014.  In  the  determination
    the Judge allowed the appeal on human rights  grounds  in  relation  to
    four of the Appellants and under the Immigration Rules in  relation  to
    the third Appellant, E.

 2. Although this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of  State's
    appeal, for the sake of continuity and clarity I will continue to refer
    to the Secretary of State as the  Respondent  and  the  family  as  the
    Appellants.

 3. The first Appellant is married to the second Appellant and  the  third,
    fourth and fifth are their three children, all of whom were born in the
    UK.

 4. Mrs P is aged 33 and her husband 38. The three children  were  born  in
    the UK in 2006 2007 and 2012 and are therefore now aged 8, 7 and 1.

 5. The husband came to the UK first in 2002 as a student with leave  until
    2004. His wife, the first Appellant came to the UK as a visitor in 2003
    and then obtained leave to remain as a student until 2005. Their  visas
    were then extended until April 2010 when they were no  longer  eligible
    and after that they overstayed.

 6. On 26th April 2013 they applied  for  leave  to  remain  on  Article  8
    grounds. It is worth mentioning at this point that at the date  of  the
    application the first child, E, who was born in February 2006, had been
    in the UK for seven years. The Secretary  of  State  refused  all  five
    applications in a decision dated 20th May 2013.

 7. The Appellants appealed and thus the matter came before  Judge  Canavan
    in March 2014. On that occasion  the  Appellants  were  represented  by
    counsel.

 8. In his determination the Judge set out the history and  the  nature  of
    the refusals, which as the Judge pointed out, bore  little  resemblance
    to  the  applications.  The  applications  were  refused  because   the
    Appellants did not meet the requirements of appendix FM or Ex.1 but the
    Secretary of State failed to consider whether any of the Appellants met
    paragraph 276ADE. It was the Appellants' argument that the eldest child
    E, having been born in the UK more than seven years  earlier,  met  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE.

 9. The Judge considered, as he was obliged to do, the  best  interests  of
    the children and concluded in paragraph 12 that it was likely to be  in
    their best interests to remain in the UK.

10. At paragraph 14 the Judge considered E's situation noting that she  was
    by now eight years of age and had spent her entire life in the  UK  and
    concluded that it would not be reasonable for her to leave the  UK  and
    that she met the requirements therefore of paragraph 276ADE (1) (iv) of
    the Immigration Rules.

11. The Judge then went on to consider the situation  with  regard  to  the
    remaining four members of the family and in short  found  that  it  was
    unreasonable and disproportionate for E to be required to leave the  UK
    and given that she is reliant on her parents for all her  needs,  found
    it disproportionate to remove the rest of the family also.

12. The Secretary of State appealed that decision on the basis  that  there
    had been no consideration by the Judge of  the  fact  that  the  family
    would be relocating as a family  unit  back  to  Bolivia  and  gave  no
    consideration to that aspect when considering whether it was reasonable
    for E to leave the UK and also did not take account of  the  fact  that
    the remaining four Appellants did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

13. The matter first came before me  on  25th  June  2014  for  an  initial
    hearing. It was my task then to decide whether the First-tier  Tribunal
    had made an error of law and if so  whether  and  to  what  extent  the
    determination should be set aside. I found on that  occasion  that  the
    Judge had erred in concluding,  without  adequate  reasoning,  that  it
    would be unreasonable for E to leave the UK when she would  be  leaving
    with her entire family, none of whom had any right to be in the UK.  As
    it was that finding which led to the appeal being allowed for  E  under
    the Immigration Rules and for the rest  of  the  family  on  Article  8
    grounds, I set  aside  the  determination  in  its  entirety.  On  that
    occasion the Home Office, having been obliged to provide a  replacement
    Home Office Presenting Officer  at  the  last  minute,  was  not  in  a
    position to proceed with the rehearing and the matter was adjourned  to
    be reheard by me on a later date.

14. Thus the matter came before me on 7th  August.  In  accordance  with  a
    direction given in June the Appellants'  representatives  had  filed  a
    composite bundle and I heard evidence from both parents, both  of  whom
    had filed new witness statements.

15. I heard first from Mr S. He explained that during his time in the UK he
    progressed well within his job and become  proficient  in  English.  He
    attended training courses and gained a  full  UK  driving  licence.  He
    gained certificates to work with London  Underground  as  a  specialist
    labourer and then took up employment with London Underground, primarily
    dealing with maintenance work on the tracks and lines. He explains  how
    he was promoted to foreman and was highly respected by  his  peers  and
    his employers. He continued with that work until his visa expired after
    which he was unable to work lawfully. He then says that  as  it  became
    increasingly difficult for him to support his  family  he  resorted  to
    working illegally for cash in hand. When that  still  did  not  produce
    enough money he obtained a fake visa  but  was  caught,  convicted  and
    sentenced to 6 months imprisonment.

16. He goes on to confirm that his wife gave birth to their three  children
    in the UK and that the eldest two attend primary school  in  London,  a
    school that they started in October 2013. He describes his children  as
    outgoing, confident and happy and settled into the British way of life.
    He says that they speak English most of the time although  he  and  his
    wife try to speak to them in Spanish but their  Spanish  is  basic  and
    they cannot read or write in Spanish. English is their first language.

17. He goes on to say that he and his wife have made good friends in the UK
    and have become fully integrated with their church.

18. At paragraph 14 of his statement he says that if his children are  sent
    to Bolivia they will be "horribly impacted on". He also  says  that  it
    will have a big impact on himself and his wife as they  have  spent  12
    years in the UK and will feel like strangers on return.

19. Mr S was cross-examined and he said that when  he  first  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in 2002 the visit was partly funded by his mother and he
    was originally coming for six months. When asked how long  he  intended
    to be in the UK when he  first  came  he  said  that  he  had  no  real
    intention to stay any longer than a year at first and  did  not  really
    have any idea how long he would stay. Once he transferred to a  student
    visa he said that he supported himself with a part-time  job  and  with
    some of the money that he still had left. He said that before  he  came
    to the UK he had studied at university in Bolivia and  had  obtained  a
    degree in Business Administration.  When  asked  how  he  is  supported
    financially now in the UK he said he was struggling to  manage  because
    he is not allowed to work but he sometimes does cash-in-hand  work.  He
    said that he earns an average of �800 a month through this work but  he
    also said that his rent is �900 a month. He receives  no  public  funds
    whatsoever and so when asked where the rest of the money comes from  to
    support the household he said that they get support from friends to the
    tune of some �300 - �400 per month to cover expenses. He said  that  he
    did not know how long these friends would be  willing  to  continue  to
    fund the family.

20. With regard to family in Bolivia, Mr S said that he has  a  brother  in
    Peru who works as a commercial airline pilot. He  is  his  stepbrother.
    They have the same mother but different fathers. His brother  qualified
    as a pilot in Bolivia. His step-father has passed away and  his  mother
    is now alone. He has no sisters.

21. As to what he means by his children being  "horribly  impacted  on"  if
    sent to Bolivia he said that it was because it was a different  country
    and a different culture. The children do not speak Spanish  very  well.
    They understand it but do not speak it very well and they do  not  read
    or write Spanish. It was put to him that the children had been speaking
    Spanish in the corridor of the court to each other  and  he  said  that
    they preferred to speak English but they do speak Spanish sometimes  at
    home. Apart from their inability to speak, read and write  Spanish,  he
    was asked whether there were any other problems about going to  Bolivia
    and he said that it is not a secure place; that there is a lot of crime
    and corruption and also if they wanted to be educated he would have  to
    register them in a school where they speak English which he  would  not
    be able to afford. Mr  Saunders  noted  that  the  background  evidence
    suggested that the education system in Bolivia was  unsatisfactory  and
    Mr S agreed. However, he also agreed that he is a  university  graduate
    and when asked if he would be able to get a job he said that there  was
    not really a lot of work and he knows this because he  reads  the  news
    and checks the Internet looking at the economy in Bolivia.

22. As regards the children's health he said that both girls  have  asthma;
    it is allergic asthma and he said that maybe they would not be able  to
    breathe in Bolivia and that in some parts of the country there was  not
    a lot of oxygen.

23. Mr Saunders then referred Mr S  to  the  report  from  the  educational
    psychologist that had been submitted on their behalf today and asked if
    he had read it. He said that  he  had  not  really  read  it.  He  also
    confirmed that the children had not seen the educational psychologist.

24. Mr S was asked how long it was after they first arrived in the UK  that
    he and his wife decided they wanted to remain and he said that  it  was
    after his wife arrived and they were having a good life; maybe a  year.
    He was asked about why he was unable to renew his visa and he indicated
    that it was when the law changed to the requirement to have  funds  for
    28 days. They could not  meet  the  Rules.  He  was  asked  if  it  was
    therefore correct that the family decided, in  2010,  that  they  would
    overstay and become dependent upon other people and he  confirmed  that
    it was and that it was while they were dependent upon other people they
    had their third child.

25. In re- examination he was asked again about work  in  Bolivia  and  the
    fact that he said he did not think he would be able to  find  work.  He
    was asked what work he had done when he was in Bolivia  before  and  he
    said that when he was at university some 15 years ago he  worked  as  a
    cashier in a financial institution but now he is 37 years old. He  also
    confirmed in re-examination that the family are surviving currently  by
    a combination of his working for cash in hand  and  the  generosity  of
    friends.

26. I next heard from Mrs P who gave her evidence through  an  interpreter.
    She adopted her recent statement as her  evidence  in  chief.  In  that
    statement she set out the history  of  her  time  in  the  UK  and  her
    husband's work history. Her statement mirrors that of her husband. With
    regard to her two daughters she said that when  they  are  together  or
    with friends they speak in English and that their Spanish is  not  very
    good and often if she speaks to them in Spanish they will not know  the
    proper words to reply. She said her  oldest  daughter  wants  to  be  a
    doctor when she grows up  and  the  second  daughter  wishes  to  be  a
    teacher. Apart from one holiday when they were very young in 2007  they
    have never been to Bolivia. They know they have grandparents there  but
    know nothing about the country. They believe themselves to be  British.
    She talks about how hard it was when her husband was in prison and also
    talks about how the family is integrated into the community and  church
    and how she has helped out at a local nursery and become  good  friends
    with the teacher.

27. She was cross-examined and she was asked about her  studies.  She  said
    she studied through until about 2010. Initially she studied English and
    then she tried to study  business  administration  but  was  unable  to
    finish the course because her visa ran out and she  had  a  very  young
    daughter. When she was a student she said  she  was  supported  by  her
    husband who was working but since 2010 when their  visas  run  out  her
    parents have been sending money in addition to her husband  doing  some
    work She has also been working doing cleaning and childcare for friends
    for cash. She said that her parents sent an average of  between  �1,000
    and �1,500 per month. She said her father is a retired doctor  and  her
    mother a retired teacher. When she was asked how they were able to send
    this money notwithstanding the fact that they were  retired,  she  said
    that they had worked all their lives and have savings. They  have  been
    sending that money since 2010. It was put to Mrs P that if  the  family
    returned to Bolivia they could continue to help and she  said  she  did
    not think that would be the case because they are grown-ups and  should
    be reliant upon themselves and not dependent on parents.

28. She had met and married her husband in Bolivia.  She was asked what her
    husband was doing in Bolivia and she said  that  he  had  finished  his
    Business Administration degree and  had  started  working  for  an  oil
    company. She said his parents  were  a  doctor  and  a  housewife.  His
    stepfather worked at the airport.

29. Mrs P was asked about the comment in her statement at paragraph 13 that
    returning the children to Bolivia would have  a  "terrible  impact"  on
    them. She said that the change would be enormous. She  has  asked  them
    and they have said that they do not want to go other than perhaps for a
    holiday. They say that their life is in England; they speak Spanish but
    they cannot read or write it. She was asked whether there was any other
    reason why they could not go and she said that it was just  that  their
    entire lives are in the UK.

30. Mrs P was asked how long it took her to feel comfortable  and  wish  to
    remain in the UK after she came and she  said  that  it  was  from  the
    moment she arrived. She likes the country, its structure, its  politics
    and its culture.

31. She was then asked why, given that she and her husband had been able to
    adapt so quickly to life in the UK having lived until then in  Bolivia,
    the children would not similarly be able to adapt and she said that  it
    was  very  different.  Bolivia  is  a  very  different   country   with
    kidnappings and deaths and criminality.

32. I asked Mrs P if it was correct, as reported in the country information
    that I had been given by her representatives, that teachers  were  paid
    between US$100 and US$300 per month. She said that was the case if  you
    worked for the State but if you worked in a private school it could  be
    as much as US$2000 - US$2500  per  month.   Her  mother  had  been  the
    director of a private school. I asked if it is fair  to  say  that  her
    parents were well off and she said it was. She has a brother in  Brazil
    who is a doctor and a sister who  is  in  Bolivia  and  married  to  an
    agricultural engineer.

33. In re-examination she was asked about her parents' situation in Bolivia
    and in particular if they were quite wealthy whether they could support
    her to have a comfortable life there and she reiterated that  that  was
    not the case because she should not be dependent on her parents as  she
    is an adult.  She did agree that they could  give  the  family  support
    initially. When asked why it was that she wanted to stay in the UK  she
    said that it is because she feels that she is a part  of  this  country
    and that the children were born here and the family  feels  a  part  of
    this country. She said that  in  Bolivia  there  is  very  little  work
    whereas in the UK you can  better  yourself.  She  confirmed  that  the
    family lives on what her husband earns, what she  can  earn  and  money
    from her parents. She said that they do not receive cash  support  from
    friends.

34. I then heard evidence from N L who used to work with Mr S when he was a
    foreman. He gave a glowing reference about his work and said that their
    friendship continued. He also suggested that he would get his job  back
    as soon as he got a visa.

35. I then heard  evidence  from  A  P  who  is  a  teacher  and  a  friend
    particularly of Mrs P. They first met through their children  and  have
    since become firm friends. She expressed the  view  that  the  children
    would not settle in Bolivia and that they  read  and  write  and  speak
    English very well. The families also get together with the church.  She
    described the children as being happy and bright, normal little  girls.
    She was asked about the comment by the educational psychologist in  her
    report that the children are introverted and sensitive  and  said  that
    whilst they are sensitive she would not describe them  as  introverted.
    She also ventured her opinion that they should not have  to  leave  the
    UK.

36. I then heard oral  submissions  from  Mr  Saunders  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State. He identified that this case turns on the  position
    of the two older children who were born in the UK more than seven years
    ago and the question to be answered is  whether  it  is  reasonable  to
    expect them to leave. He argued that it was. He said that  the  parents
    have not got anything like a claim to remain in the UK  and  that  they
    should be leaving the United Kingdom and absent any circumstances which
    would render removal unreasonable, the children's best  interests  were
    to go to Bolivia with their parents.

37. He referred to the evidence that had emerged at the  hearing  that  the
    parents both came from prosperous  and  professional  backgrounds.  The
    husband has a degree and had worked, according to him  in  a  financial
    institution as a student and according to his  wife,  after  graduation
    for an oil company. Both were good jobs.

38. He referred to the evidence submitted about  the  education  system  in
    Bolivia and in particular that few people were able to  complete  their
    education; yet this family has done so and their  families  are  in  an
    equally privileged position, all having professional jobs.  The  family
    are clearly prosperous to the extent that Mrs P's  parents  could  fund
    them to the extent of �1000 - �1500 a  month.  He  added  there  is  no
    reason  why  that  arrangement  should  not  continue  in  Bolivia.  He
    submitted that taking the position of the family as a whole there is no
    hardship in return.

39. He referred to Mr S's reference to jobs being difficult  to  obtain  in
    Bolivia but that clearly did not apply to those from a  privileged  and
    professional background such as this family came from. He  pointed  out
    that the family is there to support and  assist  them  to  re-establish
    themselves and once they have done so  there  is  no  reason  why  they
    should not be able to pay for their children's education  in  the  same
    way that their own was paid for.

40. With regard to the children's situation he asked  that  I  give  little
    weight to the comments of the educational  psychologists  who  has  not
    even seen the children.

41. He referred to Mr S's claim that both girls have asthma and yet despite
    being asked whether there was any  other  reason  why  they  could  not
    return to Bolivia the mother failed to mention it and there was also an
    absence of any medical evidence that they suffer from  this  condition.
    He referred to the fact that the children speak the  language  and  are
    intelligent, outgoing children and thus there is  no  reason  why  they
    would be unable to adapt to life in Bolivia as easily as their  parents
    adapted to life in the  UK,  particularly  given  that  they  would  be
    returning to a privileged and comfortable family situation.

42. He then referred me to the  Immigration  Act  2014  and  in  particular
    section 117B and submitted that it was in the public interest that this
    family be removed.

43. I then heard submissions from Mr Bennett. He confirmed  that  the  main
    reason why it is unreasonable for this family to be removed is the long
    residence of the two eldest children. He said the seven-year  threshold
    is a long established  principle  and  that  unless  there  are  strong
    countervailing reasons; children who have  been  in  the  UK  for  that
    length of time should  not  be  removed.  He  said  that  the  law  has
    introduced a "reasonableness" test but he still  submitted  that  where
    children have been in the UK for more than seven years their removal is
    unreasonable unless there is a strong reason to  do  so.  He  submitted
    that in  this  case  there  are  two  such  children  which  makes  the
    presumption even stronger.

44. He referred to the children's performance at school submitting that  it
    is clear they are at a crucial stage  in  their  development  which  is
    apparent in the  school reports and in particular in  the  letter  from
    the head teacher. That letter is contained at page 95 of the bundle and
    confirms that the children joined the school in October 2013. They  are
    said  to  attend  school  regularly  and  to  have  settled   in   very
    successfully. They are said to be quiet and helpful girls who  are  now
    established into the school and have integrated positively  with  other
    children having finally made a small circle  of  friends.  She  reports
    that their self-confidence is increasing and they are starting to  make
    progress and beginning to make more of a contribution to  the  life  of
    the school. However, she says that this improvement  was  not  achieved
    easily as both girls are very quiet and uncertain. She referred to both
    girls  having  social  difficulties  at  their  previous   school   and
    experiencing bullying which had a distressing  effect  on  their  self-
    esteem and progress.  The head teacher said she was pleased to see that
    they are recovering from those problems and beginning to make  progress
    normally as to be expected for their ages. However  they  both  require
    and receive emotional and psychological support sessions from  the  in-
    house therapeutic service.

45. The head teacher goes on to say that  she  is  concerned  that  if  the
    family  is  returned  to  Bolivia  the   children   will   be   damaged
    educationally and emotionally. She says she is  aware  that  they  have
    little family there because their parents have been living  in  the  UK
    for 12 years. She states that neither child has ever lived  in  Bolivia
    and would have to become used to a school system  very  different  from
    the one they  are  used  to.  She  said  she  is  concerned  for  their
    psychological and emotional welfare.

46. The head teacher goes on to say that in the case of a forced return she
    believes that both E and AB would be at a serious disadvantage both  in
    their learning and mental health. They need support  and  encouragement
    to continue to make progress. They are both  more  settled,  happy  and
    have friends around them and she fears that their emotional  well-being
    would also be compromised should they have to leave the UK.

47. This Mr Bennett indicated confirms the girls are at a crucial stage  in
    their development  and  the  negative  impact  of  removal.  The  other
    documents from the  school confirms that  the  children  are  kind  and
    gentle, making good progress, growing in confidence  which  he  pointed
    out contrasts with previous reports when they were not doing  so  well.
    Mr Bennett submitted it is clear from the evidence that they have  made
    good progress and are at a crucial stage.

48. With regard to the educational psychologist's  report  he  argued  that
    some weight  should  be  given  to  it  because  it  is  from  a  child
    psychologist and that in any event it is common sense that removing the
    children will have a prejudicial impact on their academic,  social  and
    emotional well-being thereby making removal  unreasonable  and  not  in
    their best interests. He relied in particular to paragraphs  36  of  EZ
    (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874.

49. That paragraph states:-

         "In a sense the Tribunal is concerned with how emphatic  an  answer
         falls to be given to the question: is it in the best  interests  of
         the child to remain? The longer the child has been here,  the  more
         advanced (or critical) the stage of his education, the  looser  his
         ties with  the  country  in  question,  and  the  more  deleterious
         consequences of his return, the greater the weight falls  into  one
         side of the scales. If it is overwhelmingly  in  the  child's  best
         interests  that  he  should  not  return,  the  need  to   maintain
         immigration control may well not tip the balance. By contrast if it
         is in the child's best interest to  remain,  but  only  on  balance
         (with some factors pointing the other way); the results may be  the
         opposite".

50. Mr Bennett submitted that there was a very emphatic yes in this case in
    answer to the  question  of  whether  it  is  in  the  children's  best
    interests to remain.

51. He accepted that there were some countervailing  factors  such  as  the
    fact that the parents are overstayers and father has a conviction but I
    should offset those against the positive contributions they  have  made
    and the father's work history of five years earning good money and  the
    respect of his colleagues as indicated by the glowing reference letters
    and the evidence of his colleague. He is an honest, hard-working person
    who can provide for his family if allowed to remain. He  also  referred
    to how the family has integrated so well into  the  community  and  the
    church, again as confirmed by the letters  of  support  and  the  other
    witness's evidence. All the supporting letters suggest that this  is  a
    decent hard-working and honest family which is held in high  esteem  by
    all who know them. The wife has undertaken voluntary work at a nursery.
    Overall, he said, this is a model migrant family and the scales  should
    be tipped in their favour.

Decision

52. This case turns  on  one  single  issue  and  that  is  whether  it  is
    unreasonable for the two eldest children of this family to be  expected
    to leave the UK. The provisions of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration
    Rules is now included in the Immigration Act 2014. Section 19  of  that
    Act inserts sections 117A to D into the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  It thus gives paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules statutory force.

53. Section 117A  requires  a  Tribunal  which  is  determining  whether  a
    decision made under the Immigration Acts breaches a person's  right  to
    respect for private and family life and thus would  be  unlawful  under
    section 6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  to  have  regard  to  the
    considerations listed in 117D (in non deport cases)

54. In this case, although the father  has  been  convicted  and  served  a
    prison sentence this is not a deportation appeal.

55. Section 117B sets out the public interest considerations applicable  in
    all cases as being:-

    (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
interest.

    (2)   It is in the public interest, and in particular in the  interests
    of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek
    to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English,  as
    persons who can speak English-

         (a)   are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)   are better able to integrate into society.

    (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
    the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  financially  independent,
    because such persons-

          a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

          b)  are better able to integrate into society.

    (4) little weight should be given to -

         (a)  a private life, or

         (b)   a relationship formed with a qualified partner,

    that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully.

    (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.

    (6) In the case of a person who  is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
    public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.

56. Paragraph 117D provides interpretation  and  in  particular  defines  a
    "qualifying child" as a person under the age of 18 and who is a British
    citizen, or has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period  of
    seven years or more.

57. It is now trite law that the best interests of a child are the  primary
    consideration and are to be considered first. It is also trite law that
    a period of seven years is taken as a threshold point when longevity of
    residence may render removal of a child disproportionate. However, that
    has been tempered both by the contents of the Immigration Rules and the
    2014 Act to impose a reasonableness test and also by case  law.  It  is
    not the case that seven years continuous residence  is  of  itself  the
    answer.

58. In terms of the seven year period itself, what is very relevant is when
    in the child's life the seven years occurred. It  has  been  said  that
    from birth to age 7 is perhaps less critical than from  age  7  to  14.
    That is because for the  first  approximately  four  years  of  life  a
    child's life centres around his family and he does  not  establish  any
    meaningful life away from his immediate carers and siblings. The  child
    only starts to acquire those with the onset of education at the age  of
    rising five. On the other hand a child who comes to the UK at  the  age
    of seven will complete its primary education here and seven years later
    at the age of 14 be at a  fairly  critical  stage  of  their  secondary
    education having embarked upon courses that  lead  to  GCSEs  and  thus
    important qualifications.

59. In this case we are talking about  the  first  eight  and  seven  years
    respectively of the children's lives and they have for  the  last  four
    and three years respectively attended  school  and  would  have  formed
    relationships beyond their immediate family both at school  and  church
    during that time. The fact that that is  four  years  and  three  years
    respectively means they have a less established UK based  private  life
    than a child who is older.

60. The children are clearly happy and settled  in  their  current  school,
    although it must be said that is a recent development as they had  been
    clearly unhappy and unsettled in their earlier school as  a  result  of
    being bullied. They have therefore for the past 12  months  been  in  a
    good educational environment and made some friends.   That  however  is
    only of one year's duration.

61. I am told that the children have expressed a wish to remain in the  UK.
    Given their ages, that is hardly surprising. They are not mature enough
    to make such a decision  for  themselves  and  are  making  it  from  a
    position of knowing only life in the  UK  and  nothing  about  Bolivia.
    Their wishes and feelings therefore, while relevant, given their  youth
    cannot be determinative. Children the  world  over,  particularly  when
    young go with their parents wherever their parents decide to go to work
    and live whether in another part of the same country or in another.

62. I note that the head teacher's comments would seem to suggest that  the
    girls would be equally distressed if they had to move elsewhere in  the
    UK - indeed anywhere which means a change if school.

63. The best interests of children of tender years as all three children in
    this case are, unless there are  countervailing  circumstances  lie  in
    living with their immediate family. That is the case here. It is in the
    best interests of all three children to live together with  each  other
    and with their parents wherever that may be. If the parents are  to  be
    removed to Bolivia it is in the children's best interests  to  go  with
    them. If the parents are in the UK then it is clearly in the children's
    best interests to  live  with  them.  Removing  the  parents  from  the
    equation altogether I find that the children's best interests would  be
    served by preserving the status quo and remaining in the UK.

64. The best interests of the children however  are  not  the  end  of  the
    matter. Baroness Hale in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4  and Judges  since
    have made  clear that  the  best  interests  of  children  are  a  very
    important factor and are  a  primary  consideration  but  they  can  be
    outweighed by other considerations. They are not, as they  are  in  the
    family courts the first and paramount  consideration.   In  the  family
    courts the best interests of children  are  the  determinative  factor.
    That is not the case in this jurisdiction.  It is  also  relevant  that
    the children in this case are not British.  British  children  have  an
    entitlement to live in and enjoy the benefits of living in the  country
    of their nationality.

65. I now turn to the countervailing factors.

66. The parents in this case have now been in the  UK  for  a  considerable
    period of time. On their own evidence they settled within 12 months and
    reached a conclusion that they  wanted  to  stay.  They  started  their
    family in the UK with all three children born here. When they could  no
    longer extend their leave they made  a  quite  deliberate  decision  to
    break the law and stay unlawfully. Not only did they make that decision
    but they have continued to take work unlawfully. Worse than that, Mr  S
    has a criminal conviction for which he has served  a  six-month  prison
    sentence. Whilst it  is  true  that  both  the  working  illegally  and
    criminal conviction arise out of a wish to support  themselves  in  the
    UK, that  only  became  necessary  because  they  remained  in  the  UK
    unlawfully.  Had they met the Immigration Rules they  would  have  been
    able to work. It is they who are responsible  for  the  situation  that
    they find themselves in.

67. Mr S clearly  speaks  good  English  and  has  been  able  to  take  up
    employment. I am less able to make that finding in relation to Mrs P as
    she gave her evidence through an interpreter and so I have no  evidence
    of her English ability save that she says she studied English.  However
    her ability is clearly not enough for her to  feel  comfortable  giving
    evidence in it.

68. I find it is also significant that having made a deliberate decision to
    overstay in 2010, in 2013 a matter of  weeks  after  the  eldest  child
    achieved the "magic age" of seven years they lodged  their  application
    to remain.

69. I am required to take into account that it is in  the  public  interest
    for a person settling in the UK to be financially independent. Whilst I
    have some evidence that if given leave to remain  Mr S would be able to
    work,  I do not have any confirmation from the company to  that  effect
    nor do I have any confirmation of his  potential  earnings  or  whether
    they would exceed the amount required by the Immigration  Rules  for  a
    couple with three children. Furthermore, whilst it is  true  that  they
    have not thus far claimed any public funds in terms of  benefits,  they
    are nevertheless enjoying the benefits  of  the  NHS  and  the  British
    education system to which they are not contributing.

70. The private life now relied upon by this family has  been  acquired  in
    large part when they should not have been here.   Indeed  the  youngest
    child was born while they were unlawfully here.

71. Without the fact of the ages of the two older  children  therefore  the
    parents' application to remain on Article 8 grounds would be a hopeless
    case. What might  tip  the  balance  in  their  favour  are  those  two
    daughters. As I have already indicated above they have been in  the  UK
    for 8 and 7 years respectively from birth and thus I find  it  is  less
    disruptive for them to leave than to an older child  who  has  spent  7
    years here. Much has been  made  by  both  parents  of  the  children's
    inability to speak Spanish. I find that the children can speak Spanish.
    They have been speaking Spanish in  the  court  precincts.  The  mother
    required an interpreter and Spanish is  the  first  language  for  both
    parents. I do not accept that as the children would have learned speech
    from their parents that they do not speak Spanish  and  indeed  I  find
    that their language of choice at home with their  parents  is  Spanish.
    They have had to learn English for school in the UK  and  have  clearly
    done so without difficulty.  There is no reason to suppose  they  could
    not equally adapt to an education  in  Spanish.  They  are  intelligent
    children and with the help and support of  their  parents  could  adapt
    quickly to a life conducted in Spanish, including learning to read  and
    write in that language. They are still very young.

72. I attach no weight to the father's claim that  the  girls  suffer  from
    allergic asthma and will be  unable  to  breathe  in  Bolivia.  If  the
    children did  indeed  suffer  from  this  potentially  life-threatening
    illness then I would have expected the mother to mention  it.  I  would
    also expect medical evidence to confirm it.

73. I refer to the head teacher's letter and her belief of the catastrophic
    effect on these children if they were to be removed to Bolivia.  Whilst
    I of course respect and accept the  head  teacher's  expertise  in  her
    field, she is not an expert on Bolivia.  It  is  also  clear  from  the
    content of her letter that the damage to these children's psychological
    and emotional health was caused by the  bullying  they  experienced  at
    their previous school. There is no reason to suppose that will occur in
    a Bolivian school. It is furthermore, not  the  case  of  two  children
    being wrested from their family to an alien environment. They  will  be
    travelling with their family to a country where they speak the language
    and where they have prosperous, professional and close family  who  can
    offer them help and support.

74. The educational psychologist's report  I  treat  with  utmost  caution.
    Whilst of course I accept  the  author  is  an  expert  as  she  is  an
    educational psychologist, not having even met  the  children  concerned
    renders her report virtually worthless, particularly as her comments on
    what these girls are like differ so much from both the comments of  the
    schools, their parents and the witness who know them well.

75. I cannot accept Mr Bennett's assertion that the answer to the  question
    referred to at paragraph 36 of EZ is an emphatic yes.   These  children
    fall a long way short of the scenario referred to therein by  being  at
    an "advanced (or critical) the stage of his education, the  looser  his
    ties  with  the  country  in  question,  and   the   more   deleterious
    consequences of his return".  It cannot be said in this case that it is
    "overwhelmingly in the children's' best interests that they should  not
    return."

76. I also cannot accept Mr Bennett's  assertion  that  this  is  a  "model
    migrant family".  They are in the UK illegally, have worked  illegally,
    extended their family at a time  when  they  have  no  leave  and   are
    dependant on others,  Mr  S  has  a  criminal  conviction  sufficiently
    serious to warrant a term of imprisonment.  Notwithstanding  that  they
    receive no benefits they are a burden on  the  tax  payer.   The  adult
    Appellants have sought to  deceive  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    Tribunal as to how they are supported in the UK, the circumstances that
    await them in Bolivia and about their children's state  of  health  and
    ability to speak Spanish.

77. I therefore conclude in this case that it would not be unreasonable  to
    expect these children to leave the UK  as  part  of  the  family  to  a
    country where they have considerable family ties, where they speak  the
    language and where both emotionally  and  financially  they  will  have
    support from their extended family.

78. The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is  allowed  with
    the result that the Appellants' appeals against the decision to  remove
    them are dismissed.
