Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Shaw, Counsel, instructed by Kilby Jones
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant, a citizen of Albania, entered the United  Kingdom
           on 29 April  2014  and  claimed  asylum.  That  application  was
           refused on 6  November  2015.  The  Appellant's  appeal  to  the
           Tribunal  against  the  refusal  of  her  protection  claim  was
           dismissed  on  all  grounds  by  decision   of   Judge   Clarke,
           promulgated on 6 December 2016.
        2. The Appellant was granted permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
           Tribunal by decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson  of
           6 March 2017. The Respondent filed a Rule  24  Notice  dated  27
           March 2017 opposing that grant.
        3. Thus the matter comes before me.


      The hearing
        4. When the matter was called on for hearing it was identified that
           no interpreter had been booked for the  hearing,  and,  that  Mr
           Shaw had been instructed on the basis that the decision  of  the
           FtT had already been set aside, and that this was the hearing of
           a remitted appeal to the FtT. The matter was stood down to allow
           him time to take instructions and/or prepare further.  When  the
           matter was called on  once  again  he  confirmed  he  was  in  a
           position to proceed, and to present the Appellant's appeal.


      The Judge's decision
        5. In the course of her decision of 6 November 2015 the  Respondent
           accepted that the Appellant was  who  she  claimed  to  be,  but
           rejected her claim to be  the  victim  of  trafficking  for  the
           purpose of sexual exploitation. The basis of that rejection  was
           the  earlier  rejection  on  28  April  2015  by  the  competent
           authority on the balance of probabilities, that her  account  of
           her experiences was true, following an NRM  referral.  Thus,  as
           the Judge accepted, if that was the basis  of  the  Respondent's
           decision on the asylum claim,  then  that  latter  decision  was
           flawed because the wrong standard of proof was used.
        6. In fact the Respondent's decision of 6 November 2015  identified
           no inconsistency or  lack  of  credibility  in  the  Appellant's
           account sufficient  to  merit  the  outright  rejection  of  her
           evidence of her experiences.  None  came  to  light  during  the
           hearing because the Respondent did not attend it, and thus there
           was no cross-examination.
        7. Accordingly the Judge was entirely correct to accept, as he did,
           the Appellant's evidence as credible on the applicable  standard
           of proof, and for the reasons that he  gave.  Thus  he  accepted
           [75] after analysis, that the entirety of her account  of  being
           trafficked from Albania to Italy, France and  back  to  Albania,
           and brutalised, and forced into prostitution in those  countries
           was true.
        8. Against this factual background, as he had found it  to  be,  Mr
           Shaw argued that  the  Judge  erred  in  taking  too  narrow  an
           approach to the country guidance  to  be  found  in  TD  and  AD
           (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 92. The country  guidance  was
           that the risk of re-trafficking faced by victims upon return  to
           Albania was a reality, and not  a  matter  of  speculation.  The
           nature of that risk was not confined to the risk  posed  by  the
           individuals who had been involved in the  original  trafficking.
           Thus the assessment of the true nature of the risk  faced  by  a
           particular individual  required  the  Tribunal  to  undertake  a
           holistic assessment of her personal circumstances which did  not
           simply focus upon the risk posed by the individuals who had been
           responsible for the original trafficking. Ms Petterson  for  her
           part accepted that this was the tenor of the country guidance.
        9. In this case, Mr Shaw argued, the Judge's decision  disclosed  a
           focus by the Judge  that  was  too  narrow,  and  one  that  had
           concentrated simply upon whether the Appellant could relocate to
           avoid the individuals responsible for the original  trafficking,
           and upon the possible links between those  individuals  and  the
           Albanian police. This error in the approach, he argued, had  led
           to the conclusion  that  there  was  adequate  state  protection
           available to the Appellant [81]  and  that  she  could  relocate
           within Albania to  avoid  those  individuals  [94]  because  her
           fiancï¿½e need not even know that she had returned to the country,
           and lacked the ability to trace her even  if  he  suspected  it.
           Thus, whilst the Judge did consider the medical evidence [85-91]
           he did so from the perspective of whether her return would  lead
           to  a  breach  of  her  Article  3  rights  consequent  upon   a
           deterioration in her mental health, rather than from either  the
           perspective of  whether  it  was  realistic  to  expect  her  to
           relocate at  all,  or,  from  the  perspective  of  whether  her
           vulnerability left her  at  risk  of  re-trafficking  by  others
           notwithstanding  any  relocation.  No  particular  location  was
           identified by either the Respondent or  the  Judge  as  being  a
           realistic relocation option,  for  this  educated  young  woman,
           permitting the Appellant  to  access  the  support  the  medical
           evidence showed that she needed, and to rebuild her life.
       10. I accept that the Judge's decision disclosed no specific finding
           rejecting the Appellant's claim to be at risk  of  harm  in  her
           home area - either from those who had trafficked her previously,
           or, from members of her family who she  said  she  feared  would
           kill her to preserve the "family honour". Indeed,  if  paragraph
           100 of the decision was intended to be read  as  such,  then  it
           would be plainly inconsistent with what  had  gone  before.  The
           Judge had earlier specifically accepted that  it  was  plausible
           the Appellant's parents had disowned her [84], and  earlier  had
           accepted  the  Appellant's  evidence  in  full  [75].   In   the
           circumstances, I am satisfied that the decision must be read  as
           accepting that the Appellant did face a real risk of harm in her
           home area from both her former  trafficker,  and  her  family  -
           albeit one that the Judge considered could be avoided either  by
           seeking  state  protection,  or,  through   the   expedient   of
           relocation.
       11. In those circumstances Mr Shaw's criticism of the approach taken
           by the Judge to the evidence of  scarring  relied  upon  by  the
           Appellant as corroboration of the brutality she had  experienced
           at the hands of her traffickers and her  prostitution  might  be
           said to fall away as immaterial. However I am satisfied that  to
           simply attach no weight to  the  unchallenged  evidence  of  the
           existence of scars as corroboration of her account for lack of a
           consultant  plastic  surgeon's  report  was  not   the   correct
           approach; the evidence was deserving of at  least  some  weight.
           Given the acceptance of the whole of  her  evidence,  the  Judge
           should in fact have accepted her account of  the  injuries  that
           had occasioned those scars, and the circumstances in which those
           injuries were inflicted.
       12. The Judge did accept in the light of the medical  evidence  that
           the Appellant was particularly vulnerable as  a  result  of  her
           mental health. That evidence (which included low mood,  anxiety,
           and self harming) pointed to her  as  suffering  from  PTSD  and
           needing both the daily  medication,  and,  the  counselling  she
           received fortnightly  to  control  its  symptoms.  The  evidence
           showed that the only reason she was not receiving  CBT  was  the
           lack of supply of that service to meet the demand  for  it;  she
           was on a waiting list.
       13. Whilst the  Judge  was  no  doubt  entitled  to  note  that  the
           Appellant had not been referred to a consultant psychiatrist  or
           psychologist, and thus had no formal diagnosis, it is less  easy
           to see to what purpose he put the "significant weight"  that  he
           attached to her progress at College  whilst  attending  an  ESOL
           course. Mr Shaw's criticism was that this was used to  undermine
           the weight that should otherwise have been given to the  medical
           evidence, and the Appellant's account of her experiences, and to
           justify a finding  that  the  Appellant  could  be  expected  to
           relocate to an unspecified location within Albania. As  such  he
           points to the guidance to be found in TD #106-112,  and  argues,
           in my judgement with justification, that  the  Judge's  approach
           did not follow it.
       14. The  Appellant's  evidence  (which  was  accepted  in  full)  as
           corroborated by the scars (to which no weight was  given)  meant
           that her appeal had to be approached on the basis that  she  had
           been subject to a significant level of brutality even within the
           context  of  a  young  woman  who  had   been   trafficked   for
           prostitution against her will. As the Upper Tribunal said in  TD
           these are  important  factors  which  must  be  considered  when
           considering  whether  internal  flight  is  reasonable  for  any
           individual [110].
       15. After due consideration Ms Petterson accepted  for  the  reasons
           set out above that there had not been an  adequate  analysis  by
           the Judge of the risk the appellant faced  either  in  her  home
           area, or  in  Albania  generally,  because  there  had  been  no
           adequate analysis of the risk of re-trafficking and the  ability
           to relocate to avoid the risks faced. Thus the Judge  had  erred
           materially. Both parties then agreed  however  that  the  appeal
           could nevertheless be disposed of by me  on  the  basis  of  the
           findings of primary fact that had been made,  without  the  need
           for further oral evidence. I agree.
       16. In the circumstances of this appeal I am not satisfied  that  it
           is reasonable to expect the  Appellant  to  internally  relocate
           within Albania to avoid the risks that the  Judge  accepted  she
           faced in her home area. Those  risks  were  posed  by  both  her
           family, and, her former traffickers. I  note  that  no  specific
           area  has  ever  been  identified  by  the  Respondent  for  her
           prospective relocation - but even assuming the expectation to be
           no more detailed than that she should relocate to a  city  I  am
           not satisfied that it is a reasonable one.
       17. Following the  guidance  to  be  found  in  TD  [105-112]  I  am
           satisfied that she would face very significant obstacles if  she
           sought to relocate, which  would  include  grave  difficulty  in
           accessing a comparable level  of  mental  health  services  from
           which she currently benefits and which permit her to function to
           the  level  the  Judge  commented  upon   so   favourably   when
           considering her ability to follow her  ESOL  course.  Access  to
           services must of course include the ability to raise  the  funds
           to pay for such services. The evidence reviewed in  TD  did  not
           suggest that the Albanian authorities are  able  or  willing  to
           provide a comparable level of  support  to  trafficking  victims
           upon return, to that which may be accessed in the UK  for  free.
           Absent an ability to access a level of  mental  health  services
           that would allow the Appellant to function sufficiently well  to
           support and house herself, it is very difficult to see  how  she
           could support or house herself to any  adequate  degree.  Indeed
           her very vulnerability in seeking to support  herself  would  be
           what would be likely to place her at an unacceptably  high  risk
           of re-trafficking.
       18. I can see very little merit  in  the  argument  advanced  by  Ms
           Petterson to the effect that having been duped once,  she  would
           be wary of being duped again. She may  indeed  be  very  wary  -
           indeed the mental health  issues  she  has  suggests  that  this
           understates the position badly,  but  without  effective  family
           support she would probably be forced into the "grey economy" and
           she would have very little choice over the risks that she  would
           then be forced to take in  seeking,  and  then  accepting,  what
           employment offers she might secure  from  time  to  time.  I  am
           satisfied that she would find  even  mere  subsistence  survival
           extremely difficult  to  achieve  without  significant  support.
           Given her past experiences, and her consequent mental health,  I
           am satisfied that the Appellant has established that as one  who
           is without family support she would face very  grave  difficulty
           in locating, accessing and benefiting from  the  help  that  she
           would undoubtedly need in order to support herself and survive.
       19. Moreover, as a single woman, living outside the family unit, the
           guidance in TD is to  the  effect  that  she  would  be  readily
           identifiable as being an "outsider" and as vulnerable, by  those
           individuals minded to prey upon the weaker members  of  Albanian
           society. That pool is far wider than simply  those  involved  in
           her original trafficking. Thus I am satisfied that she would  be
           at serious risk of re-trafficking even outside her home area.
       20. If those were my conclusions then Ms  Petterson  confirmed  that
           the Respondent did not resist the conclusion  that  the  Judge's
           decision should be set aside and  remade  so  as  to  allow  the
           asylum appeal.





   DECISION


      The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  6
      December 2016 did involve the making of an error of law that  requires
      that decision to be set aside and remade.


      The asylum appeal is allowed.
