                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

[1]  This is the Secretary of State's appeal against  the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 16 August 2013.

[2]  All three Appellants were the subject of decisions of the Secretary  of
    State dated 20 November 2012.  By  these  decisions  the  Secretary  of
    State refused to revoke  previously made deportation orders in  respect
    of each Appellant.

[3]  The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appeals,  firstly,  under  the
    Immigration Rules; secondly, under Article 3 ECHR ; and, thirdly, under
    Article 8 ECHR.  The Secretary of State registered  an  appeal  against
    that determination.  The grounds of appeal focus predominantly  on  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8.

[4]  At the outset of the hearing conducted before this  Tribunal  today  Mr
    Saunders on behalf of the Secretary of State acknowledged, properly and
    correctly in our view, that the grounds of appeal do not formulate  any
    challenge to the assessment, findings and conclusions of the First-tier
    Tribunal in respect  of  Article  3  ECHR.  The  jurisdiction  of  this
    Tribunal is shaped by the grounds of appeal.  This  Tribunal  does  not
    exercise any original  or  inherent  jurisdiction.  Rather,  it  is  an
    appellate court.  There being no formulated challenge of the kind  that
    I have just mentioned in the grounds of appeal  it  follows  inexorably
    that the appeal must be dismissed. This consequence was, realistically,
    recognised by Mr Saunders.

[5]  As we have  observed  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  father's
    appeal on two other grounds, namely under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    under Article 8 ECHR.  It may be said that those two grounds are inter-
    related. In the events which have  occurred  at  today's  hearing  this
    Tribunal has not considered any argument  of  any  substance  on  those
    issues.  It would, in principle, be open this Tribunal  to  investigate
    and consider those issues in full and to make its own determination  of
    whether the First-tier Tribunal committed any material error of law  in
    respect thereof.  However, the appeal has taken a certain course and we
    have declined to conduct such  exercise,  taking  into  account,  inter
    alia,  the  overriding  objective  and  all  of  the  principles  which
    constitute that important standard.

          DECISION

[6]  Accordingly we dismiss and affirm the  Determination  of  the  First  -
tier Tribunal.

                                    Mr Justice McCloskey,
                                                  President  of  the   Upper
     Tribunal

                           Dated:      25 October 2013
