For the Appellant:     Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Brakaj, Iris Law Firm


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national  of  Iraq  born  in  1984.   On  the  20th
    November 2019 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  O'Hanlon)  allowed  his
    appeal on humanitarian protection grounds. The Secretary of  State  now
    has permission to appeal against that decision.


 2. The basis of the asylum claim before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    the Respondent faced a real risk of serious harm in Iraq  arising  from
    his illicit relationship with a young woman. It was  averred  that  the
    family of this girl had discovered that the Respondent had  slept  with
    her and that they had declared that they would kill him.  A second limb
    of the case related to the Respondent's claim that since his arrival in
    the United Kingdom he had given information to the  police  here  about
    another Iraqi national, a man held on suspicion of terrorist  offences.
    The Respondent claimed to fear this man's family in Iraq.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal found the Respondent's evidence about the young
    woman  and  the  threat  of  "honour"-based  violence  to   "lack   all
    credibility". As for the actions of the Respondent in giving the police
    a statement about the terrorist suspect, the Tribunal considered it  to
    be speculative that either the man or his family would  know  that  the
    Respondent had done this. At its highest  his  evidence  concerned  the
    addresses of family members of the man  and  there  was  no  reason  to
    believe that the Respondent  had  incriminated  him  any  further.  The
    appeal was thereby dismissed on asylum grounds.

 4. The Tribunal went on to consider whether the appeal should nevertheless
    succeed on humanitarian protection grounds.   It notes  [at  �53]  that
    the Secretary of State accepted that the Respondent  was  from  Kirkuk,
    and that this was a 'contested area' such that Article 15  (c)  of  the
    Qualification Directive applied: AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT
    00544.  That being the case, the Tribunal directed itself that the next
    question was whether the Respondent could  reasonably  be  expected  to
    relocate somewhere else in Iraq in order to  avoid  the  indiscriminate
    harm that he would  face  in  Kirkuk.   It  recorded  the  Respondent's
    consistent evidence that his CSID and his Iraqi passport had been taken
    from him by the agents in Turkey [at �54].  Having had  regard  to  its
    own findings on the evidence about the young lady the Tribunal was  not
    prepared to accept  the  Respondent's  evidence  that  his  family  had
    disowned him as a result of that affair [at  �56];  it  found  that  he
    retained the ability to contact his parents if he wished.   His  family
    would be able to assist him in acquiring a CSID:  AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds  -
    Internal Relocation) Iraq CG [2018] UKUT 00212 applied. With a CSID  he
    could enter the IKR by air.  The Tribunal then said this [at �58]:

         "However AAH goes on to say that for those without  the  assistance
         of family  in  the  KRI  accommodation  options  are  limited.  The
         question  of  whether  the  appellant  would  be  able  to   secure
         employment must also be assessed on  a  case-by-case  basis  taking
         into account factors such that the  unemployment  rates  for  Iraqi
         displaced persons living in the KRI is 70%, patronage and  nepotism
         are important factors in securing employment and the fact that  the
         appellant is from an area with  associations  with  ISIS  that  may
         deter prospective employers.   In this case having  considered  all
         of the information before me,  although I find that  the  appellant
         could access a CSID card and thereby gain access to the KRI by air,
         taking into account the lack of assistance of family in the KRI and
         difficulties which the appellant may find in securing employment in
         the KRI I do find that taken cumulatively,  internal relocation  in
         the KRI for the appellant would be unduly harsh".

 5. The Tribunal went on to make similar findings in  respect  of  Baghdad,
    and the appeal was allowed on humanitarian protection grounds.

 6. The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal are detailed and excessively
    long. The essence of her complaint is that in making  its  findings  on
    internal flight the Tribunal failed to explain why the Respondent could
    not receive the material financial assistance of his family  in  Kirkuk
    thus lifting him above an unacceptable level of destitution.

 7. I am satisfied that this error is made out. The  Tribunal  had  already
    found that the Respondent was in touch with his family  and  that  they
    would be willing to go to the trouble of getting him a replacement CSID
    and bringing it to Baghdad Airport so  that  he  could  fly  to  Irbil.
    Having made that finding it is not  at  all  clear  that  the  Tribunal
    turned its mind to whether they would also be willing or able to  offer
    him some meagre financial assistance until such time as he was able  to
    establish himself in the IKR. In AAH the  Tribunal  accepted  that  the
    presence of family members was a relevant factor for that very  reason.
    I am therefore prepared to set the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    aside to that extent.

 8. Before me Mr Tan raised another matter that does not expressly  feature
    in the grounds. As I have noted, the Tribunal  proceeded  to  determine
    the appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State had  accepted  that
    Kirkuk remained contested territory. Paragraph  53  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal records that the Secretary of State makes this  concession  in
    the refusal letter. It seems likely that the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    there referring to paragraph 77 of that decision:

         "The security situation in Iraq has changed considerably since  the
         decision in AA [2015] was promulgated. However, the most up-to-date
         information available  confirms  that  your  home  area  of  Kirkuk
         governate still meets the threshold of article 15 (c)"

 9. What the Tribunal did not appear to notice (and no  Presenting  Officer
    appeared before it in order to assist) was that the refusal letter goes
    on to reach precisely the opposite conclusion, at its paragraph 134:

         "For the reasons given above, there are strong grounds supported by
         cogent evidence to depart from AAs assessment  that  any  areas  of
         Iraq engage the high threshold of Article 15(c)..."

10. Mr Tan submits that the failure to deal with  the  submission  made  at
    paragraph 134 was a discrete error of law.

11. This was not a point taken in the grounds, and it is not a criticism of
    the First-tier Tribunal that I am prepared to uphold. The Tribunal  was
    faced with a protection appeal involving complex  issues  of  fact  and
    law, and no representative of the Home Office available to assist.  The
    refusal letter runs to some 154 paragraphs and the First-tier  Tribunal
    can be forgiven for stopping reading at paragraph 77  given  that  this
    was the key statement it was interested in for the purpose  of  Article
    15(c). From thereon in it was to be  guided  by  the  country  guidance
    cases.   If the Secretary of State wishes to have her  case  considered
    by  the  Tribunal,  she  should  make  sure  that  it  is  not   flatly
    contradictory.

12. It nevertheless remains for me to remake the  decision  in  respect  of
    Article 15. Accepting as I must that the operative country guidance  is
    now SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity documents)  Iraq  CG  [2019]
    UKUT 00400 (IAC) I make the following findings.

13. It was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal that the Respondent  has  no
    CSID nor Iraqi passport. No findings are made on whether  he  is  in  a
    possession of an INC but I am satisfied that it is highly unlikely that
    he is. It has been his consistent evidence  that  he  handed  over  his
    documents to an agent in Turkey. It made sense that he should do  this:
    he had no need for them himself anymore and presumably  such  documents
    have a relatively high value on the black  market.    It  seems  wholly
    probable that had the Respondent been in possession of his INC that too
    would have been handed over.   There is no reason to  suppose  that  he
    would have left that document at home, but  taken  the  more  important
    passport and CSID with him with the intention of giving  them  up  once
    over the border.   I am satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the
    Respondent has no identity documents nor copies thereof.

14. Following the concession made in SMO, the  relevance  of  documents  in
    Iraqi cases is, for the  Secretary  of  State,  that  without  them  an
    individual may face conditions of such socio-economic deprivation so as
    to engage the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  Article  3  ECHR/
    Article 15(b)  of  the  Qualification  Directive.    To  that  end  the
    concession made in AA, AAH and repeated  in  SMO  remains  Home  Office
    policy:

         "... it remains the  position  that  a  person  returning  to  Iraq
         without either family connections able to assist him, or the  means
         to obtain a CSID, may be at risk of enduring conditions contrary to
         Article 3 ECHR."

15. It is therefore important to establish whether or not it is  reasonably
    likely that the  Respondent  would  be  able  to  obtain  new  identity
    documents, either a CSID or one of the new biometric 'INID's.
16. Mr Tan suggested that as a starting point the Respondent would be  able
    to acquire a CSID before he leaves the United Kingdom,  by  approaching
    the embassy in London. He referred me to paragraph 383 of the  decision
    in SMO (Iraq):

         "We have not been asked to revisit the extant country  guidance  on
         the way in which an individual might obtain a replacement CSID from
         within the UK, for which see [173]-[177] of AA (Iraq) and  [26]  of
         AAH (Iraq).  We add only this: whilst the INID is clearly replacing
         the CSID in Iraq, consulates do not have the  electronic  terminals
         necessary to issue the INID and continue to issue the CSID instead,
         as confirmed in a Canadian Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  report
         which is quoted at 5.6.9 of the respondent's CPIN entitled Internal
         Relocation, civil documentation and returns, dated  February  2019.
         An Iraqi national in the UK would be able to apply for  a  CSID  in
         the way explained  in  AA  (Iraq)  and,  if  one  was  successfully
         obtained, we find that it  would  be  acceptable  evidence  of  the
         individual's identity throughout Iraq.  Notwithstanding the plan to
         replace the old CSID system with the INID by the end  of  2019,  we
         accept what was said by EASO (in  February  2019)  and  the  Danish
         Immigration  Service  and  Landinfo  (in   November   2018),   that
         implementation was delayed and that the CSID was still  being  used
         in Iraq, and that it continues to be issued in those parts  of  the
         country in which the INID  terminals  have  not  been  rolled  out.
         Given this evidence, and the fact that the CSID has been a  feature
         of Iraqi society for so long, we do not accept that there will come
         a time at the end of this year when the CSID suddenly ceases to  be
         acceptable as proof of identity."

17. Mr Tan relied on this passage to submit that the Upper Tribunal in  SMO
    clearly envisaged that it remained possible to obtain  a  new  CSID  in
    London. The passages in AA to which the Tribunal refer are these:

         "173.    As regards those who have  an  expired  or  current  Iraqi
         passport but no CSID - Dr Fatah identifies in his first report that
         a CSID may be obtained through the "Consular section of  the  Iraqi
         Embassy in London", which will send a request for a replacement  or
         renewed CSID to the General Directorate for Travel and  Nationality
         - Directorate of Civil Status. A request  for  a  replacement  CSID
         must be accompanied, inter alia, by "any form of official  document
         in support of the applicant's identity" and  the  application  form
         must be signed by "the head of the family, or the legal guardian or
         representative to verify the truth of its contents." He also  added
         that an applicant must also authorise a person in Iraq  to  act  as
         his representative in order for that person to "follow  up  on  the
         progress of the application".


         174.     However, Dr Fatah  continued  by  explaining  that  if  an
         individual has lost his CSID and does not know  the  relevant  page
         and book number for it, then the Iraq Embassy in London will not be
         able to obtain one on his behalf. Instead, he or she will  have  to
         attend the appropriate local office of family registration in  Iraq
         or give a relative, friend or lawyer power of  attorney  to  obtain
         his or her CSID. The process of a giving power  of  attorney  to  a
         lawyer in Iraq to act "as a proxy" is commonplace and Dr Fatah  had
         done this himself. He also explained that  the  power  of  attorney
         could be obtained through the Iraq Embassy.


         175.     Dr Fatah gave further evidence to the effect that having a
         marriage certificate may be useful as it would contain  data  found
         in the family records. It  is,  however,  not  possible  to  use  a
         "health card" in order to obtain a CSID because there is no primary
         health care or GP system in Iraq,  but  instead  patients  attended
         hospital when they needed to do so and no central records are held.




         176.     There is a consensus between Dr Fatah's evidence  and  the
         following more general evidence provided  by  UNHCR-Iraq  in  April
         2015 on the issue of obtaining CSID's from abroad. "In principle, a
         failed asylum seeker, or  indeed  any  Iraqi  citizen  abroad,  can
         acquire Iraqi documents through  Iraqi  embassies  and  consulates.
         There is a special authorization granted to these bodies to provide
         documents for Iraqi abroad on the condition that the  beneficiaries
         should have  any  available  documents  in  order  to  prove  their
         nationality."


         177.     In summary, we conclude that it is possible for  an  Iraqi
         national living in the UK to obtain a  CSID  through  the  consular
         section of the Iraqi Embassy in London, if such a person is able to
         produce a current or expired passport  and/or  the  book  and  page
         number for their family registration details. For  persons  without
         such a passport, or who are unable to produce the  relevant  family
         registration details, a  power  of  attorney  can  be  provided  to
         someone in  Iraq  who  can  thereafter  undertake  the  process  of
         obtaining the CSID for such person from the  Civil  Status  Affairs
         Office in their home governorate. For  reasons  identified  in  the
         section that follows below, at the  present  time  the  process  of
         obtaining a CSID from Iraq is likely to be severely hampered if the
         person wishing to obtain the CSID is from  an  area  where  Article
         15(c) serious harm is occurring".

18. The supplementary evidence given by Dr Fatah in AAH was as follows:

         "26.     If applying through a consulate  abroad  the  requirements
         are different.  Having  contacted  the  consulate  in  London,  and
         checked on the website of the Iraqi embassy  in  Sweden,  Dr  Fatah
         states that the authorities will require  the  applicant  to  first
         make a statement explaining why he needs a CSID and attach this  to
         his application form, which must countersigned by the head  of  the
         applicant's family and stamped by the consulate or embassy; he must
         then produce his Iraqi passport and proof of status in the  country
         where he is applying, the name of a representative (proxy) in Iraq,
         an additional form completed by the head of the applicant's  family
         verifying that the contents of his application form were true, four
         colour copies of his INC, and 10 colour photographs. Crucially  the
         applicant must be able to produce something which can establish the
         location of his family's details in the civil register. This should
         be a CSID, an INC or  birth  certificate.  If  none  of  these  are
         available to the applicant he must supply the identity documents of
         his parents. This evidence again  accords  with  that  of  Landinfo
         (December 2017) who conclude that it can  be  difficult  to  obtain
         replacement ID documents from an embassy abroad for the  individual
         who is unable to verify his or her identity.


         27. If you are in Iraq, and have all of the required documents,  in
         normal circumstances the process is straightforward and  quick  and
         should take no more than three days. Dr Fatah's  own  daughter  was
         born in the United Kingdom and he managed to obtain her a  CSID  in
         one day from the office in Sulaymaniyah, upon payment  of  a  small
         fee. Dr Fatah was less  optimistic  about  the  efficiency  of  the
         process if in the United Kingdom. He has regular dealings with  the
         consulate in London and he is not impressed.  He  said  that  staff
         there are generally very unhelpful.


         ..."





19. Applying that guidance, and in particular the evidence of Dr  Fatah,  I
    find as follows.   There is no obstacle to  the  Respondent  signing  a
    statement explaining why he does not currently have a CSID. Whether  he
    could get  that  countersigned  by  the  head  of  his  family  remains
    debatable. The First-tier Tribunal found that he will still  have  some
    contact with his family in Kirkuk but it is far from clear whether that
    this includes his father.  Assuming for the sake of argument  that  the
    Appellant's father is alive and well and living  in  Kirkuk,  and  that
    there is no reason why he could not countersign the  application  form,
    there remains the matter of the  colour  photocopy  of  the  INC.   The
    Respondent does not have such a document and it is at least  reasonably
    likely that he would not be able  to  obtain  one.  I  have  considered
    whether embassy staff might be prepared to overlook  that  requirement,
    if for instance the Respondent was  able  to  give  them  the  relevant
    details of his 'family book',  but this seems unlikely given  that  the
    strict evidential requirements appear to be there for a reason, and  it
    was Dr Fatah's overall conclusion that  embassy  staff  in  London  are
    "generally very unhelpful". Having considered all of those  matters  in
    the round I am satisfied that there must  be  a  reasonable  likelihood
    that the Appellant would not be able to acquire a new CSID  in  London.
    The application process explained by Dr Fatah must  be  viewed  in  the
    context  of  the  very  great  number  of  Iraqi  nationals   who   are
    undocumented,  and  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  that  the  problems  of   an
    individual returnee are regarded as "trivial".


20. This means that there is at least  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the
    Appellant will find himself at Baghdad airport with no means of  onward
    travel. He cannot board a domestic flight to Kirkuk,  and  cannot  pass
    through the many checkpoints on the road north.  In order to do  so  he
    would need a CSID, or one of the new generation of identity cards - the
    INID - being progressively rolled out across the country.

21. The next question is whether the Appellant would be able to secure such
    identity documents within a reasonable time frame.  Assuming  that  his
    family in Kirkuk would be able to assist him by approaching  the  civil
    status office in that city on his behalf,  and  that  one  male  family
    member would be able and willing to make the journey to Baghdad airport
    to greet the Appellant and bring to him  a  replacement  card,  I  must
    nevertheless consider the likelihood of such a card being issued  to  a
    proxy. It was the clear evidence of Dr Fatah that the new generation of
    cards are not being issued to proxies.   Although the Tribunal was  not
    expressly told whether the Kirkuk civil status office is issuing  INIDs
    or CSIDs, it was its assumption  that  it  is  the  former,  given  the
    evidence that it is largely  'rural areas' that have been left  behind:
    see paragraphs 389 and 431 SMO.   That being so it does not  appear  to
    be at all likely that the Appellant will be able to obtain a INID  from
    his home city Kirkuk, given that he cannot get  there  and  any  family
    member who might be willing  to  help  will  not  be  assisted  by  the
    authorities.  Applying the guidance in AAH and SMO it follows that  the
    Appellant would, on arrival, be exposed to conditions  amounting  to  a
    violation of Article 15(b) and his  appeal  must  be  allowed  on  that
    basis.




    Anonymity Order

22. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"






    Decision


23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


24. There is an order for anonymity.

25. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on protection grounds.


                                                                       [pic]
