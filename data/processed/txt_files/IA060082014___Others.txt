Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr. J. Plowright , Counsel instructed by Gulbenkian
                    Andonian Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms. E. Savage, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision of the  First-
       tier Tribunal (FTT), Judge Plumptre of the First-tier Tribunal, which
       was promulgated on 15th October 2014.  The FTT  Judge  refused  their
       appeals against a refusal by the Secretary of State (SSHD)  to  grant
       leave to remain (LTR) outside the Immigration Rules (the  Rules)  and
       against immigration notices to remove them as illegal entrants.   The
       letter of refusal was dated 17th January 2014 and the removal notices
       the 16th January.

    2. The appellants are Georgian nationals.  The first appellant  (A1)  is
       the husband of the third appellant (A3) and the second appellant (A2)
       is their daughter, now 8 years old.   She  was  born  in  the  United
       Kingdom and has lived here ever since, which is a period of more than
       7 years.  This means that she is a "qualifying child" as  defined  by
       section 117D(b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.
       We shall return to the significance of that below.

    3. A1 entered the United Kingdom on 1st July 2002 as a visitor  and  has
       remained here since then.  He had suffered a brain tumour  which  had
       been treated in Georgia but he has required  extensive  treatment  in
       this country since.  He was arrested as an overstayer on 4th November
       2008 and made two unsuccessful applications under Article  8  of  the
       EHCR.  A3 entered as a student on 12th  November  2002  and  had  LTR
       until 30th June 2009 since which time she has been unlawfully in this
       country.

  The decision of the SSHD

    4. The SSHD considered the applications under the  new  Rules,  applying
       Appendix FM and Rule 276ADE.  The applications under the  Rules  were
       all rejected and no appeal is pursued against that decision,  and  it
       is not necessary to set out that lengthy process in full.  Some brief
       detail is necessary, because failure under the Rules  is  a  relevant
       factor to be considered in deciding the Article 8 claims outside  the
       Rules.

    5. The appellants were found to meet the suitability requirements of the
       Rules (one aspect  of  which  is  that  A1  was  not  found  to  have
       accumulated a NHS debt in excess  of  �1,000).   Neither  A1  nor  A3
       qualified under the  partner  rules,  because  although  they  had  a
       settled relationship neither was a British Citizen, they did not have
       settled status in the UK, and did not have leave to remain in the  UK
       as a refugee or humanitarian protection.  They did not qualify  under
       the parent rules because neither is the sole carer for the child  and
       they are entitled to apply under the partner rules  (unsuccessfully).
       They therefore could not rely on EX.1, but even if they  could,  they
       would fail because the child A2, had not lived continuously in the UK
       for not less than 7 years at the date of the application and it would
       be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK with  her  parents.
       It was accepted that education in Georgia is less good than it is  in
       the UK, but A2 would be no more disadvantaged than any other child in
       Georgia.  The SSHD said that  the  new  Rules  had  been  drafted  to
       reflect the duty of  the  SSHD  under  section  55  of  the  Borders,
       Citizenship, and Immigration Act 2009 and Article 8.  The claim under
       paragraph 276ADE failed because the parents  had  been  here  for  11
       years rather than 20 years, and had not lost all ties  with  Georgia.
       Claims based on A1's medical condition failed for reasons  which  are
       not relevant to his appeal.

  The decision of the FTT

    6. There are two grounds of  challenge  to  the  decision.   The  second
       requires an explanation of the structure of the decision in a  little
       detail.  The grounds are

        a. That the Judge erred in her application of a decision of the UTT
           in Azimi-Moayed and Others (Decisions Affecting Children; Onward
           Appeals);  Azimi-Moayed  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department [2013] I.N.L.R. 693.

        b. That the Judge acted unfairly in pursuing and relying on her own
           conviction that despite the finding recorded above,  A1  had  in
           fact accumulated a debt to the NHS in excess of �1,000.

    7. These are discrete grounds which do not  involve  an  attack  on  the
       whole of the  decision.   The  FTT  Judge  heard  evidence  and  made
       findings of fact which are not, for the most part,  challenged.   She
       canvassed the law  relating  to  A1's  claim  to  LTR  based  on  his
       continuing need for medical care, and her conclusion adverse  to  him
       on that issue is not challenged.  Predominantly, the argument  before
       her centred on the child.  She referred to the relevant law.

        a. She applied  the  well-known  dictum  of  Baroness  Hale  in  ZH
           (Tanzania) at paragraph 34:-

                "Further, it is clear from the recent jurisprudence that the
                Strasbourg court will expect national authorities  to  apply
                article 3.1 of UNCRC and treat the best interests of a child
                as  "a  primary  consideration".  Of  course,  despite   the
                looseness with which these  terms  are  sometimes  used,  "a
                primary consideration" is  not  the  same  as  "the  primary
                consideration",    still    less    as    "the     paramount
                consideration"".

        b. She reminded herself of section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship
           and Immigration Act 2009 which provides:-

                "55 Duty regarding the welfare of children


                    (1) The Secretary of State must make arrangements for
                    ensuring that-

                        (a) the functions mentioned in subsection (2) are
                        discharged having regard to the need to safeguard
                        and promote the welfare of children who are in the
                        United Kingdom"

        c. When weighing the public interest  she  set  out  the  terms  of
           section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act:-

                "(6)  In  the  case  of  a  person  who  is  not  liable  to
                deportation,  the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
                person's removal where -

                    (a) the person has a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a qualifying child, and

                    (b) it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to
                    leave the United Kingdom."

        d. The Judge reminded herself of the 5 stage test in Razgar v. SSHD
           [2004] 2 ACR 368.

        e. The Judge then set out part of the  headnote  from  Azimi-Moayed
           and Others (Decisions Affecting Children; Onward Appeals); Azimi-
           Moayed v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]
           I.N.L.R. 693.  This reads:-

                "(1) The case law of the Upper Tribunal has identified the
                following principles to assist in the determination of
                appeals where children are affected by the appealed
                decisions:

                    i) As a starting point it is in the best interests of
                    children to be with both their parents and if both
                    parents are being removed from the United Kingdom then
                    the starting point suggests that so should dependent
                    children who form part of their household unless there
                    are reasons to the contrary.

                    ii) It is generally in the interests of children to have
                    both stability and continuity of social and educational
                    provision and the benefit of growing up in the cultural
                    norms of the society to which they belong.

                    iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than the state
                    of origin can lead to development of social cultural and
                    educational ties that it would be inappropriate to
                    disrupt, in the absence of compelling reason to the
                    contrary. What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear
                    cut but past and present policies have identified seven
                    years as a relevant period.

                    iv) Apart from the terms of published policies and
                    rules, the Tribunal notes that seven years from age four
                    is likely to be more significant to a child that the
                    first seven years of life. Very young children are
                    focussed on their parents rather than their peers and
                    are adaptable."

    8. In relation to the relevance of the child, the  Judge  observed  that
       she found paragraph 1(iv) of the headnote from Azimi-Moayed to be  of
       particular significance, and also said that (i) and (ii) apply to the
       facts of the appeal  before  her.   She  then  took  account  of  The
       Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
       00640 (IAC) and directed herself that the child's need for  education
       was not a compelling factor justifying LTR under  Article  8  outside
       the Rules.  That, in itself, is not challenged before us.  Her ruling
       in relation to the child and the other appellants' cases based on the
       child is as follows:-

           "46.   When considering the five questions posed by Lord Bingham
           in Razgar, whilst I accept that there will  be  an  interference
           with the appellants' rights to family and private life and  that
           Article 8 is  engaged,  I  find  that  the  interference  is  in
           accordance with the law because the appellants cannot  meet  any
           of the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to
           remain.  I further find that such interference is necessary in a
           democratic society  both  for  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
           country and for the protection of the  rights  and  freedoms  of
           others and that  the  interference  is  proportionate  to  these
           legitimate public ends on the facts of this appeal.

           "47.   Mr. Davidson set out some powerful factors  to  be  taken
           into account as to why it was  disproportionate  to  remove  the
           appellant child Nino at paragraph 22 and in 24 of  his  skeleton
           argument and in particular paragraph 23.   I  am  not  persuaded
           that "the  test  is  whether  removing  Nino  would  affect  her
           educational  interests  detrimentally  judged  absolutely,   not
           relative to other Georgians." And particularly  when  no  up-to-
           date evidence in relation to schools has been  cited  by  either
           party including the appellants and the only evidence  before  me
           relates to 2009 immediately after the civil war between  Georgia
           and Ossetia.

           "48.   For the avoidance of doubt I accept  that  the  appellant
           child Nino has lived in the UK for nearly eight years, that  she
           speaks English, that she has never lived in Georgia and  may  or
           may not have minimal familiarity  with  that  country.   I  also
           accept that she has been educated in the UK and  is  doing  well
           and that she will have social ties in the UK although no details
           were provided other than her attendance at school.  I am  unable
           to accept paragraph 23(f) that the SSHD's claim  that  Nino  has
           cultural links to Georgia is unfounded and  speculative  in  the
           light of the oral evidence that she speaks to her  relatives  in
           Georgia over the telephone."

    9. While addressing the claim based on the health needs of A1, the Judge
       had embarked upon a series of remarks about the cost of his treatment
       to date.  This give rise to the second ground of appeal and  we  must
       therefore explain how it arose.  As we have said, the Judge  rejected
       the claim for LTR outside the  Rules  because  of  A1's  present  and
       future medical needs relying on settled  law  which  she  cited.   At
       paragraph 15, while giving an account of the hearing before her,  she
       said this

           "He [A1] stated that he had  paid  privately  for  some  medical
           treatment but after a while had, as he put it, been granted  NHS
           treatment.  I expressed surprise that the SSHD conceded that  he
           did not have a debt of over �1,000 to the NHS.   The  Presenting
           Officer said she wished to withdraw that finding  to  which  Mr.
           Davison understandably objected stating that there were no  good
           reasons for the SSHD to withdraw this statement at such  a  late
           stage during the proceedings."

   10. It appears to us that this  exchange  is  the  result  of  a  natural
       enquiry  by  a  Judge  on  hearing  evidence  of  a  long  series  of
       substantial medical interventions and at the same time  a  concession
       that the cost of the treatment to the NHS had  not  exceeded  �1,000.
       That sum arose because it is  specified  in  Appendix  FM  under  the
       suitability requirements.

           "S-LTR.2.3. One or more  relevant  NHS  body  has  notified  the
           Secretary of State that the applicant has failed to pay  charges
           in accordance with the relevant NHS regulations  on  charges  to
           overseas visitors and the outstanding charges have a total value
           of at least �1000."

   11. However, although it was a  relevant  requirement  for  consideration
       under the Rules, A1's claim under  the  Rules  had  failed  on  other
       grounds.  Thus, whether he should  have  been  allowed  through  this
       filter or not was a matter of historical  interest  only.   The  fact
       that he had been dependent to a degree on the NHS while unlawfully in
       the country was no doubt a relevant consideration for the  Article  8
       assessment, although it was not likely to be a very significant  one,
       given the presence of a qualifying child for the purposes of  section
       117B(6) of the 2002 Act.  It was perhaps, therefore a natural enquiry
       which ought to have been relegated on mature reflection to its proper
       place.  Instead, the Judge  returned  to  it  after  summarising  the
       treatment which A1 had received since at least  2008  from  the  NHS.
       This  had  included  three  MIR  scans,  a   number   of   consultant
       appointments, a craniotomy and numerous GP  appointments.   She  then
       said this:-

           "41.   In the  light  of  that  evidence  I  am  at  a  loss  to
           understand why the SSHD was willing to agree to state  that  the
           appellant has incurred a debt of less than  �1,000  to  the  NHS
           which as a matter of common sense I cannot accept.  Even  though
           Mr. Davison was entitled to object to  the  late  withdrawal  of
           this statement by the Presenting Officer at the hearing I  would
           in any event not have accepted it  given  the  detailed  medical
           evidence before me.  I consider there to be no unfairness to the
           appellant in reaching a different conclusion from  that  of  the
           SSHD in the light of the medical evidence  the  appellants  have
           chosen to disclose.

           "42.   It is clear from a letter at page 133 that [A1]  returned
           to see Doctor Richard Perry in July 2012 at the neurology clinic
           for advice on a different type of headache  and  that  analgesia
           overuse had been a concern.  Further this appellant had  another
           MRI scan in September 2012.

           "43.   For the avoidance of doubt I  have  considered  the  bank
           statements from pages 168-206 which confirm that the  appellants
           have not been in receipt of any state benefits.  I remain  at  a
           loss to  understand  how  they  are  able  to  pay  utility  and
           electricity bills sometimes amounting to �184 given  the  modest
           deposits into their Halifax and Lloyds TSB bank accounts."

   12. The Judge then returned to the issue which she was actually  deciding
       at this stage in the Decision, namely whether  the  medical  evidence
       showed any "compelling or compassionate" reason why A1's  application
       for LTR outside the Rules should succeed.  In paragraph 44, on proper
       grounds, she concluded that it did not.  She had,  in  fact,  already
       decided this issue twice previously, at paragraphs 31 and 37-38.   It
       is not clear from any of these decisive paragraphs that  the  Judge's
       concerns about the funding of A1's treatment, or the  source  of  the
       family funds, played any part in the decision.

  Discussion and Decision

   13. It appears to us that Ground 1 is without substance.  The  submission
       is that in reaching the decision she did about  the  significance  of
       the child the Judge ignored the second paragraph of the  headnote  in
       Azimi-Moayed which we have set out above.  Given that she  said  that
       it applied but did not follow it, this is said to be an error of law.
         This  argument  is  misconceived.   To  say  that  a  consideration
       "applies"  in  this  context  merely  means  that   it   arises   for
       consideration.  It does not mean that it is the decisive factor.   It
       will be  recalled  that  the  Judge  said  that  paragraph  (iv)  was
       "significant" and that (i) and (ii)  also  applied.   They  point  in
       different directions  and  cannot  therefore  all  be  decisive:  (i)
       suggests that if the parents are going to  be  removed  the  starting
       point is that the children  should  leave  too;  (ii)  suggests  that
       children should have stability and should grow up in the  country  to
       which they belong; (iv) suggests that older children are more  likely
       to be settled than younger  ones  because  very  young  children  are
       focussed in their parents rather than their peers and are  adaptable.
       Mr. Plowright, who appeared for the appellants at the  appeal  before
       us did not draft this Ground of Appeal, but valiantly  did  his  best
       with it.  The relevant factors from the evidence were fully  set  out
       in the Decision and briefly summarised in paragraph 48 when rejecting
       the submission that this child should be permitted to stay.

   14. We therefore reject the Ground of Appeal which was advanced.  We are,
       however, concerned that the decision in relation to the relevance  of
       the child was not taken in quite the right way.  At  a  much  earlier
       point in the Decision, at paragraph 8,  the  Judge  had  referred  to
       section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act, which she recited.  She  noted  that
       the child A2 was a "qualifying child".  This means, by statute,  that
       if it would not be reasonable to  expect  her  to  leave  the  United
       Kingdom then it was  not  in  the  public  interest  to  require  her
       parents' removal either.  That was, therefore, the principal question
       which the Judge had to decide.  Was it reasonable to expect the child
       to leave the United Kingdom, in circumstances where her parents  were
       liable to be removed?   This  engages  the  first  paragraph  of  the
       headnote of Azimi Moyaed , and also EV  (Philippines)  and  others  v
       Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874.
       Those cases were both decided before the amendment  which  introduced
       sections 117A-D came into force on 28th July 2014.  However, there is
       no reason to suppose that the considerations  which  prevailed  there
       are irrelevant to a decision as to what it is "reasonable to expect".
        Further, the same question arises under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(i)  of
       the Rules which provides

           "276ADE (1). The requirements to be  met  by  an  applicant  for
           leave to remain on the grounds of private life  in  the  UK  are
           that at the date of application, the applicant:

           ...

           (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously  in
           the  UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
           imprisonment) and it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
           applicant to leave the UK;"

   15. The factual situation in which the reasonableness of the  removal  of
       A2 is to be judged is one where both parents are leaving the UK  with
       her, since that is the only circumstance in which she might leave.

   16. Although not specifically raised  as  a  ground  of  appeal,  in  our
       judgment it is an error of law to decide a case of this kind  without
       specific regard to the test in section 117B(6) and 276ADE(1)(iv).  It
       is true that the Judge did mention the former provision, but did  not
       thereafter refer to it or explain how it applied.  In particular, she
       neither posed nor in  terms  answered  the  question  which  required
       answering in order for her properly to assess the role of the  public
       interest in the case.  On the face of it, if it was not reasonable to
       expect the child to leave the UK even with her parents then they were
       entitled to remain, as was she.  For this reason, we would set  aside
       the decision.

   17. The second Ground of Appeal gives rise to a  different  concern.   It
       appears to us that the Judge, with respect to her,  became  embroiled
       in a factual issue which  was  of  little  importance.   As  we  have
       remarked above, whether or not there was a debt to the NHS in  excess
       of �1,000 was important to a claim  under  the  Rules.   It  was  not
       entirely irrelevant to a claim outside the Rules, but was  only  ever
       relevant at all to the claims to LTR of A1.  The puzzlement expressed
       by the Judge about the family's source of income at paragraph 43  was
       also relevant to the claim of the parents.  Those  claims  failed  on
       other grounds and it would have been far better  not  to  take  these
       concerns into account at all, and certainly  not  to  give  them  the
       prominence which they achieved by their  location  in  the  Decision.
       Although, as we have said, they are not referred to in the paragraphs
       which follow where the decision is actually given, it is obvious that
       the Judge considered that they had some part to play in  the  outcome
       of the case.  Given that the SSHD had accepted that  the  suitability
       criteria under the Rules had been met by the appellants,  they  would
       not have come to the hearing prepared to address an  attack  on  that
       issue and we cannot exclude the possibility that,  contrary  to  what
       the Judge said, there may have been some procedural unfairness in the
       way in which these issues were dealt with.   The  principal  concern,
       however, is that the Judge's findings on these questions were  either
       entirely irrelevant, or  at  least  of  little  significance  in  any
       objective assessment of the case overall.  The Judge did not  explain
       what weight she gave them or what their relevance was.  Therefore, we
       consider that the reasons she gives give rise to a  real  possibility
       that an irrelevant consideration was allowed to  play  a  significant
       part in the outcome, or that a factor of limited weight  was  allowed
       to  assume  far  too  much  importance.   Having   introduced   these
       considerations by a route which risked procedural unfairness, in  our
       judgment it was necessary to reason  the  part  they  played  in  the
       outcome with particular care.  Given that we do not  know  what  part
       this consideration played in the outcome, it  is  impossible  to  say
       that this Ground does not disclose a material error.  For this reason
       also, we set aside the decision.

  The decision re-made

   18. The findings of fact of the FTT Judge are not challenged, except  for
       those about the NHS debt and, perhaps, the family income as described
       at paragraph 43 of the Decision.  We give no weight at all  to  those
       matters and leave them entirely out of account.   Without  them,  the
       claim of A1 to LTR on medical grounds fails for the reasons given  by
       the Judge.

   19. Therefore, as we have explained the issue  for  us,  under  paragraph
       276ADE(i)(iv) and section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act is  whether  it  is
       reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom  with  her
       parents.

   20. We conclude that it is.  She was  born  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
       speaks English.  She is doing well at school and has only  a  distant
       relationship with her extended family  in  Georgia.   These  are  the
       factors which count in favour of it being unreasonable to expect  her
       to leave.  The education she will receive in  Georgia  will  be  less
       good than that which is available here, and she may  be  expected  to
       take some time to settle, given that he command of  the  language  in
       which she will educated will be far less good than  her  peer  group.
       However, she is not a complete stranger to the language and the Judge
       noted that she received oral evidence that the family do  speak  some
       Georgian at home.  Both parents have family members  in  Georgia  and
       there is, therefore, a wider family there  who  may  be  expected  to
       provide support to her.

   21. There is no principle of law which  holds  that  young  children  are
       adaptable, but it is the common experience of parents everywhere that
       this is so.  Children commonly move schools when young and  sometimes
       sever social ties when they do so.  The process of growing  up  is  a
       process of moving  slowly  away  from  being  entirely  dependent  on
       parents and other close family into a world where an independent life
       is formed.  The earlier in that process an upheaval occurs  the  more
       readily it will be accommodated in the life of the  child.   This  is
       especially so where the child will have the  support  of  two  loving
       parents who will themselves have no language difficulties as a result
       of returning home to the land where they grew up and have lived  most
       of their lives.   Any  change  in  the  life  of  a  child  may  have
       unforeseen effects and may go well or badly.   Things  can  turn  out
       better than expected, as well as worse.  A judgment  as  to  what  is
       reasonable in all the circumstances does  not  involve  assuming  the
       worst possible outcome if the status quo is changed.

   22. We find that the best interests of the  child  require  that  she  is
       brought up by her parents.  We are willing to assume it would  be  in
       her best interests if that occurred in the UK, but  that  is  a  less
       important factor compared to the maintenance of the family unit.   In
       any event, her interests are  a  primary  factor  in  the  Article  8
       decision and not the primary or paramount factor,  see  the  citation
       from Baroness Hale above.

   23. Applying EV (Philippines) and others v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874 and having regard to  section  55
       of the Borders, Citizenship, and Immigration  Act  2009  we  conclude
       that it is reasonable to expect A2 to leave the  United  Kingdom  and
       that  therefore  she  should  not  be  granted  LTR  under  paragraph
       276ADE(1)(iv) of the Rules.  This also means that the public interest
       in the removal of her parents as  part  of  an  effective  system  of
       immigration control is not negated by section  117B(6)  of  the  2002
       Act.  In our judgment,  balancing  the  adverse  consequences  to  A2
       resulting from her removal against that public interest  we  consider
       that her removal is not disproportionate, applying the Razgar 5 stage
       test.

   24. For these reasons we dismiss these appeals against  the  decision  of
       the SSHD.
