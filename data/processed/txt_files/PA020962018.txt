|                                     |On 18th December 2018                |

                                  Between:

                                    [B A]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                            Decision and Reasons

 1. The Tribunal issued a decision on 7 August  2018  requesting  that  the
    parties provide written reasons within 21 days as to why  an  error  of
    law should not be found and  the  appeal  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. No response on the proposal to remit was  received  from  either  party
    within 21 days.

 3. The Tribunal therefore finds an error of law, sets aside  the  decision
    dated 2 May 2018 of First-Tier Tribunal Judge S T Fox  and  remits  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal at North Shields  to  be  re-made  de
    novo.
