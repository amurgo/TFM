Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Joshi, instructed by A Bajwa & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Moan  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of  the  respondent  made  on  19  August  2016  refusing  his
    application for permanent residence.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 6 June 1974.  He  entered
    the UK in 2007 on a  student  visa.   He  married  a  French  national,
    Vanessa de Faria on 7 June 2010.  He was issued with a  residence  card
    between March 2011 and  March  2016.   The  appellant  and  his  spouse
    divorced on 19 February 2014.

3.   On 9 February 2016 the appellant applied for permanent residence.   The
    respondent refused this application on 19  August  2016.   It  was  his
    appeal against this decision that was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Moan.

4.   The grounds upon which permission to appeal was granted  asserted  that
    the judge made a mistake regarding the material fact as to  whether  or
    not the appellant's former spouse was a qualified person at the date of
    the dissolution of their marriage  on  19  February  2014.   The  judge
    concluded that she  was  not  satisfied  that  the  former  spouse  was
    exercising treaty rights at the  date  of  the  divorce  [18]  but  the
    grounds argued that this was inconsistent with the finding at [8]  that
    she had paid tax up to the end of the tax year 2014.  It was also noted
    that the evidence from HMRC in the appellant's bundle gave an end  date
    with the former spouse's employment as 28 February 2014.

5.   Ms Joshi argued that the judge overlooked the evidence from HMRC  dated
    21 September  2016  giving  the  appellant's  employment,  pension  and
    benefits history.  This evidence showed that the appellant  worked  for
    MGNT Limited.  It gave her reference number,  the  start  date  of  her
    employment as 1 May 2013 and the end date as 28  February  2014.   HMRC
    indicated that she was paid ï¿½5,416 for that period of  employment.   Ms
    Joshi argued that the end date of the wife's employment  postdated  the
    divorce.

6.   Ms Joshi referred to the judge's finding at paragraph  12.   The  judge
    said as follows:-

         "The Appellant must provide evidence that his wife was  working  in
         2014.  The guidance  makes  it  clear  that  the  Appellant  should
         provide three months' of wage slips.  He did not  provide  payslips
         for the 3 months prior to his divorce in 2014.  He is not  able  to
         show that she was a qualified person at the time of his divorce."

7.   Ms Joshi submitted that it was not clear what guidance  the  judge  was
    referring to.  She did not accept that there was a requirement for  the
    appellant to provide  three  months'  wage  slips  for  his  wife.  She
    submitted that the appellant provided his former  wife's P60s  and  the
    HMRC work history which clearly indicated  that  she  was  a  qualified
    person at the date of the respondent's decision.

8.   Mr Wilding submitted that the HMRC confirmation of employment does  not
    show on a balance  of  probabilities  that  the  appellant's  wife  was
    working at the date of the divorce.  All it shows is that  she  was  in
    employment but it does not show she was actually working at the date of
    the divorce.  The bank  statements  which  the  judge  also  took  into
    account did not show that she was working on 28 February 2014 when  she
    ceased working with MGNT Limited.

9.   Mr Wilding explained that the guidance the judge was referring  to  was
    guidance issued by the respondent to case  workers  advising  the  what
    evidence was  required  when  an  applicant  made  an  application  for
    permanent residence.

10.  Mr Wilding argued that this was a perversity challenge.  The  appellant
    had to show that  no  judge  would  find  that  his  wife  was  not  in
    employment at the date of the divorce.  He submitted  that  the  modest
    amounts she earned added strength to the case that she was not  working
    at the date of the divorce.

11.  I was not persuaded by Mr Wilding's arguments. The  appellant's  former
    wife's earnings were not in issue. The issue in this case  was  whether
    she was a qualified person at the date  of  the  dissolution  of  their
    marriage on 19 February 2014. There was overwhelming from the HMRC that
    the appellant's former wife ceased employment on 28  February  2014,  a
    date  which  post-dated  the  divorce.   The  judge  erred  in  law  in
    overlooking this evidence.

12.  I find that the judge erred in relying on a guidance which he  did  not
    identify and which according to Mr Wilding, was advice to  Home  Office
    caseworkers and therefore not pertinent to the judge's decision.

13.  In the light of these errors I find that the  judge's  decision  cannot
    stand.  I set it aside and remake the decision.

14.  On the evidence provided by HMRC I find that the appellant's  wife  was
    in employment at the date of their divorce which was 19 February  2014.
    She was therefore a qualified person at the date of the dissolution  of
    their marriage on 19 February 2014.

Notice of Decision

15.   I allow the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
