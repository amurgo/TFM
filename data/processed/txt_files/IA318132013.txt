                       mr Abdul Lateef Toluwani Bello
                        (no anonymity direction made)

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan
For the Respondent:    Mr J Ren� of counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference purposes the parties are referred to as they were
    before the First-tier Tribunal so that Mr Bello is  the  appellant  and
    the Secretary of State for the Home Department is the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 25 May 1989.   On
    8 July 2013 a decision was made to refuse him leave to  remain  on  the
    basis that such removal would not place the United Kingdom in breach of
    its obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998.  Directions were  also
    given under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  for  his
    removal from the United Kingdom.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision and at a hearing before First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wiseman the appeal was allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal on the basis that the  judge
    had not considered the guidance in the case of Gulshan (Article 8 - new
    Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) namely that  "if  there
    are good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  Immigration
    Rules it is necessary for Article 8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules".  It was submitted in the grounds that the  judge  had
    not considered the correct approach in departing  from  the  Rules  and
    permission to appeal was granted on that basis.

 5. Mr Tufan, representing the respondent, submitted  before  me  that  the
    judge did not consider Gulshan and other recent cases on Article  8  to
    show  that  there  would   need   to   be   exceptional   compassionate
    circumstances if the appellant was to succeed  under  Article  8.   The
    judge simply went straight to the proportionality assessment.  This was
    a  "near  miss"  case  and  there  are   no   particularly   compelling
    circumstances.

 6. Mr Ren� submitted that the respondent did  not  challenge  the  judge's
    findings, but only the approach to Article 8 in general.  Mr Ren�  then
    referred me to Huang v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2007] UKHL 11 which sets out what  the  appellant  and  the  Appellate
    Authorities have to do when considering Article 8. He submitted further
    that even the latest cases do not alter the  approach  that  should  be
    taken.  The refusal letter does not deal with private and family  life.
    The First-tier Tribunal Judge took into account in paragraphs 56 to  65
    of the determination all the matters that were  required  of  him  even
    though he did not mention expressly the case  of  Gulshan.   Mr  Ren�'s
    submission was that there had been  no  material  errors  made  in  the
    determination.

My Conclusions

 7. This is a very carefully constructed  and  worded  determination.   The
    judge has  given  correct  self-directions  in  paragraphs  50  and  55
    referring to his consideration of the facts in the context of  Appendix
    FM and then on a stand alone or "exceptional circumstances"  basis,  if
    necessary.  As Mr Ren� points out credibility  was  not  in  issue  and
    there is no challenge to the findings of the judge  in  general  terms.
    The judge took into account that the  appellant  comes  very  close  to
    being "aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at least
    half  of  his  life  residing  continuously  in  the  United   Kingdom"
    calculating that the appellant falls short of that requirement probably
    by less than a year.  Although  that  is  suggestive  of  a  near  miss
    argument the judge referred  to  "near  miss"  arguments  and  directed
    himself appropriately in paragraph 62 of  the  determination.   Careful
    reading of the determination  shows  that  as  the  judge  put  it  the
    appellant has become "embedded" in the household of his sister and  her
    child.  He has lived with that family group for eleven and a half years
    and the relationships are  clearly  far  more  important  than  "normal
    emotional ties with an adult".  Not only do they significantly  involve
    a child who has lived with the appellant all her life  but  the  sister
    has been a financial supporter of the appellant for the  whole  of  his
    time here.  It would be significant enough if it was only  in  relation
    to the normal costs of living but in fact it  has  involved  university
    and other fees. By reason of the difference in their  ages  his  sister
    has clearly acted effectively as a mother figure for him,  particularly
    when he was younger.

 8. It is also apparent from  reading  the  determination  that  the  judge
    concluded that this was one of those exceptional cases that led him  to
    allow the appeal under Article 8.  He has fully justified his  decision
    and although the respondent disagrees  with  that  conclusion  and  the
    reasoning for coming to it this I find is little  more  than  argument.
    The determination discloses no error of law, let alone a material one.

Decision

 9. For the above reasons the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

10. There has been no anonymity direction thus far, none was sought, and in
    the circumstances of this case I see no need for one to be made now.
