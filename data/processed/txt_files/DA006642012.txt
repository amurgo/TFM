For the Appellant:     Mr A Hussain, instructed by Burton & Burton
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Raja Adnan Sangar, was born on 3 July 1987 and is a male
    citizen of Pakistan.   A decision to make a deportation order was  made
    in respect of the appellant under Section 32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act
    2007. The appellant was sentenced on 13 December 2011 to twelve months'
    imprisonment for having perverted the course of justice.   He  appealed
    against  the  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  P  J   M
    Hollingworth; Mr G F Sandall) which, in a determination  promulgated on
    23 January 2014, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission, Judge Andrew noted that:

         The grounds  complain  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made
         reference to an NOMS report in his determination but that  no  such
         NOMS report was before him. This appears from the file  to  be  the
         case.

 3. At the hearing, I was able to produce from the Tribunal file a copy  of
    a letter dated 29 October 2012 which had been sent by the  Home  Office
    to the Tribunal and also to  the  appellant's  solicitors.  The  letter
    enclosed a copy of the NOMS report.  The letter had  been  received  by
    the Tribunal office on 30 October 2012 (as evidenced by  the  stamp  on
    the face of the letter).  As a consequence, where the Tribunal [at 112]
    wrote that it accepted "the assessment made in  that  report  including
    the risk assessment" (referring to the NOMS report)  the  Tribunal  had
    before it a copy  of  the  report  even  though,  as  both  I  and  the
    respondent accept, Mr Hussain (who also appeared before the  First-tier
    Tribunal) had not been provided with a copy; at [53] the  Tribunal  had
    noted Mr Hussain's submission that he did  not  have  the  NOMS  report
    although it does not appear to have occurred to the Tribunal to provide
    Mr Hussain with a copy from its own papers.

 4. Whilst acknowledging that Mr Hussain was put at  some  disadvantage  by
    not having sight of the report, I do not find that anything turns  upon
    this issue. The report contains an assessment of the  appellant's  risk
    of reoffending as low and, as I have noted above, the Tribunal accepted
    that assessment.  Although it is  no  doubt  very  frustrating  for  Mr
    Hussain that a copy of the report was not in his instructions from  his
    instructing solicitors, it is difficult to see what  Mr  Hussain  might
    have submitted regarding the report which would have taken  the  matter
    any further than that.   Before  me,  Mr  Hussain  submitted  that  the
    Tribunal had not given sufficient weight to the report, but  I  do  not
    find that that submission is made out  given  that  they  accepted  its
    conclusions without demur. Mr Hussain's further submission that, having
    accepted the conclusions of the report, the  appeal  should  have  been
    allowed, amounts to a non sequitur. There was nothing  to  prevent  the
    First-tier Tribunal accepting that the appellant was  at  low  risk  of
    reoffending whilst, at the same time  and  having  considered  all  the
    relevant evidence, proceeding to dismiss the appeal.   Had  the  report
    been before the Tribunal and the Tribunal had failed  to  consider  it,
    then an error of law may have occurred.  In the circumstances, the fact
    that the report had not been seen by the  appellant's  counsel,  whilst
    unfortunate, is immaterial.

 5. The second ground of  appeal  concerns  the  Tribunal's  assessment  of
    family and private life for the purpose of Article 8 ECHR.   At  [111],
    the Tribunal wrote this:

         We do not find that the first criterion in Razgar is  satisfied  in
         relation to family life. We have rejected the  credibility  of  the
         appellant and Mrs  Humera  Ikram.   We  set  out  our  findings  in
         relation to the evidence above.  We  do  not  accept  that  genuine
         family life is led between the appellant and Mrs Humera Ikram.  The
         typed skeleton argument attached  to  the  papers  at  paragraph  3
         refers to Article 8 'family life'  to  which  this  appeal  is  now
         directly related. We treat the contact between  the  appellant  and
         Mrs Humera Ikram and her children as  aspects  of  the  appellant's
         private life. On this basis we find that the first four criteria in
         Razgar are established.  The question arises as to proportionality.

 6. At [22] et seq, the Tribunal set out in some detail its findings as  to
    credibility of the evidence given by the appellant and Mrs  Ikram.  Mrs
    Ikram has a number of children (not the appellant's  natural  children)
    and the appellant claimed that he lived with her and the children.  The
    Tribunal found the appellant's evidence to "disingenuous" and in  parts
    entirely untrue.  The Tribunal found  that  "doubt  arises  as  to  the
    strength of [the appellant's and Mrs Ikram's) mutual commitment in  the
    light of [the delay of five months before the  appellant  resided  with
    Mrs Ikram at her  home  following  his  release  from  prison]."    For
    example, the Tribunal found that the appellant's claim to pick  up  Mrs
    Ikram's children from school was flatly contradicted by  evidence  from
    the head teacher of the school which indicated that the  appellant  had
    never been to the school and that the teacher had had no  contact  with
    the appellant. Consequently, the  Tribunal  rejected  that  the  expert
    report of Mr Nusendo on the basis that it was predicated on  an  untrue
    account provided to him by the appellant.  The Tribunal also found [95]
    that  Mrs  Ikram  had  given  inconsistent   evidence   regarding   her
    relationship with the appellant.

 7. Having considered the findings of fact of the Tribunal and the  reasons
    given for those findings, I can identify no error of law.  The Tribunal
    has considered carefully the evidence given by each  of  the  witnesses
    and has given entirely sound reasons for rejecting the  credibility  of
    that evidence.  However, at [111] which I have set out in  full  above,
    acknowledge that the Tribunal has fallen into some  confusion.  On  the
    one hand, having rejected  the  credibility  of  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant and Mrs Ikram as to the nature  of  their  relationship,  the
    Tribunal has concluded that  there  was  no  family  life  between  the
    appellant and Mrs Ikram with her children. On the other hand, it uppers
    to  have  accepted  that  Mrs  Ikram  and  the  appellant   have   some
    relationship  and  the   Tribunal   has   therefore   considered   that
    relationship as an aspect of  the  private  lives  of  the  individuals
    involved.  The Tribunal proceeded to consider Section 55  of  the  2009
    Act as regards  the  best  interests  of  the  children  and  also  the
    reasonableness of Mrs Ikram (as a British citizen) relocating with  the
    appellant to  Pakistan.   Those  are  aspects  of  the  analysis  would
    normally flow from the existence of family  life  rather  than  private
    life;  although  it  clearly  wished  to  record  its   view   of   the
    unreliability of the evidence it heard from the witnesses, the Tribunal
    has, in effect, completed an analysis of family life for  the  purposes
    of Article 8 ECHR after all.

 8. In the circumstances, it may have been more logical for the Tribunal to
    have accepted that family life between Mrs Ikaram and the appellant did
    exist but that differed in  many  respects  from  the  family  life  as
    described by the appellant and Mrs Ikaram. Such a  finding  would  have
    led the Tribunal to consider  Section  55  and  the  reasonableness  of
    family life being pursued abroad without creating the apparent  anomaly
    of rejecting the existence of family life altogether whilst also having
    regard to those aspects of the case.

 9. If the approach adopted by the Tribunal does amount to an error of law,
    the question remains whether it was in any way material to the  outcome
    of the appeal.  I consider that it is  not.  Whether  any  relationship
    such as exists between Miss Ikram, the children and  the  appellant  is
    characterised as family life or private life, the impact of the removal
    of the appellant upon Mrs Ikram and the lives  of  the  children  would
    need to be assessed.  The Tribunal has completed that assessment and  I
    do not accept Mr Hussain's submission that the assessment is flawed  or
    thast it would have led to a different outcome had the  Tribunal  found
    that family life existed.  The Tribunal was entitled to find  at  [115]
    that "the conduct of the appellant outweighs the  positive  factors  in
    favour of  his remaining and [we] do not find there will be a breach of
    the appellant's Article 8  right  to  a  private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  We do not find that there will be a breach of the  Article  8
    rights to a private life with Mrs Humera Ikaram or her children for the
    same  reasons".   Even  if  the  Tribunal  had  characterised  what  it
    describes as private life as family life, it is clear that that outcome
    would  have  been  the  same.   Further,  at  [116]  the  Tribunal  has
    accurately set out the jurisprudence relating to the Immigration  Rules
    (see MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192)).  Although it does  not  refer
    to the case, it is also apparent that the Tribunal's  decision  was  in
    line with the decision of the Tribunal in  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new
    Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC):

         On the current state of the authorities:


         (a)     the  maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2   stand,
             although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said
             that they could constitute an unjustified and disproportionate
             interference with the ability of spouses to live together;  he
             suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,
             and highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage
             earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;
         (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if  there
             may be arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
             outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on
             to consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the application  of)
             Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC
             720 (Admin);
         (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in  provisions  such  as
             Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  393
             (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  45  (IAC);
             they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the
             absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is  necessary  to
             show other non-standard and particular features  demonstrating
             that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


         The Secretary of State addressed the Article 8  family  aspects  of
         the respondent's position through the Rules, in particular EX1, and
         the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge should
         have done likewise, also paying attention to the Guidance. Thus the
         judge should have considered the Secretary  of  State's  conclusion
         under EX.1 that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
         the continuation of the family life outside the UK. Only  if  there
         were arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the
         rules was it necessary for him for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to
         consider  whether   there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

10. The facts in this appeal as found by the Tribunal did not  require  it,
    having concluded  that  the  appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, to consider a grant of leave outside the Rules under
    Article 8 ECHR.   I  find  that,  notwithstanding  any  errors  in  the
    approach or analysis of the Tribunal such as I have described above, it
    is not necessary to set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Consequently, this appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

11. This appeal is dismissed.
