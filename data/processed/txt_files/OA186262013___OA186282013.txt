For the Appellant:     Mr D Williams, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   These are linked appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Wright promulgated on 16 October 2014 dismissing the  Appellants'
    appeals against the Respondent's decisions  dated  26  August  2013  to
    refuse entry clearance as the wife and son  respectively  of  Mr  Robin
    Rai, a British citizen, (hereafter 'the sponsor').

Background

2.   The Appellants are nationals of Nepal born on 28 November  1972  and  3
    December 1995 respectively.  The current appeals arise from their joint
    applications made on 5 July 2013 to join  the  sponsor  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Their applications  were  refused  for  reasons  set  out  in
    respective Notices  of  Immigration  Decision  dated  26  August  2013.
    Essentially, in respect of the First Appellant, the Respondent was  not
    satisfied with regard to the relationship requirements of  Appendix  FM
    (paragraphs E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10},  and  further  the  Respondent  raised
    concerns in respect of the financial requirements pursuant to paragraph
    E-ECP.3.1.  The Second Appellant was refused  because  his  mother  had
    been refused - rule E-ECC.1.6.  The  same  issues  in  respect  of  the
    financial requirements were also raised in the  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision in respect of the Second Appellant.

3.   However,  in  respect  of  the  financial  requirements  the  following
    passage appear in the Notices of Immigration Decision.  (I  quote  from
    the decision in respect of the First Appellant, but a  similar  passage
    also appeared in the decision in  respect  of  the  Second  Appellant.)
    Having set out the issues identified by the  decision-maker  under  the
    Rules the following was said:

         "In light of the above, your application also falls to  be  refused
         under the Immigration Rules because you  do  not  meet  the  income
         threshold  requirement  under  Appendix  FM  and/or   the   related
         evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE.   However,  no  final
         determination has been made at this stage as to  whether  you  meet
         the income threshold and/or related evidential requirements.   This
         is because the Courts have not  yet  decided  the  outcome  of  the
         Secretary of State's appeal in a  legal  challenge  to  the  income
         threshold requirement.  More information about this is set  out  in
         the Home Office  website.   If  you  appeal  against  this  refusal
         decision, a final determination as to whether you meet  the  income
         threshold and/or related evidential requirements  under  the  Rules
         may be made at a later stage.  In  making  any  such  determination
         account would be taken of  any  further  information  or  documents
         regarding  the   income   threshold   and/or   related   evidential
         requirements which you enclosed with your appeal."

4.   The Appellants appealed to  the  IAC  against  the  refusals  of  entry
    clearance, lodging appeals on 30 September 2013.  It  is  not  apparent
    that  there  was  any  further  review  in  respect  of  the  financial
    requirements and it is not apparent that the matter  to  which  I  have
    alluded was identified as being possibly relevant before the First-tier
    Tribunal.

5.   The appeals were dismissed for the reasons set out in the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Wright.  Although  the  Judge  found  in  the
    Aappellants' favour in respect  of  the  relationship  requirements  as
    between the  sponsor  and  the  First  Appellant,  the  Judge  was  not
    satisfied in respect of the financial requirements of the Rules.

6.   The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted on 16 December  2014  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cheales.

Consideration

7.   The focus of consideration in respect  of  the  financial  requirements
    before the First-tier Tribunal was with reference to paragraphs 13  and
    15 of Appendix FM-SE.  The Judge rejected  the  Appellants'  case  with
    reference to paragraph 13(a) of Appendix FM-SE at paragraph 29  of  his
    decision.  There is no challenge to the  findings  in  that  paragraph.
    Accordingly the issue that has been pursued by the  Appellants  to  the
    Upper Tribunal is in respect of paragraph 13(b) of Appendix FM-SE.  The
    Judge addresses this at paragraph 30 of the decision in  the  following
    terms:

         "Applying  (alternatively)  paragraph  13(b)  of   Appendix   FM-SE
         ('Calculating Gross  Annual  Income  under  Appendix  FM')  to  the
         payslips submitted with the application, whilst 'The  gross  annual
         salary from employment as  it  was  at  the  date  of  application'
         (paragraph 13(b)(i)) would appear  to  be  �35,877  (taking  weekly
         salary  figure  of  �689.96  from  last  payslip  submitted   dated
         21/6/2013  and  multiplying  by  52)  when  additionally   applying
         paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE (as required) it cannot be said that
         the sponsor also meets the level of gross annual income required by
         Appendix FM (�22,400) 'on the basis that their income is the  total
         of (i) the gross income from  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  or
         overseas earned by the person [sponsor] in the 12 months  prior  to
         the date of application; (ii) N/A; (iii) N/A' (paragraph  15(b)(i)-
         (iii)) (the sponsor's income for this  period  being  only  �18,479
         when taking the P60 figure of �12,159 [covering TAG employment from
         October  2012  -  April  2013]  and  adding  �6,320  [covering  TAG
         employment  from  April  2013  to  last  payslip  dated   21/6/2013
         submitted with application dated 5/7/2013]; NB no pre-October  2012
         income figures)."

8.   The challenge that has been raised in the grounds  in  support  of  the
    application for  permission  to  appeal  in  respect  of  this  passage
    essentially comes down to a submission that the Judge was in  error  in
    having regard to the sponsor's income in a twelve month  period  up  to
    the date of application.  It is argued that the sponsor only needed  to
    demonstrate his earnings for a six month period prior to  the  date  of
    application.

9.   In considering this basis of challenge the starting point must  be  the
    Rules.  They are, so far as  they  are  applicable,  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix and
         can  be  taken  into  account  with  reference  to  the  applicable
         provisions of Appendix FM gross annual income under  paragraphs  E-
         ECP3.1, E-LTRP3.1, E-ECC2.1 and E-LTRC2.1 will be calculated in the
         following ways:

         (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at  the
             date of application and has been  employed  by  their  current
             employer for less than six months (or at least six months  but
             the person does not  rely  on  paragraph  13(a))  their  gross
             annual income will be the total of:

             (i)  the gross annual salary from employment as it was at  the
                  date of application;

             (ii) [As identified by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  this  is
                  not applicable and Mr Williams  confirms  no  reliance  is
                  placed upon it];

             (ii) the same considerations apply as in respect of (ii).

    In addition the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met."

10.  Paragraph 15 is in the following terms:

         "15.  In  respect  of  paragraph  13(b)  and  paragraph  13(d)  the
             provisions in this paragraph also apply:

             (a)  In order to evidence the level  of  gross  annual  income
                  required  by  Appendix  FM  the  person  must   meet   the
                  requirements in paragraph 13(b) or 13(d)(i) and

             (b)  the person must also  meet  the  level  of  gross  annual
                  income required by Appendix FM on  the  basis  that  their
                  income is the total of:

                  (i)  the gross income from salaried employment in  the  UK
                      or overseas earned by the person in the twelve months
                      prior to the date of application."

                  (ii) and (iii) are not applicable,  nor  is  (iv)  to  the
                      current case.

11.  During submissions it became apparent that Mr Williams' real  complaint
    was in respect of the Rules themselves and not  specifically  how  they
    had been applied to the Appellants.  In particular he argued that there
    was an inconsistency in specifying a period of six months in  paragraph
    13 but referring to twelve months in paragraph 15.

12.  Whilst I accept that the Rules  are  complex,  I  do  not  accept  that
    paragraphs 13 and 15 are inconsistent, rather in my judgment  they  are
    complementary.  It seems to me essentially that an applicant  is  being
    asked to comply with two complementary requirements.   Under  paragraph
    15 it is a requirement to demonstrate an actual income  in  the  twelve
    months  preceding  the  date  of  application  that  meets  the  income
    threshold.  Under paragraph  13  there  is  a  further  requirement  to
    demonstrate by the production of specified evidence the income received
    in the preceding six months.  There is no inconsistency  in  those  two
    requirements.

13.  Given that Mr Williams  accepts  that  it  cannot  be  shown  that  the
    sponsor's income in the twelve months up to the date of application met
    the required income threshold of �22,400, the  Appellants  cannot  meet
    the requirements of the Rules by reference to the circumstances at  the
    date of the Respondent's decision; in my judgment to  that  extent  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did not err.

14.  However, as identified above, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was  not
    alert or at least made no reference to, the passages in the Notices  of
    Immigration Decision indicating no decision had been taken  in  respect
    of the financial requirements and  that,  if  appropriate,  a  decision
    would be taken by reference to matters that necessarily post-dated  the
    Appellants' applications and the Respondent's decisions.  It  does  not
    follow that the Tribunal could undertake such an assessment confined as
    it is by section 85A to circumstances appertaining at the date  of  the
    Respondent's decision.  However in my judgment it was an error  of  law
    to fail to recognise that  a  decision  in  respect  of  the  financial
    requirements had not  been  made  and  that  there  had  been  a  clear
    representation giving rise to a legitimate expectation that a  decision
    would be  made  at  a  later  date  in  the  event  of  an  appeal,  if
    appropriate.

15.  It may be  that  on  the  facts  of  this  particular  case  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager on  review  did  not  undertake  such  re-calculation
    because the issue in respect of the genuineness of the relationship was
    still a 'live' issue and accordingly it was not necessary to embark  on
    a calculation  of  the  financial  requirements  at  a  time  when  the
    circumstances  informing  the  approach  taken  in   the   Notices   of
    Immigration Decision still applied.  Be that as it may, the findings of
    the First-tier Tribunal are such that the relationship  issue  has  now
    been settled in the Appellants' favour.  In my judgment this means that
    the offer of the  Respondent  to  undertake  a  re-calculation  of  the
    financial requirements by reference to  materials  that  would  not  be
    restricted  to  the  date  of  the  Appellants'   application   remains
    outstanding and requires to be honoured.  Applying those considerations
    to the context of the challenge before me, and mindful of the extent of
    the jurisdiction that the Tribunal may exercise, I reach the  following
    conclusions.

16.  In my judgment the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was in error  of
    law because of a failure to recognise that  there  was  effectively  an
    outstanding decision to be made by the Respondent  in  respect  of  the
    financial requirements.  I consider that that is sufficient to  warrant
    setting aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  dismissing
    the Appellants' appeals.  That  means  the  decisions  in  the  appeals
    require to be re-made and in re-making them I find that the application
    of the Appellants remain outstanding before the Respondent  because  no
    relevant  decision  has  been  taken  in  respect  of   the   financial
    requirements.

17.  Whether this ultimately will avail the Appellants  is  not  for  me  to
    say, but in my judgment the matter must go back to the Respondent to re-
    determine the applications with reference to the financial requirements
    on the premise that the relationship between the  First  Appellant  and
    the sponsor is a genuine relationship.

Notice of Decisions

18.  The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal contained material  errors  of
    law and are set aside.

19.  I re-make the decisions in the appeals. The appeals are allowed to  the
    extent that the Respondent's decisions were not in accordance with  the
    law; the applications remain outstanding and require to be  decided  by
    the Respondent in accordance with the law.

    The above represents a corrected transcript of an  ex-tempore  decision
    given at the hearing on 29 January 2015.
