Representation:
For the appellant:     MS A Vatish, instructed by Ashmans Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Muhammad Javed  Sultan,  date  of  birth  2.1.81,  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Reid promulgated 3.7.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision  of
    the Secretary of State, dated 14.10.14, to cancel his Tier 1 for  false
    representation in relation to an English  language  test,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 321A of the Immigration Rules and to refuse leave  to  enter.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 25.6.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    23.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.1.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. At the outset of the hearing Ms Vatish applied for an  adjournment,  on
    the basis that there were pending hearings relating to  ETS  cases  and
    that this case should be adjourned behind those cases.  I  refused  the
    application on the basis that the duty of the Tribunal is to apply  the
    law as it presently stands. If the case law in relation  to  ETS  fraud
    cases changes, that is a matter than can be raised at a later date.

Error of Law

 6. For the reasons set out herein, I found no material error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Reid to be set aside.

 7. The case for the Secretary of State is simply that it has now  come  to
    light that the appellant did not in fact  sit  the  ETS  language  test
    taken at Gant's Hill on 9.1.13 and submitted in support of his previous
    Tier 1 Highly Skilled Entrepreneur application, on the basis  of  which
    on 13.5.14 he was granted leave to remain in that  capacity,  valid  to
    13.5.17. It is significant that the  appellant  was  interviewed  about
    this matter on two occasions and was unable to recall the name  of  the
    test centre. The record of the test was examined  by  ETS  using  voice
    verification software to verify  that  a  single  person  sat  multiple
    tests. ETS found significant evidence that this appellant did  not  sit
    the test himself and concluded that the  English  language  certificate
    was fraudulently obtained, as a  result  of  which  ETS  cancelled  the
    scores and invalidated the certificate. Relying  on  that  information,
    the Secretary of State concluded that  the  appellant  had  made  false
    representations  and  used  fraudulently  obtained  information  in  an
    application for leave to remain,  and  thus  cancelled  his  leave  and
    refused leave to enter, the  appellant  being  on  temporary  admission
    following his detention at Heathrow Airport on 7.8.14, on return to the
    UK from Pakistan.

 8.  It  is  clear  from  the  decision  that  Judge  Reid  considered  the
    appellant's  account  and  explanation,  found  that   account   vague,
    inconsistent, and not credible. Taking that evidence into account  with
    the evidence produced on behalf of ETS and the Secretary of  State,  at
    �20 the judge reached the conclusion that the appellant  did  not  take
    the test himself, stating, "I find this based on all the evidence  (see
    paras 15-18 above) and not just the generic evidence  provided  by  the
    respondent as regards ETS testing generally."  The  judge  went  on  to
    consider that the appellant's private life in  the  UK  was  relatively
    limited and developed during a period when  he  had  limited  leave  to
    remain, concluding at �22 that returning him to Pakistan would  not  be
    an interference with that limited private life, and at �23  that,  even
    if it would be an interference with his private life, that interference
    was proportionate to his article 8 rights.

 9. At �24 of the decision the judge  relied  on  the  findings  summarised
    above  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  made  false  representations
    pursuant to paragraph 321A(2), as he did not take the  test  on  9.1.13
    but represented in his application that he had done so.  "Whilst it was
    said in submissions that the burden of proof as regards this allegation
    was not discharged, I conclude that it was in the light of the findings
    set out above based upon the evidence before me. The decision  was  not
    solely based on the ETS invalid score report, there was other  evidence
    relied on and the appellant had an opportunity to explain  himself  ...
    on the findings set  out  above  the  representations  made  about  9th
    January 2013 were dishonest and not just mistaken. I therefore conclude
    that the decision was made in accordance with para 321A  of  the  Rules
    and in accordance with the law."

10. Permission to  appeal  was  only  granted  because  Judge  Hollingworth
    considered there was an arguable error  of  law  "in  relation  to  the
    juxtaposition between the Judge's reference  at  paragraph  14  to  the
    standard of proof being on the balance of probabilities and the finding
    set out at paragraph 24 of the decision in which the judge states  that
    he concludes that the appellant made false representations in paragraph
    321A(2). It is arguable that the  reference  at  paragraph  13  of  the
    decision  in  relation  to  the  burden  and  standard  of   proof   is
    insufficient."

11. However, it is clear from the decision, particular  at  �9,  �13,  �14,
    �20, and �24 that the judge did not misdirect himself as to the  burden
    and standard of proof, neither in relation to the Rules nor in relation
    to article 8 ECHR. Ms Vatish  accepted  in  her  submissions  that  the
    standard of proof is the civil standard, but relied  on  Bijendra  Giri
    [2015] EWCA CIV 784, where at �38 the Court of  Appeal  made  it  clear
    that there is no heightened standard  of  proof,  but  noted  that  the
    evidence should be of sufficient strength and quality. At �36 the Court
    of Appeal noted that the House of Lords had approved the  statement  in
    the judgement of R  (N)  v  Mental  Health  Review  Tribunal  (Northern
    Region) [2005] EWCA Civ 1605 [2006] QB 468, that "although there  is  a
    single civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities,  it  is
    flexible in  its  application.  In  particular  the  more  serious  the
    allegation or the more serious the consequences if  the  allegation  is
    proved, the stronger must be the evidence before a court will find  the
    allegation proved on the balance of probabilities." The judicial review
    appeal in Giri, which concerned paragraph 322(1A) and whether deception
    was required, was dismissed.

12. In the circumstances, the case provides no material  assistance  to  Ms
    Vatish's submissions, as it is clear the judge has applied the  correct
    burden and standard of proof.

13. The judge gave full and detailed reasons  for  the  findings  made  and
    conclusions reached, based on a consideration  of  the  evidence  as  a
    whole. Having found that the appellant did not in fact take the English
    language test, the outcome of the appeal was  inevitable.  The  finding
    that the burden of proof was discharged was fully open to the judge and
    for which cogent reasons have been given. It cannot be  said  that  the
    decision was in any way perverse or irrational,  or  inconsistent  with
    the considerable weight of the evidence.

14. In relation to private life, it was arguable that the judge's treatment
    was rather perfunctory and it was not clear  what  evidence  there  was
    about the appellant's private life. In the circumstances, I invited  Ms
    Vatish to lead evidence from the appellant on private life, there being
    no reliance on family  life,  as  all  his  family  members  remain  in
    Pakistan.

15. Ms Vatish submitted that the appellant had spent time and money setting
    up his business and had arranged for funds to be transferred to the  UK
    for that business. The evidence demonstrated (A46) that  the  appellant
    had set up a limited company following the grant of his entrepreneurial
    visa. He gave oral  evidence  stating  that  he  intended  to  start  a
    business supplying frozen and fresh fish and was  going  to  take  over
    some premises for that purpose. However, his mother fell ill and  died,
    so he returned to Pakistan in 2014 for her funeral and  remained  there
    for some 2 months. He had not in fact commenced trading  or  taken  any
    substantive steps towards doing so; all he had done was to  register  a
    limited company. He had come to the UK for the first time in  2011  and
    is now 33 years of age. He said he was being financially  supported  in
    the UK by friends and maintained that he had not worked. He agreed that
    the funds had not been transferred yet.

16. It follows that the judge was correct to observe  that  there  is  very
    limited evidence of private life. It is clear that the appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE to show very  significant
    obstacles to integration into Pakistan. I am not  satisfied  there  are
    any compelling circumstances  in  this  case  to  have  justified  even
    considering article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, but the judge did so. The
    judge would also have had to take into account paragraph  117B  of  the
    2002 Act that little weight should be given to a private life developed
    in the UK whilst the appellant's  status  was  precarious,  as  it  was
    dependent on the grant of further leave. Further, the very  aspects  of
    private life relied on arise principally from his fraudulently obtained
    entrepreneurial visa. Frankly, he is now reaping  the  consequences  of
    his fraud and misrepresentation and can hardly rely on his very limited
    business  activities  to  justify  a  private   life   overriding   the
    application and consequences of fraud and misrepresentation  applicable
    under the Immigration Rules.

17. In all the circumstances, even considering the  further  evidence  from
    the appellant and the submissions of Ms  Vatish,  there  is  absolutely
    nothing to suggest that the judge was in  error  in  finding  that  any
    interference with  the  appellant's  private  life  occasioned  by  his
    removal, or refusal to permit  entry,  can  be  properly  described  as
    disproportionate or otherwise unjustifiably harsh.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
