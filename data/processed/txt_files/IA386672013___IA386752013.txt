Representation

For the Appellant:       Ms Wilkins, Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor Solicitors
For the Respondent:      Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants  are  both  nationals  of  Pakistan.  They  appeal  with
    permission[1] the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Holt)[2]
    to dismiss their linked appeals against the Respondent's  decisions  to
    refuse to vary their leave to remain and to remove them from the United
    Kingdom pursuant to s47 of the Immigration Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006[3].




    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. The First Appellant had applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepeneur) with the Second Appellant,  her  husband,  named  as  her
    dependent. She relied inter alia on a statement purportedly  issued  by
    the Sindh  Bank  showing  her  to  have  funds  of  in  excess  of  the
    equivalent,  in  rupees,  of   ï¿½200,000.   The   Respondent   conducted
    verification checks and found that document  not  to  be  genuine.  The
    refusal was therefore made with reference to paragraph 322 (1A) of  the
    Rules.  No explanation was offered,  nor  evidence  submitted,  by  the
    Respondent as to why the Sindh Bank statements  were  not  accepted  as
    genuine.

 3. The Appellants appealed and in doing so submitted witness statements in
    which they maintained that the bank statement had  been  genuine.   The
    account given was that following their initial submission of  documents
    they had decided to close the Sindh Bank  account  and  transfer  their
    funds to Habib Bank. They pointed  out  that  in  July  2013  they  had
    actually sent  on  Habib  Bank  statements  to  the  Respondent.   This
    suggested that if there was no currently existing account this was  not
    because of any deception; rather it was because the  account  had  been
    shut by the time the checks were made.

 4. Prior to the hearing the Respondent produced a  'Document  Verification
    Report' (DVR).   This showed that enquiries made by the High Commission
    on the 17th July 2013 had resulted in information being supplied  by  a
    Mr Muhammad Bilal Sheikh of Sindh Bank, Jhelum  Branch  to  the  effect
    that no such account "exists" (in the present tense).

 5. At the hearing on the 21st February 2014 the Appellant produced in  her
    evidence a chequebook. She said that this had been issued to her by the
    Sindh Bank; she produced it as further evidence that she  had,  at  one
    time, held this account. The HOPO cross-examined her on this  document.
    One of the points he made was that the name of the branch  was  spelled
    as "Jehlum" instead of "Jhelum".   The Appellant  protested  that  this
    was an alternative spelling. Following the hearing her  representatives
    wrote to the Tribunal  providing  a  screenshot  from  the  Sindh  Bank
    website which confirmed that the  bank  does  spell  the  name  of  the
    Punjabi city 'Jehlum'. That letter was sent on the 24th February 2014.

 6. On the 7th March 2014 Judge Holt promulgated her decision. She was  not
    impressed by the cheque book:

         "The cheque book was very different from any  cheque  book  I  have
         ever seen. Bizarre elements included:  the  quality  of  the  shiny
         paper, the fact that the binding (green) appeared to have been  cut
         unevenly and applied at different levels on the front and  back;  a
         corner was ripped off; figures inside were not on the  same  level;
         the spelling of 'Jehlum'  was  different  from  other  spellings  -
         'Jhelum' used for example in the DVR email from the bank;  and  the
         fact that the perforations running between the counterfoil and  the
         cheques were not in a straight  line  and  appeared  to  have  been
         created by means of a  needle,   pin  or  other  sharp  instrument.
         Finally,  all  the  cheques  had  already  been  signed   by   both
         Appellants.


         Overall the cheque book was very strange. However, I  do  not  have
         any knowledge of Pakistani cheque books or expertise  in  assessing
         what is a forgery or not. Therefore my overall  assessment  of  the
         chequebook itself is that it is a document which I can ascribe  any
         weight whatsoever".


    I presume from the tenor of these paragraphs that  the  final  sentence
    should  read  "  I  cannot  ascribe   any   weight   whatsoever".   The
    determination went on to make adverse findings about the oral  evidence
    and the appeal was dismissed, Judge Holt finding that the refusal under
    paragraph 322(1A) was justified.

 7. The grounds of appeal are that  that  the  determination  contains  the
    following errors of law:


    a) Nowhere is it recognised that the burden of  proof  in  establishing
       deception lies on the Respondent;


    b) Nowhere is  it  considered  that  the  explanation  offered  by  the
       Appellants - that the bank account had now been closed  -  had  been
       offered prior to the DVR ever being disclosed  and  as  such  should
       have carried more weight as a consistent explanation for Mr Sheikh's
       evidence;

    c) There is no finding as to  whether  the  contents  of  the  DVR  are
       capable of discharging the burden of proof,  the  Respondent  having
       failed to produce any other  evidence  that  this  account  was  not
       genuine;

    d) The  findings  on  the  credibility  of  the  Second  Appellant  are
       unreasoned: there are no reasons given for having found the evidence
       to be "convoluted", "vague" or "nonsensical and unreliable";

    e) The comments about the  chequebook  in  the  determination  are  all
       unsafe because as the Judge herself notes, she has no experience  of
       Pakistani chequebooks;

    f) There is a mistake of fact in that the Punjabi  town  is  frequently
       known as Jehlum as opposed to Jhelum,  notably  on  the  Sindh  Bank
       website.





    Error of Law

 8. An initial 'error of law' hearing took place on the 21st November 2014.
    The Respondent was that day represented by Senior Presenting Officer Mr
    Diwnycz.  Following that hearing I made the following findings.


 9. This was not, at first glance, a promising case. As can  be  seen  from
    the extract above, the First-tier Tribunal gave numerous reasons as  to
    why the chequebook was not reliable, and was damning in its  assessment
    of the oral evidence.


10.  Having  heard  from  Ms  Wilkins  I  am  however  persuaded  that  the
    determination is unsafe and must be set  aside.   At  paragraph  7  the
    determination states that the burden of proof lies on  the  Appellants.
    In fact in respect of the 322(1A) decision it lay  on  the  Respondent.
    The only evidence that the Respondent had produced was the DVR relating
    to the communications with Mr Sheikh. The Appellant's had, before  they
    had ever had sight of the DVR, explained that the account  was  closed.
    This offered an apparently straightforward explanation as to why it  no
    longer existed. There is no reasoned finding in the determination as to
    whether the Respondent had discharged the burden of  proof  in  showing
    that the Sindh Bank statements were forged.

11. There is an error of fact in that the Tribunal appears to have attached
    weight to the spelling of Jhelum: it is apparent from  the  Sindh  Bank
    website that they use the transliteration "Jehlum".   It  may  be  that
    some or all of the remaining points  made  about  the  chequebook  were
    perfectly justified and it is a document to  which  no  weight  can  be
    attached, but this does not establish that  the  bank  statements  were
    forgeries.

12.  In respect of the reasons given for rejecting  the  oral  evidence  Mr
    Diwnycz was unable to extract any from the  determination.    He  could
    not for  instance  point  to  where  there  was  a  "lack  of  internal
    consistency" or in what respect the evidence had been "ambiguous".

13. For those reasons the decision was set aside.   At  the  close  of  the
    'error of law' hearing Mr Diwnycz indicated that  he  would  like  some
    time in order to take instructions on whether the Respondent wished  to
    conduct a verification check on the  Sindh  Bank  chequebook  that  had
    troubled the First-tier Tribunal.  I agreed to  this  request  and  the
    matter was set down for a CMR.  That hearing was not convened until the
    22nd April 2015 when Mr Harrison appeared for the Respondent.  He  said
    that no verification checks had been undertaken or requested  and  that
    the Respondent did not intend to take any further action in respect  of
    the chequebook. The Appellants were that day represented by  Mr  Karnik
    of Counsel whose instructions were that they no longer wished  to  rely
    on the chequebook at all. The matter was therefore set down for a  full
    hearing.





    The Re-Made Decision

14. I remind myself that the burden of proof in respect of an allegation of
    deception lies on the Respondent. The  standard  of  proof  is  at  the
    higher end of the spectrum of the  balance  of  probabilities:  see  JC
    (Part 9 HC395, burden of proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027 at [13]

         "So far as the standard of proof is  concerned,  we  consider  that
         what the Immigration Appeal Tribunal said in Olufosoye  [1992]  Imm
         AR 141 still holds good: "insofar as the justification consists  of
         deception or other criminal conduct the standard of proof  will  be
         at the higher end of the spectrum of balance of  probability"  (see
         also R v IAT ex parte Nadeem Tahir  [1989]  Imm  AR  98  CA).  This
         approach reflects that of the House of Lords in R  v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department ex p.Khawaja  [1984]  AC  74  and  is
         consistent with subsequent case law (see e.g.  Bishop [2002]  UKIAT
         05532). In  R (AN &  Anor)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2005]  EWCA  Civ  1605  Richards  LJ  stated  at  [62]:
         "Although there is a single civil standard of proof on the  balance
         of probabilities, it is flexible in its application. In particular,
         the  more  serious  the  allegation  or  the   more   serious   the
         consequences if the allegation is proven, the stronger must be  the
         evidence before a court will find  the  allegation  proved  on  the
         balance of probabilities".


15.  In this case the applications were refused by way of  a  letter  dated
    9th September 2013. That letter simply states "as false documents  have
    been submitted in relation to your application,  it  is  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration  Rules".   The  reasons  for  that
    conclusion  were  not  given  until  the  production  of  the  Document
    Verification Report shortly before the First-tier Tribunal hearing. The
    substance of that document is reflected in the email  received  on  the
    5th July 2013 by the  investigating  officer  from  Mr  Muhammad  Bilal
    Sheikh, President and CEO of Sindh Bank:


         "Please note that the statement of account, mentioning  the  number
         as 0635-066249-6106 is totally bogus. Neither this number  nor  the
         title of account (Asif and Ayesha Junaid)  exists  at  any  of  our
         branches.


         You are requested to please take  serious  note  of  any  statement
         received by you on account of our Jhelum branch for confirming  its
         genuineness through a telephone call to us.  We  shall  immediately
         verify it and inform you on telephone regarding its genuineness"


16. As I note above it is the Appellants' case that before  they  had  ever
    had sight of that DVR they had closed their Sindh Bank account and  had
    opened a new one, providing statements from  the  new  account  to  the
    Respondent.   In his statement  dated  11th  January  2014  the  Second
    Appellant explains that he had decided to close the account because the
    bank was not providing a good service and had not been able to  provide
    a letter confirming that the money was held in the account.   The  bank
    had required him to visit the branch in person which obviously he could
    not do because he was in the UK. He had therefore transferred the funds
    to his cousin's account at Habib  Bank.  By  the  time  the  check  was
    conducted by the Respondent, the Sindh Bank account no longer  existed.
     In his oral evidence he said that since the refusal he had tried  many
    times to speak with the branch manager but had  been  unsuccessful.  He
    had in the end received a reply by email dated 11th March 2015. A  copy
    of this email was produced in evidence. It  is  from  Kashif  Iqbal  of
    Sindh bank in Clifton, Karachi and it reads:


         "Dear sir,
         your account with  reference  0635066249-6106  was  opened  in  our
         Jehlum branch no longer exist...kindly visit branch for any further
         inquiry"


17. As to the origin of the funds held in that account the Appellants  rely
    on an affidavit sworn by Mr Ali Shah, who is cousin to both of them. He
    writes that he had agreed  to  give  the  Appellants  the  sum  of  PKR
    32,000,000 for the purpose of starting a business in  the  UK.  He  had
    personally deposited the money in their account at the Jhelum branch of
    Sindh Bank.  In May 2013 they had asked him  to  go  there  and  get  a
    statement for the purpose of supporting their visa application  in  the
    UK.  The branch manager Mr Shahzad Hafeez had told him that because  he
    was not the account holder that was not possible.  He told Mr Ali  Shah
    that the bank had raised a query about the account and where the  large
    amount of funds had come from. The bank had written to the  Appellants'
    address in Pakistan but the post had been  returned  as  obviously  the
    property was empty.   Ali Shah explained to the branch manager that  he
    had given his cousins the  money  and  that  he  had  made  it  in  his
    occupation as a businessman owning a chain of restaurants in  Pakistan.
    The branch manager had then  informed  him  that  it  was  contrary  to
    Pakistani law for a third  party  to  keep  money  in  an  account  not
    belonging to him - if it was not the Appellants' money they should  not
    have it in their account. In addition it was bank policy  that  holders
    of such accounts had to be in Pakistan. Because of these  infringements
    the account was blocked.  The branch manager asked Ali Shah to  give  a
    written statement explaining where the money had come from and  why  he
    had given it to his cousins. He was assured that when the investigation
    was complete the funds would be released.  Ali Shah then  went  to  the
    Appellants house in Pakistan and collected the chequebook. He posted it
    to them in the UK so that they could sign some cheques.  They  sent  it
    back to him so that if in the case of an emergency  he  could  withdraw
    money in an alternative way.


18. It is apparent that there is a fundamental  contradiction  between  the
    evidence given by the Second Appellant in his written  statement  dated
    11th January 2014 and the undated affidavit of his cousin Mr Ali  Shah.
    It was the Appellants' written evidence that they had closed the  Sindh
    Bank account because of poor service: "as a result we felt the need  to
    change to Habib Bank".  By contrast the evidence of Ali Shah is that it
    was the bank which froze the account for various  regulatory  breaches,
    including the account holders not being  present  in  Pakistan,  having
    failed to  reply  to  correspondence  and  the  account  holding  funds
    belonging to a third party. In his oral evidence the  Second  Appellant
    attempted to resolve that contradiction by telling me that it  was  the
    bank which closed the account of its  own  motion.  That  was  not  his
    written evidence.

19. A further contradiction emerges from the affidavit of Mr  Ali  Shah  in
    that he  appears  to  state  that  he  organised  the  signing  of  the
    chequebook so that funds could be withdrawn  -  presumably  by  him  in
    Pakistan - in an emergency.  It is not clear how this would  have  been
    possible if the account had been blocked or frozen. If  the  bank  were
    concerned about the origin of  PKR  32,000,000  in  cash  -  a  natural
    enquiry that any bank operating with due diligence would have made - it
    is in my view very unlikely that they would  have  simply  allowed  the
    funds to be transferred from  a  frozen  account.    It  is  even  more
    unlikely that this history of account freezing and investigation  would
    not appear on the records of the bank.   The unambiguous email from  Mr
    Sheikh is expressed in the present tense but it is in my view extremely
    unlikely that the name of the Appellants,  coupled  with  that  account
    number, would not have shown  up  in  the  bank  records  as  a  closed
    account.  The same can be said of  the  recent  email  from  Mr  Iqbal,
    relied upon by the Appellants.

20. Having considered  all  of  this  evidence  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Respondent has produced cogent evidence in support  of  his  conclusion
    that the Sindh Bank statements were indeed forged.   The Respondent has
    discharged the burden of proof and the appeals must be dismissed.



      Decisions

21. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


22. I re-make the decision in the appeals  by  dismissing  both  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

23. I was not asked to make a direction as to anonymity and on the facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
