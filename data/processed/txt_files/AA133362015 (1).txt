                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr K Smith, Kesar & Co Solicitors


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   The respondent (hereafter the  claimant)  is  a  citizen  of  Iran  who
    entered the UK on 21 October 2009.  He claimed  asylum  on  22  October
    2009.  The appellant (hereafter the SSHD) refused this on 7 April 2010.
     The claimant's appeal was dismissed by Immigration Judge Curzon  Lewis
    on 8 December 2010.  On 10 November 2011 the SSHD refused to vary leave
    to remain.  His appeal on this occasion was successful: in January 2012
    First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Stanford  allowed  the  appeal.   On  6
    February 2012 he was granted DL as an unaccompanied minor, in  view  of
    the fact that FtJ Judge Stanford had found his date of birth  to  be  1
    January 1995.  On 2 February 2015  he  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain.  On 13 November 2015 the SSHD made  a  decision  to  refuse  to
    grant asylum, humanitarian protection and further leave to remain.  His
    appeal came before FtT Judge Sweet who in a decision  sent  on  13  May
    2016, allowed his appeal "to the  extent  that  the  matter  is  to  be
    remitted to the Secretary  of  State  for  consideration".   The  judge
    stated at [20] that:

         "It is unclear to me why  the  Appellant  was  given  three  years'
         discretionary leave following the decision promulgated in  February
         2012 rather than six months until  the  Appellant  was  17�.   That
         would have been in accordance with the Respondent's policy  at  the
         time (as set out in paragraph 17 above).  Rather than allowing  the
         appeal on the  basis  of  the  Appellant's  skeleton  argument  and
         submissions, or refusing it on the basis of the refusal letter  and
         the Presenting Officer's  submissions,  I  direct  that  this  case
         should  be  remitted  to  the  Secretary  of  State  so  that   the
         application can be reconsidered in the light of  the  documentation
         produced for the hearing, the  Respondent's  previous  and  current
         policies and in particular an explanation as to why  the  Appellant
         was granted three years' discretionary leave rather than six months
         (till he became 17�)  following  the  hearing  promulgated  on  6th
         February 2012.  It should also be made clear in the reconsideration
         letter whether the three-year  discretionary  leave  reflected  the
         fact that the application was on the grounds  of  private  life  as
         well  as  on  his  being  a  minor.   If  the  application  remains
         unsuccessful on reconsideration, the Appellant will retain a  right
         of appeal."

     The SSHD's grounds of appeal  contended  that  the  FtT  Judge  had  no
    jurisdiction to allow the appeal on '...not in accordance with the law'
    grounds and had wholly failed to determine the appeal substantively.

2.   I consider that the FtT Judge materially  erred  in  law.   The  appeal
    that he was required  to  determine  comprised  a  refusal  of  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and a grant of further leave to remain.  In the
    refusal decision the SSHD stated  that  whilst  he  was  granted  three
    years' DL in view of the findings of Judge Stamford, those findings did
    not justify a grant of further leave to  remain.   Judge  Stanford  has
    found that he was a minor and that:

         "[r]emoving him at this stage would interfere  with  his  right  to
         respect for a private life  and  the  consequences  of  sending  an
         orphaned young man to Iran with no appropriate reception facilities
         to support him would have consequences of such gravity as to engage
         the protection of Article 8."

    The SSHD placed particular reliance on  Judge  Stanford's  use  of  the
    qualifier "at this  stage"  pointing  out  that  whereas  in  2012  the
    claimant was a minor requiring education and social care,  he  was  now
    over 20 and had not produced any evidence of  still  being  reliant  on
    social care.  The SSHD proceeded to find that the claimant did not meet
    the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  dealing  with  family  and
    private life and had not shown exceptional circumstances to  warrant  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.  The SSHD also  noted  that  she  had
    considered the claimant's case under her DL policy: see paragraph 43.

3.   In the appeal brought by the claimant against a decision of  this  kind
    the duty of FtT Judge Sweet was to allow or dismiss  it  outright.   By
    virtue of changes made to the NIAA 2002, the judge had no  jurisdiction
    to allow it on "otherwise not in  accordance  with  the  law"  grounds.
    Section 84 had previously contained such a ground, but  this  had  been
    removed by operation of the Immigration Act 2014 with  effect  from  20
    October 2014.  By s.86(2)(a) the judge was obliged  to  "determine  any
    matter raised as a ground of appeal".  The matters raised as grounds of
    appeal fell under  S.84  and  were  confined  to  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights.  If FtT Judge Sweet considered she did not
    have sufficient information before her to determine the appeal, she had
    the possibility of adjourning with directions for the parties to obtain
    it.  She did not, however, have the possibility of allowing it so  that
    it remained outstanding before the SSHD.  I would observe that  in  any
    event, the judge  should  not  have  considered  she  had  insufficient
    information.  The SSHD decision letter made perfectly clear  why  three
    years rather than six months' DL had been granted.

4.   Accordingly FtT Judge Sweet erred  in  law  and  her  decision  is  set
    aside.

    The upshot of the judge's error is that the  claimant  has  effectively
    had no assessment of his grounds of appeal.  In  such  circumstances  I
    see no alternative but for his case to be remitted to  the  FtT  to  be
    heard by a judge other than Judges Sweet, Stanford or Curzon Lewis.

    To summarise:


    FtT Judge Sweet erred in law and her decision is set aside.


    The case is remitted to be heard by the FtT.

No anonymity direction is made.
