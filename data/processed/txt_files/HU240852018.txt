                                 SAKINA AYUB
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                             NOTICE OF DECISION

    1. Rules 34 and 40(3)(a) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
       Rules 2008 apply to this decision.

    2. The appellant's human rights appeal was  dismissed  by  a  First-tier
       Tribunal panel (Judges Plowright and Parkes)  on  17  May  2019.  The
       grounds of appeal invited the Upper Tribunal to set aside the panel's
       decision and remit the matter to First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing.

    3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  by  Judge  of
       the First-tier Tribunal Birrell in a decision  dated  11  July  2019.
       Judge  Birrel  considered  it  arguable  that  the  panel's  decision
       disclosed errors relating to the issue of integration under paragraph
       276ADE(1)(vi), with reference to Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813.

    4. In a Rule 24 response received by the Upper Tribunal on  2  September
       2019 the respondent  considered  that  the  appeal  grounds  revealed
       material errors of law in  the  panel's  consideration  of  paragraph
       276ADE(1)(vi). The respondent stated,

           "Consequently, the Respondent does not  oppose  the  Appellant's
           application for permission  to  appeal  and  invites  the  Upper
           Tribunal to remit this appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
           rehearing [as suggested by Council in the  Grounds  of  Appeal],
           without the need for a hearing for the Upper Tribunal, in  order
           to save costs for the parties to this appeal."

    5. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied that  it  can  determine
       the appeal without a hearing (rule 34) and, as the decision was  made
       with the consent of the parties,  no  detailed  written  reasons  are
       required (rule 40(3)(a)).

    6. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal panel promulgated on  17  May
       2019 involved the making of an error point  of  law  and  is  set  it
       aside.

    7. The appeal is remitted the First-tier Tribunal to  be  determined  de
       novo by a judge other than Judge Plowright or Parkes.

                               Judge of the Upper Tribunal
