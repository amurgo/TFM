                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision of First-
        Tier Tribunal Turnock, promulgated on 28 March 2018, in  which  the
        Judge allowed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.
     2. The operative  part  of  the  grant  of  permission  being  in  the
        following terms:

           4.  Where  an  individual  cannot  meet  the  Immigration  Rules
                compelling reasons are required to justify a grant of  leave
                under article 8 which is not a  stand-alone  provision.  The
                decision does not identify any compelling factors and in the
                circumstances the grounds are arguable.


Error of law


     3. The Judge writes at [58 - 59]:

           58.    It is clear that, as a result of advice provided  to  him
                the Appellant lost the opportunity  of  acquiring  10  years
                lawful residence in the UK. The  decision  to  withdraw  the
                appeal was not  on  the  basis  of  trying  to  secure  some
                tactical  advantage  for  the  Appellant  but  because   the
                implications of the withdrawal were not appreciated. Had the
                Appellant not withdrawn  his  appeal  and  simply  taken  no
                action then the 45 days would have passed and the  Appellant
                would have been able to show that he  had  10  years  lawful
                residence  in  the  UK.  In  itself  that  would  not   have
                guaranteed the grant of Indefinite leave to remain as  there
                would have been other  factors  which  would  have  required
                consideration under  the  relevant  Rule,  but  no  one  has
                suggested that there were  any  serious  issues  with  those
                factors.


           59.    The Appellant's situation was not brought  about  by  any
                action on the part of the Respondent or the  government  but
                flowed from the alleged poor  service  provided  to  him  by
                former solicitors. It had  previously  been  suggested  that
                there had been an  'historic  injustice'  (sic)  perpetrated
                against the Appellant although  that  was  not  an  argument
                which was advanced at the hearing before me.

     4. The Judge undertook an examination  of  relevant  case  law  before
        drawing together the  threads  of  the  decision  at  [71]  in  the
        following terms:

           71.    The public interest in this case is the need to  maintain
                effective immigration controls.  As  identified  that  is  a
                factor that must be given significant weight. That  must  be
                tempered to a degree to take account of the  fact  that  the
                Appellant  could,  without  any  difficulty,  have  met  the
                requirements of the Rules by  simply  taking  no  action  in
                December 2011. Almost certainly  he  would  have  then  been
                granted indefinite leave to remain. He  now  has  a  private
                life which includes relationships with family members  which
                has  developed  of  approximately  16  years.  He  has  been
                financially independent and there is no reason to  think  he
                will not be again, and he has made a contribution during the
                time he has spent in the UK.  In  light  of  the  compelling
                circumstances of this particular case, which I find exist, I
                conclude   that,   on   balance,   the    public    interest
                considerations are outweighed by the factors  in  favour  of
                the Appellant and his removal would be disproportionate.

     5. The Judge noted it  was  accepted  the  Appellant  was  in  the  UK
        lawfully until he ceased to have leave to remain when  he  withdrew
        an appeal on 8 December 2011, the circumstances of  which  are  set
        out in the Preliminary Decision of the Legal Ombudsman; set out  at
        [57] of the decision under challenge. It is not disputed  that  the
        appellant's previous advisers are culpable for what  occurred  with
        no suggestion or finding that the appellant contributed to his  own
        difficulties in relation to the loss of the lawful residence which,
        at the date the appeal was withdrawn, was 45 day short  of  the  10
        years lawful residence required to enable the applicant to  succeed
        under the long residence rule.
     6. The President of the Upper Tribunal has recently  handed  down  the
        reported  decision  in  Mansur  (Immigration  adviser's   failings:
        Article 8) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT 00274 (IAC),  the  head  note  of
        which reads:

           (1)    Poor professional immigration advice  or  other  services
           given to P cannot give P a stronger form of protected private or
           family life than P would otherwise have.


           (2)    The correct way of  approaching  the  matter  is  to  ask
           whether the poor advice etc that P has  received  constitutes  a
           reason to qualify the weight to be placed on the public interest
           in maintaining firm and effective immigration control.


           (3)    It will be only in a rare case that an adviser's failings
           will constitute such a reason. The weight that  would  otherwise
           need to be given to that interest is  not  to  be  reduced  just
           because there happen to be immigration advisers who  offer  poor
           advice and other services. Consequently, a person who takes such
           advice will normally have to live with the consequences.


           (4)    A blatant failure by an immigration adviser to follow P's
           instructions, as found by the relevant  professional  regulator,
           which led directly to P's application for  leave  being  invalid
           when it would otherwise have been likely to have  been  granted,
           can, however, amount to such a rare case.

     7. The finding of the legal ombudsman in the Preliminary Decision of 2
        March   2018   clearly   established   the   applicant's   previous
        representatives Farani Javid Taylor Solicitors LLP are culpable for
        failing to consider and advise  the  appellant  of  the  impact  of
        withdrawing the appeal listed for hearing on 25 January 2012, on  8
        December 2011, at which  point  the  appellant's  presence  in  the
        United Kingdom became unlawful leaving him 45 day short of accruing
        10 years continuous lawful residence. Whilst not,  technically,  an
        issue of a representative failing to follow a client's instructions
        I find the finding of the Ombudsman shows a blatant failure by  the
        previous representatives to act in a  professional  manner  leading
        directly to the applicant's appeal being withdrawn and to his being
        unable to  establish  10  years  lawful  residence  in  the  United
        Kingdom. The Preliminary Decision recommended an award  of  damages
        to the appellant as a result of the previous solicitors conduct  in
        the sum of ï¿½12,317.50. The Judge records that at the  date  of  the
        hearing all that was available was the Preliminary Decision.
     8. The Upper Tribunal were today advised that the preliminary  finding
        became the Ombudsman's final finding.
     9. The issue in this appeal is whether the conclusions reached by  the
        Judge are in the range  of  those  reasonably  open  and  available
        following the analysis of  the  relevant  law  and  facts  of  this
        appeal. I do not find it made out that the Judge's conclusions  are
        irrational such as to fall outside the range  of  those  reasonably
        available on the facts. The Judge carefully analyses the  appellant
        circumstances as a whole,  including  the  issue  of  the  previous
        representatives' error,  setting  out  a  number  of  issues  which
        contributed to the overall assessment of the balancing exercise.
    10. Accordingly I find that the  respondent  has  failed  to  establish
        arguable legal error sufficient to warrant a grant of permission to
        enable the Upper Tribunal to interfere in this decision. It has not
        been made out the conclusion the decision is not  proportionate  is
        not within the range of findings reasonably available to the  Judge
        on the evidence.


Decision

    11. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
