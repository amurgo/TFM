                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



    JUDGE mcwilliam:


1.   The Applicant, a citizen of Nigeria, was born on 12 February 1981.   He
    came to the UK on 4 September 2008 with entry clearance  as  a  student
    which was valid until 1 August 2010.  He was granted further periods of
    leave to remain (LTR) under the points based system until 15 May  2016.
    He made an application on 2 July 2016 for indefinite  leave  to  remain
    (ILR) as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  The Secretary  of  State  refused
    the application on 2 July  2016.   An  application  for  permission  to
    judicially review that decision, issued on 6 October 2016, resulted  in
    the grant of permission and a consent order  sealed  on  19  July  2017
    whereby the Secretary of State agreed to reconsider the application.


2.   The Applicant was interviewed on 16 August 2017 and  the  Secretary  of
    State reconsidered his application and again refused it on  12  January
    2018.  The Secretary of State decided that it was not desirable for the
    Applicant to be granted ILR due to his character and  conduct  pursuant
    to paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules (the "Rules") because of a
    discrepancy  in  the  earnings  that  the  Applicant  claimed  in   his
    application on 21 June 2013 for LTR as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  and
    the earnings that he declared to  HMRC  for  the  corresponding  years.
    Permission was granted by UTJ Smith on 3 December 2018.

3.   The discrepancy identified by  the  Respondent  is  that  in  the  2013
    application the Applicant stated to the Respondent that his total self-
    employed net profit for the period between 19 June 2012 and 29 May 2013
    was �14,530.40.  However, the information  received  from  HMRC  showed
    that the  Applicant  had  declared  a  self-  employed  net  income  of
    �5,760.00 and �500.00 for tax years 2012-13 and  2013-14  respectively.
    The Respondent's case is that there is a significant gap  of  �8,270.00
    in the earnings that the Applicant claimed in his  application  to  the
    Secretary of State and the earnings that he had declared  to  HMRC  for
    the corresponding tax years.

4.   The salient parts of the decision read as follows:-

     "You attended an interview on  16  August  2017  and  provided  further
         information that was received on  30  August  2017  detailing  your
         previous earnings and Tax.  These documents have been considered by
         our department and it has been  concluded  that  you  do  not  meet
         Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules as detailed below.

         On 21 June 2013 you applied for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  You claimed 35  points  for
         total earnings of �56,140.50 in the period 01 June 2012 to  31  May
         2013.  Your earnings were from the following sources:

         Employment with Aker Subsea Limited; earnings of �41,610.10 in  the
         period 30 June 2012 to 31 May 2013.

         Self employment; earnings of �14,530.40 Net Profit in the period 19
         June 2012 to 29 May 2013.

         When assessing your application of  02  July  2016  for  indefinite
         leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant,  consideration  has
         been given to the information you have provided  to  HM  Revenue  &
         Customs (HMRC) concerning your income from periods 19 June 2012  to
         29 May 2013.

         The information you provided to HMRC  about  your  self  employment
         earnings had a direct impact on your tax liability and  the  amount
         of tax you would be required to pay.  The information you  provided
         to UK  Visas  &  Immigration  (UKVI)  about  your  self  employment
         earnings was required in order  for  you  to  obtain  your  Tier  1
         General Leave to Remain.

         On investigation it is clear there are significant  differences  in
         the information you initially provided to HMRC and the  information
         you provided to UKVI.

         Information was provided from HMRC  to  corroborate  your  previous
         earnings.

         When reviewed, it was apparent to UKVI that  the  earnings  claimed
         from self employment you had declared to HMRC  for  the  tax  years
         2012/13 and 2013/14 were significantly different to the information
         you had declared to UKVI.

         You had declared to UKVI self employed earnings  of  �14,530.40  in
         the period 19 June 2012 to 29 May 2013.

         For the tax year 2012/13, on your self assessment  return  to  HMRC
         you declared a net profit of �5760.

         For the tax year 2013/14, on your self assessment  return  to  HMRC
         you declared a net profit of �500.

         On your application dated 02 July 2016 had you  declared  the  same
         earnings to UKVI that you declared to  HMRC,  your  total  earnings
         from employment and self employment  would  have  been  �47,870.10.
         (This  includes  employment  with  Aket  (sic)  Subsea  Limited  of
         �41,61.10 (sic), self employment net profit declared  to  HMRC  for
         2012/13 of �5760 and self employment net profit  declared  to  HMRC
         for 2012/13 of �500.)

         Consequently Total Earnings of �47,870.10 means you would have been
         awarded 25 points for previous earnings.

         We are satisfied that you have been awarded 10 points for  previous
         earnings.

         We are satisfied that you have been awarded 10 points for  Age,  35
         points  for  Qualifications  and  5  points  for   UK   Experience.
         Consequently your Total points would have been 75 and you would not
         have scored sufficient points under the Immigration Rules for leave
         to remain to be granted.

         As a result had you declared earnings which  were  consistent  with
         your declaration to HMRC, you  would  not  have  scored  sufficient
         points under the Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to  remain  to  be
         granted.

         Within the evidence you provided in support of your application you
         have demonstrated that there were errors in the tax returns you had
         previously submitted to HMRC for the  years  2012/13  and  2013/14.
         You have also stated that you have contacted HMRC to resolve  these
         errors and that you now have an updated tax liability  figure  from
         HMRC.

         The updated HMRC Tax Calculation Summary SA302 for 2013/14 shows:

         Tax year 2012/13, you have now declared a net profit of  �3556  for
         your self employment.

         The updated HMRC Notice of further assessment  and  SA302  for  the
         year ended 5 April 2014 show:

         Tax year 2013/14, you have now declared a net profit of  �4997  for
         your self employment.

         Your amended tax returns to HMRC are acknowledged and it recognised
         you have a revised tax liability figure from HMRC.

         You relied upon the figures for tax years 2012/13  and  2013/14  as
         evidence of your previous earnings.  The  supplied  evidence  shows
         considerable discrepancies between your claimed  earnings  to  HMRC
         and UKVI, between your  initial  self  assessment  return  and  the
         amendment.

         Careful consideration has been given to the  information  you  have
         provided to UKVI and the information  you  have  provided  to  HMRC
         about your earnings in the United Kingdom.  As stated above,  these
         earnings are significant for tax liability purposes  and  also  for
         determining whether  you  would  have  been  eligible  for  Tier  1
         (General) Leave to Remain.  It is clear the initial information you
         provided to HMRC about your earnings was significantly different to
         the information you provided to UKVI.

         You have shown in the evidence submitted that errors were  made  on
         your original HMRC tax returns in calculating your expenses, profit
         and loss and turnover.

         You have stated the errors are because you  initially  filled  your
         tax returns personally and the discrepancies were as  a  result  of
         expenses incurred after you submitted your Tier 1 application.  You
         then  contacted  a  professional  accounting  firm  to   help   you
         retrospectively amend your tax returns.

         Consideration has been given to the explanation provided.   However
         it is clear that when applying for leave to remain you were able to
         confirm the level of profit you had made from self  employment  you
         had received.  It is  not  clear  why,  when  submitting  your  tax
         returns over the same period, you would declare a different  amount
         to HMRC.  It is your responsibility to ensure  that  the  requisite
         tax is paid on your self employment and it is questionable that you
         did not identify these substantial discrepancies  at  the  time  of
         submitting the returns.   Your  explanation  for  these  errors  is
         therefore not accepted.

         Therefore, the Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied  that  the  self
         employed  earnings  you  had  declared  in  your  previous  Tier  1
         (General) applications are not consistent  with  your  declarations
         made to HMRC in the relevant tax period.  Had you declared earnings
         which were consistent with your declaration to HMRC, you would  not
         have scored sufficient points under the Immigration Rules for leave
         to remain to be granted.

         The Secretary  of  State  has  considered  whether  the  particular
         circumstances of  your  case  merit  the  exercise  of  discretion.
         Having considered those circumstances the  Secretary  of  State  is
         satisfied that the refusal remains appropriate and is not  prepared
         to exercise discretion in your favour.

         Your actions in declaring different amounts of income to  HMRC  and
         UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light  of  your  character  and
         conduct it would be undesirable to  allow  you  to  remain  in  the
         United  Kingdom.   Your  character  and  conduct  with  regards  to
         declaring your income would lead to a refusal of  your  application
         under General Grounds Paragraph 322(5) of  the  Immigration  Rules.
         Whilst a refusal under Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules is
         not  a  mandatory  decision,  it  is  considered  your  actions  in
         declaring different income to HMRC  and  UKVI  would  mean  that  a
         refusal under Paragraph 322(5) is appropriate."

5.   The final paragraph reads as follows:-

     "Consideration has also been  given  to  section  55  of  the  Borders,
         Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (Duty regarding the welfare of
         children).  The duty to have regard to the need  to  safeguard  and
         promote the welfare of children requires the UK  Border  Agency  to
         consider the effect of any children of a decision to refuse  leave,
         or  remove,  against  the  need  to  maintain  the   integrity   of
         immigration control.  Our aim is always to carry out enforcement of
         the Immigration Rules with the minimum possible interference with a
         family's private life, and in particular  to  enable  a  family  to
         maintain continuity of care and development of the children in ways
         that are compatible with the immigration laws.  In  the  particular
         circumstances of your case, it has been concluded that the need  to
         maintain the  integrity  of  the  immigration  laws  outweighs  the
         possible effect on you or your children that might result from  you
         and your children having to re-establish family  life  outside  the
         United Kingdom."

The Grounds

6. There are two grounds relied on by the Applicant. Ground 1 in summary  is
   that the Respondent's conclusion that the Applicant was dishonest in his
   dealings with the Home Office and/or HMRC is  founded  on  an  erroneous
   approach.  The Respondent's claim of  deception  is  vague  and  is  not
   founded upon the material consideration as identified in Khan R (on  the
   application of Khan) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  384  that  he
   either under declared to HMRC or that he overstated to UKVI.

7. Ground 2 argues  that  the  Respondent's  decision  fails  to  adequately
   consider the best interests of the Applicant's children and consequently
   represents a breach of both the relevant guidance and the statutory duty
   created by the 2009 Act.

Submissions

8.   The parties submitted skeleton arguments.  Both  parties  addressed  me
    extensively Khan which sets out guidance to be applied in cases of this
    kind at paragraph 37[1].  In addition, Mr Najib relied on the case of R
    (on the application of NS, ZS, ZS, SS and NS) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2014] EWHC 1971.

9.   Mr Wilford  made  submissions.  He  referred  me  to  the  Respondent's
    position is summarised at  paragraph  15  of  the  Summary  Grounds  of
    Defence which reads as follows:-

     "the only reason for these discrepancies is to assist the Applicant  in
         either initially, lowering his tax liability  when  submitting  his
         tax returns to HMRC or latterly, to score enough points  under  the
         Tier 1  PBS  system,  as  per  his  application  to  UK  Visas  and
         Immigration".

10.  The Applicant has explained how the difference in amounts  arose.  This
    was as a result of error and not dishonesty.  There is no factual basis
    upon which to fast find an allegation of  dishonesty.   The  difference
    between the sums is relatively small.  The Applicant's amended  returns
    declare an additional sum of �2,793.00. This sum would not have reduced
    his Tier 1 earnings claim sufficiently to disqualify him for LTR  under
    the points based system.  Furthermore, the sum  has  been  declared  to
    HMRC and tax liability arising from the discrepancy has  been  settled.



11.  It is accepted by the Respondent at paragraph 8 of the Summary  Grounds
    of Defence that the Applicant provided cogent and credible evidence  in
    respect of his self-employment in the gas and oil industry.

12.  The fact that the Applicant had a motive to act dishonestly is  plainly
    insufficient to discharge the burden  of  proof  on  the  part  of  the
    Respondent.  Moreover, the justification for the decision  now  offered
    by  the  Respondent  is  inconsistent  with  his  acceptance  that  the
    Applicant provided cogent and credible evidence in the  course  of  his
    interview.

13.  Mr Wilford  submitted  that  as  soon  as  the  amended  accounts  were
    produced they were submitted to HMRC. The Applicant  was  contacted  by
    HMRC by e-mail in December  2015  regarding  an  overpayment  and  this
    prompted him to revisit his accounts.  Whilst there is no  evidence  of
    him having received an e-mail, Mr Wilford referred me to a document  at
    page 22A, Part B of the bundle.  This is  a  self-assessment  statement
    and my attention was drawn to it to support the Applicant  having  been
    alerted by HMRC to his eligibility for a tax refund which prompted  him
    to review his accounts for the relevant period.  Mr  Wilford  submitted
    that the point taken by the Respondent  relating  to  delay  is  not  a
    strong one because the accounts were amended in March 2016, this having
    been prompted by the e-mail correspondence in December 2015.

14.  Mr Wilford referred me to the guidance in Khan,  specifically  that  at
    paragraph  37(i).   He  submitted  that  in  this  case  there  is   no
    significant  difference  between  the  income  claimed  in  a  previous
    application and the income declared to HMRC.   The  difference  between
    the pre- and post-amended accounts amounts  to  only  �2,793.00.   This
    would not  have  made  any  difference  to  the  outcome  of  the  2013
    application.  In support of this, Mr Wilford referred me to a  document
    at page 46, Part B of the bundle. This is a GCID - Case  Record  Sheet.
    He submitted that the document is not correct.  The  salient  parts  of
    this document to which I was referred were as follows:-

     "HMRC Notice of further assessment for the  year  ended  5  April  2014
         dated 14 June 2016 - Previously assessed

         2013/14

         Breakdown:

         Employment (PAYE) �15,285

         Self employment �500 (net profit)

         Total = �15785

         The applicant has claimed for 10 months from 2012/13 and  2  months
         from 2013/14 so we are unable to work out the exact points  as  the
         claimed period covers 2 years.  However if we take  an  average  of
         the applicant will have earned just over �10,000 so would have been
         awarded 0 points.  UK Experience points would not have been awarded
         in line with this level of earnings.

         This means that the applicant would have only scored 45 points  for
         all attributes.  They are required to score 80.  Therefore the  LTR
         application would have been refused.

         Amendment made March 2016 by his accountant

         Self employment figures were amended as seen on SA302:

         New total assessed

         2012/13 Breakdown:

         Employment (PAYE) �33,933

         Self employment �3556 (net profit)

         Total = �37,489

         Self employment figures were amended as  seen  on  HMRC  Notice  of
         further assessment for the year ended 5 April 2014  dated  14  June
         2016.  This can also be seen on SA302.

         New total assessed

         2013/14 Breakdown:

         Employment (PAYE) �49,199

         Self employment �4997 (net profit)

         Total = �54,196

         The amended figures  still  do  not  meet  the  figures  that  were
         initially declared to UKVI so he would still have not been  awarded
         the required points to be awarded 80 points."

15.  Mr Wilford submitted on the figures declared it  would  not  have  made
    any difference, and in support of this he referred me to  page  49,  of
    the bundle, which is the reply to Acknowledgement of Service  in  which
    the following is stated:-

     "... When the Applicant applied in June 2013, he was awarded 85 of  the
         required 80 points for attributes (35 for  his  qualifications,  35
         for previous earnings, 10 for age and 5 for UK experience) - please
         see enclosed decision letter form  the  Respondent  dated  15/07/13
         (pp1-4 of supplementary bundle).  He  was  awarded  35  points  for
         previous earnings  as  his  assessed  earnings  were  over  �55,000
         (�41,610 from employed  earnings  and  �14,430  from  self-employed
         earnings).  He only  required  30  points  for  previous  earnings,
         however, to gain the 80 points required overall and  so  the  lower
         level  of  earnings  that  would  apply  taking  into  account  the
         Applicant's amendments in his tax returns would have given him over
         the �50,000 threshold required to earn those  30  points  (employed
         earnings of �41,610, self-employed earnings of �8553).  This  would
         reduce his overall score by 5 points but he would still  have  been
         eligible for a grant of leave having qualified for 80  points.   It
         appears that the error made by the Respondent in their calculations
         shown on the pages RB16 - RB17 caseworker notes referred to in  the
         acknowledgement of service is that they  have  taken  the  required
         level of points required for the Applicant to qualify as  the  same
         35 points (�55,000 earnings required) he gained  in  2013  when  in
         fact the Applicant only required 30  points  as  he  was  initially
         granted 85 points in total in 2013 and so could afford to drop down
         an earnings threshold and lose 5 points ...".

16.   The  Applicant,  according  to  Mr  Wilford,  provided   a   plausible
    explanation.  Mr Wilford referred me to point 3 of the guidance in Khan
    at paragraph 37(iii) and submitted that the Secretary of  State  should
    remind herself  of  the  very  serious  consequences  of  refusing  the
    application. He conceded that it was not  his  primary  point;  however
    drew my attention to the decision letter making no  specific  reference
    to this principle and furthermore it has not been applied in substance.
     Mr Wilford submitted that there are two  discrepancies,  but  this  is
    over two tax periods.  For  the  tax  period  2012/2013  the  Applicant
    declared a net profit in excess of what was actually received.

17.  My attention was drawn to the Applicant's interview at  page  37,  Part
    B, of the bundle:-

         "Q28.    As part of our case working  procedures,  we  have  sought
                  information from Other Government departments in  relation
                  to  your  earnings.   Records  show  that  you   initially
                  declared a self employed net profit of:


                   . �840 in 2011/12
                   . �5,760 in 2012/13
                   . �500 in 2013/14

                  Record  therefore  show  that  you  initially  declared  a
                  significantly lower net profit  from  your  self  employed
                  business  over  the  period  covered  by   your   Tier   1
                  application.

                  Can  you  please  provide   an   explanation   for   these
                  discrepancies?

         A:       Ok good, there is a problem, my 2013/14 my income was  not
                  �500, but this was declared at that time.  So in  December
                  2015 I spotted this  admin  error  and  in  March  2016  I
                  updated self-assessment of �4,997 in  total  was  declared
                  for 2013/14 an extra �4,301 of tax was payable.  This  was
                  paid in full.

         Q.   Did you amend 2012/2013?

         A.   That was amended.  I don't remember exactly it was �3 to 4K.

              In total roughly �9K net profit for the 2 years.

              I put the application I had expense that  came  in  after  the
                  application was submitted.

         Q.   What were the expenses?

         A.   A number of  things,  training,  accountant  fees  and  travel
                  expenses.

              I can't remember.

         Q.   Roughly Accountant fee?

         A.   Approx about �500.

              Training was around �205K -

         Q.   What training did you do?

         A.   PERT master software.

         Q.   Who was training from?

         A.   That was a friend.  Ade Ganu.  I'm not with second names.

         Q.   Where did it take place?

         A.   In Aberdeen.  At the university library.  He had experience of
                  this software from working in the industry.

         Q.   Who did he work for?

         A.   Wood Group.

         Q.   What travel expenses?

         A.   It was for flight and  fuel  expenses  to  find  and  talk  to
                  potential clients.  Flight to Belfast to talk  to  set  of
                  individuals to train but didn't work out.

         Q29. In the covering letter submitted  with  your  current  Tier  1
                  (General)  ILR  application,  you  have  stated  that  you
                  identified the errors in tax your  tax  filings  when  you
                  were reconciling your records last year.

              Can you explain the chronology of events that led you to  file
                  incorrect earnings record with HMRC?

         A.   First of all because my earning was split over 2 years:

              2012/13 I declared �5K

              Intension was to declare the remain earning  in  2013/14.   So
                  when I was filing the  returns  I  made  a  mistake  as  I
                  thought  I  had  to  declare  the  remaining  earnings  in
                  2014/15, so I declared �500 in 2013/14  but  that  was  an
                  error.  I did not use a professional  accountant  at  that
                  time.

              So after in 2015 looking at setting  up  my  own  business,  I
                  reviewed  my  earnings  and  noticed  I  hadn't   declared
                  incorrectly, so I contacted an accountant.

              So, the accountant and I reviewed the accounts and  I  amended
                  the tax declarations in Mar 2016.

         Q.   Do you have the paperwork to prove these expenses?

         A.   Yes, the expenses show on my bank statement  sent in with  the
                  applications.

         Q.   Do you have the invoices and  receipts  for  the  flights  and
                  training?

         A.   Yes, I will have to dig back in to my record.

         Q.   Are you able to provide this paperwork?

         A.   Yes sure.

         Q30. What date did  you  first  identify  that  you  had  submitted
                  incorrect earnings information to HMRC?

         A.       See above.

         Q31. What led you to re-visit your tax  submissions  which  enabled
                  you to identify the error?

         A.   I received an email from HMRC about a payment back  to  me  of
                  around �500 and I  thought this couldn't be right, so  you
                  call them and they stated it  was  based  on  what  I  had
                  declared.  So they said I had to contact my Accountant.

         Q.   When WAS EMAIL RECEIVED (sic)?

         A.   Sometime around September 2015".

18.  In Mr Wilford's submission the answer the Applicant  gave  to  question
    31 corroborates his account that he received an e-mail in December 2015
    which triggered a review of his accounts.  Mr  Wilford  submitted  that
    there is no material discrepancy between the answers that the Applicant
    gave to questions 29 and 31. They are not mutually exclusive and in any
    event, there  is  no  material  divergence  to  support  a  finding  of
    deception.

19.  Mr Wilford referred  me  to  paragraph  18C(iii)  of  the  Respondent's
    skeleton argument in which it is asserted that answers to questions  28
    and 29 disclosed  internal  inconsistency.  (The  Applicant  stated  in
    answer  to  question  28  that  he  had  incurred  expenses   including
    "accountant fees", and that  was  "Approx  about  �500".   However,  in
    answer to question 29 he stated that he "did  not  use  a  professional
    accountant") in relation to the tax years  in  question).   Mr  Wilford
    submitted that this was not a material discrepancy.  The Applicant made
    use of an accountant in making the amended returns and  completing  the
    revised accounts.

20.  Mr Wilford conceded that ground 2 is dependent on  ground  1  (see  UTJ
    Smith's grant of permission).  However,      Mr Wilford submitted  that
    the Respondent's approach to the best interests of the Applicant's  two
    children; Antoinette Ideho (date of birth 9 October 2010) and Alexandra
    Ideho (date of birth 24 August 2014) was defective.  The  eldest  child
    was aged 7 at the date of the decision and the significance of that  to
    the assessment of proportionality is  recognised  in  statute  (Section
    117B(6) and Section 117D of the 2002 Act).There was scant consideration
    of Section 55. The decision is irrational because it is  at  odds  with
    the subsequent decision.

21.  The unsustainability of the Respondent's reliance upon her decision  in
    respect of the Applicant's children is all the  more  apparent  in  the
    light of the grant of leave  to  the  Applicant's  partner  (Ms  Ogaga-
    Woghiren, date of birth 16  October  1987)  by  the  Respondent  on  28
    November 2018 on the basis of the children's best interests. There  was
    no change in  circumstances  between  the  challenged  decision  of  12
    January 2018 and this later decision other than the  short  passage  of
    time.

22.  I heard representations  from  Mr  Najib.   He  drew  my  attention  to
    paragraph 37(i) of the guidance in Khan.  He suggested that Mr  Wilford
    had misrepresented the guidance insofar as the starting point  is  that
    where there is a significant  difference  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    entitled to draw an inference.  Mr Najib submitted that  the  Applicant
    tried to minimise the extent of the discrepancy, however there  has  in
    this case been  a  material  discrepancy  between  what  the  Applicant
    declared to the Home Office and what he declared to HMRC  and  that  an
    inference can be drawn where there is  a  significant  difference,  not
    because there is no plausible explanation, that is the  next  stage  in
    the assessment. (Mr Wilford in response drew my attention to the  final
    sentence of paragraph 37(i), namely "I would expect  the  Secretary  of
    State to draw that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation
    for the discrepancy" in order to support that the first  stage  of  the
    assessment includes consideration of whether there  has  been  given  a
    plausible  explanation.  I   do   not   find   that   there   was   any
    misrepresentation made by Mr Wilford. However, for reasons  I  will  go
    onto explain the Respondent was entitled to conclude that there  was  a
    significant discrepancy, that there was no plausible explanation and to
    draw an inference that there was deception. There point  taken  by  the
    parties in respect of 37 (i) of the guidance in Khan is not material).

23.  Mr Najib submitted that the guidance in Khan was properly applied.   It
    is not the Applicant's  case  that  his  accountant  is  to  blame  for
    mistakes. The Respondent has properly considered  the  explanation  for
    the error  that  was  given  by  the  Applicant  when  interviewed.  My
    attention was drawn to the discrepancy relied on by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  I was referred to page 42, Part A of the bundle.   This  was  a
    letter from the Applicant in support of his  2013  application.[2]   My
    attention was drawn to the figure  of  �14,530.40  straddling  two  tax
    years. The Applicant declared to the Secretary of State  a  net  profit
    which was �8,270.00 more  than  that  he  declared  to  HMRC.  This  is
    significant.  What is missing in this case is an  explanation  how  the
    errors occurred. The Applicant's account of the chronology does not add
    up.

24.  I was referred by Mr Najib to the self-assessment statement at Part  A,
    page 22A, of the bundle.[3] This  self-assessment  statement  does  not
    support the Applicant having received an e-mail at  any  time  about  a
    refund of �500.00.  His account is that he received  this  in  December
    2015 but this is unsupported. In the Applicant's interview he does  not
    properly explain the errors. He does not explain  how  he  reached  the
    conclusion, albeit in error, that the net profit  during  the  relevant
    period was �14,530.40.  During the interview one of the reasons he gave
    for the error is  that  he  did  not  use  a  professional  accountant;
    however, this is at odds with the answer he gave to question  28  (that
    the error occurred as a result of  expenses  that  came  in  after  the
    application  was  submitted  and  where  he  made   reference   to   an
    accountant's fee of approximately �500).  The Applicant puts the  error
    down to expenses.  In support  of  this  he  submitted  a  schedule  of
    expenses ("the schedule") (pages 7, 8, Part A of the  bundle.  However,
    Mr Najib submitted that the  schedule  gives  no  account  of  expenses
    during 2012/13. The expenses set out relate to 2013/2014. They  do  not
    correspond with what the Applicant said in his interview  about  having
    paid �2.5K for training to a friend at the University Library Aberdeen.
     This is not reflected in the figures that are given.

25.  In any event, the point made by Mr Najib, is that the  Applicant  seeks
    to explain the discrepancies as a result of expenses incurred after  he
    submitted his application for LTR.  The flaw in is that his application
    was submitted in the tax  year  2013/14  and  the  relevant  accounting
    period was 2012/13. It is  difficult  to  understand,  without  further
    explanation, how the expenses in the latter tax year  would  impact  on
    the net profit for 2012/13. Furthermore, there are no expenses set  out
    in  the  schedule  for  this  period  and  no  corroborative   evidence
    supporting expenses having been  incurred  which  would  undermine  the
    figures that he gave to HMRC which  would  support  a  plausible  error
    having been made. The Applicant said in his interview that in 2015 that
    he spotted an admin error (in answer  to  question  28).  There  is  no
    explanation what that admin error was and, in any event, it is at  odds
    with what the Applicant stated (in  answer  to  question  31)  that  he
    received an e-mail from HMRC  about  a  refund,  which  in  itself,  is
    unsupported  and  inconsistent  with  the  Applicant's  self-assessment
    statement (at page 22, Part A, of the bundle).

26.  My attention was drawn to the Applicant's amended tax  liability  which
    amounts to �4,301.00 payable for the tax year 2013/2014.  There  is  no
    explanation how this figure has  been  arrived  at.   Furthermore,  the
    Applicant may now say that he used accountants to prepare his  everyday
    accounts and for bookkeeping; however, there is no evidence of this. In
    any event, it is plausible that he would use an  accountant  for  these
    purposes and yet file his own  tax  returns.   If  the  Applicant  used
    accountants in order to prepare his accounts and bookkeeping  there  is
    no reason why he incorrectly transposed figures into  his  tax  return.
    Whilst the Applicant has submitted bank statements in  support  of  his
    case, it is not reasonable to expect the Secretary of State to  conduct
    an accounting exercise.

27.  The Applicant, in answer to question 31, said that he  received  an  e-
    mail some time after September 2015, but there is no evidence of  this.
    The  conclusion  that  there  had  been  a  significant  delay  in  the
    submission of the amended  accounts  is  reasonable  in  light  of  the
    evidence.  There is no explanation why  it  took  the  Applicant  until
    March 2016 to amend his accounts; two-and-a-half months before he  made
    his application. In any event, it is simply not clear  what  the  error
    was.  It has not been properly explained.  The expenses referred to are
    not corroborated or explained in sufficient detail and it has not  been
    plausibly explained why it took the Applicant until March 2016 in order
    to put matters straight with HMRC.  The  Applicant's  explanations  are
    inconsistent and implausible. Ground  1  is,  according  to  Mr  Najib,
    hopeless.

28.  In respect of ground 2, the Respondent's position  is  that  after  the
    refusal of this application  the  Applicant  and  his  family  made  an
    application for LTR on Article 8 grounds.  The Applicant's children and
    wife  were  granted  leave  on  Article  8  grounds.   The  Applicant's
    application was refused and he has  an  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  This application, giving rise to the decision under  review,
    was simply an application for ILR not a general Article 8  application.
    There  was  no  removal  decision  and  there  was  no   human   rights
    application.  The Applicant's wife and children  were  not  dependants.
    They made their own independent applications.  The family has not  been
    granted leave on the basis  of  the  children's  best  interests.   The
    eldest child was 7 at the time of making the  application  and  it  was
    decided on the basis of reasonableness that she should be granted leave
    and her mother has been granted leave in line with her.  The  Applicant
    has an alternative remedy.  Section 55 had a limited role  to  play  as
    regards the decision under  review.   The  only  evidence  provided  in
    support of the application relating to the  children  was  their  birth
    certificates.  There was no witness statement or  submissions  relating
    specifically to  the  children  and  Mr  Najib  relied  on  R  (on  the
    application of NS, ZS, ZS, SS and NS) and he referred  me  specifically
    to paragraph 40 of that decision.[4] This application, giving  rise  to
    the decision under review, was simply an  application  for  ILR  not  a
    general Article 8 application.  There was no removal decision and there
    was no human rights application.  The Applicant's of  this  application
    the Applicant and his family made an application for LTR on  Article  8
    grounds.  The Applicant's children  and  wife  were  granted  leave  on
    Article 8 grounds.  The Applicant's application was refused and he  has
    an appeal before the FTT.

29.  Mr Wilford in response submitted that the Respondent has relied on  ex-
    post facto justification. Because the Respondent  does  not  understand
    the Applicant's explanation is no reason to conclude that he  has  used
    deception.  The Respondent ignored the schedule submitted in support of
    the application setting out the  expenses.  However,  Mr  Wilford  then
    conceded that the schedule did not deal with  the  2012/2013  expenses.
    He asked me to exercise caution when considering Mr Najib's  submission
    in relation to a closed tax year dealing  with  the  tax  year  2012/13
    because where  submissions  are  made  it  is  open  to  HMRC  to  make
    amendments.  The schedule provides clear evidence  of  expenses  and  a
    plausible basis on which the amendments were made. The Respondent acted
    irrationally in leaping to a conclusion that the  explanation  was  not
    plausible.

Conclusions

30.  In support of his application in for LTR on 21 June 2013 the  Applicant
    stated to the Home Office that during the period between 30  June  2012
    and 31 May 2013 his self-employed  earnings  were  �15,898.40  and  net
    profit �14,530.40. However, the Applicant filed two tax  returns  which
    he stated he completed personally; one for 2012/2013  declaring  a  net
    profit of �5,760 and one for 2013/2014 showing a net profit of �500.

31.  The Applicant's accountants amended the tax returns in March 2016.  The
    amended returns showed net income for 2012/2013 as  �3,556  and  �4,997
    for 2013/2014. Indicating an over declaration to HMRC of �2,204 for the
    first period and an under declaration to HMRC of �4,497 for the latter;
    an overall under declaration of �2,293.

32.   He  overstated  his  income  for  2012/2013  to  the  Home  Office  by
    �8,770.40. On the amended figure he overstated his income to  the  Home
    Office by  �10,974.40.  However,  I  accept  that  the  declaration  of
    earnings he made to the Home Office straddles both  accounting  periods
    (2012/2013 and 2013/2014). Considering the matter generously as far  as
    the Applicant is concerned and considering  the  net  profit  for  both
    periods, he originally overstated his income  to  the  Home  Office  by
    �8,270.40. This is the Respondent's case.  The  amended  figures  still
    show an overstatement of income to the Respondent of �5,977.40.

33.  The discrepancy reasonably relied on by the  Respondent  is  �8,270.40.
    The Respondent  rationally  concluded  that  there  was  a  significant
    difference. I reject the submission that  the  material  difference  is
    between the figures the Applicant presented to HMRC,  a  difference  of
    �2,293 for both periods as advanced by the  Applicant.  This  does  not
    accord with Khan. In any event, this figure could still  rationally  be
    considered significant in terms  of  the  Applicant's  overall  income.
    Thus, the Respondent  was  entitled  to  draw  an  inference  that  the
    Applicant used deception.

34.  The Applicant presented evidence to support that he  was  not  in  fact
    dishonest but only careless.  The explanation provided by the Applicant
    was that he did not have a professional accountant. He was  alerted  to
    the discrepancies after he submitted his application to the Home Office
    on 21 June 2013 by an email  he  received  from  HMRC,  sometime  after
    September 2015, informing him that he was due a refund of �500. He then
    instructed an accountant to prepare his accounts for  the  same  period
    and these were submitted in March 2016. Following this he was  told  by
    HMRC that he had a tax liability which he has now  settled.  I  am  not
    clear why and it has not been explained how the  amended  figures  gave
    rise to a tax liability of �4,301  because  according  the  figures  on
    which the Applicant relies, he overstated his income to HMRC by �2,293.
    In  any  event,  looking  at  the  decision,  it  states  therein  that
    consideration was given to the Applicant's explanation that  he  filled
    in his tax return personally and that discrepancies  arose  because  of
    expenses incurred after  he  submitted  his  Tier  1  application.  The
    Respondent in the decision accurately summarises the  Applicant's  case
    and adequately engages with explanation  advanced  by  him.   (See  the
    tenth paragraph of the  decision  (the  paragraphs  are  not  numbered)
    starting with the word "Consideration" and ending with the  words  "not
    accepted".)

35.  Whilst there is no reference in the decision to  the  schedule  or  the
    specific answers given by the Applicant  when  he  was  interviewed,  a
    proper  reading  of  the   decision   shows   that   the   Respondent's
    consideration of the explanation was adequate. In any event, I  do  not
    accept that there is material irrationally.

36.  The Applicant has not at any time given an account  explaining  how  he
    arrived at the figure �14,530.40 (the amount of net profit he relied on
    in support of his application in 2013). The schedule is not capable  of
    shedding light on how the original net profit figure was miscalculated.
    The schedule does not support  his  case  that  the  mistakes  happened
    because of expenses. The schedule does not set  out  expenses  for  the
    material tax period (2012/2013). It is not explained how  the  expenses
    incurred in the tax period 2013/2014 set out in  the  schedule  led  to
    miscalculation of the  net  profit  figure  in  2012/2013.  Whilst  the
    expenses set out in the schedule are potentially capable of reducing  a
    net profit figure for the latter period, the amended  figures  show  an
    increased net profit figure. In any event, the expenses set out in  the
    schedule in 2013/2014 do not accord with what the Applicant said in his
    interview in respect of training. None of  the  evidence,  including  a
    quantity of bank statements, explains how  he  reached  the  figure  he
    originally presented to the Home Office which is not reflected  in  the
    original or amended accounts  nor  is  it  capable  of  explaining  the
    discrepant figures in the tax returns.  The Respondent was entitled  to
    attach weight to the reference made by the Applicant  when  interviewed
    to accountancy fees and conclude that this was not consistent with  his
    version of events.  What the Applicant stated in his interview prompted
    him to re-visit his tax  submissions  was  not  consistent  nor  is  it
    supported.  It is reasonable to expect the Applicant to have been  able
    to obtain a copy of the email he said he received from HMRC. He did not
    do so. Neither did he explain what efforts he  had  made  to  obtain  a
    copy. The self- assessment form on which he relied does not accord with
    his account (the timeline or substance). The Respondent was entitled to
    conclude that the Applicant raised the e-mail to create a prompt to re-
    visit the original accounts and to explain  the  significant  delay  in
    rectifying them (two and a half months before his  application  to  the
    Home Office). The Respondent rationally concluded that there had been a
    delay.  The Respondent rationally concluded that the Applicant did  not
    take steps within a reasonable time to remedy the errors. Whilst  there
    is no reference in the decision to the standard of proof this does  not
    disclose public law error.

37.  The Applicant asserted that taking  into  account  the  net  figure  of
    �8,553, he would have met the Rules in any event, and  therefore  there
    was no motivation to deceive.  However,  that  figure  represents  both
    accounting periods whereas the relevant period for LTR was from 30 June
    2012 to 31 May 2013 or thereabouts. In  any  event,  none  of  this  is
    material.  On  the  Applicant's  own  evidence,  rectification  of  his
    accounts meant that he had a tax liability  of  more  than  �4,000  and
    therefore it can be reasonably  inferred  that  he  had  motivation  to
    understate his income to HMRC.

38.  The Respondent properly considered the evidence before him at the  date
    of the decision both ways. The reasoning given is rational. Mr  Wilford
    states that the Respondent was unable to  understand  the  explanation.
    However, the Applicant failed to provide a coherent, supported  account
    which is capable of belief to explain  the  significant  discrepancies.
    The account does not stand the lowest level of scrutiny.  There  is  no
    plausible explanation given for the discrepant figures.  The  Applicant
    was given an opportunity to provide a  plausible  account  but  failed.
    Although not a matter Mr Wilford referred to  in  oral  submissions,  I
    conclude that the Respondent made his position clear from  the  outset;
    namely, that the Applicant has  used  deception.  No  other  conclusion
    could be reached from a proper reading of the decision and this is  not
    undermined by the AoS.

39.  The application is refused on ground 1. Mr  Wilford  conceded  that  in
    the light of UTJ Smith's order, if the application is refused on ground
    1, ground 2 cannot succeed. In any event, the Applicant did not make  a
    human-rights claim. He did not submit evidence relating to his children
    other than their birth certificates. They did not make  an  application
    as Tier 1 dependents. His children have now been granted leave and  the
    Applicant has an appeal  in  the  FTT  on  human  rights  grounds.  The
    Respondent considered  the  children's  best  interests  on  the  scant
    evidence available. In any event, there is  in  an  alternative  remedy
    available to the Applicant so far as family life is concerned. There is
    no public law error arising.

40.  The application for judicial review is refused.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.



-----------------------
[1] "37. In order not to fall into  the  trap  which  I  consider  that  the
    Secretary of State (or those acting on her behalf) fell  into  on  this
    occasion, it may assist for me to give some guidance in relation to the
    decision-making process where there  have  been  discrepancies  between
    previous applications for Leave to Remain (with points claimed  on  the
    basis of earnings or profits) and tax  returns  which  have  been  made
    covering the same period.  This guidance stems from my observations  at
    paragraphs 32-34 above:

    (i)  Where there has been a significant difference between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary of State  to  draw
         that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.


    (ii) However, where an Applicant has presented evidence to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented with a fact-
         finding task: she must decide whether the explanation and  evidence
         is sufficient, in her view, to displace the prima  facie  inference
         of deceit/dishonesty.


    (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is  the
         "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.


    (iv) However, for an Applicant simply to blame his  or  her  accountant
         for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be
         the end of the matter: far from it.  Thus, the Secretary  of  State
         is entitled to take into account that, even where an accountant has
         made an error, the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
         payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to  have  signed
         the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of
         his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If,
         realising this (or wilfully shutting his eyes  to  the  situation),
         the Applicant has not taken  steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to
         remedy the situation, the Secretary of State  may  be  entitled  to
         conclude either that the error was not  simply  the  fault  of  the
         accountant or, alternatively, the Applicant's failure to remedy the
         situation itself justifies a conclusion that he has been  has  been
         deceitful or dishonest and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR
         within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.


    (v)  Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to a  tax
         return has been dishonest or  merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the  reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


    (vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State  to
         consider in reaching her decision in these  cases,  including  (but
         these are by no means exclusive):


         i.  Whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;


         ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed to  exist  (for
             example,  correspondence  between  the   Applicant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;


         iii.     Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;


         iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to remedy
             the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and  the
             explanation for any significant delay.


    (vii)    In relation to any of the  above  matters,  the  Secretary  of
         State is likely to want to see  evidence  which  goes  beyond  mere
         assertion:  for example, in a case such as the  present  where  the
         explanation is that the Applicant was distracted by his concern for
         his son's health, there should be documentary  evidence  about  the
         matter.  If there is, then the Secretary of  State  would  need  to
         weigh up whether such concern genuinely  excuses  or  explains  the
         failure to account for tax, or at  least  displaces  the  inference
         that the Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest. The  Secretary  of
         State, before making her decision, should  call  for  the  evidence
         which she considers ought to exist, and may  draw  an  unfavourable
         inference from any failure on the part of the Applicant to  produce
         it.


    (viii)   In her decision, the Secretary of State should articulate  her
         reasoning, setting out the matters which she has taken into account
         in reaching her decision and stating the reasons for  the  decision
         she has reached".

         [4] "The Guidance does place the initial onus on the  Applicant  to
         raise the issue of the best interests of the child involved.  Given
         a context in which the Applicant is seeking a period of leave  that
         is substantially longer than that ordinarily provided by the IR,  I
         do not regard this as an objectionable feature, or one that  itself
         is in conflict with, or undermines, the duty under section 55.  The
         Applicant should be in a position  to  explain  what  children  are
         involved in the decision, and how in broad terms the  interests  of
         the children would be  adversely  affected  if,  for  example,  LTR
         rather than ILR were granted. In some cases of course the Defendant
         will  have  independent  access  to  information  bearing  on   the
         immigration history of the persons involved, and could be expected,
         consistent with the duty under s  55,  to  take  into  account  the
         welfare of a  child  concerned,  even  if  the  Applicant  did  not
         specifically raise that consideration. Once the decision maker  has
         basic and reliable information concerning the position of any child
         involved, the decision maker is then required under the Guidance to
         treat the best  interests  of  any  child  involved  as  a  primary
         consideration. Furthermore, once the decision maker  can  see  that
         the issue of the welfare of a child has arisen, I accept  that  the
         decision maker should be pro-active in seeking to obtain,  if  need
         be, further information bearing on that issue."
