                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a citizen of Kenya, appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal
    against a decision by the Respondent dated 21st November 2014 to refuse
    to vary her leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of  discretionary
    leave.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Oakley allowed  the  appeal  and  the
    Secretary of State now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The background to this appeal based on the material facts found by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge (which have not been challenged) are that the
    Appellant came to the UK in September 2000 and was  granted  a  student
    visa and successive extensions as a student until March 2007  when  she
    was granted two years' leave to remain until March 2009 as  the  spouse
    of a British citizen whom  she  had  married  in  December  2006.   She
    applied for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant in  April  2009
    and this  was  refused.   In  June  2011  the  Appellant  submitted  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten  years'
    residency but this was refused because there had been a  break  in  her
    continuous leave owing to the refusal of the Tier 1 application in June
    2009.  The refusal letter dated 19 August 2011  stated  that,  although
    the application for indefinite leave to remain  was  refused,  she  was
    granted leave to remain on the discretionary basis  until  18th  August
    2014.

 4. On 6th August 2014 the Appellant applied for further leave to remain on
    the basis of long residency, private and family life in the UK  and  at
    that time her relationship with her husband subsisted but he was abroad
    and she was unable to obtain  a  statement  or  passport  from  him  as
    requested by the Respondent and the application  was  refused  on  21st
    November 2014. The Reasons for Refusal letter stated that the appellant
    had been granted discretionary leave on 19 August 2011 on the basis  of
    her relationship and that, as she was no longer  enjoying  family  life
    with her husband, the Secretary of State was  not  satisfied  that  the
    grounds  of  appeal  under  which  she  had  previously  been   granted
    discretionary leave still persisted and  her  application  for  further
    discretionary leave was refused. Her application was also refused under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules and the  Secretary  of  State
    considered  that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  in   the
    Appellant's case.

 5. The judge found that at  the  date  of  the  hearing  the  relationship
    between the Appellant and her husband was no  longer  subsisting,  that
    the Appellant works as a teacher receiving an  income  of  �32,588  per
    annum and is an active member of her local church, that she has a  wide
    circle of friends and is close to her sister, whom she sees  regularly.
    The judge accepted that the Appellant resides with her friend  and  her
    friend's two sons aged 7  and  9  for  whom  she  provides  significant
    childcare to enable her friend to work as a midwife and  a  nurse.  The
    judge found that the Appellant's mother resides in  Kenya  but  suffers
    from arthritis  and  has  a  carer  to  assist  her  and  is  supported
    financially by the Appellant and her  sister,  who  send  approximately
    �600 each per month for their mother's  support.   The  judge  accepted
    that the Appellant has no other close relatives living in Kenya  except
    for an aunt with whom she does not have regular contact.

 6. Having made his factual findings the judge decided that  the  Appellant
    could not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi) and went  on
    to consider the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR. The judge concluded
    that the removal of the Appellant would interfere  with  her  right  to
    private life in the UK.

 7. The judge considered the appeal  in  accordance  with  the  five  stage
    approach set out in R v SSHD  ex  parte  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27.   In
    considering proportionality at paragraph 34 of his decision  the  judge
    took into account the fact that the Appellant has resided in the UK for
    almost fifteen years, she has a strong private life in the UK and makes
    a significant contribution to her  community  through  her  work  as  a
    teacher, that she has a strong network of  friends  and  is  an  active
    member of her church, that she earns a good income, pays her tax and is
    financially independent and speaks  fluent  English.   The  judge  took
    these  factors  into  account  in  relation  to  Section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and said:

         "Taking into account the factors listed in Section 117B of the 2002
         Act it is doubtful that her removal would be in the public interest
         since her significant private life has been  established  when  she
         enjoyed  leave  to  remain  and  her  immigration  status  was  not
         precarious."

 8. The judge went on to consider other factors including the fact that the
    Appellant enjoys a close  relationship  with  her  sister  although  he
    accepted that this is unlikely to be more than the usual emotional ties
    between adult siblings and that she is close to her  friend's  children
    who she looks after when her friend is working shifts in the NHS.

 9. The judge also considered the  terms  of  the  Respondent's  policy  in
    relation to discretionary  leave.  The  judge  noted  that  the  policy
    requires "a significant change of circumstances in order to  justify  a
    refusal to continue discretionary  leave  as  previously  granted"[35].
    The judge said that it would clearly be wrong to interpret  the  policy
    as requiring any change of circumstances since any renewal  application
    will involve a change of circumstances  at  least  in  respect  of  the
    length of time of the residence and that, taking into account the  aims
    and objectives in the policy, any change of circumstances "will need to
    be capable of tipping the balance in favour of removal  and  away  from
    the grant of leave".  The judge found on the fact  of  the  Appellant's
    case that it could not be said that;

         "... the breakdown in communication between the Appellant  and  her
         husband is a significant change in circumstances, all the  more  so
         when the Appellant has continued to work and contribute to  society
         and develop her private life in the United Kingdom as  referred  to
         above." [36]

10. The judge concluded that the Respondent  misinterpreted  the  basis  on
    which  the  Appellant  was  previously  granted  leave  and  the  judge
    concluded that the thrust of the 2011 application was primarily related
    to the Appellant's  private  life  and  long  residence  and  that  the
    decision  granting  discretionary  leave   says   nothing   about   the
    relationship with her husband, despite  the  misleading  terms  of  the
    decision under appeal in this case.  The judge concluded that it  could
    not therefore reasonably be maintained on reading the 2011  application
    and the decision that "in August 2011 you  were  granted  discretionary
    leave on the basis of your relationship" as stated in the  reasons  for
    refusal letter.  The judge said that this was clearly not the case  and
    that the Appellant therefore fell within the terms of the  Respondent's
    own policy and that this is  a  further  factor  to  be  considered  in
    relation to proportionality.

11. The Secretary of State contends in her Grounds of Appeal that the judge
    materially misdirected himself in relation to Section 117B and  Article
    8.  It is contended that the judge erred in relation to the  assessment
    as to whether the Appellant's leave was precarious and  relied  on  the
    case of AM (S.117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).

12. Ms Foot conceded that the judge made an error  in  considering  whether
    the Appellant's immigration status had been precarious.   She  accepted
    that the case of AM Malawi makes it clear that, despite  having  lawful
    leave to remain, the Appellant's immigration status over the  years  of
    her stay in the UK was 'precarious'.  However, she submitted that  this
    is not a material error as, due to her circumstances, the Appellant was
    always going to do well in  an  assessment  of  the  other  factors  in
    Section 117B.

13. Ms Foot submitted that  the  Appellant  could  speak  English  and  was
    financially independent and that there were other factors also  in  her
    favour in relation to Article 8, for example her role in the community,
    her role in relation to her sister  and  her  friend's  children.   She
    submitted therefore that the  error  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    immigration status was not capable of tipping the balance  towards  the
    Secretary of State.  She also submitted that the Appellant fell  within
    the discretionary  leave  policy  which  enables  a  further  grant  of
    discretionary  leave  if  there  has  been  no  significant  change  of
    circumstances.  She submitted that the case law makes  it  clear  that,
    where an Appellant falls within the terms of a policy, this is relevant
    to a proportionality assessment in relation to the  assessment  of  the
    public interest.  She submitted that in this context and with reference
    to that policy the error in  relation  to  the  precariousness  of  the
    Appellant's status was not capable of tipping the balance back  to  the
    Secretary of State.

14. I accept Ms Foot's submissions in relation  to  this  issue  and  I  am
    satisfied that the accepted error at paragraph 34(iv) is not a material
    error. It is clear that all of the other factors in Section 117B of the
    2002 Act are in the Appellant's  favour.   I  accept,  looking  at  the
    decision overall, that the judge took into account many factors in  the
    Appellant's favour including the factors listed at paragraph 34.

15. Ms Foot also referred to the case of Dasgupta [2016] UKUT 0028  and  in
    particular paragraph 26 in relation to proportionality which emphasises
    the substance of the  judge's  conclusions.   She  submitted  that  the
    Secretary  of  State's  appeal  falls  foul  of  the  decision  in   MR
    (permission to appeal: Tribunal's approach) Brazil  [2015]  UKUT  00029
    (IAC) as the Grounds of Appeal in this case amount to  a  quarrel  with
    the judge's  assessment.   She  submitted  that,  although  it  may  be
    arguable that the Appellant was  granted  discretionary  leave  on  the
    basis of her marriage, it is equally arguable that the  2011  grant  of
    leave was based on the Appellant's private life.   She  submitted  that
    the policy refers to a significant change of circumstances and  it  was
    open to the judge to conclude that there was not in this case.

16. Ms Foot referred to the Appellant's application letter dated  3rd  June
    2011 at page 55 of the Appellant's bundle.   The  letter  is  from  the
    Appellant's solicitors and begins by indicating that the Appellant  had
    instructed them to submit an application for indefinite leave to remain
    in the UK under the long residence Rules and Article 8 of the  ECHR  on
    the basis that she has completed ten years' lawful residence in the  UK
    and has established a private and family life in the  UK.   The  letter
    goes on to outline the Appellant's circumstances including  the  length
    of her residence and her marriage, and the fact that she is engaged  in
    employment and has not had recourse to public funds in the UK. Ms  Foot
    drew my attention to the letter from the Secretary of State dated  19th
    August 2011 informing the Appellant that discretion  was  exercised  in
    her favour and she was granted  limited  leave  to  remain  until  18th
    August 2014.

17. I accept that the letter of 3rd June 2011  refers  to  the  Appellant's
    lengthy residence, her private life and her family life in the  UK  and
    that the letter granting discretionary  leave  does  not  indicate  the
    basis  on  which  discretionary  leave  had  been  granted.   In  these
    circumstances I am satisfied that it was absolutely open to  the  judge
    to conclude that it was  not  clear  that  the  Appellant  was  granted
    discretionary leave on the basis of her relationship  as  indicated  in
    the reasons for refusal letter of November 2014. It was equally open to
    the judge to conclude that the Appellant was granted leave to remain on
    the basis also of her private life and length of residence in the UK.

18. I am satisfied that it was open to  the  judge  to  conclude  in  these
    circumstances that the breakup of the Appellant's relationship was  not
    a significant change of circumstances.  It was rational and  the  judge
    gave good, sustainable reasons  for  his  conclusions.   I  accept  the
    submission made by Ms Foot in relation to the  guidance  given  in  the
    case of Dasgupta approving the decision in Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC
    14 and I accept that the judge's decision  was  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence and was not perverse.

19. In these circumstances I conclude that there is no  material  error  in
    the judge's decision.
