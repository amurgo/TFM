Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Williams, Williams Hortor Law & Mediation
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals with permission a decision of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Perry, promulgated on 2nd July 2014, in which the judge dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's refusal, dated 17th May
    2013, of the Appellant's application made under the Points Based system
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, in combination with a  removal  decision
    of the same date.

 2. Permission was granted on the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had  raised
    Article 8 and Article 3 grounds which the judge decided  he  would  not
    determine.

 3. In light of the clear obligation on judges to determine all Grounds  of
    Appeal before them I indicated at the commencement of  the  hearing  to
    the representatives that the decision was  plainly  vitiated  by  legal
    error.  No fact finding exercise had been  conducted at the  First-tier
    in connection with either  human  rights  or  international  protection
    issues.  In those circumstances it is  appropriate  that  the  case  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a proper consideration of those
    Grounds of Appeal.

 4. The grounds also raised challenges  in  respect  of  the  points  based
    decision, in respect of which permission was "not  refused",   although
    no reasoning was given in relation to them.  All grounds were therefore
    available to the Appellant before me.

 5. These PBS grounds challenge Judge Perry's conclusion that the Appellant
    had failed to establish that he was entitled to 35 points for  previous
    earnings in excess of �55,000.  These  Grounds  of  Appeal  are  almost
    impenetrable, being dense and difficult to follow, but, insofar as they
    were distilled in the skeleton argument  and  orally  before  me,  they
    relate to the judge's treatment of the documentary evidence required by
    the Immigration Rules.

 6. Appendix A at paragraph 19(a) states that an applicant must provide  at
    least two different types of the specified documents in  paragraph  19-
    SD(A),  from two or more separate sources,  as evidence for each source
    of previous earnings.

 7. Appendix A at paragraph 19(b) states:

         (b)  If the applicant is claiming points for self-employed earnings
             made in the UK, he must also provide the  specified  documents
             in paragraph 19-SD(B) to show that;

         (i)  he is registered as self-employed,

         (ii)     he was registered as self-employed during the period(s) of
             self-employment used to claim points, and

         (iii)    he was paying class  2  national  insurance  contributions
             during the period(s) of self-employment used to claim points.

 8.  I  find  that  the  grounds  directed  to  explanations  as   to   why
    documentation cannot meet the requirements of the Rules,  for  example,
    the improbability of emails being on headed notepaper, miss the  point,
    which is simply that they do not meet the rule. Similarly the arguments
    railing against the rules are misconceived: the rules  are  the  rules.
    These parts of the grounds were reiterated  tenaciously  before  me  in
    submissions, but do not take the case any further because they  do  not
    establish an error of law by the judge.  The  grounds  and  submissions
    directed to "otherwise not  in  accordance  with  the  law"  were  also
    confused by containing references to  guidance  dated  July  2013,  the
    relevant date in this case being 17th May 2013.

 9. The judge was required to resolve a dispute as to whether  or  not  the
    Appellant's earnings from  Sword  Event  Guard  Limited  of  �1,669.48,
    appropriately identifiable from the Appellant's NatWest  Bank  accounts
    as automated  credits  from  the  employer  could  be  corroborated  by
    payslips which, whilst reflecting the relevant amount,  identified  the
    employer and were consistent with   a  schedule  of  hours  worked  and
    payments received, were deficient in the context of the requirements at
    paragraph 19(FD) which required that the payslips be on "company headed
    notepaper or stamped and signed as authentic  by  the  employer".    Mr
    William's vehement argument that the decision is flawed  because  wages
    slips  are  not  usually  on  headed  notepaper  does  not  assist  the
    Appellant, not least because that is not  the  only  form  of  evidence
    accepted.

10. The arguments centering on paragraph 245AA have more force because  the
    Appellant's ground of appeal, as clarified at the First-tier,  included
    the ground that the respondent had not contacted him and  provided  him
    with any opportunity to rectify his  errors,  and  the  judge  has  not
    explained to the Appellant why he concluded that  paragraph  245AA  did
    not assist him. The judge might have  considered  that  the  Respondent
    should have exercised discretion to approach the Appellant on the basis
    that the payslips were "in the wrong format". In  this  regard  I  note
    that the Respondent's position on the point was made  clearer  when  on
    20th May 2013, days later, the PBS evidential flexibility guidance  was
    officially clarified to include the  explanation  that  "wrong  format"
    covers documents which  contain  all  of  the  substantive  information
    required by the Immigration Rules, but which are not laid  out  in  the
    way described in the Rules, and the example provided is precisely where
    a specific documentation should be submitted on  letter  headed  paper.
    Later guidance relied on by Mr Williams's,  shows  that  by  July  2013
    additionally payslips which carried the name of the  employer  were  in
    fact regarded as sufficient.   At the first tier the  Appellant  sought
    to rely on a letter from the employer dated  20  May,  on  headed  note
    paper, confirming the details of the transactions.  That was  a  letter
    which, if it had been submitted with  the  application,  would  in  any
    event have been sufficient  to  corroborate  the  information  of  bank
    statements, even absent payslips, and so tends to confirm  that  had  a
    further documentary evidence   request  been  made,  adequate  evidence
    would have followed.  Consistent with that position the file shows  the
    Home Office addressed the issue in submissions before the judge  ,  not
    on the basis that  it would have been wrong in  principle  to  approach
    the Appellant  in the context of the specific evidence of the payslips,
     but rather that there was no need for an officer to do so because even
    if that evidential point had resolved in the  Appellant's  favour   the
    refusal would still have followed,  because there were  other  problems
    with the application and lack of specified evidence.  The Rule at 245AA
    provides that no contact should be  made  unless  the  evidence  sought
    would lead to the grant of the application. It is in that context  that
    the point in these grounds is insufficient  to  bring  the  Appellant's
    appeal home.

11. It became apparent as the case unfolded before me that  there  were  at
    least two other issues which were pertinent. The  Appellant's  salaried
    income was approximately �36,000; he needed, and  sought  to  show,  an
    income in excess of �55,000, through additional self employment income.
    Again the Appellant's self-employed earnings were demonstrated  in  his
    bank statements, by automated  credits  consistent  with  the  invoices
    raised against three clients. However in the  context  of  evidence  of
    self employment there are further hurdles in the Rules.

12. The Judge  found  a  difficulty  arose  with  correspondence  from  the
    chartered certified accountants. That  evidence  was  rejected  by  the
    Respondent and the Judge, for a failure to give a breakdown of  salary,
    dividends, profits, tax credits and dates of net  payments  earned.  On
    scrutiny the evidence from Frank J & Co attached with the  tax  returns
    in the Respondent's bundle confirms not only the gross and net  amounts
    for the Appellant's self-employed earnings, but  indicates  the  profit
    figure of �18,294, and sets out in the analysis of income summaries the
    breakdown of salary and the relevant dates of earnings.  What  it  does
    not do is to indicate the nil  receipts  in  terms  of  dividends;  tax
    credits. However as Mr Nath readily accepted at the hearing before  me,
    and consistent with the case of Durrani (Entrepreneurs:  bank  letters;
    evidential flexibility)  [2014]  UKUT  00295,  which  states  that  the
    requirements of paragraph 41-SD (A)(i), and so analogously the position
    here  with  paragraph  19-SD,  "are  to  be  construed  reasonably  and
    sensibly, in their full context", the insistence of a rendering of  nil
    balances, is not, on a  sensible  reading  of  the  rule,  required  in
    circumstances where they are not applicable. Accordingly there is merit
    in the grounds assertion that the evidence of the Accountant  has  been
    wrongly treated.

13. However that too is not the complete picture. The  rules  require  self
    employed  earnings  to  be   corroborated   by   additional   specified
    documentation, and there  is  no  such  additional  corroboration.   Mr
    Williams' reliance on policy guidance issued in July 2014 referring  to
    the ability to corroborate self employed earnings by  an  official  tax
    document showing the Unique tax reference does not assist the Appellant
    as it was not applicable at the  date  of  decision.  At  the  date  of
    decision evidence from the tax office was admissible. In the context of
    the self  assessment  completed  by  the  Appellant's  accountants  and
    forwarded in this case it would only become sufficient when it had been
    duly stamped and assessed by the tax office and the tax  levied.  There
    is no evidence of that position. Accordingly  there  is  a  failure  to
    provide specified evidence in this context.

14. The final hurdle facing the Appellant is  the  requirement  to  provide
    evidence of his satisfaction of the national insurance requirements set
    out at 19(b). In this regard the Appellant  did  not  meet  the  actual
    requirements rather than just the issue of the specified evidence.  The
    documentation in  the  Appellant's  bundle  at  page  34  reveals  that
    although the Appellant contacted the HM Revenue  and  Customs  helpline
    for the self-employed in March 2013, and received a leaflet, he was  on
    his own evidence of contact in  march  2013  not,  in  the  context  of
    paragraph 19(b), registered as self-employed during  the  2012  period,
    nor as  required  at  (19(b)(ii)  paying  class  2  national  insurance
    contributions during the period of self-employment. He  registered  and
    paid in arrears. That is also shown by the letter dated 30th March 2013
    from the National Insurance Contributions Office showing  that  on  the
    basis of the information provided, the  Appelalnt  says  following  the
    March contact, an outstanding liability for 6th May 2012 to 6th October
    2012 and from 7th October 2012 to 6th April 2013.  The letter  was  not
    submitted with the application as shown by the fact that  the  document
    reveals that it was used to pay the outstanding  amounts  on  21st  May
    2013.  At  best  the  document  in  the  bundle  is  only  evidence  of
    registration as self-employed from 30th March.  The evidence  that  the
    Appellant was previously registered as self-employed in 2010 does  not,
    despite Mr. William's vigorous assertions, help him.  It  follows  that
    even if the Appellant had been contacted he could not provided evidence
    to show that he met the Rules, and there is no merit in the Appellant's
    ground that the judge's failure to explain to the Appellant  why  245AA
    did not assist him is an error which if corrected could have led  to  a
    different outcome.

15. In conclusion, whilst there is no dispute before me that the  Appellant
    met the thresholds of the relevant earnings requirements in respect  of
    actual previous earnings from salary and self-  employment,  the  judge
    made no error in dismissing his appeal  on  the  grounds  that  he  had
    failed to establish the position by specified evidence. It follows that
    the decision to dismiss the  Appeal  on  rules  based  grounds  is  not
    vitiated by material errors of law.  I do not set it aside  and  so  it
    stands.

16. As the case of R (on the application of Hafiz) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  1342
    confirms, there is no room in a points-based system for a  "near  miss"
    principle, and there is no  basis  for  a  judge  to  simply  grant  an
    application which is shown on the day of hearing to be able to meet the
    rules if they were being applied at that date.  In Patel and  Others  v
    SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 Carnwath  LJ  drew  attention  to  the  justifiable
    difference in the treatment of Article 8 Private  Life  considerations,
    and cases requiring favourable treatment outside of the  Rules  on  the
    application of family values to the point that a near  miss  under  the
    PBS Rules cannot provide substance to a  human  rights  case  which  is
    otherwise lacking in merit.  That is not to detract from the  principle
    that when considering Article 8 the  context  of  the  failure  of  the
    Immigration Rules may be of relevance.  In the instant case, the weight
    to be attached to the formal requirements  of  immigration  control  as
    described in the points-based system will be a matter to be assessed in
    the round, including factors relevant to  the  Appellant's  failure  to
    meet the said requirements, as well  as  those  relating  Family  Life,
    English language ability and  financial  independence,  and  any  other
    matters  that  the  judge  in  the  context  of  the  remitted  hearing
    reasonably finds relevant.

Decision

17. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal on  immigration  grounds  reveals  no  material  errors  of  law
    requiring it to be set aside and it stands.   The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal to dismiss  the  Appellant's  appeal  on  Article  3  and
    Article 8 grounds, without consideration of the same,  is  vitiated  by
    legal error and is set aside and the appeal remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal for determination on those grounds.
