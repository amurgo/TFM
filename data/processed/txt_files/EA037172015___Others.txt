   DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 39 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
                                 RULES 2008


 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh. They appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT) against a  decision  dated  16  November  2015  to
    refuse residence cards as extended family members of an  EEA  national.
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet ("the FtJ") dismissed the appeals for
    want of jurisdiction in the FtT, relying on the decision in Sala (EFMs:
    Right  of  Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411  (IAC)  to  conclude  that  the
    appellants did not have a right of appeal.

 2. Permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the  FtJ  having  been
    granted, their appeal came before me.

 3. By consent, the parties agreed the following:

      (i)    the FtJ erred in law in her  decision  in  the  light  of  the
         decision of the Court of Appeal in Khan v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 which found that Sala  was
         wrongly decided and that of the Supreme Court  in  SM  (Algeria)  v
         Entry Clearance Officer  [2018]  UKSC  9  which  decided  that  the
         decision in Khan was correct and that Sala should be overruled;

      (ii)   that the FtJ's decision should be set aside; and

      (iii)  that the appeal should be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de
         novo before a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Turquet.

4.   Having heard the parties, and  considering  rule  39  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, I make a consent  order  in  the
    terms expressed in [3] above, considering it appropriate to do so,  and
    thus remitting the appeal to the FtT for a hearing  de  novo  before  a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet,
    with no findings preserved.

5.   The consent order is as contained herein, no  separate  document  being
    required.

6.   It  is  as  well  to  remind  the  parties  of  what  is  said  in  the
    respondent's decision about the sponsor's Italian identity card  having
    been reported as "invalid". Ms Isherwood was not able to  refer  me  to
    any evidence that supports the respondent's  position  in  relation  to
    that identity card. Mr Hashan suggested that  this  is  a  matter  that
    ought properly to be resolved within the  context  of  the  proceedings
    before the First-tier Tribunal. I make no findings in relation to  that
    issue but it is a matter that will have to be resolved  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            7/03/18
