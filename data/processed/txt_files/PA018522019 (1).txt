Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The  appellant  was  born  on  3rd  May,  1996  and  is  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.  He arrived in the United Kingdom  clandestinely  on  10th
    October, 2018 and made a claim to the respondent for asylum on the same
    day.  He was refused asylum in a decision letter dated  14th  February,
    2019 and appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

2.    His  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Herwald   in
    Manchester on 17th  April,  2019.   The  Immigration  Judge  found  the
    appellant to be entirely plausible and accepted his  claim.   He  found
    that the appellant had not discharged the burden of proof of  having  a
    well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason because he did
    not  accept  that  the  appellant  could  not  relocate  internally  in
    Afghanistan and live safely without fear.

The Appellant's Claim

3.   The appellant is an Afghan Muslim whose father is dead.  He lived  with
    his mother, four brothers and sisters.  Having left school at  the  age
    of 15 a friend recommended him for the position  of  a  security  guard
    with the American  Construction  Logistics  and  Service  company.   He
    joined the company as a guard  on  1st  March,  1996.   The  ACLS  held
    contracts with American forces in many Afghan  provinces  and  employed
    some  twenty  Afghanis  as  far  as  the  appellant  was  aware.    The
    appellant's job was at the front gate of the head  office  building  in
    Kabul.

4.   In early 2018 the appellant went to  a  funeral  where  he  met  a  man
    called Mulla [E].  This man used to be a local imam but now  was  known
    to be the regional commander of the Taliban.  This man  threatened  the
    appellant and said that the appellant would be killed if  he  continued
    working for the Americans.

5.   Four men came with this man in  June  2018  and  started  to  beat  the
    appellant.  He was told that he had been authorised  for  execution  by
    terrorists.  The only way  out  for  the  appellant  was  to  help  the
    Taliban.  To save his life the appellant agreed.

6.   On 6th June 2018 while he was working between the hours of 8  a.m.  and
    5 p.m. a man whom the appellant was expecting visited him.  He was from
    the Taliban and the appellant was  expected  to  show  him  around  the
    compound as a form of reconnoitre on behalf of the Taliban.  The mullah
    then visited the appellant on 10th June 2018 at the  appellant's  house
    and positioned four men in the  house.   The  appellant  had  told  his
    friend who had recommended him for the position about the  Taliban  and
    he and his friend decided that they would inform their  employer  about
    what had happened.  In turn they advised the  National  Directorate  of
    Security.  After several weeks the appellant received a call from Mulla
    and following a second call the appellant contacted the NDS  again  who
    arranged for a raid on the Taliban.  Unfortunately, Mulla [E]  escaped.
    During the raid one Taliban member was killed, one was wounded and  two
    were arrested.  The appellant received a telephone call  later  in  the
    day and was told that he would be punished for his deceit.

7.   In his witness statement the appellant claimed that he believed it  was
    10th June, 2018 when his employers told him that  his  presence  was  a
    risk to the company and they therefore terminated his contract.   As  a
    result, the appellant arranged with his  uncle  to  leave  Afghanistan.



8.   The appellant, dissatisfied with the judge's decision appealed, and  in
    granting permission First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane found that  it  was
    arguably irrational for the judge to find that internal relocation  was
    an option available to the appellant, given that the appellant had come
    to the adverse attention of a regional Taliban commander known as Mulla
    [E] in early 2018.  The judge found that it would not  be  unreasonable
    to expect the appellant to return to Jalalabad, but did not explain how
    he could safely make his way to Jalalabad from Kabul.

9.   Mr Rafique argued that Afghanistan  was  still  volatile  and  that  it
    would be very difficult for the  appellant  to  travel  from  Kabul  to
    Jalalabad in safety.  He would be questioned wherever he went and would
    soon come to the attention of the Taliban.  The decision in AK (Article
    15(c)) Afghanistan [2012] UKUT 163 does not rule out  relocation  to  a
    safe area.  He emphasised that it would be unsafe and dangerous for the
    appellant to be returned to Afghanistan  and  urged  me  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal.

10.  For the respondent, Mr Bains suggested that Jalalabad and  other  areas
    under the control of the Afghanistan government would be perfectly safe
    for the appellant.  He would need to travel from Kabul to Jalalabad and
    could, presumably, do so by car.  He would be entitled to  an  assisted
    return package worth up to approximately ï¿½1,500 and could  arrange  for
    his safe passage to Jalalabad, perhaps with the assistance of his uncle
    who lives in Afghanistan, using some of the  assisted  return  package.
    There should be no difficulties at all as  to  his  reintegration  into
    society in Afghanistan.  His mother and maternal uncle still live there
    and while there was no need for the appellant to go to his  home  area,
    there was certainly nothing to prevent members of his family  assisting
    him in travelling to an alternative government controlled  area,  where
    he would be at no risk on return from the Taliban leader  he  fled.   I
    reserved my determination.

11.  Immigration Judge Herwald found the appellant's account to be  entirely
    credible.  It is clear  from  the  determination  that  the  judge  was
    impressed that he had been told the truth by the appellant and accepted
    that on return to Afghanistan the appellant would be at risk were he to
    go back to his home.  At paragraph 19 of the  determination  the  judge
    said this

         "The respondent said that it was  possible  for  the  appellant  to
         relocate internally  given  the  detailed  country  guidance  cases
         referred to above and I reach the same conclusion.  The  respondent
         refers,  for  example,  to  the  town  of  Ghazni,  more  than  150
         kilometres from Kabul, on which  city  the  appellant's  fears  are
         centred.  Ghazni is clearly outwith Taliban control according to AK
         referred to above.  I do not accept that the Taliban has  any  sort
         of  power  and  influence  the  appellant  asserts  throughout  the
         country.  In particular the refusal letter at paragraph  60  refers
         to  background  information  which  confirms   this   Home   Office
         assertion.  Furthermore it would not therefore be  unreasonable  to
         expect him to return to the town of Jalalabad where the  government
         controls the city and all surrounding areas and which is again more
         than 150 kilometres from Kabul.  The  population  of  the  city  is
         around 240,000.   The  appellant  has  shown  great  fortitude  and
         ability to travel through  Europe  (having  been  fingerprinted  in
         Italy) and although his  representatives  said  that  he  would  be
         destitute on return, I do not find this  to  be  the  case.   I  am
         satisfied from the appellant's own account that his maternal  uncle
         is presently supporting the family and could therefore  assist  the
         appellant on his  return.   That  maternal  uncle  also  raised  an
         enormous amount of money very quickly to enable  the  appellant  to
         leave Afghanistan.  I find it noteworthy that the appellant did not
         consider relocating within Afghanistan but instead travelled across
         the world to the United Kingdom for safety.


         In the case of Januzi and Others [2016] UKHL 5 it was decided  that
         the test whether or not it  will  be  unreasonable  for  an  asylum
         seeker to relocate to a safe haven within his own  country  is  not
         whether the quality of life there fails to meet the basic norms  of
         civil, political and socioeconomic human  rights,  but  whether  he
         would face conditions such as  utter  destitution  or  exposure  to
         cruel or inhumane treatment threatening his most basic rights.  The
         case of AH and Others  [2007]  UKHL  49  reminds  me  that  if  the
         appellant will face a standard of living in the safe haven which  a
         significant proportion  of  his  countrymen  have  to  endure  then
         (absent individual characteristics making the appellant  physically
         vulnerable) it will not be unduly harsh for him to relocate  there.
         In this case, I am satisfied that the appellant may  reasonably  be
         expected to relocate within his homeland".

12.. Given that the appellant could apply for an  assisted  returns  package
    which would provide him with some money, to  at  least  enable  him  to
    travel to Jalalabad or some other safe area in Afghanistan, and  enable
    him to find accommodation before obtaining employment, I have concluded
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not err in his determination.  I
    uphold it.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

I have dismissed the appeal and therefore there can be no fee award.
