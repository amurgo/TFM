For the Appellant:     Mr Pratt, WTB Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Wint Pa Pa Thein, was born on  15  May  1985  and  is  a
    female citizen of Myanmar (Burma).  The appellant had  applied  to  the
    respondent for a  variation  of  her  leave  to  remain  following  her
    marriage to a British citizen (Mr Andrew Clough).  Her application  was
    refused by the respondent on 4 August 2014.  The appellant appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  N  P  Dickson)  which,  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 14 January 2015 dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission, Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds wrote:

         It was conceded on behalf of the appellant that she could not  meet
         the requirements of Appendix FM at [26] as she could not  meet  the
         income requirements at the time of the application or  provide  the
         specified documents.  However, the case was expressly  advanced  on
         Article 8 grounds outside the Rules and the judge was aware of that
         (see [5]) it is arguable that the judge's approach by stating  that
         it is "premature to consider Article 8" at [30]  failed  adequately
         to resolve the issue that was before him.  Whilst it could be  said
         that he did at [31] consider proportionality  that  assessment  was
         arguably flawed as he had not taken into account  the  Section  117
         factors either in substance or informed  despite  a  self-direction
         [11] nor did he take into account [the appellant's] ability to meet
         the Rules (see SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [56])  or  make  any
         findings on the issue of insurmountable obstacles  although  raised
         by the Secretary of State in the refusal letter.

 3. Judge Reeds has summarised what is problematic  in  this  decision  and
    there is little more to say.  Mr McVeety did not  seek  to  defend  the
    decision.  Judge Dickson has, on the  one  hand,  stated  that  it  was
    "premature" for him to consider Article 8 [30] but has then  (a  little
    half-heartedly) dismissed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, finding that
    the appellant's removal would be proportionate [31].  There has been no
    proper engagement at all with the appeal on  Article  8  grounds.   The
    appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  further  fact-
    finding exercise  and  further  determination  of  the  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

Notice of Decision

 4. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  was  promulgated  on  14
    January 2015 is set aside.  None of the findings of fact  shall  stand.
    The appeal is returned to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (not  Judge  N  P
    Dickson) for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

 5. No anonymity direction is made.
