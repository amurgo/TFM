                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against the dismissal by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    of the appellant's appeal against the refusal of his asylum  claim.  He
    arrived in this country in July 2012 entering in the back  of  a  lorry
    having been assisted, it seems, to  leave  Iran,  the  country  of  his
    nationality, by means of an agent.

2.   He left Iran essentially because of an incident which occurred  at  the
    wedding which he was attending. He has a cousin who is a member of  the
    Revolutionary Guard and whom he has never particularly liked. There has
    also been a family dispute in relation to an  inheritance.  It  is  not
    necessary for us to go into any detail at all.  In  any  event  at  the
    wedding reception it seems that according to his  account  he  saw  his
    mother being involved in a dispute with his maternal uncle who  it  was
    alleged had cheated her. He went to the assistance of  his  mother  and
    his cousin, that  is  the  uncle's  son,  in  the  Revolutionary  Guard
    attacked him, kicked him, and he was pushed and fell over a  table.  He
    picked up a plate which he threw at the cousin,  unfortunately  hitting
    him in the face and breaking his nose.  The cousin then  drew  his  gun
    but fired it into the air.  In any event when this happened and in  the
    heat of the moment the appellant admits that he  made  observations  to
    this effect, namely that the cousin was abusing his position, that  he,
    and all those from the top including the Supreme Leader,  were  corrupt
    bastards. That was not a sensible thing to  say,  particularly  in  the
    presence of a member of  the  Revolutionary  Guard,  because  it  is  a
    criminal offence in Iran to make that sort of observation  about  those
    in power, but in particular the Supreme Leader.

3.   It was fear of the consequences of his action that led  him,  he  said,
    to decide that he needed to leave the country and so  it  was  that  he
    found his way here.

4.   He produced before the Immigration Judge a photocopy of  what  he  said
    was a summons. Indeed on its face it appears to be a summons  to  court
    to face an accusation of insulting the  Supreme  Leader  and  spreading
    insubstantial rumours against the regime.  That  is  what  the  warrant
    appears to say.

5.   The Immigration Judge found against  the  appellant  on  the  issue  of
    credibility and one of the key  matters  that  led  him  to  doubt  the
    appellant  related  to  this  court  summons.  What  he  said  in   his
    determination was that the objective material stated that in  the  case
    of criminal offences warrants were served personally on the accused and
    if the accused were not found they may be published and he  noted  that
    the date of the summons which had been said to have been served on  the
    appellant's parents, was 23 June 2012.  He left on 5 June but the judge
    said that he did not find it plausible that a summons would  have  been
    served in his absence or that his parents could have come to possess  a
    genuine document.

6.   However that is contrary to the material that was  before  him  on  the
    situation in the country, the date of the Country of Origin Information
    Report on Iran being 16 January 2013.  Paragraph 11.49 says so  far  as
    material, in order to invite an  individual  to  a  judicial  body  the
    summons must be issued, a copy of the document must be  served  on  the
    defendant or a family member and signed by both the serving bailiff and
    the recipient to show the date of service.



7.   The copy that we have does bear  two  signatures  and  the  Immigration
    Judge was clearly wrong to take the view that it did  not  accord  with
    the objective material.  On the face of it it did  and  his  conclusion
    was that based on his findings on the summons itself and based  on  his
    findings on the appellant and having considered the remoteness  of  the
    appellant's cousin from the state authorities he did not find his claim
    in this respect plausible. True it is  that  there  were  a  number  of
    problems in relation to his account as to  how he  had  travelled  from
    Iran to the United Kingdom and the fact that he had not claimed  asylum
    initially where he had stopped for a time. That was capable no doubt of
    damaging his credibility but was hardly central to the issue which  the
    Immigration Judge had to determine.  Accordingly his  adverse  findings
    are based upon a misapprehension of the true position and  in  fairness
    it has not been  suggested on behalf of the Secretary of State that the
    Immigration Judge did approach the matter in the correct way.

8.   The fact is of course that we have a 16ï¿½ year  old  with  a  family  in
    Iran who decided that as a result of an incident he should leave and on
    the face of it is difficult to see why he should have  left  unless  he
    was afraid of something, but what  he  may  have  been  afraid  of  was
    perhaps the possibility of prosecution.  His cousin being a  member  of
    the Revolutionary Guard would no doubt be able  to  tell  the  relevant
    court authorities or the police or whoever is  responsible  and  obtain
    the summons. There seems to us to be nothing  particularly  implausible
    in that possibility.  But it is a criminal  offence  and  although  the
    appellant relies on imputed political opinion it may be that in reality
    he faces prosecution rather than persecution.  On the other hand, it is
    clear that it may be that the offence which he has allegedly  committed
    becomes over-political and so it may be possible that it  can  properly
    be  regarded  as  crossing  the  borderline  between  prosecution   and
    persecution.  That may depend at least in part upon what  the  possible
    penalties are for the offence which is alleged.

9.   In all the circumstances we take the view that  this  decision  by  the
    Immigration Judge cannot stand.  However, in the light of the  material
    that is before us we do not feel it would be proper for us  to  make  a
    positive finding that this appellant qualifies  for  either  asylum  or
    humanitarian protection.  It seems to us that there is a need  for  the
    Secretary of State to reconsider the matter on a proper basis,  bearing
    in mind that the original overall findings that  his  account  was  not
    believed must be reconsidered.

10.  However, as we say, there are a number of problems in the account  that
    was given. Those no doubt will be taken into account and the  Secretary
    of State will have an opportunity to consider if  she  wishes  to  make
    further enquiries whether the summons produced is in fact genuine,  and
    to consider whether this indeed could be said to amount to  persecution
    on the assumption that it is a valid warrant.

11.  We note that there is apparently a moratorium at the moment on  returns
    to Iran. Accordingly that is a further good reason for  remitting  this
    to the Secretary of State for the matter to be considered afresh in the
    light of all the information and in the light of the views that we have
    expressed.

12.  Accordingly this appeal  is  to  the  extent  that  we  have  indicated
    allowed.
