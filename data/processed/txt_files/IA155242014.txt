Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Berry, instructed by ASG Immigration Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Mongolia born on 4th October 1983 and  he
    appealed against a decision of the respondent  dated  13th  March  2014
    refusing his application for leave to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    under Article 8 of the  ECHR.   The  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M A Khan on 31st October  2014  and  dismissed  on  13th
    November 2014.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the appellant entered the UK as a
    student on 18th October 2008 having previously worked at the GOLMT Bank
    in Mongolia and he proceeded  to  study  at  various  colleges  looking
    forward to starting the final  undergraduate  course  on  22nd  October
    2012.

 3. He underwent a very serious physical attack by a group of seven  people
    on 19th September  2012  and  on  20th  September  had  surgery  for  a
    traumatic spine injury.  He realised  he  had  lost  all  movement  and
    sensation  in  his  limbs  and  he  went  through  extensive  inpatient
    rehabilitation treatment lasting six months.  He  was  discharged  from
    Stoke Mandeville Hospital on  22nd  March  2013.   He  now  experiences
    severe physical effects from the attack, has no sensation in his  hands
    save for his right thumb and is unable to  hold  things  properly.   He
    suffers from neurogenic bowel dysfunction which  is  managed  by  daily
    assistance from a district nurse.

 4. At the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  gave
    evidence as his mother and sister were in Mongolia but his  mother  had
    many health problems, both physical and mental and  his  sister  is  in
    full-time work as an accountant.  They live in a one  bedroom  property
    and were experiencing financial difficulties.

 5. The appellant gave evidence that he had been told by his  medical  team
    that he had made a 75% recovery and that anything  more  was  unlikely.
    To date he had  been  paid  ï¿½10,000  by  way  of  a  criminal  injuries
    compensation  interim  payment  and  the  main  component   was   still
    outstanding.

 6. Judge Khan dismissed the appellant's appeal and found at paragraphs  36
    and 37:

         "36.     On the basis of current case law,  there  is  no  need  to
             consider Article 8 of the ECHR outside the  Immigration  Rules
             unless there are cogent reasons for consideration  that  there
             are   compelling   circumstances    which    would    justify,
             exceptionally, allowing the application under Article 8 on the
             basis of decision produced a  result  that  was  unjustifiably
             harsh.  The line of cases begins with R (Nagre) v Secretary of
             SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), endorsed by the Court of  Appeal
             in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, Gulshan  (Article
             8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).

         37.      This line of authorities has  held  that  the  Immigration
             Rules are  intended  to  be  a  complete  code  including  for
             consideration of Article 8 family  and  private  life  rights.
             More recently, the case of Shahzad  (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)
             [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC), it was held that the new Rules are  a
             complete code for Article 8 of the ECHR where a  consideration
             of exceptional circumstances and other  factors  are  required
             within the Rules.  Once having considered the requirements  of
             the Rules, only if there may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
             granting leave to remain outside the Rules,  is  it  necessary
             for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there  are
             compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the
             Rules.  I find  that  in  this  case  the  appellant  has  not
             provided any evidence of any compelling circumstances for  the
             matter to be considered outside the Rules."

 7. It is incorrect to state that the Immigration Rules are intended to  be
    a complete code for the consideration of Article 8 family  and  private
    life rights albeit that they might be  a  reflection  of  some  of  the
    Article 8 considerations.  It is accepted that they are a complete code
    in respect of the deportation provisions but as stated in Singh V  SSHD
    and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ, paragraph 64, the  test  is  whether
    all the relevant circumstances had been taken into account.

 8. It is correct to state that as at the  date  of  the  decision  by  the
    respondent the Immigration Rule relevant was whether the appellant  had
    "no ties" (including social, cultural or family) but this  was  deleted
    from the Immigration Rules on 28th July 2014 and in its place the  test
    was following that  date  whether  "there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to  which  he
    would have to go if required to leave the UK".

 9. As Mr Berry pointed out, this was not made clear in  the  determination
    and although I take heed of  Mr  Norton's  submission  that  the  judge
    between paragraphs 30 and 32 some proportionality  considerations  were
    made, I am not satisfied that the  judge  addressed  all  the  relevant
    evidence to make a full assessment of  Article  8  outside  the  Rules.
    Judge Nicholson on granting permission identified  that  the  prospects
    may not be strong but it is notable that Judge  Khan  referred  to  the
    appellant making an application for entry clearance as a  spouse  which
    was clearly not the case and begs the question as to whether sufficient
    care has been given to consideration of this  appeal.   Indeed  I  note
    that the reasons for refusal letter by the respondent herself  confirms
    that  consideration  had  been  given  to  whether  the   circumstances
    constituted exceptional circumstances outside the Rules.

10. In particular it was stated that although the condition was  not  life-
    threatening, the psychiatric  consultant  Dr  Turner  MD  FRCP  on  1st
    September 2014 referred to the  very  poor  psychiatric  state  of  the
    appellant and his suicidal ideation.   At paragraph 32 that Judge  Khan
    stated that the appellant had his mother and his sister.  The  evidence
    recorded, however, was that the sister was  in  full-time  work  as  an
    accountant and the mother  had  mental  and  physical  health  problems
    following the death of the  father  from  cancer.  These  are  relevant
    considerations and do not appear to have been addressed fully.

11. The appellant experienced a very serious attack whilst he was  lawfully
    in the United Kingdom and continues  to  have  medical  assistance  the
    standard of which he could not access in Mongolia and  this  may  be  a
    factor to consider  in  relation  to  proportionality,  Akhalu  (health
    claim: ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 00400 (IAC).

12. In the circumstances I consider it was incumbent upon the judge to make
    a careful and full evaluation of all  the  relevant  considerations  in
    this matter including the fact that the appellant is still pursuing his
    claim for criminal injuries compensation whilst in the UK.

13. I therefore consider that the matter should be remitted to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal bearing in mind the nature and extent of the findings  to
    be made.





Notice of Decision

decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals Courts and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent of
the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the First-tier
Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007 and further to 7.2 (b)
of the Presidential Practice Statement

No anonymity direction is made.
