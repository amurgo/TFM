                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant Yanxiu Chu was born on 23 December 1945  and  is  now  67
    years old.  She is a citizen of the People's Republic  of  China.   She
    came to the United Kingdom on the last of  a  series  of  visit  visas,
    entering the United Kingdom on 7 April 2011 with leave to remain  until
    1 October 2011.  She applied during that stay  to  vary  her  leave  to
    remain to indefinite leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the
    dependant of her daughter, Furong Xing, who is  married  to  a  British
    citizen, is settled in the United Kingdom and is now herself a  British
    citizen.  The appellant also has a son, Faxi Xing, who studied  in  the
    United Kingdom then returned to China.

 2. The Secretary of State refused to vary her  leave  by  letter  dated  1
    February 2012.  The appellant appealed.  At a hearing on 26 July  2012,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet, heard and later dismissed her appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision.

 3. The appellant challenged that determination and was granted  permission
    to appeal on the basis of an apparent inconsistency in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's findings as to whether Kugathas  family  life  existed
    between the appellant and her adult daughter.

 4. The respondent filed a rule  24  Reply,  the  material  part  of  which
    contended that:

           "3.   It is submitted that the judge's findings were open to her
           on the basis of the evidence  presented.  The  appellant  has  a
           pension in China. Moreover, she has a  son  with  whom  she  has
           lived with.  The judge was entitled not to give  weight  to  the
           purported  medical  evidence  regarding  the  appellant's  son's
           claimed condition.  She has clearly dealt adequately  with  this
           evidence at paragraph 38 of the determination.

           4.    As to Article 8 of the ECHR, the judge  considered  the  5
           stage Razgar test at paragraph 43 and it is submitted  that  her
           conclusions were open to her.  It is submitted that the  grounds
           are mere disagreement with the judge's conclusions."

 5. That is the basis on which this appeal came before me.

Factual matrix

 6. The appellant is a widow. Her husband died in 2006  and  the  appellant
    was then diagnosed with a brain tumour which was operated upon in 2008.
     The appellant finds  it  difficult  to  remember  things  and  becomes
    disorientated. For  several  years  she  has  relied  significantly  on
    financial  support  from  her  daughter  and  son-in-law.   They   have
    supported the appellant  both  financially  and  by  way  of  care  and
    companionship for most of the last five years  on  a  series  of  visit
    visas, beginning in July 2007.  The appellant's case is that she  needs
    the physical and social support of her daughter and her partner.

 7.  For some of the relevant period, the appellant's son Faxi  also  lived
    in the United Kingdom where he studied  but  he  has  now  returned  to
    China, married and is living in Donggun in south China.  The  appellant
    stayed with him for eight months in  2009,  but  her  son  has  chronic
    depression, now extending over  fifteen  years,  which  leads  to  many
    suicide attempts and to his locking himself in  his  room.   Her  son's
    wife had enough to do caring for the appellant's  son's  mental  health
    condition and was unable also to support and care for the appellant.

 8. The appellant moved back to her  own  flat  in  Quingdao  in  northeast
    China, but struggled to live alone there and  returned  to  spend  time
    again on a long visit with her daughter and her partner in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The frequent long travel was very wearing for her and on each
    occasion she required at least two weeks and sometimes three to recover
    from the journey.  She was frail and vulnerable.

 9. While they  were  considering  whether  to  apply  for  leave  for  the
    appellant to remain in the United Kingdom the appellant's brother,  who
    had inherited the flat in Quingdao, emailed to say that he had lost his
    job and would need to use the flat, which only has  one  bedroom.   The
    appellant does not have sufficient income to deal with the costs  of  a
    retirement home, still less the additional cost  required  for  someone
    who is now rather frail and has memory loss.

10. The sponsor and her partner are willing to have  the  appellant  living
    with them in the United Kingdom.  Apart from her daughter Ms  Xing  and
    her son Faxi, the appellant has no other children.

The First-tier Tribunal determination

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered that the  appellant's  account
    of Faxi's mental health problems was exaggerated and that  she  herself
    was not as frail as the  sponsor  portrayed,  such  that  the  Kugathas
    dependency test was not met.   The  sponsor,  who  was  now  a  British
    citizen, could keep in touch via visits and  other  modern  methods  of
    communication such as Skype. the  judge  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant could either meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    or show that Article 8 without the Immigration Rules  entitled  her  to
    remain.

Permission to appeal

12. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes on
    the basis of confusion in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision  in
    relation to family life which was set out in directions  which  I  made
    after the oral hearing on 3 December 2012.  At paragraph 41,  referring
    to the Kugathas test, the First-tier Tribunal Judge found  that  family
    life had not been established.  However, at  paragraph  42,  the  judge
    accepted that "during her time in the United  Kingdom  [the  appellant]
    has enjoyed family life with her daughter".

Upper Tribunal hearing

13. At the oral hearing, after hearing submissions  from  both  parties,  I
    reserved my decision.  The  appellant  undertook  to  provide  all  her
    previous visa applications to the Tribunal and the Secretary  of  State
    within seven days and the respondent was directed to provide  all  Home
    Office relevant documentation relating to those applications not  later
    than 10 January 2013.  Both parties were given leave to  make  further
    submissions and the appeal decision would then be remade on the papers.



14. I gave directions as follows:

           "3.    In  paragraphs  41  and  42  of  the  determination   the
           Immigration Judge made contradictory findings as to whether  the
           appellant's several visits to the United Kingdom over  the  last
           five or six years together  amounted  to  the  establishment  of
           family life with her adult daughter in the United Kingdom.

           4.    At paragraph 41, having referred to the test  in  Kugathas
           [2002] EWCA 31 the First-tier Tribunal Judge found  that  family
           life had not been established.  At paragraph  42,  however,  she
           did accept the existence of family life:

                "42    ...The appellant has now been living  in  the  United
                    Kingdom for over one year.  However she came on a visit
                    visa and can have  had  no  legitimate  expectation  of
                    staying for a longer period than six months.   She  has
                    spent the majority of her life in China.  She has  made
                    a number of visits since 2006.  I  accept  that  during
                    her time in the United Kingdom she has  enjoyed  family
                    life with her daughter.  Her son was also in the United
                    Kingdom during many  of  her  visits  but  he  has  now
                    returned to China.  She actually lived with him there."

           It is  most  unfortunate  that  there  should  be  contradictory
           findings in two successive paragraphs in the determination.  The
           findings of fact in relation to family life constitute  a  plain
           error of law on the basis of which the determination must be set
           aside and re-made.

           Directions

           5.    I consider that this determination can be re-made  on  the
           papers.  I directed at the hearing as follows:

                 a) The appellant to provide copies of her previous visa to
                    the respondent  and  the  Tribunal  within  seven  days
                    together  with  Home  Office   reference   numbers   as
                    appropriate.  That was complied with  promptly  by  her
                    new representatives, TKD Solicitors.

                 b)  The  respondent  to  locate  and  serve  the  relevant
                    documents from the overseas post  in  relation  to  the
                    present application, not later than  10  January  2013.
                    That does not appear to have been complied with.

                 c) I further directed that each party have leave  to  make
                    further  submissions  to  accompany  their   additional
                    documents, if so advised, and that  if  the  respondent
                    exercised that option,  the  appellant  have  leave  to
                    respond  to  such   submissions   within   seven   days
                    thereafter such that all submissions should be complete
                    by 17 January 2013.

                 d) The substantive re-making of this decision  would  then
                    be considered as a paper case.

           6.    In the light of the non-compliance by  the  respondent,  I
           would normally proceed to determine the appeal on the  documents
           before me.  However, the  appellant's  previous  representatives
           made additional written submissions on 28 September 2012.   They
           were in essence the same as the original grounds of appeal  with
           the addition of arguments at paragraphs 6 - 8 based  on  a  case
           which was then pending before the Court of  Appeal  relating  to
           the adult children of Ghurkha families.   That was published  on
           21 January 2013 as Gurung & Ors, R (On the Application Of) v The
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 8.

           7.    In the interests of justice, the Tribunal now invites  the
           parties to make written submissions on Gurung, if so advised, to
           be received by the Upper Tribunal not  later  than  14  February
           2013 final."

 4.  The  appellant  has  complied  with  the  directions  fully,  but  the
    respondent has not.  I therefore have no idea what the  respondent  has
    to say about the previous  applications  or  about  the  Gurung/Ghising
    argument on adult dependency.  The key paragraph  is  paragraph  50  of
    Gurung in which the Master of the Rolls, giving  the  judgment  of  the
    court, says this:

           "50.  ...  The critical issue was whether there  was  sufficient
           dependence and in particular sufficient emotional dependence  by
           the appellants on their parents to justify the  conclusion  that
           they enjoyed family life.  That was a question of fact  for  the
           First-tier Tribunal to determine.  In our  view  the  First-tier
           Tribunal was  entitled  to  conclude  that  although  the  usual
           emotional bonds between parents and their children were  present
           the requisite degree of emotional dependence was absent."

    The Court of Appeal  in  Gurung  expressly  approved  the  analysis  in
    Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal  [2012]  UKUT  160
    (IAC) summarised at point 1 of the guidance therein given:


           "(1)  A review of the jurisprudence discloses that there  is  no
           general proposition that Article 8 of the European Convention on
           Human Rights can never be engaged when the  family  life  it  is
           sought to establish is between adult siblings  living  together.
           Rather than  applying  a  blanket  rule  with  regard  to  adult
           children each case should be analysed on its own facts to decide
           whether or not family life exists within the meaning of Article
           8(1).  Whilst some generalisations are  possible  each  case  is
           fact-sensitive."


    That is the result of a detailed  and  rigorous  analysis  set  out  at
    paragraphs 48 to 72 of the determination in Ghising and  in  particular
    at paragraph 62 thereof:


           "62.  The different outcomes in cases with superficially similar
           features emphasises to us that the issue under Article  8(1)  is
           highly fact-sensitive.  In our judgment rather than  applying  a
           blanket rule with regard to adult children each case  should  be
           analysed on its own facts to decide whether or not  family  life
           exists  within  the  meaning  of  Article  8(1).   As  Wall   LJ
           explained, in the context of family life between adult siblings:


                  'We  do  not  think  that  Advic  is  authority  for   the
                  proposition that Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention
                  can never be engaged when the family life it is sought  to
                  establish is that between adult siblings living  together.
                  In our judgment the recognition in Advic that whilst  some
                  generalisations are possible each case  is  fact-sensitive
                  places an obligation on both Adjudicators and the  IAT  to
                  identify the nature of the family  life  asserted  and  to
                  explain quite  shortly  and  succinctly  why  it  is  that
                  Article  8  is  or  is  not  engaged  in  a  given  case.'
                  (Senthuran v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
                  [2004] EWCA Civ 950)."

Discussion

 5. I have before me all the information which was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in addition I have the information as to what was said  in
    relation to the appellant's various visits to the United Kingdom.   The
    first of these was on  5  May  2008  when  the  appellant  produced  an
    invitation letter from her daughter's partner  requesting  a  two  year
    family visit visa and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  noted  that  the
    appellant had spent nearly seventeen months in the UK on three previous
    six month visit visas.  The appellant said that she would stay for  six
    months as her husband was now deceased. The application was refused.

 6. The appellant's savings in a second  application  amount  in  total  to
    approximately �8,400 at today's rates.  However, the  reason  for  that
    may well be that during the long period she has  spent  in  the  United
    Kingdom during which she is supported by her daughter she has  no  call
    on her funds in China.  Alternatively, since it is  her  evidence  that
    she depended whilst in China on monies sent from her daughter,  it  may
    well be that these are some of those monies, we simply do not know.

 7. The respondent has had an opportunity to comment both on  the  case  of
    Gurung and on the evidence produced by the appellant,  but  has  chosen
    not to exercise it, and I assume therefore that she has nothing to  add
    to the submissions that she made at the hearing last December.

 8. I am satisfied, on the evidence before me that this appellant, who is a
    67-year old widow who is frail and forgetful after an operation  for  a
    brain tumour in 2008, both in China and in the United Kingdom,  depends
    on her close relationship with her daughter who lives here and is now a
    British citizen.  It appears that she no longer has a home available to
    her in China and that because of her son's ill-health, and her daughter-
    in-law's unwillingness to have her, his home is not  a  suitable  place
    for her to receive the social and emotional care which her  health  and
    age require.

 9. It is clear from the determination that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    was aware of the closeness between the appellant and her daughter which
    in at least one place in the determination he regarded as being  family
    life.  I consider, having regard to all of the facts in this case, that
    that is the proper analysis and that  although  in  Western  terms  the
    appellant is not old, for a woman with a brain tumour and  some  memory
    loss the relevant level of emotional dependency  has  been  established
    and accordingly this appeal will be allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

Consequential Directions
Forthwith on receipt  of  this  decision  the  respondent  shall  grant  the
appellant leave to remain for such period as is necessary to give effect  to
this determination.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
