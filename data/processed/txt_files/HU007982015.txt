Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Salam of Salam & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant against a  decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    dated 4 June 2014 refusing her further leave to remain on human  rights
    grounds.


Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Thailand born on  18  August  1977.   She
     first met her husband in November 2004 when he was living in  Thailand.
     They began living  together  as  a  couple  in  June  2005  and  had  a
     traditional Thai wedding in 2006.  The appellant gave birth  to  twins,
     born on 4 November 2006.  They have been living with  their  father  in
     the UK since August 2010 and the appellant has visited the  UK  on  six
     occasions between 2010 and 2014.  She last entered the UK on 30 October
     2014 with a family visit visa valid until 30 April 2015.  On  14  April
     2015 she applied for leave to remain on the basis  of  her  family  and
     private life.

3.   In the letter dated 14 April  2015  from  her  solicitors,  written  to
    accompany the application, it is made  clear  that  the  appellant  was
    applying as an unmarried partner as there was no  documentary  evidence
    to prove the marriage.   It  confirms  that  on  4  January  2007  both
    children were granted British passports and in 2010 the  appellant  and
    her partner decided that it would be best for the children's  education
    if they lived in the UK and in August 2010 the appellant travelled with
    both children to the UK where they have since been living and attending
    school.  The appellant has visited the UK several times on visit  visas
    to spend time with her partner and children and they have also  visited
    her in Thailand.

4.   Since she entered the UK on 30 October 2014 she has  been  living  with
    her partner.  It is also asserted in this letter that the appellant can
    meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM as her  partner  has  an
    investment portfolio valued in excess of �50,000 and  also  receives  a
    state pension of �158.30 per week.  They currently live in  a  property
    which has adequate room for the couple and both children and  is  owned
    outright by her partner.  She is also able to  communicate  at  a  good
    level in English and has enclosed an original copy of the ESOL Entry  1
    in speaking and listening obtained from Trinity College London.

5.    However,  the  respondent  refused  her  application.   She  was   not
    satisfied that the appellant fulfilled the definition of a  partner  as
    she was unable to provide documentary evidence to  show  that  she  had
    cohabited with her partner for two years immediately preceding the date
    of application, which was accordingly refused under para D-LTRP.1.3  of
    Appendix FM.  In these circumstances para EX.1 did not  apply  and  she
    could not meet the requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(d) as she was  unable  to
    qualify under the parent route as she did not have sole  responsibility
    for the children and she could not meet the requirements for  leave  on
    private life grounds under para 276ADE(1).

6.   The respondent went on  to  consider  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances but found that, whilst the appellant's  partner  and  her
    children were not required  to  leave  the  UK  as  they  were  British
    citizens, it was open to them to join her  in  Thailand  and  carry  on
    their home life there.  The appellant had entered the UK as  a  visitor
    and therefore knew that she had no  legitimate  expectation  to  remain
    because of her private and family life and further she  had  said  that
    she had only intended to visit the UK for four months.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

7.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  it  was  accepted  that
    the appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  under
    Appendix FM as she had come to the UK as a visitor and therefore  could
    not meet the requirements of E-LTRP.2.1  and  R-LTRP.1.1.(c)  and  (d).
    Paragraph EX.1 could not help her because of her immigration status  as
    a visitor.  It was argued on her behalf  that  she  was  able  to  show
    compelling circumstances and that the appeal should be allowed  outside
    the Rules because the interests of the children lay with the  appellant
    being allowed to remain with them in the UK.

8.   The judge was satisfied that there was a genuine  relationship  between
    the appellant and her partner and that,  although  they  had  not  been
    formally married in the UK, they were clearly in  a  relationship  that
    existed akin to marriage which was genuine and subsisting.  Her partner
    had been living in Thailand where he met the appellant.  They had  come
    to the UK in August 2010 with their children.  They had now been living
    in the UK for about  six  and  a  half  years  and  the  children  were
    attending primary school.  The appellant's  partner  had  been  looking
    after the children in her absence.  She had made many visits to the  UK
    to see her family and clearly wished to settle with  them.   The  judge
    was told that the  appellant's  partner  was  finding  it  increasingly
    difficult to look after the children on his own and his general  health
    had deteriorated.  He did not have any family to assist him.

9.   The judge commented that he saw no reason why  the  appellant  had  not
    made an application for settlement under the Rules  in  Thailand.   The
    appellant had said that she was unable to do this due to  her  business
    commitments when working there as a travel agent.  She did not want the
    children to live in Thailand permanently because  she  wanted  them  to
    have the benefit of a British education  and,  further,  her  partner's
    deteriorating health would preclude him from living there  permanently.
    The judge was referred to Chikwamba v Secretary of State [2008] UKHL 40
    but, whilst he accepted that  there  would  be  a  degree  of  hardship
    involved in the appellant having to return to  Thailand  and  make  the
    necessary application, he said that he  did  not  see  why  she  should
    circumvent immigration control and "jump the  queue".   The  period  of
    separation would be temporary and would not have such an adverse effect
    upon the children as contact could be maintained through telephone  and
    Skype.  He did not consider it unduly harsh or unreasonable  to  expect
    the appellant to  return  to  Thailand  and  make  an  application  for
    settlement which on the face of it would have  every  chance  of  being
    successful.

10.  The judge then referred to s117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  He said that there was a reasonable expectation  that
    the appellant would be able to return to the UK to join her children on
    the basis that she could  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.   He
    accepted that it would not be  reasonable  for  the  children  to  live
    permanently in Thailand and said  that,  whilst  the  appellant  had  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with her children  and  it
    would not be reasonable to expect them to leave the UK, any  separation
    would only be on a temporary basis and s117B(6) did not  apply  because
    the appellant had the right to  make  an  entry  clearance  application
    either as a spouse or partner and would appear to meet all the relevant
    requirements of Appendix FM.  In these circumstances, the judge was not
    persuaded that there were arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules  and  found  that  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules entitling the
    appellant to succeed.  For these reasons the appeal was dismissed.

The Grounds and Submissions

11.  In the grounds it is argued that the judge seriously erred  by  holding
    that s117B(6) did  not  apply  to  the  appellant.   He  was  wrong  to
    distinguish between migrants who would be able  to  apply  successfully
    for entry clearance if returned as opposed to those who  would  not  be
    able  to  meet  those  requirements.    He   had   further   erred   by
    misinterpreting the principle laid  down  by  the  House  of  Lords  in
    Chikwamba by treating  it  as  restricted  to  refugees  who  were  not
    expected to accompany their partners to their country of origin to make
    an application.  He had also erred by making suggestions as to how  and
    when the British partner should accompany  the  appellant  to  Thailand
    when he was only concerned  with  the  removal  of  the  appellant  was
    proportionate.  Finally, the judge did not  appreciate  the  compelling
    circumstances whereby the appellant would be  separated  from  her  two
    young children even for a  short  time,  particularly  given  that  her
    partner was 70 and had recently been in deteriorating health.

12.  Mr Salam adopted these  grounds,  relying  in  particular  on  s117B(6)
    arguing that the judge had failed to give proper weight to his  finding
    that it would not be reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.
     I was referred to MA (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705.   Mr  Staunton
    submitted that the decision was a sound one.  The judge had  considered
    all the evidence and reached a conclusion properly open to him  as  the
    effect of  a  temporary  separation  while  an  application  for  entry
    clearance was made could be minimised by visits to Thailand.

Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in Law

13.  I am  satisfied  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  by  discounting  the
    application of s117B(6) on the basis that the appellant had  the  right
    to make an entry clearance application as either a  spouse  or  partner
    and appeared to meet all the relevant requirements of Appendix FM.   In
    MA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State [2016] EWCA Civ  705  the  Court  of
    Appeal  considered  how  the  question  of  reasonableness  should   be
    approached.  So far as the application of s117B(6) was concerned  Elias
    LJ identified as the only questions  that  needed  to  be  asked,  when
    applying that sub-section were as follows:

         "(1) Is the applicant liable to deportation?  If so,  section  117B
             is inapplicable and instead the relevant code will usually  be
             found in section 117C.


         (2)  Does the applicant have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with the child?


         (3)  Is the child a qualifying child as defined in section 117D?


         (4)  Is it unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the  United
             Kingdom?"


14.  So far as how reasonableness should be approached,  it  was  argued  on
    behalf of the appellant that this must focus only on  the  position  of
    the children and that  the  conduct  and  immigration  history  of  the
    parents, relevant to the wider public  interest  considerations  to  be
    weighed in the balance, were immaterial.  On behalf of  the  respondent
    it was argued that the focus was not simply on the  children  but  must
    embrace all aspects of  the  public  interest  and  that  the  approach
    envisaged in s117B(6) was not materially different from  that  which  a
    court would adopt in any other article 8 exercise.

15.  Elias LJ said that free from authority he would favour the  appellant's
    argument but that would be inconsistent with the judgment of the  Court
    of Appeal in MM (Uganda) v Secretary of State [2016] EWCA Civ 450 where
    the Court had held that the wider public interests should be taken into
    account.

16.  Therefore,  it  was  open  to  the  judge  to  take  into  account  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control as  being  in  the  public
    interest including the fact that the appellant had the right to make an
    application for entry clearance as a spouse or partner from abroad, not
    only when  assessing  reasonableness  under  s.117B(6)  but  also  when
    assessing proportionality. However, he was not entitled to treat  those
    factors as effectively determinative without giving  proper  weight  to
    the fact that there was a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    and his finding that it would not be reasonable to expect the  children
    to leave the UK permanently, still less to treat s.117B(6) as having no
    application.  I am therefore satisfied that the judge erred in law such
    that the decision should be set aside.

Re-making the Decision

17.  Both representatives agreed that if I found that there was  a  material
    error of law  I  should  proceed  to  re-make  the  decision.   Neither
    representative wished to make any further  submissions  accepting  that
    the issues were clear from the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal
    and the judge's findings.  It is common ground that  the  appellant  is
    unable to meet the requirements of Appendix FM and the issue  therefore
    is whether there are  compelling  circumstances  justifying  a  further
    consideration of article 8 outside the provisions of the Rules.   I  am
    satisfied that there is in the present case as the fact that it is  not
    open to the appellant to rely on EX.1 means that  proper  consideration
    cannot be given to the best interests of the children save outside  the
    Rules.

18.  The legal principles for assessing children's best  interests  are  set
    out in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas  v  Secretary  of  State
    [2013] UKSC 74.  They must be a  primary  consideration,  although  not
    always the only primary one and they do  not  of  themselves  have  the
    status of a paramount consideration.  Further, the fact that  the  best
    interests of children is to stay in the UK does not  mean  that  it  is
    necessarily unreasonable to expect them to leave.

19.  As set out in EV (Philippines) v Secretary of  State  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    874, the decision on what is in the best  interests  of  children  will
    depend on a number of factors such as their age,  the  length  of  time
    they have been in the UK, how long they have been  in  education,  what
    state their education has reached, to  what  extent  they  have  become
    distanced from the country to which it is proposed  that  they  return,
    how renewable their connection with it may be and to what  extent  they
    will have linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life
    in that country and the  extent  to  which  the  course  proposed  will
    interfere with their family life or rights as  British  citizens.   The
    longer a child has been in this country, the more advanced the stage of
    his education, the looser his ties with the country in question and the
    more deleterious the consequences of his return, the greater the weight
    that falls into one side of the scales.

20.  The children are twins born on 4 November 2006.  They have been  living
    in the UK with their father since August 2010, having come to the UK so
    that they can be educated here.  They are  British  citizens  and  were
    issued with British passports on 4 January 2007.  They  have  now  been
    living in the UK for about  six  years  and  three  months.   They  are
    attending primary school and it appears that they  are  doing  well  at
    school.  They have been looked after by their father but  their  mother
    has frequently visited.  They must  inevitably  have  become  distanced
    from Thailand but they have visited and to that extent their connection
    could be renewed.  Their father is now 70 and there was  evidence  that
    he was finding it increasingly difficult to look after the children  on
    his own and that his general health had deteriorated.

21.  The judge accepted that the appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with her children.  The children  are  qualifying
    children as defined in s117D.  The remaining issue therefore is whether
    it is unreasonable to expect the children to leave the  UK,  the  judge
    finding that it would not be reasonable for the children to  leave  the
    UK permanently.  The Court of Appeal in MA  (Pakistan)  made  it  clear
    that when assessing reasonableness, general  factors  relating  to  the
    public interest in effective immigration  control  were  matters  which
    could be taken into account  and  pointed  out  that  the  question  of
    whether it was reasonable for an appellant to  return  and  whether  it
    would be reasonable to expect the children to  leave  in  circumstances
    where the appellant can make an application  for  entry  clearance  was
    capable of producing different answers.

22.  The assessment of reasonableness in the present  case  must  take  into
    account the fact  that  the  appellant's  partner  is  British  and  is
    entitled to remain in this country as  are  the  children.   The  judge
    proceeded on the basis that he should give weight to the fact that  the
    appellant could meet the financial requirements of the Rules  and  that
    an application for settlement would on the face of it have every chance
    of being successful as factors in favour of making  it  reasonable  for
    the appellant to return  to  Thailand.   However,  these  factors  when
    looked at in the context of whether it is reasonable to  expect  either
    the appellant or the children to leave the UK,  even  temporarily,  are
    factors indicating that less weight should be given to the  maintenance
    of  immigration  control  particularly  in  assessing  whether  it   is
    reasonable to expect the children to leave.  I am not satisfied in  the
    circumstances of this appeal that it would be reasonable to expect  the
    children to  leave  for  a  visit  of  indeterminate  length  while  an
    application for entry clearance is made with the  disruption  it  would
    cause to their settled home life and their education.

23.  There is no issue in the present case that  family  life  is  involved,
    that the removal of the appellant would  be  an  interference  of  such
    severity as to amount to interference with that right.  The decision is
    in accordance with the law and is for a legitimate aim.  However,  when
    assessing proportionality and the public  interest  considerations  set
    out in s117B and in particular (6), I am satisfied that it would not be
    reasonable to expect the children to leave  the  UK  and  it  therefore
    follows that the removal of the appellant is not required in the public
    interest and that removal would be  disproportionate  to  a  legitimate
    aim. I am satisfied that the appellant is  entitled  to  succeed  under
    article 8.

Decision

24.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside.  I re-make the decision by allowing the appellant's appeal under
    article 8.  No anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal.
