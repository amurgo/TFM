Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 17  June  1989  and  she
    appeals against the decision of the respondent dated  3  June  2014  to
    refuse her leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student and to  remove
    her by way of directions under Section 47 of the Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2006.

 2. The appellant's application was refused under paragraph 245ZC(c) of the
    Immigration Rules with  reference  to  paragraph  117B  of  Appendix  A
    because she was not in possession of a valid CAS.

 3. The background to the appeal was that on 20 March 2014 the Secretary of
    State wrote to the appellant at the address given  on  her  application
    form to state that  the  appellant's  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies for a Diploma  in  Health  Care  and  Management  at  14  Stars
    (London) (trading as European College  for  Higher  Education)  was  no
    longer valid because on 18 March 2014 the Home Office made the decision
    to revoke the licence, making the CAS no longer valid and therefore her
    application fell to be refused.  Before they made the final decision in
    line with the Rules and guidance they suspended  consideration  of  her
    application for a period of 60 calendar days.  During this time it  was
    open  to  her  to  withdraw  that  application  and  submit   a   fresh
    application.

 4. On 19 May 2015  Lea  Valley  Immigration  Services  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant wrote to the appellant  stating  that  they  had  received  a
    letter from the Home Office dated 20  March  2014  but  that  they  had
    checked the Tier 4 Sponsor Register List where it  showed  the  college
    was on it and therefore the appellant did not need alternative sponsor.
     The Home Office was requested to consider the appellant's  application
    with the same CAS.

 5. Nonetheless on 3 June 2014 the  Home  Office  wrote  to  the  appellant
    refusing  her  application  further  to  Paragraph  245ZX(c)   of   the
    Immigration Rules and making a decision to remove her  further  to  the
    Rules set out above.

 6. She appealed against that decision and  the  matter  was  heard  on  16
    February 2015 by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davda who refused the
    appeal.  The judge set out that the appellant had received  the  letter
    from the Home Office giving her 60 days to  find  another  college  but
    noted that her college had told her they would be getting their licence
    back and told her to reapply using the same CAS. To get another CAS  it
    would "cost her another ï¿½2,000, a lot of money".  As she  was  told  by
    the college to use the same CAS so before the expiry  of  60  days  she
    again applied to the Home Office on 19 May 2014 when the  college,  she
    states, was on the list but the college lost its sponsorship on 3  June
    2014.

 7. The appellant made an application for permission to appeal on the basis
    that the judge misdirected herself and failed to apply the principle of
    procedural fairness to grant the appellant 60 days  after  the  Tier  4
    (General) Student  Migrant  sponsorship  licence  of  the  college  was
    revoked on 3 June 2014.  The sponsor's name was on the Home Office list
    on 19 May 2014 when the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier
    4 student in the UK.  There was an error on  the  facts  further  to  R
    (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 902 and the  error  effectively  undermined  the
    reasoning relied upon  which was an  error of law.

 8. The appellant must be given  fair  notice  of  the  withdrawal  of  the
    sponsorship licence and the evidence was considered in  isolation  when
    it should be assessed in the round.  The  appellant  had  suffered  not
    because of her mistake but because the college confirmed  their  status
    as an existing Tier 4 Sponsor.

 9. The respondent did not argue that the college was not on the list on 19
    May 2014 when the sponsorship issued the appellant's CAS  letter.   The
    relevant date was 19 May 2014 not 3 June 2014.  The judge had failed to
    apply the law properly and materially  and  erred  to  interpreter  the
    evidence contrary to the judgments such as Gudi (Sudan) 2012  UKUT  41.
    It was arguable that the judge had  taken  too  harsh  a  view  of  the
    appellant's evidence and she failed to take  into  account  the  letter
    from Md Jalal Uddin of Lea Valley  Immigration  Services  Limited  that
    "They had checked the Tier 4 Sponsor Register of the appellant  college
    which appeared on the list".

10. In effect the judge did not take into account the relevant facts.

11. At the hearing Mr Pennington-Benton submitted that there was  no  exact
    date as to the restoration of the college's licence and he  would  have
    expected to have seen in the refusal letter a query over the submission
    made by the solicitors as to the restoration of the college to the list
    as a sponsor.  He accepted that the CAS was not  resurrected  but  then
    stated that some other remedial steps should have been  taken  to  find
    out what was going on.  He stated that the  facts  of  this  case  were
    different from those in EK (Ivory Coast) [2014] EWCA  Civ  1517  as  in
    this case the college had been restored to  the  role  and  there  were
    principles of fairness. In this case there was only one college not two
    colleges as in the case of the EK (Ivory Coast).  Here there  was  only
    one CAS number.  He pointed out that at paragraph  14  of  the  refusal
    letter the representatives  for  the  Home  Office  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing did not  challenge  the  fact  that  the  college  was
    restored to the licensing list.  In this case the  Secretary  of  State
    was "playing around with the sponsorship licence  and  the  curtailment
    should never  have  been   made".   He  was  not  submitting  that  the
    Secretary of State's  had  behaved  conspicuously  unfairly  but  there
    should have been some investigation into the matter.

12. Secondly, he submitted that the judge had not dealt with  the  evidence
    and he  referred  me  to  paragraph  16  and  noted  that  it  was  the
    appellant's case that in line with the letter  of  20  March  2014  the
    appellant had looked  at  the  list  of  licensed  Tier  4  educational
    sponsors and seen that her college had been reinstated.

13. Mr  Tufan  submitted  that  the  conclusions  of  the  judge  were  not
    irrational and there was nothing unreasonable set out.  He stated  that
    even if one assumed for a moment that the college had become  relisted,
    a CAS cannot be resurrected as it is no longer  valid.   The  case  was
    simply that the appellant needed to get a new CAS.

14. In conclusion, I am not persuaded that there is an error of law in this
    decision.  The appellant was notified by the Home Office  on  20  March
    2014 that the CAS she had submitted with  her  outstanding  application
    was no longer valid.  She was warned that her application would fall to
    be refused and yet she  failed  to  present  any  new  CAS.   From  the
    documents it is clear that the CAS is dated 27 February 2014 and it has
    a CAS number.  That CAS number was set out in the letter  of  20  March
    2014 from the Secretary of State to have been invalidated.   I  do  not
    accept the submission by Mr Pennington-Benton to the  effect  that  the
    Home Office was "playing around with the sponsorship licensing".  There
    was no evidence that this college had been reinstated to the  list  and
    the point made by Mr Tufan is correct that the particular CAS submitted
    by the appellant was itself invalid at the date of decision (and indeed
    clearly by 20th March 2014).   The  judge  set  out  her  reasoning  at
    paragraphs 15 and 16 and in particular at [16] stated the following:

         "I have  considered  the  evidence  and  the  submissions  by  both
         parties.  On the basis of evidence, such as is before me:  (1)  the
         appellant had her legal advisors in place right from the start  (2)
         The Home Office had made the appellant aware as early as  20  March
         2014 that they had made a decision to revoke  the  college  licence
         and  provided  her  with  their  letter,  information  leaflet  and
         certified copy of her passport and invited her to view the list  of
         licensed Tier 4 educational sponsors (3) There is  no  evidence  of
         the appellant having spoken to the college or that they had advised
         her to reapply using the same CAS but  there  is  no  corroborative
         evidence (4) There is also no evidence as to her efforts if any, to
         find another sponsor between 20/3/2014 and her  repeat  application
         on 19/05/2014 (5) There is no evidence other than a letter from  Md
         Jalal Uddin of Lea Valley Immigration Services  Limited  that  they
         have checked the Tier 4  Sponsor  Register  and  that  her  college
         appears on that list (6) It has  been   stated  on  behalf  of  the
         appellant that she did make enquiry with the Bradford  College  but
         again  there is no evidence of that or what other colleges she  has
         approached since then."

15. The Home Office had given the  appellant more than adequate warning  to
    obtain a new CAS.  I can see that a solicitor's letter  from  Md  Jalal
    Uddin  was  taken  into  account  by  the  judge  in  relation  to  the
    restoration of the college to the sponsor  register  and  she  rejected
    this on the basis that it was insufficient.

16. EK (Ivory Coast) makes it very clear at paragraph 29 as follows:

         "As Sullivan LJ observed in Alam, it is an inherent feature of  the
         PBS that it "puts a premium on predictability and certainty at  the
         expense of discretion" (para. [35]). Later, at para. [45], he said:



             "... I endorse the view expressed by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
             Shahzad [Shahzad (s 85A: commencement) [2012]  UKUT  81  (IAC]
             (paragraph 49) that there is no unfairness in the  requirement
             in the PBS that an applicant must submit with his  application
             all of the evidence necessary to demonstrate  compliance  with
             the rule under which he seeks leave.  The  Immigration  Rules,
             the Policy Guidance and the prescribed  application  form  all
             make it clear that the prescribed documents must be  submitted
             with the application, and if they are not the application will
             be  rejected.  The   price   of   securing   consistency   and
             predictability is a lack of flexibility that may  well  result
             in "hard" decisions in individual cases, but  that  is  not  a
             justification for imposing an obligation on the  Secretary  of
             State to conduct a preliminary check of  all  applications  to
             see whether they are  accompanied  by  all  of  the  specified
             documents, to contact applicants where this is not  the  case,
             and  to  give  them  an  opportunity  to  supply  the  missing
             documents. Imposing such an obligation  would  not  only  have
             significant resource implications, it would  also  extend  the
             time taken by the decision making  process,  contrary  to  the
             policy underlying the introduction of the PBS."

17. I am not persuaded that there was any error on the facts further  to  R
    (Iran) [2005]. There no evidence from either party as to the  date  the
    college was removed but there was certainly no  firm  evidence  of  any
    reinstatement.  There was evdience that the CAS which  accompanied  the
    application was considered  by  the  respondent  to  be  invalid.   The
    appellant was warned  that  this  college  would  be  removed  and  the
    argument is an attempt to shift the burden to validate the CAS onto the
    Home Office when it had very clearly set out  that  it  was  no  longer
    valid.  I do not accept  that  the  principle  in  Goudey  assists  the
    appellant or that the rules of procedural fairness have been  breached.
    The appellant does not  need  to  be  warned  again  when  the  college
    actually loses its licence.   She had  already  been  warned  that  the
    licence was due to be removed and that her CAS was invalid.  There  may
    have only been only one college involved in this instance compared with
    EK (Ivory Coast) but the approach by the respondent does not reveal any
    unfairness. The appellant was warned, however, that the college licence
    was to be removed and further told on 20th  March  2014  that  the  CAS
    presented was invalid.  As at the date of decision the appellant  could
    not comply with the Immigration Rules.  The appellant was warned  in  a
    letter of 20th March 2014 that the CAS, presented with her application,
    was invalid and her application was suspended for 60 days.   There  was
    no firm evidence with regards the erroneous advice from the college and
    the letter from the solicitors did not and  does  not  now  assist  the
    appellant.

18. In the letter of 20th March 2014 the respondent clearly stated

         '... if you fail to submit a new,  valid  CAS  togtether  with  the
         required supporting documentation within this 60  day  period  then
         your application will be considered on the basis of the information
         currently available and will therefore fall to be refused'.

19. The appellant made  no  attempt  to  seek  a  further  valid  CAS.  The
    appellant chose to act, not on the warning of the  respondent,  but  on
    the advice of the college that she could continue to use an invalidated
    CAS. This is not a case in which the Secretary of State was  proceeding
    on the basis of ignorance of whether there  was  a  withdrawal  or  the
    reason of the withdrawal of the CAS.  The Secretary of State had  spelt
    out to the appellant that the CAS had been invalidated.  Put simply the
    appellant failed to submit a valid CAS with her application.

Notice of Decision

20. I therefore find that there is no error of law and the  decision  shall
    stand.
