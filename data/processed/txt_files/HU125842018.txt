Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Sharma, Counsel instructed by Capital
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in the appeal before us is the Secretary of State for the
    Home Department ("SSHD") and  the  respondent  to  this  appeal  is  Mr
    Chowdhury.  However, for ease of  reference,  in  the  course  of  this
    decision we adopt the parties' status as it was  before  the  FtT.   We
    refer to Mr Chowdhury as the appellant, and the Secretary of  State  as
    the respondent.


 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh. He appears to have entered
    the United Kingdom on 20th August 2005 with a work permit valid until
    16th August 2006. He remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully when his
    leave to enter came to an end. On 18th November 2016 he was encountered
    working illegally, and on 24th November 2016, he made a claim for leave
    to remain based on the family life that he has established with his
    partner, [HB].


 3. The appellant's claim for leave to remain on human rights grounds was
    refused by the respondent for the reasons set out in a decision dated
    25th May 2018. In that decision, the respondent had regard to the
    evidence relied upon by the appellant and considered his claim, first
    by reference to the requirements set out in Appendix FM and paragraph
    276ADE of the immigration rules. The respondent concluded that the
    applicant is unable to meet the requirements of the immigration rules.
    The respondent then concluded that there are no exceptional
    circumstances that would render a refusal of leave to remain, a breach
    of Article 8.


 4. The respondent's decision gave rise to a right of appeal and the
    appellant's appeal was heard in the First-tier Tribunal by Judge
    Trevaskis on 17th October 2018. The appeal was allowed on human rights
    grounds for the reasons set out in a decision promulgated on 25th
    October 2018.


 5. We pause to note at this juncture, that in his decision of 25th May
    2018, the respondent accepted that the claim made by the appellant does
    not fall for refusal on grounds of suitability, and accepted that the
    appellant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2 - 1.12 of
    Appendix FM, that is, the relationship requirement.  The respondent did
    not accept that the appellant meets the immigration status requirements
    set out at paragraphs E-LTRP.2.1 to 2.2 because the appellant has
    remained in the UK in breach of immigration laws.


 6. The respondent considered whether the appellant could benefit from the
    exceptions to certain eligibility requirements for leave to remain as a
    partner, set out in section EX of Appendix FM.  The relevant exception
    here, is set out in section EX.1(b) and applies if the applicant has a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and
    is a British Citizen, settled in the UK, and there are insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.
    The respondent considered the appellant's relationship with his partner
    [HB], and rejected his claim that there are insurmountable obstacles to
    the appellant's family life with his partner continuing outside the UK,
    in Bangladesh.


 7. The decision of the respondent expresses no view on whether the
    financial requirements referred to in paragraph E-LTRP.3.1 are met by
    the appellant. The rules require the appellant to provide specified
    evidence from the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of a gross
    annual income of at least �18,600.  In the absence of a concession by
    the respondent that the requirement is met, it cannot be assumed that
    the requirement is met. The decision is also silent as to whether the
    English language requirement referred to at paragraph E-LTRP.4.1, is
    met. Paragraph E-LTRP.4.1 also requires that "... If the applicant has
    not met the requirements in a previous application for entry clearance
    or leave to remain as a partner or parent, the applicant must provide
    specified evidence that they ... passed an English language test in
    speaking and listening at a minimum of level A1 of the Common European
    Framework of Reference for languages with a provider approved by the
    Secretary of State".  The appellant has been in the UK unlawfully since
    August 2006, and he has not met that English language requirement in a
    previous application for entry clearance or leave to remain as a
    partner.


The decision of Judge Trevaskis


 8. The Judge heard evidence from the appellant and his sponsor. The
    findings and conclusions of the Judge are set out at paragraphs [28] to
    [52] of his decision.  At paragraph [28] of the decision, the Judge
    states that he begins "... by considering whether or not the appellant
    meets the requirements of the immigration rules because they reflect
    the respondent's view on proportionality..." and "... therefore, form
    an important part of the assessment of proportionality". At paragraph
    [29] of his decision, the Judge states:


         "The appellant satisfies the suitability requirements, relationship
         requirements, financial requirements, accommodation requirements
         and English language requirements of Appendix FM. These findings
         are based either upon concessions by the respondent, or on the
         basis of evidence which has now been provided by the appellant."


 9. The Judge therefore proceeds upon the premise that all the eligibility
    requirements set out in Appendix FM, save for the immigration status
    requirement, are met by the appellant. The Judge records, at [30], as
    follows:


         "With regard to the immigration status requirement of Appendix FM,
         his inability to meet that requirement will not prevent him from
         meeting the rule, if he is able to satisfy EX.1(b). If the
         appellant these (sic) in a genuine and subsisting relationship with
         the sponsor, and there are insurmountable obstacles to their family
         life continuing outside the United Kingdom, then that requirement
         will be satisfied."


10. For the reasons set out at paragraphs [35] to [37] of his decision, the
    FtT Judge found that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the
    continuation of the appellant's relationship with his partner, outside
    the UK. The Judge noted, at [37], that the reality of the situation is
    that the sponsor will not accompany the appellant to Bangladesh, "...
    but he will instead make an application for entry clearance to return
    to re-join her in the United Kingdom ...".  The Judge refers to a
    potential difficulty that he perceives the appellant may face in
    satisfying the requirements for entry clearance. The Judge states
    "...he will face difficulty in regard to his immigration history, and
    in particular his overstaying since the expiry of his work permit. He
    will only be able to circumvent that difficulty if he can show
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Bangladesh. I
    conclude that his entry clearance application will not be bound to
    succeed.".  We will return to those observations made by the Judge,
    later in this decision.


11. At paragraph [38] of his decision, the Judge addressed the private life
    claim and concluded as follows:


         "... He was born in Bangladesh and lived there until he was 23
         years old, when he came to the United Kingdom; he has never
         suggested that his decision to leave Bangladesh was for any reason
         other than economic benefit; he is socially and culturally
         integrated in that country, and no evidence has been provided which
         leads me to believe that he would not be able to integrate in that
         society if he returned there."


12. The Judge concluded at paragraph [39] that he is not satisfied to the
    required standard, that the appellant meets the requirements of the
    immigration rules for the grant of further leave to remain based upon
    his family or private life. At paragraphs [40] to [51] of his decision,
    the Judge addressed the Article 8 claim outside the rules by reference
    to the five stage approach referred to by the House of Lords in Razgar
    -v- SSHD [2004] UKHL 27, and adopting the "balance sheet" approach
    identifying the matters that weigh in favour of, and against the
    appellant in the assessment of proportionality.  For the reasons
    identified at paragraphs [50] and [51] of the decision, the Judge found
    at paragraph [52], that the respondent's decision amounts to a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to enjoyment
    of family and private life in the UK.


The appeal before us


13. The respondent advances several grounds of appeal, some of which are
    incoherent. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Melvin readily accepted
    that the grounds could have been better drafted, but in essence the
    respondent claims that having referred to the decision of the Supreme
    Court in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC 11, the Judge irrationally
    concluded that the interference with the appellant's family life would
    be disproportionate, without identifying any exceptional circumstances
    capable of justifying that conclusion.  Mr Melvyn maintains that the
    decision that the appellant is able to meet the minimum income
    requirement, is unfounded. Permission to appeal was granted in the
    First-tier Tribunal FtT Judge Simpson on 19th November 2018, and the
    matter comes before us on appeal.


14. There is a the Rule 24 response on behalf of the appellant.


15. The respondent claims that the Judge failed to provide adequate reasons
    for his conclusion that the appellant satisfies the financial
    requirement set out in paragraph E-LTRP.3.1. The rules require the
    appellant to provide specified evidence from the sources listed, of a
    specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.  At paragraph [8] of
    the decision, the Judge records the evidence of the appellant that he
    had not worked for very long but admitted that he was working when he
    was encountered. His evidence was that he was supported by his uncle,
    aunt and friends, and since 2014, by his wife.  The evidence before the
    Tribunal was that the sponsor's income is limited to �10,800 per year,
    and the Judge refers to the evidence of that income, at paragraph [21]
    of the decision.


16. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Sharma referred to paragraph 5 of the
    Rule 24 response and submits that the evidence before the First-tier
    Tribunal in the form of bank statements and payslips demonstrated that
    the appellant's wife had a combined income of �21,177.84.   However, he
    accepts that her income fluctuates, and that the P60s issued to her in
    respect of the tax year to 5th April 2018 disclosed a combined income
    of �10,843.  He submits that the P60s do not reflect the level of
    income that the appellant's partner had, at the time the appeal was
    heard. He accepts that the requirements for leave to remain as a
    partner set out in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE could not be met by
    the appellant, and the appellant was bound to rely upon the exception
    set out in EX.1(b) of Appendix FM.


17. Having considered the evidence for ourselves, we are at a loss as to
    how the Judge was able to conclude that the financial requirement set
    out in Appendix FM was met.  We are also at a loss to understand how
    the Judge reached a conclusion that the English language requirement
    was met. The respondent had not conceded that those requirements were
    met, and the Judge simply failed to provide any reasons to support his
    conclusion, which in any event could not, so far as we can see, have
    been founded on the evidence before him.


18. The respondent claims that in reaching his decision, the Judge had
    regard to immaterial matters such as whether the appellant might
    succeed in an application for entry clearance. At paragraphs [37] and
    [51], he refers to the perceived difficulties that the applicant may
    face, if he were to make an application for entry clearance to return
    to the UK as the partner of a British citizen. At paragraph [51] of his
    decision, the FtT Judge states that an application for entry clearance
    by the appellant "... is not virtually certain to succeed", whatever
    that means, but he was satisfied that the appellant is able to meet
    most of the requirements, and the area in which the appellant is likely
    to face difficulty, concerns his immigration history.  Quite apart from
    the fact that the appellant would, on the evidence that was before the
    Judge, be unable to satisfy other requirements set out in Appendix FM,
    it was in our judgment, irrational for the Judge to have in mind a
    perceived difficulty with an application for entry clearance arising
    from the appellant's immigration history. Although in Appendix FM,
    there is an immigration status requirement to be met in support of an
    application for leave to remain as a partner, there is no such
    requirement for entry clearance as a partner.


19. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Sharma submits that the perceived
    difficulty that the Judge had in mind stems not from the requirements
    set out in Appendix FM, but from paragraph 320(11) of the immigration
    rules.  He submits that it is not uncommon for an application for entry
    clearance to be refused under that provision.  The difficulty with that
    submission is twofold.  First, the Judge made no reference to paragraph
    320(11), and his language bears no resemblance to what paragraph
    320(11) requires.  Second, paragraph 320(11) is a discretionary ground
    for refusal, and before an Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO") could refuse
    an application on that ground, a number of pre-requisites must be met.
    The ECO would have to be satisfied that the appellant has contrived in
    a significant way to restrict the intentions of the rules by
    overstaying, breaching any condition attached to his leave, being an
    illegal entrant or using deception in an application for entry
    clearance, or leave to enter or remain. Furthermore, the ECO would have
    to be satisfied that "there are other aggravating circumstances, such
    as absconding, not meeting temporary admission/ reporting restrictions
    or bail conditions, using an assumed identity or multiple identities,
    switching nationality, making frivolous application or not complying
    with the documentation process."  If, as Mr Sharma submits, the Judge
    had in mind paragraph 320(11) of the immigration rules, there was
    simply no evidence before the Judge that could rationally have led to a
    conclusion that an application for entry clearance was not bound to
    succeed, under paragraph 320(11) of the rules.


20. The focus of Mr Melvin's submissions before us was that the conclusion
    of the Judge that the decision to refuse leave to remain amounts to a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to enjoyment
    of family and private life in the UK, is irrational, in view of the
    other findings made by the Judge.


21. The only ground of appeal available to the appellant was that the
    respondent's decision is unlawful under s6 of the Human Rights Act
    1998. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC
    11 confirms that the fact that the immigration rules cannot be met,
    does not absolve decision makers from carrying out a full merits-based
    assessment outside the rules under Article 8, where the ultimate issue
    is whether a fair balance has been struck between the individual and
    public interest, giving due weight to the provisions of the Rules.
    Although the appellant's ability to satisfy the immigration rules was
    not the question to be determined by the Judge, it was capable of being
    a weighty, though not determinative factor, when deciding whether
    refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration
    control.  At paragraph [32] of the decision, the FtT Judge refers to
    the decision of the Supreme Court and in the final sentence, notes; "In
    general, in cases concerned with precarious family life, a very strong
    or compelling claim is required to outweigh the public interest in
    immigration control".


22. Mr Sharma concedes before us that the appellant could not satisfy the
    requirements of Appendix FM unless there was a finding by the Judge
    that the applicant can benefit from the exception at paragraph EX.1(b).
     The Judge found that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the
    continuation of family life between the appellant and his partner,
    outside the UK.  Mr Sharma accepts that in light of that finding made
    by the Judge, it follows that the requirements of the immigration rules
    cannot be met by the appellant.  The Judge noted that he is required to
    attach little weight to the family or private life acquired by the
    appellant while his status in the United Kingdom was precarious or
    unlawful.  The Judge identified, at [47], four factors that weighed in
    favour of a decision that any interference was proportionate, and at
    paragraph [48], he identified two factors that weighed against a
    decision that the interference was proportionate.


23. The Judge referred to the public interest at paragraph [49].  He stated
    that "the appellant and sponsor will be financially self-sufficient if
    the appellant is allowed to work".  The Judge also, erroneously, notes
    that "the appellant has passed an English language test".  It is not
    clear what weight the Judge placed upon those factors, but it is now
    well established that those factors are at their highest, neutral.


24. The Judge noted, at [50], that the appellant's partner is undergoing
    medical treatment. The Judge stated:


         ".. even if such treatment would be available to her in Bangladesh,
         the suspension of such treatment while she sought re-establish
         herself in the country which she left many years ago would be
         likely to have a detrimental effect on her health..."


25. There is no reference to the medical treatment that the Judge had in
    mind, or the treatment that she would require in Bangladesh. The Judge
    does not identify the extent to which any required treatment would have
    to be suspended, and how that would be detrimental to the health of the
    appellant's partner.


26. Mr Sharma refers to the medical evidence that is to be found at pages
    [278] to [302] the appellant's bundle. There is evidence of the
    appellant's partner having been referred by her GP to the
    Gastroenterology team at the Dorset County Hospital and of appointments
    sent to the appellant to attend for further investigation. There is at
    page [295] of the bundle, an undated letter to the appellant from her
    GP informing her that recent blood tests showed that she could be at a
    higher risk of developing type two diabetes. The letter informs the
    appellant's partner of a program called "Healthier You" that will
    provide her with the tools to make small but significant changes to not
    only reduce or reverse the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but also
    other conditions such as heart disease and stroke. The most up-to-date
    information available appears to be set out in a letter from a
    Consultant Nurse at the Dorset County Hospital Department of
    Gastroenterology, following Mrs [B]'s attendance on 29th August 2018.
    Overall, it appears that blood tests taken at the end of July show that
    she is hepatitis D and HIV negative, with normal liver function. The
    blood tests show a slightly raised hepatitis B viral load, but the
    Consultant Nurse states "... As her liver function is normal I am not
    overly concerned about this result. We should, however, continue three
    monthly bloods as planned at her last appointment...". That letter also
    states "... She will be 40 in October and from then onwards we should
    offer her six monthly ultrasound scans and alphafetoprotein for primary
    liver cancer surveillance...".  We are unable to identify anything in
    that evidence to support the conclusion that the suspension of any
    treatment being received whilst Mrs [B] sought to re-establish herself
    in Bangladesh, would have a detrimental effect on her health. There was
    no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal as to the availability of
    treatment in Bangladesh.


27. It appears therefore that beyond the fact that the appellant is married
    to a British citizen, and the length of the appellant's residence in
    the UK, the Judge fails to rationally identify any exceptional
    circumstances that establish that the refusal of leave to remain will
    constitute a violation of Article 8.


28. Having carefully considered the Judge's decision and the evidence that
    was before the Tribunal, we are satisfied that the Judge fails to
    rationally identify the very strong or compelling circumstances that
    lead to the conclusion that the respondent's decision amounts to a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to enjoyment
    of family and private life in the UK.


29. It follows that in our judgment, the decision of the Judge is infected
    by error of law.  It cannot stand and we set it aside.


Re-making the decision


30. Directions were issued to the parties in advance of the hearing  before
    us, reminding the parties that the Tribunal is empowered to permit  new
    or further evidence to be admitted in the remaking of a decision,  and,
    in any case where this facility is sought, the parties must comply with
    Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.   No
    such application has been made by the appellant  and  we  declined  the
    oral application made by Mr  Sharma  to  adduce  further  evidence.  No
    further witness statement has  been  made  by  the  appellant  and  his
    partner, and there is no updated medical evidence regarding  Mrs  [B]'s
    health.  We have  been  provided  with  no  explanation,  let  alone  a
    satisfactory explanation, as  to  why  any  new  evidence  could,  with
    reasonable diligence, not have been made available  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the initial  appeal,  and  why  no  application  to  adduce
    evidence in accordance with the Tribunal Rules, has  been  made.  There
    has been no Notice sent to the Tribunal and served upon the respondent,
    as required by the directions issued to  the  parties,  indicating  the
    nature of the evidence that the appellant wishes  to  reply  upon.  The
    parties were on notice of the presumption that, in  the  event  of  the
    Tribunal deciding that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is to be
    set aside as erroneous in law, the remaking of the decision  will  take
    place at the same hearing.


31. The only ground of appeal  available  to  the  appellant  is  that  the
    respondent's decision is unlawful under s 6 of  the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998.  As to the Article 8 claim, the  burden  of  proof  is  upon  the
    appellant to show,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  he  has
    established a family life with his wife, and that  his  exclusion  from
    the UK as a result of the respondent's decision, would  interfere  with
    that right. It is then for the respondent to justify  any  interference
    caused. The respondent's decision must be in accordance  with  the  law
    and must be a proportionate response in all the circumstances.


32. The  respondent  accepts  that  the  appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his partner, who is a British Citizen.  We
    find that the appellant enjoys family life with his  partner.  We  also
    find that the decision to refuse the appellant  leave  to  remain,  may
    have consequences of such gravity as to engage the operation of Article
    8, and we accept that the interference is in accordance with  the  law,
    and that the interference is necessary to protect  the  economic  well-
    being of the country.


33. The issue in this  appeal,  as  is  often  the  case,  is  whether  the
    interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved.  As we have said in our error of law decision, the ability to
    satisfy the immigration rules is not the question to be  determined  by
    the  Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of  being  a  weighty,   though   not
    determinative  factor,  when   deciding   whether   such   refusal   is
    proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.


34. Mr Sharma submits that there are here, a number of exceptional
    circumstances such that the removal of the appellant from the UK would
    be disproportionate.  He refers to the 'proximity' of the appellant's
    ability to meet the requirements of the rules, the length of his
    residence in the UK, and more importantly, the length of his wife's
    residence in the UK.  He submits that the refusal of leave to remain
    impacts upon the ability of the appellant's wife to exercise her rights
    as a British Citizen in the UK, where she has spent the formative years
    of her life. He also submits that any separation whilst the appellant
    makes an application for entry clearance, or requiring the appellant
    and his wife to live together in Bangladesh, is likely to have an
    adverse impact upon the physical and mental health of the appellant's
    partner.


35. We have carefully considered the evidence before us.  In his witness
    statement dated 4th October 2018, the appellant confirms that he came
    to work in the UK as the economic and political situation in Bangladesh
    was not good and many people were going abroad to look for work and
    provide for their families. He accepts that it was wrong for him to
    remain in the UK after his visa expired, but claims that he did so,
    because he felt there was no future for him in Bangladesh.  He claims
    that he had been involved in politics in Bangladesh, and the opposition
    were always filing false claims against him.  There is no information
    as to the harassment that the appellant claims that he was subjected
    to, or of the false cases that he claims were filed against him, and
    this is not an appeal against the refusal of a protection claim.


36. He describes his relationship with his wife and confirms that she was
    aware of his immigration status throughout.  Nevertheless, they married
    according to Islamic law on 9th March 2015 and they then began living
    together. They registered the marriage according to English Civil law
    on 14th August 2017. In his statement, the appellant states that he no
    longer has any close family in Bangladesh as his father, grandmother
    and stepbrother have sadly passed away since his arrival in the UK. His
    relationship with his stepmother is not a good one, and he has not
    spoken to his biological mother for a number of years. He has a brother
    in Bangladesh who is settled with his own family and has his own
    commitments.  The appellant claims that he does not have a job or
    business and would have nowhere to live, as they have no assets or
    property in Bangladesh.


37. In her witness statement, Mrs [HB] confirms the background to her
    relationship with the appellant.  She too confirms she was made aware
    of the appellant's immigration status from the outset. She sets out her
    evidence regarding the breakdown of her previous relationship, and the
    breakdown of her relationship with her own family.  She describes the
    attempts she has made to rekindle her relationship with her mother,
    following the death of her father. She describes her mother as being
    completely bedbound, and needing assistance with day-to-day activities.
    She wishes to remain in the UK so that she can be there for her mother,
    and make up for the time that they lost when they did not communicate.


38. Mrs [B] confirms that they want to have a child, but she has been
    diagnosed with Hepatitis B for which she is receiving treatment. She
    claims it would be extremely difficult for her to return to Bangladesh
    and settle there because she has not lived in Bangladesh since she was
    a child. She does not have any family or personal connections with
    Bangladesh. Although she speaks Bengali, she cannot read or write the
    language and she has never previously worked in Bangladesh. She
    confirms that she has spent all of her formative, teenage, and adult
    years in the UK. She claims that her income is sufficient to meet the
    minimum income requirement, and it would be unfair and unjust to
    separate her from the appellant, just so that he can go back to
    Bangladesh to apply for entry clearance.


39. Whether described as the 'proximity' of the appellant's ability to meet
    the requirements, or a 'near miss', it is uncontroversial that the
    appellant cannot satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules.


40. We remind ourselves that section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 requires that in considering the public interest
    question, we must (in particular) have regard to the considerations
    listed in section 117B of the 2002 Act.  We acknowledge that the
    maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.


41. It is now well established that limited weight is generally attached to
    family life established in the full knowledge that its continuation in
    the UK is precarious. It is equally well established that Article 8 is
    not intended to undermine the ability of member states to control the
    entry of non-nationals into their territory, by enabling non-nationals
    to evade immigration control by establishing a family life whilst
    present in the UK unlawfully, and then presenting the respondent with a
    fait accompli. The authorities establish that the removal of a non-
    national family member is incompatible with Article 8 only in
    exceptional circumstances.


42. In our search for the exceptional circumstances here, we have already
    set out at paragraph [26] above, the evidence before us regarding the
    health of Mrs [B] and the limited evidence that is before the Tribunal
    regarding the treatment that she has received.  There is no evidence
    before us regarding the medical treatment that is now being received by
    Mrs [B].  She has previously been under review by the Dorset County
    Hospital Department of Gastroenterology, and although blood tests
    revealed a slightly raised Hepatitis B level, because of the normal
    liver function, it seems that the slightly raised Hepatitis B level,
    was of no significant concern.  Subsequent blood tests confirmed that
    Mrs [B] is suffering from chronic Hepatitis B.    She was referred to
    Gynaecology Services for specialist advice regarding her failure to
    become pregnant.  There is no evidence before us that any follow-up or
    treatment that is required by Mrs [B], would not be available in
    Bangladesh.


43. The appellant has not sought to challenge the finding of the Judge that
    there are no insurmountable obstacles to the continuation of family
    life between the appellant and his partner, outside the UK.  Equally
    the appellant has not sought to challenge the finding of the Judge that
    there are no very significant obstacles to the appellant's integration
    into Bangladesh. In reaching those findings, the Judge had considered
    the connections that the appellant and his wife have with Bangladesh,
    their respective age when they came to the UK, and their social and
    cultural connections to Bangladesh. The Judge also had in mind the
    evidence given by Mrs [B] regarding the breakdown of her previous
    marriage, and her evidence regarding her relationship with her sister
    in Bangladesh, and the contact that she now has with her mother by
    visits and by telephone.


44. Whilst the appellant and his wife might prefer to continue their
    married life together in the UK, that does not equate to a right to do
    so in law.  We accept that Mrs [B] is a British citizen and we can well
    understand her desire to remain in the UK.  However, she entered into a
    relationship and marriage with the appellant, knowing of his
    immigration status and must therefore have known that it may not be
    possible for them to continue living together in the UK.  She must have
    been aware of the possibility that they would have to continue their
    married life together in Bangladesh, or that they would face a period
    of separation if the appellant were not permitted to remain in the UK,
    and had to return to Bangladesh to make an application for entry
    clearance.  It is of course open to Mrs [B] to join her husband in
    Bangladesh, whilst any application for entry clearance is made.  We
    note the appellant's evidence is that his wife had returned to
    Bangladesh once, to attend the funeral of the appellant's father, and
    stayed for a month.  We reject the claim that the appellant and Mrs [B]
    have no family connections to Bangladesh.  The appellant has his
    stepmother and a brother, and Mrs [B] has a sister in Bangladesh.  They
    could in our judgement, turn to their family for some short-term
    support whilst they re-establish themselves in Bangladesh, or whilst
    the appropriate application for entry clearance is made by the
    appellant.


45. On the evidence before us, and considering the unchallenged findings
    made by the FtT Judge, in our judgment there are no exceptional
    circumstances capable of establishing that the removal of the appellant
    amounts to a disproportionate interference with the appellant's right
    to enjoyment of family and private life in the UK.


46. Having carefully considered the evidence before us, and taking all the
    relevant factors into account including those in S117B of the 2002 Act,
    we find that the decision to refuse the application for leave to remain
    is not disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.
    Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


47. Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, we remake the
    decision, dismissing the appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.


Signed                                  Date          19th July 2019
