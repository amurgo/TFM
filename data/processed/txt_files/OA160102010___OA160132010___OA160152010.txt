                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER-ISTANBUL

                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. On 25 October 2012 I gave the following directions:





                   "DIRECTIONS

       1.   The appellants have been granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
          Upper Tribunal against a decision of Immigration Judge Kelsey who,
          by a determination promulgated  on  4  July  2011,  dismissed  the
          appellants' appeals against decisions to  refuse  to  grant  entry
          clearance.


       2.   The Upper Tribunal has received a letter  from  the  appellants'
          legal representatives dated 19 October 2012 in  which  they  write
          that "We are instructed that the Appellants in this case  wish  to
          withdraw their appeal."


       3.   Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
          provides that a party may give notice of  the  withdrawal  of  its
          case or any part of it,  subject  to  the  consent  of  the  Upper
          Tribunal. There is no provision for a party to withdraw the appeal
          before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Therefore,  the  letter  from   the
          appellants' legal representatives can serve only as  a  notice  of
          withdrawal of the appellants' case before the Upper  Tribunal,  to
          which the Upper Tribunal now consents.


       4.   Subject to  any  request  received  from  either  party  to  the
          contrary by 4.00  pm  on  8  November  2012,  the  Upper  Tribunal
          proposes to treat the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  as
          unchallenged so that the appeals before the Upper Tribunal will be
          dismissed without a hearing."


    2. No response has been received to those directions  and  accordingly,
       the  Upper  Tribunal  will  determine  the  appeals  in  the  manner
       indicated.

    3. The appeals before the Upper Tribunal are dismissed and the decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.





Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek
