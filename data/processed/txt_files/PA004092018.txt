                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran, born on  7  February  1983.   By  a
    decision promulgated on  29  May  2018,  Designated  FtT  Judge  Murray
    dismissed his appeal against the respondent's decision to deport him as
    a foreign criminal.

 2. The appellant petitioned the Court for reduction of the UT's refusal of
    permission to appeal.  On 4 December 2019, the Vice President of the UT
    granted permission in light of the  Court's  interlocutor  and  of  the
    joint minute between the parties.

 3. The joint minute was entered into in light of TF & MA [2018]  CSIH  58,
    published after the FtT made its decision.

 4. Mr Govan conceded that the reasoning of the  FtT  in  relation  to  the
    evidence of the "church witnesses" disclosed error, such that  a  fresh
    hearing was required.  The following outcome was agreed.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
