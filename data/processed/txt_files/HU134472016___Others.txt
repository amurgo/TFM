For the Appellants:    Miss D Ofei-Kwatia
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Kiss, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of Mauritius.  The first appellant  is  the
    husband of the second appellant, who are the parents of the  third  and
    fourth appellants.

2.   Their appeal against the refusal of the respondent to grant them  leave
    to remain under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and under  Article
    8 of the ECHR was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge E B Grant  for
    the reasons set out in her decision promulgated on 24 November 2017.

3.   The appellants were granted permission to appeal the  judge's  decision
    by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Storey  on  4  September  2018  in  the
    following terms:

         "Whilst it is clear from the judge's focus on  whether  removal  of
         the third appellant would be 'catastrophic' that she considered the
         guidance given in MA (Pakistan) and the observations  made  therein
         at [102] and whilst I would reject the contention  that  the  third
         appellant is entitled to succeed simply by virtue  of  having  more
         than 7 years residence and being  autistic  (clearly  autism  is  a
         spectrum disorder and any assessment of reasonableness must be fact-
         specific), it is arguable that the judge failed to  recognise  that
         the essential test was not whether removal  would  be  catastrophic
         but whether there were 'powerful  reasons'  why  a  child  in  this
         situation should be removed."

4.   On 17 October 2018 Ms  Kiss,  Senior  Presenting  Officer  and  at  the
    Specialist Appeal Team of the Home Office wrote to the  Upper  Tribunal
    informing the Upper Tribunal that careful consideration of the decision
    of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant's  decision  regarding  the  [P]
    family's Article 8  claim  did  reveal  a  material  error  of  law  as
    highlighted by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey in his notice of decision of
    4 September 2018.

5.   She added that the very particular cumulative current circumstances  of
    the two [P] children indeed indicated a lack of  powerful  reasons  for
    their removal; the Upper Tribunal was therefore respectfully invited to
    allow the Article 8 appeal of the [P] family  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

6.   In the light of the letter from Ms  Kiss,  I  found  that  the  judge's
    decision dismissing the appellants' appeals could not stand.  I set  it
    aside and remake the decision.

7.   For the reasons set out in Ms Kiss' letter, I allow the appeal  of  the
    [P] family under Article 8 of the ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
