                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hillis made following a hearing at Bradford on 17th February 2015.



Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  8th  July  1988.   He
    entered the UK with entry clearance as a  student  on  3rd  April  2011
    valid to 23rd June 2012. He submitted a further application  which  was
    refused.  However his appeal against that decision was allowed and,  on
    18th January 2014, his case was reconsidered.

 3. On 11th March 2014 he submitted an  application  as  the  spouse  of  a
    settled person which was rejected due to payment of  an  incorrect  fee
    and resubmitted on 2nd April 2014.

 4. The  claimant  was  refused  on  suitability  grounds  because  it  was
    considered that his English language test taken on 17th July  2012  had
    been obtained through deception and an anomaly with the  speaking  test
    indicated the presence of a proxy test taker.

 5. So far as his family life was concerned, his spouse did  not  meet  the
    definition of a partner, and  he  was  also  refused  on  private  life
    grounds.

 6. The Immigration Judge found that the claimant  was  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his spouse.  He also  concluded  that  the
    claimant took and passed the test on 17th July 2012 personally and that
    the Secretary of State's finding that he used deception was  unfounded.



 7. So far as the financial requirements of the  Rules  were  concerned  he
    said that the  couple  earned  �13,533  which  was  below  the  minimum
    requirement of �18,600.

 8. He then concluded as follows:-

         "Applying the relevant law to the established facts I find that the
         appellant has satisfied all the relevant requirements  of  Appendix
         FM.  He and his sponsor are currently in a genuine  and  subsisting
         marriage and intend to live permanently together  as  each  other's
         spouse.  I therefore find  that  the  decision  of  the  respondent
         appealed against  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  the
         applicable Immigration Rules."

 9. He also allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

The grounds of application

10. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had materially misdirected himself in law in finding that the
    requirements of Appendix FM were satisfied despite  also  finding  that
    the income threshold requirement was not met.  He also failed  to  give
    any reasons why the claimant could not return to Pakistan in  order  to
    apply for entry clearance.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge P J G White for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds.





Consideration of whether there is an error of law

12. At the hearing Mr Thornhill frankly conceded that this appeal could not
    stand.  First the  judge  contradicted  himself  in  finding  that  the
    requirements of Appendix FM were met when the couple could not meet the
    financial requirements, and made  no  findings  in  respect  of  EX(1).
    Second, there is no proper  analysis  of  the  relevant  facts  in  the
    judge's consideration of Article 8.

13. The decision is set aside.

14. Mr Thornhill submitted that the appeal ought nevertheless to be allowed
    because there were insurmountable obstacles as at the date  of  hearing
    to the claimant's spouse joining him in the UK.  Their  first  baby  is
    due imminently and no airline would take her.

Findings and Conclusions

15. Under Section R-LTRP.1.1 the requirements to be met for  limited  leave
    to remain as a partner are -

      a) The applicant and their partner must be in the UK;

      b) The applicant must have made a valid  application  for  limited  or
         indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either

    (c)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  Section  S/LTR
             suitability for leave to remain and

         (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-LTRP:
             eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or

    (d)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under  Sections  S/LTR
             suitability leave to remain; and

         (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraph  E-LTRP.1.2-
             2.12 and E-LTRP.2.1; and

         (iii)    EX.1 applies.

16. The judge found in the claimant's favour  so  far  as  the  suitability
    requirements are concerned and no challenge to his findings  have  been
    made by the  Secretary  of  State.   He  also  meets  the  relationship
    requirements set out in E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 since the judge has found  that
    he is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with his spouse.

17. He cannot meet the financial requirements and therefore  the  issue  is
    whether paragraph EX.1 applies.

18. This paragraph applies if -

    (a)   (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child who -

             (aa) is under the age of 18 years;

             (bb) is in the UK;

             (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK continuously
                  for at least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of
                  application; and

         (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
             UK; or

    (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

19. The claimant cannot meet the requirements of EX.1(a) because as at  the
    date of hearing he does not have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a child. His child is not yet born.

20. His wife is settled  in  the  UK  and  is  clearly  at  present  unable
    physically to take a flight to Pakistan because  she  is  very  heavily
    pregnant.  However EX.1(b) looks to the future in  that  it  refers  to
    family life continuing.  The situation in  principle  is  no  different
    than if she had an infectious illness which prevented her flying or  if
    there was an aeroplane strike or  indeed  a  myriad  of  other  reasons
    physical travel to Pakistan was momentarily not practicable.

21. The obstacle to her travelling is strictly temporary and therefore  not
    insurmountable.  The family life which she has enjoyed with her  spouse
    in the UK could continue outside the UK within a few weeks.   The  fact
    that, as at the date of hearing, she could not  physically  get  on  an
    aeroplane, does not mean that the requirements of EX.1(b) are met.

22. The application therefore cannot succeed under the Rules.

23. In R (on  the  application  of  Davindra  Sunassee)  v  Upper  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) v SSHD [2015]  EWHC  1604  Mr  Justice
    Edis said at para 36:

         "In SS (Congo)  the  Court  of  Appeal  restated  the  context  and
         considered the role of public policy as expressed in the  Rules  in
         the proportionality assessment.   This  is  at  the  heart  of  the
         present issue.  The law is as I have said that the  decision  maker
         is entitled to decide that Article 8 considerations have been fully
         addressed in the Rules when dealing with stage 2.  If they have  it
         is enough to  say  so.   This  will  necessarily  involve  deciding
         whether there is a gap between the Rules and  Article  8  and  then
         whether there are circumstances in  the  case  under  consideration
         which take it outside the class of cases which the  Rules  properly
         provide  for.   Whether  these  circumstances  are   described   as
         compelling or exceptional is not a matter of substance.  They  must
         be relevant, weighty and not fully provided for within  the  Rules.
         In practice they are likely to be both compelling  and  exceptional
         but this is not a legal requirement."

24. No submissions were made by Mr  Thornhill  to  suggest  that  any  such
    circumstances are present in this case.



Decision

25. The original judge erred in law.   His  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The appeal is dismissed.
