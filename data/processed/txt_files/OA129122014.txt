Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr Sinker counsel instructed by Andrew Jackson & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr G Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
   order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
   First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against
   a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes promulgated on  7  October
   2015 which allowed the Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  the
   Respondent to refuse the Appellants application for entry clearance as  a
   spouse under Appendix FM.
Background


3. The Appellant was born on [18  September  1989]  and  is  a  national  of
   Yemen.
4. On 3 June 2014 the Appellant applied for entry clearance  as  the  spouse
   of Wahib Ahmed ('the Sponsor').
5. On 12  August  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application on the basis that it was not accepted that the  marriage  was
   genuine and subsisting or that they had the intention  to  live  together
   permanently.
The Judge's Decision
6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Heynes ("the Judge") allowed the appeal  against  the  Respondent's
   decision.
7. The Judge's findings as part of the two page decision  consisted  of  two
   very short paragraphs which  stated  that  the  marriage  was  a  genuine
   relationship.
8. Grounds of appeal were  lodged  arguing  that  the  Judge  had  given  no
   reasons for his decision that  the  marriage  was  genuine  and  made  no
   finding as to whether the parties intended to live together  permanently.



9. On 5 February 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew  gave  permission  to
   appeal.

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Harrison  on  behalf  of  the
   Respondent that :

   a) The Judge failed to give any reasons for his decision so  it  was  not
      possible for the losing party to know why it had lost.

11. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Sinker conceded

   a) That the decision was very  short  and  accepted  that  there  was  no
      reference to an intention to live together permanently but  that  both
      refusal issues stood or fell together.




The Law

12.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
   authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons,  ignoring  material
   considerations by taking into account immaterial considerations, reaching
   irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or   giving   legally
   inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute
   errors of law.
13. In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641  (IAC),  it  was
   held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination disclosed clearly the
   reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal found oral evidence
   to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document to be worth  no
   weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in  the  determination  and
   for such findings to be supported by reasons. A  bare  statement  that  a
   witness was not believed or that a document was afforded  no  weight  was
   unlikely to satisfy the requirement to give reasons.

14. I also remind  myself  of  what  was  said  in  Shizad  (sufficiency  of
   reasons:  set  aside)  Afghanistan  [2013]  UKUT  85  (IAC)   about   the
   requirement for sufficient reasons to be given in a decision in  headnote
   (1) : "Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation of  the
   conclusions on the central issue on which an appeal is determined,  those
   reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole  makes  sense,
   having regard to the material accepted by the judge."

Finding on Material Error

15. Having heard those  submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made material errors of law.

16. I am satisfied that the Judge did not give inadequate  reasons  for  his
   decision he simply gave no reasons.  Even  'reading  the  decision  as  a
   whole' does not  reveal  why  he  reached  the  conclusion  that  he  did
   particularly given  that  he  noted  a  number  of  deficiencies  in  the
   documentary  evidence  provided  at  paragraphs  10-13,  while  he  heard
   evidence from the sponsor he reached no conclusions  about  the  sponsors
   credibility and also referred to Mr Sinkers skeleton argument but did not
   identify which parts of it persuaded him that the appeal should succeed.

17. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that  the
   Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set aside in its  entirety
   to be redetermined afresh.

Remaking the Decision
18. The burden of proof in this case is upon the Appellant and the  standard
   of proof is upon the balance of probability.
19.  I have determined this matter based upon facts that  were  appertaining
   at the time the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer being constrained
   by Section 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the
   2002 Act) I  am  entitled  to  take  into  account  evidence  of  matters
   occurring after the date of the decision providing that  they  relate  to
   and inform an understanding of facts in existence  at  the  time  of  the
   decision pursuant to DR (Morocco) [2005] UKIAT 00038.
20. The Appellant's appeal is pursuant to Section 82 of the 2002 Act.
21. The  Appellant's  Sponsor  gave  evidence  before  me  at  the  hearing.
         The Sponsor's evidence may be summarised: -
22. He adopted the contents of his  witness  statement.  He  confirmed  that
   since the date of the application, on 2 February 2016, he had purchased a
   house for him and his wife so that they could start a family.
23. He confirmed that they maintained contact through Viber and WhatsApp.
24. He stated that he sent money to his wife every month  from  his  account
   at the NatWest and he had provided the Respondent with copies of his bank
   statements.
25. He confirmed in cross examination that so far pursuing this  application
   had cost him ï¿½6000 in fees and solicitors  costs.  He  was  very  anxious
   about his wife living in a war zone.
26. He confirmed that he was a  mechanic  working  for  Liverpool  Community
   Transport where he had started as an apprentice but was now a manager.
27. His wife was his cousin and they had met before they  married  when  she
   came on a family visit.
28. He acknowledged that they had a limited number of photographs,  just  of
   their wedding, but this was for religious reasons.
29. He stated that the last time he  had  contact  with  his  wife  was  the
   morning of the hearing when they texted each other. They spoke every  day
   on the phone of the signal allowed.
Final Submissions
30. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Harrison relied  on  the  refusal  letter
   and the ECM review.
31. Mr Sinker on behalf of the Appellant relied on  his  skeleton  argument.
   He referred to the fact that in law they were clearly  married  as  there
   was no challenge to the marriage certificate.  There  were  a  number  of
   stamps in the Sponsors passport showing that  he  had  visited  with  the
   Appellant since their marriage. There was persuasive evidence of contact.
   He suggested that there had been a significant amount of money  spent  if
   this was simply a 'sham' marriage. He suggested  that  the  Sponsor  came
   across as credible and genuinely concerned about the safety of his  wife.
   His purchase of a house was part  of  the  continuing  process  of  their
   marital relationship. The marriage was genuine and they intended to  live
   together.

Findings

32. I am required to look at all the evidence in the round  before  reaching
   any findings.  I  have  done  so.   Although,  for  convenience,  I  have
   compartmentalised my findings in some respects below,  I  must  emphasise
   the findings have only been made having taken account of the evidence  as
   a whole.

33. In relation to the determining whether a relationship is subsisting  and
   the parties intend to live together permanently I remind myself  that  in
   Goudey (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041(IAC)  the
   Tribunal held that  GA  ("Subsisting"  marriage)  Ghana  *  [2006]  UKAIT
   00046  means that the  matrimonial  relationship  must  continue  at  the
   relevant time rather than just the formality of a marriage, but  it  does
   not require  the production of particular evidence  of   mutual  devotion
   before entry clearance can be granted; Evidence  of  telephone  cards  is
   capable of being corroborative of the contention of the parties that they
   communicate by telephone, even if such data cannot confirm the particular
   number the sponsor was calling in the country in question. It  is  not  a
   requirement that the parties also write or text each other;  Where  there
   are no countervailing factors generating suspicion as to  the  intentions
   of the parties, such evidence may be sufficient to discharge  the  burden
   of proof on the claimant.

34. The Appellant made an application under Appendix FM for leave  to  enter
   the UK as the spouse of Wahib Ahmed who she married on 5 August 2009.  In
   her visa application she explained the background to their marriage, that
   they were cousins who had known each other as children until the  Sponsor
   came to the UK in 2001. He then returned to Yemen for a holiday  in  2005
   where they met again and although attracted to each other there could  be
   no relationship  until  they  were  engaged  and  married  for  religious
   reasons. They therefore became engaged on 30 August 2008 and married on 5
   August  2009.There  is  therefore  clear  undisputed  evidence  that  the
   Appellant and the Sponsor are legally married.  The Sponsor remained with
   the Appellant for a honeymoon until 5 August 2009.

35. The Sponsor has since returned to Yemen on 14 November 2010 to  see  his
   wife, again on 17 July 2012, then on 16 December 2012, 26  December  2013
   and 18 January 2014. All of these visits are accepted by  the  Respondent
   as being shown in his passport but the refusal letter suggests  that  the
   fact that the Sponsor was travelling to Yemen is not evidence that he was
   visiting his wife. I heard evidence from the Appellant and I found him to
   be a credible witness: he appeared to be, as Mr Sinker argued,  genuinely
   concerned about his wife's safety and I looking at this evidence together
   with the other evidence before me I accept that  these  visits  to  Yemen
   were made because this was a genuine enduring marriage.

36. I am also satisfied that there is other evidence of  communication  both
   in WhatsApp and Viber. It was suggested that this evidence did  not  show
   who these calls were to and from but I do not accept that this is correct
   as the WhatsApp Screenshot translations are clearly from 'Sabrin' and  in
   all the circumstances I am prepared to accept that this is the  Appellant
   given that its her name.

37. I have seen the 18 photographs of the Appellants  and  Sponsor  together
   which are in the  bundle,  largely  at  their  marriage,  but  some  more
   'casual' photographs. I accept that for religious  and  cultural  reasons
   there are those who do not seek to  memorialize  their  relationship  and
   that this does not detract from the genuine nature of the relationship.

38.  I accept the evidence  of  the  Sponsor  that  he  has  been  providing
   financial support for the Appellant as I  found  him  to  be  a  credible
   witness and this also provides support for  the  claim  that  this  is  a
   genuine and subsisting relationship.

39. Finally I note that there are a number of supportive  letters  from  the
   Sponsors employer Liverpool Community Transport Mr  Crofton.  Clearly  Mr
   Crofton has known the Appellant for some years as he  was  an  apprentice
   there and as work colleagues do he has taken an interest in the  Sponsors
   relationship with  the  Appellant.  While  accepting  that  this  is  the
   Appellants appeal and it is her intentions that are paramount I  have  no
   reason to disbelieve Mr Crofton's  categorisation  of  this  marriage  as
   being genuine.

40. I am therefore satisfied that this is a genuine  and  enduring  marriage
   and that the couple do intend to live together permanently and  therefore
   the appeal should succeed.

Decision

41. The making of the decision of the First-tier tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of  law  as  regards  Appendix  FM  of  the
   Immigration Rules

42. I set aside the decision.

43. I allow the appeal under the Rules.
