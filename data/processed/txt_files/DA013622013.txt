                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

                              Joao Filipe Faia
                          (NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant Secretary of  State  was  granted  permission  to  appeal
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's
    appeal under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
    (as amended).

 2. By a faxed letter dated 29 April 2014, she  withdrew  her  appeal.  The
    First-tier Tribunal determination therefore stands unchallenged.

Consequential Directions

 3. Forthwith on receipt of this decision the respondent  shall  grant  the
    appellant leave to remain for such  period  as  is  necessary  to  give
    effect to the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

                           Signed
                                    Upper Tribunal Judge Gleeson
