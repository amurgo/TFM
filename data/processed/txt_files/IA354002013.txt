For the Appellant:     Dr Chhetri, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case, Mr Dhital, was born on  22  September  1987
    and he is a national of Nepal.  He came to this country  as  a  student
    and appears to have had a number of  unfortunate  experiences  in  this
    country.  He claims to have come  to  this  country  originally  on  17
    September 2009 when he went to the London College  of  Engineering  and
    Management in Arsenal in order to take a  level  5  course  in  travel,
    tourism and business management.  He had leave to remain at  that  time
    for six months although the course was for one year.  The  college  was
    apparently suspended after three months and he had to  renew  his  visa
    which he did.  He then moved to the London Empire Academy in Shepherd's
    Bush to do the same course he had been doing before.  Again, this was a
    one year course.  His visa at this stage was granted for  three  months
    but the college was downgraded from highly trusted status to  B  level.
    He then left that college and went to a highly trusted  one  which  was
    the London College in Arsenal.  The course he took there was apparently
    an  integrated  business  management   course   including   hospitality
    management.  This course was suspended.  It was said before the hearing
    in the First-tier Tribunal which I will refer to below that he had paid
    the first college �3,500, the  second  college  �3,000  and  the  third
    college �2,200.  He has been in this country for some  five  years  now
    and he estimates that between course  fees,  accommodation  and  living
    expenses he has spent �40,000 in this country and  he  has  nothing  to
    show for it.

 2. He applied for a variation of his leave to enter  or  remain  and  this
    application was refused on 9 August 2013 and at the same  time  removal
    directions were made under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  The appellant appealed against this decision and
    this appeal came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Boyd  sitting  at
    Richmond on 17 September 2014 and was argued before the  judge  on  the
    basis that the appeal should be allowed under  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. In a determination promulgated on 1 October 2014 Judge  Boyd  dismissed
    the appeal.  The appellant has now appealed against  this  decision  to
    the Upper Tribunal and somewhat surprisingly in my judgment  was  given
    permission to do so by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  on  14
    November 2014.  In setting out his reasons for granting  permission  to
    appeal Judge Hollingworth stated as follows:

         "1.  In the light of the history of the colleges referred to by the
             judge at paragraph 7 of the determination, it is arguable that
             circumstances have arisen to take the appellant's case  beyond
             the unfortunate into the  relevant  criteria  for  considering
             Article 8 in the light of  the  expenditure  incurred  by  the
             appellant in relation to the colleges in question.  The  judge
             has not conducted an Article 8 exercise in the alternative  on
             the footing that those criteria for considering Article 8 were
             in fact met".

 4. During the course of this  hearing  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  Mr
    Wilding submitted that the judge had in fact  conducted  an  Article  8
    exercise outwith the Rules because at paragraph 16 he stated that:

         "I  would  have  to  be  satisfied  that  there   are   compelling,
         compassionate or  exceptional  circumstances  in  relation  to  the
         appellant such as would render the decision to refuse to vary leave
         to remain and to remove him to Nepal disproportionate".

    The judge then went on to state that:

         "There is nothing in the appellant's situation which meets  any  of
         those criteria.  It is unfortunate that he has spent so  much  time
         and money in the United Kingdom and has been unable to complete his
         course but being unfortunate is not sufficient in this case to make
         it compelling, compassionate or exceptional".

    It was for this reason that the judge  then  stated  that:  "I  am  not
    satisfied that there is any evidence that would permit me  to  consider
    Article 8 outwith the Immigration Rules".

 5. On behalf of the appellant, Dr Chhetri made  a  number  of  submissions
    which can  be  summarised  as  follows.   First  he  claimed  that  the
    appellant had compassionate and compelling grounds pursuant to which he
    should have been allowed to remain.  The judge  should  have  exercised
    his discretion "not arbitrarily but on the facts" and it  was  asserted
    that he had not done so.  The compelling reasons were first that he had
    come here in 2009 and so had been here for more than five years, second
    that he had spent �40,000 in this country concerning which he had given
    oral testimony, third that he had been deceived by his colleges and was
    a victim, fourth that it was the responsibility of  the  respondent  to
    monitor these colleges and the respondent should not be able to  ignore
    that responsibility, fifth that his family and he himself had  suffered
    and been put in "big trouble" because they had spent  money  for  which
    they had had absolutely no return and finally that this country,  which
    has a huge tradition in the sense of  being  a  provider  of  education
    including  having  educational  establishments  such  as   Oxford   and
    Cambridge, would be in a position where this appellant would  now  have
    to return to Nepal having spent five years here having nothing to  show
    for  it.   This,  argued  Dr  Chhetri,  amounted  to   compelling   and
    compassionate reasons why the appeal should be allowed.

 6. Regrettably for the appellant there is absolutely nothing contained  in
    either the grounds or in the submissions  of  Dr  Chhetri  which  comes
    close to establishing that there was any error of law  at  all  in  the
    judge's determination.  The judge, as Dr Chhetri accepted, applied  the
    correct test which was that he had to  be  satisfied  that  there  were
    compelling, compassionate or exceptional circumstances  such  as  would
    render the decision disproportionate for Article 8 purposes.

 7. The appeal has been founded on the private life rights of the appellant
    and it is quite clear from established jurisprudence that the right  to
    education as such cannot form a proper basis for asserting private life
    rights. Although the appellant's position is unfortunate, that does not
    give rise to any rights such as is claimed in  this  case  but  in  any
    event the judge considered properly  whether  or  not  there  were  any
    factors which might permit him to allow this  appeal  under  Article  8
    outside the Rules and has given adequate reasons for concluding (as any
    judge considering the facts of this appeal would  have  been  bound  to
    conclude) that there is simply no arguable Article 8 claim available to
    the appellant.

 8. In summary this appeal is absolutely hopeless  and  no  judge  properly
    considering the material submitted could conceivably have allowed  this
    appeal.  It follows that notwithstanding the  forceful  and  persistent
    manner in which the appellant's appeal was argued on his behalf  by  Dr
    Chhetri the appeal must be dismissed and I so order.

Decision

There being no error of law in the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal
this appeal is dismissed.
