                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant, an Afghan citizen,  appeals  against  a  determination  by
   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Doyle,  promulgated  on  17  October   2013,
   dismissing his appeal on asylum and all other grounds.

2) At the time his appeal was heard the appellant was  neither  by  his  own
   assertion nor by assessment carried out on behalf  of  the  respondent  a
   minor, so nothing turned directly on his age.  The judge  said  at  �  15
   that  he  found  the  evidence  about  age  "entirely  neutral"  and  not
   determinative of the appeal.

3) The main point advanced in the grounds of appeal and  in  submissions  to
   the Upper Tribunal was as follows.  It was crucial to reach a decision on
   age because (a) it went to the extent to which the appellant was credible
   (he having been consistent about his age from  the  outset)  and  (b)  if
   believed on that point, then when he gave his  initial  evidence  he  was
   only 15 years old, and  considerable  allowance  should  have  been  made
   before adverse inferences were drawn from conflicts between  his  earlier
   and later statements.  There had been lengthy submissions in  the  First-
   tier Tribunal on errors in the age assessment process, but these were not
   reflected in the determination.  Even if the judge was entitled  to  find
   that he could make no finding one way or the other, he failed to give the
   appellant the proper benefit by  taking  a  less  critical  view  of  the
   (acknowledged) conflicts in his evidence.  The judge could  not  properly
   both be neutral on the appellant's age and critical of  those  conflicts.
   The point was so material that it might have led to a  different  overall
   conclusion, and a fresh hearing of the appeal should be directed.

4) Mrs Saddiq in response said that the judge was right to  think  that  age
   was not a determinative issue, and was entitled to find himself unable to
   resolve the 2 year difference  between  the  appellant's  claim  and  the
   assessment.  However, she accepted that much  of  the  determination  was
   based on comparing what the appellant said at his initial  interview  and
   what he said later at substantive interview  and  further  evidence,  and
   that the judge did not allude to the appellant's age in  evaluating  that
   evidence.

5) I reserved my determination.

6) The judge left the competing evidence about the appellant's age  entirely
   out of account.  That was a largely favourable outcome for  him,  because
   no adverse inferences were drawn on a matter which might have been  given
   some significance against him.  That conclusion having been reached, I do
   not think the judge needed to say more about the criticisms  of  the  age
   assessment.  (If that omission was an error, it was  one  the  respondent
   might complain about, not the appellant.)  The  only  flaw  to  which  it
   might conceivably give rise is if the judge then went wrong  by  treating
   the appellant as being as old as the respondent said he was in 2007  (17)
   rather than as how old he said he was (15).   His relative  youth  was  a
   point in plain view, and the judge had said in effect  that  he  was  not
   taking him to be 17 rather than 15.  No doubt the younger  a  person  is,
   the more allowance has to be made for shortcomings in his  evidence,  but
   the grounds  go  too  far  in  seeking  to  make  this  critical  to  the
   credibility assessment.

7) The rest of the grounds amount to very little.  The judge  is  criticised
   for the comment that the appellant "managed to remain lost for 2  years",
   which is said to be erroneous because  the  appellant  admitted  that  he
   absconded.  I find it difficult to see the difference between  absconding
   and remaining lost in this context.  I do  not  think  that  the  judge's
   phrasing implies some point of distinction adverse to the appellant.   It
   is also said that the judge overlooked the appellant's explanations,  but
   no explanation of any significance is referred to.  It is to  be  assumed
   that the judge took account of evidence before him  whether  specifically
   rehearsed in the determination or not.

8) The credibility assessment (to be found in particular at � 15(j) to  (p))
   is  based  on  contradictions,  implausibilities,   inconsistencies   and
   behaviour designed to conceal information and  likely  to  mislead.   The
   determination has to be read fairly and as a whole.  As  such,  it  is  a
   more than adequate explanation to the appellant of why his appeal failed.



9) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
