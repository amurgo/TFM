Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Musira, Solicitor from Thompson & Co Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    "the claimant", against the decision of the Secretary of  State  on  27
    June 2017 refusing his application for leave to remain on human  rights
    grounds.  The claimant is subject  to  deportation  by  reason  of  his
    criminal behaviour and the operation of Section 32(5) of the UK Borders
    Act 2007 and the deportation order was made on  the  same  day  as  the
    decision to refuse his application on human rights grounds.

 2. We begin by considering the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. This explains, correctly, that the claimant was born in April 1984  and
    so is now 34 years old.  He is a citizen of Angola.  He arrived in  the
    United Kingdom in December  1995  with  his  brother  and  father.   It
    follows that he was then aged 11 years and that he  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom 22 years.

 4. The claimant was given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    in August 2004.  According to the Secretary of State, the claimant  did
    not have leave to be in the United Kingdom before then. He was known to
    the  authorities  as  the  dependant  of   his   father   who   applied
    unsuccessfully for asylum but that application was made on 11  December
    1995. It was refused and appeal rights were exhausted on 5  July  1998.
    He next came to the attention of the authorities in July 2003 when  his
    father applied for  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain  and  identified  the
    claimant as his dependant. It was that  application  that  led  to  his
    being given leave in August 2004.

 5. The claimant applied for  naturalisation  in  September  2013  but  the
    application  was  unsuccessful  because  he  had  an  unspent  criminal
    conviction.

 6. He got into trouble again.  On 16 January 2015 he was sentenced to  two
    years' imprisonment to be served  concurrently  on  two  counts  on  an
    indictment alleging the possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

 7. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was on the sole  ground  that
    the decision was unlawful under Section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
     It was the claimant's case that his deportation would put  the  United
    Kingdom in breach of its obligations under Article 8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

 8. The notice of appeal was marked in the appropriate box to indicate that
    the appeal was brought on human rights grounds.  The so-called  grounds
    of appeal are in reality narrative submissions but they make  it  clear
    that the complaint was against the decision to refuse leave  to  remain
    "under Article 8 ECHR &/ the Immigration Rules".

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made clear that he had considered all  of
    the evidence including witness statements and  letters  set  out  in  a
    bundle.  He referred to well-known  and  appropriate  authorities.   He
    directed himself, uncontroversially, that the claimant had  established
    a "private and family life" in the United Kingdom  and  that  deporting
    the  claimant  would  interfere  with  those  rights  in  a  way   that
    potentially engaged the protection of the Article. At  paragraph  8  of
    the decision he directed himself, correctly, that the starting point:

         "... has to be a consideration of the offence in the strong  public
         interest  in  removing  foreign  citizens  convicted   of   serious
         offences, which lies not only in the prevention of further offences
         on the part of the individual  concerned,  but  also  in  deterring
         others from committing them in the first place.  There is a  strong
         public interest in removing foreign citizens convicted  of  serious
         offences even where there is little or no evidence of  future  risk
         to the general public".

10. He then directed himself, again correctly, that the offence that led to
    the claimant's deportation was a  serious  offence  punished  with  two
    years' imprisonment.

11. The judge noted the remarks of the sentencing judge,  and  particularly
    that the claimant was not a man of good character.  He  had  previously
    been convicted of offences including possession of  drugs.   The  judge
    noted positive attributes in the claimant and saw how he had  taken  to
    drink and drugs when he had to  stop  studying  electrical  engineering
    because he was the victim of crime.

12. The judge then noted the assessment of future behaviour as there  being
    a "low risk of serious harm".  The judge reminded himself at  paragraph
    10 that the public interest  is  in  removing  "foreign  citizens"  (he
    surely meant foreign criminals) but regarded a low risk of  reoffending
    as something that could be weighed in the  balance  to  the  claimant's
    advantage.

13. It was the judge's view that deportation is more likely to be justified
    and therefore the consequences on the children  would  not  be  "unduly
    harsh" when there is a high risk of reoffending than when there is not.

14. The judge also  noted,  correctly,  that  the  claimant  faces  further
    prosecution but there was nothing in that fact alone  which  should  be
    used to the discredit of the claimant.

15. The judge noted the claimant had a long period of living in the  United
    Kingdom without getting into trouble, that he speaks English and  there
    was no evidence of him ever being a burden on public funds.  The  judge
    then directed himself that the relevant questions were whether  it  was
    "unduly harsh to expect the [claimant's] fianc�e and children to remain
    in the United Kingdom without the [claimant]".

16. The judge was satisfied that the claimant is exercising a parental role
    in the lives of his children.  This  finding  was  based  on  the  oral
    evidence of the claimant and his fianc�e which the judge clearly  found
    persuasive as he was entitled to do and supporting evidence from  other
    sources.  The fact  that  the  claimant's  fianc�e  was  at  that  time
    pregnant by the claimant reinforced the  judge's  finding.   The  judge
    noted the claimant's  other  family  members  are  naturalised  British
    citizens.  He said the claimant had been involved in the lives of their
    children.  He sees them every day and takes them to and/or from  school
    so that his partner can hold down a job.  The judge accepted  that  the
    claimant did not have any family in Angola.   He  believed  the  couple
    wished to marry.

17. The claimant's sons were then aged 8 and 9 years respectively.   It  is
    plain from other parts of the papers that the eldest son was born on 30
    January 2009 and the youngest son on 24 January 2010.

18. The judge found that it would be unduly harsh for the children to leave
    the United Kingdom for Angola particularly as they  had  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for all their lives.  The judge also found that it would
    be unduly harsh for the  children  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    without the claimant.

19. He then went on to allow the appeal.

20. We have to say that we cannot see how this decision can  be  justified.
    Although the judge directed himself correctly about the nature  of  the
    public interest and identified the possible way in which the appeal can
    be allowed (he clearly had  in  his  mind  Exception  2  under  Section
    117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002)  it  is
    unclear to us how he reached that decision.

21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge who gave permission made it plain that he
    was giving permission to the Secretary of State on each ground  but  he
    indicated that he was uncertain about there being arguable merit in the
    ground that there were inadequate reasons for  finding  the  effect  of
    deportation on the children would be unduly harsh.  The judge  granting
    permission was more concerned with the second ground in that the  judge
    had failed  to  give  sufficient  weight  to  the  public  interest  in
    deportation and therefore had conducted an unlawful balancing exercise.
    We do not accept  that  there  is  a  great  difference  between  these
    grounds. What is "unduly harsh" in a particular case is illuminated  by
    the strength of the public interest in removal.

22. Before us Mr Tufan relied on both grounds as he was entitled to do.

23. It was plainly set out in the Secretary of State's grounds that it  was
    his complaint that there were no reasons for the finding  and  that  it
    would be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the United  Kingdom
    without the claimant and unduly harsh for them to go to Angola.

24. We are not impressed with the suggestion the children can go to Angola.
     They have spent all their lives in the United Kingdom.  The judge  was
    clearly entitled to conclude as he did that their best interests lay in
    remaining in the United Kingdom with both parents.  We agree with  that
    finding. However, as indicated above, there is an obvious error in  the
    reasoning that should link the decision on the best  interests  of  the
    children with the decision to allow the appeal. The best  interests  of
    the children are not determinative.

25. The Secretary of State's second  ground  concerning  weight  is  not  a
    hugely different point.  It is the Secretary of State's case  that  the
    judge did not explain why the disruption to the lives of  the  children
    consequent on removal would be unduly harshness rather than the natural
    consequence of the need recognised  in  statute  to  deport  a  foreign
    criminal.

26. The claimants had served a Rule 24 notice and Ms Musira relied on  that
    in its entirety. This characterised the grounds as a mere  disagreement
    by the Secretary of State with the First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusions.
    This document shows that the judge did recognise the public interest in
    deporting  foreign  criminals.   The  decision  also  referred  to  the
    decision of the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali (Iraq) v SSHD  [2016]  UKSC
    60 but that was decided under the Rules not under the  amended  version
    of the 2002 Act and does not help us very much.

27. We asked Ms Musira to explain how the reasoning was adequate.   It  was
    an obvious question which she had no doubt anticipated  but  she  could
    not provide a satisfactory answer.  We are  quite  satisfied  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge has not explained this  decision  adequately.
    It is not good enough simply to  assert  that,  having  identified  the
    correct test, the claimant is able to satisfy it.  Ms  Musira  accepted
    that it is not the law that every father of British  national  children
    can show that the consequences of deportation are  unduly  harsh.   The
    phrase "unduly harsh" necessarily implies that some harshness is  going
    to follow a deportation decision where children are involved.  This  is
    not a case where there was anything in the decision to suggest that the
    mother had particular difficulties in coping or that the  children  had
    special needs or anything that made it an out  of  the  ordinary  case.
    The decision is not explained.  We set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.

28. Mr Tufan submitted that it would be appropriate in that event to return
    the case to be decided again in the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Ms  Musira
    agreed with that but we do not.  We have considered the  papers  before
    us in an effort to see if there is anything in the  evidence  which  if
    believed might persuade the Tribunal to allow the  appeal.   We  cannot
    find anything.

29. The Home Office file includes a letter from the claimant dated 23  July
    2015 from prison.  It is a plea that he is not deported and  refers  to
    deportation causing "great hardship within our family and community".

30. He spoke of his love for  his  partner  and  his  concern  of  how  the
    children would be brought up without their father  being  present.   He
    also said how his own family were in the United Kingdom.   There  is  a
    further letter dated 17 February 2016.  There  is  a  letter  from  the
    claimant setting out further representations dated 19 June 2015.  There
    he says his life would be in danger in the event of his return  but  he
    has not made an asylum claim and did not bring the appeal on Article  3
    grounds.  No weight should be attached to that submission.

31. The letter also points out the difficulties the  partner  and  children
    would have in  establishing  themselves  in  Angola  but  that  is  not
    controversial.  We do not expect the claimant's family to remove but to
    manage without him.

32. The claimant expressed his shame and remorse but there is nothing  that
    might support a finding that the harshness  consequent  on  removal  is
    undue.

33. On 18 May 2017 there was a letter from MQ Hassan Solicitors arguing for
    the claimant not to be deported.  It asserts the claimant is integrated
    into society in the United Kingdom to the  point  where  he  cannot  be
    expected to go to Angola.  It also relies on the relationship with  the
    children but does not bring out anything that would support  a  finding
    that the harshness would be undue.

34. We do appreciate what is involved here.  We do realise that removing  a
    father from frequent contact with his partner and children is going  to
    have a detrimental effect on them and they are wholly innocent  of  any
    deficiencies on his part.

35. The bundle prepared for the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  includes  an
    undated statement signed by the appellant.

36. The appellant talks about  some  of  the  difficulties  he  experienced
    growing up.  His parents' marriage broken down.  It  was  when  he  was
    living with his mother that he started to misbehave.   His  mother  was
    working hard holding down two jobs.

37. He met his partner in 2003 and they have been together since.  He talks
    about his own criminal behaviour.

38. He had been convicted of driving a vehicle while unfit and also  whilst
    uninsured.  He was fined and disqualified from driving.  He  was  fined
    for possessing cannabis.  He was caught  driving  whilst  disqualified.
    He was fined and disqualified from  driving  for  eighteen  months  for
    driving whilst unfit and uninsured in December 2004.  He was  later  in
    trouble when he was fined for possessing  cannabis.   In  2007  he  was
    convicted on two counts of  possessing  cannabis  and  sentenced  to  a
    twelve-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work.  He did  not
    complete that  order  entirely  satisfactorily  and  was  convicted  of
    breaching the order and was given an order to do more work.   In  March
    2008 he was convicted of driving with  excess  alcohol  and  possessing
    cannabis and driving whilst disqualified and he was ordered to  do  150
    hours' unpaid work and further disqualified from driving.  He  did  not
    do that entirely satisfactorily because he had  to  do  a  further  ten
    hours of unpaid work because he was convicted of breach of a  community
    order.  In March 2009 he was convicted of driving  whilst  disqualified
    and whilst uninsured and for that he was  sentenced  to  twelve  weeks'
    imprisonment suspended and other orders.

39. We note that he tried to excuse  that  behaviour  by  saying  that  his
    partner was pregnant and an ambulance had not been able to  help  them.
    He was sentenced as indicated.  In 2009 he was convicted of breaching a
    suspended sentence that ended in him spending  28  days  imprisoned  in
    Brixton (or two weeks, it is not clear).  In July 2009 he was convicted
    at the Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court for something  described  as
    "breaches of suspended sentence" and the result of that was  his  being
    sentenced to 28 days' imprisonment.

40. He talked about his strong  relationship  with  his  partner  and  they
    wished to be married.

41. He confirmed that they did not live together but said this was  a  bail
    condition.  He did take the boys to school and  spent  time  with  them
    every day.

42. When he was able to he was in regular work.

43. He would have no support in Angola.  It is right  that  he  made  plain
    that he was ashamed of himself and wanted a new start.

44. Parliament has decided that  heavy  weight  has  to  be  given  to  the
    desirability of removing a foreign criminal and that harshness is to be
    expected.  There is nothing here that can  support  an  "unduly  harsh"
    finding.

45. There are supporting statements from his parents.  There is a statement
    from the partner.  This rather confusingly  refers  to  being  made  in
    support of "my son's immigration appeal against the deportation  order"
    but this must be a word processing error.  The body of the statement is
    plain enough and supports the claimant's case.  It  does  not  indicate
    anything which we find capable of elevating the matter into an  "unduly
    harsh" case.

46. There is a letter from the partner dated  23  July  2015  in  which  he
    expresses her concern about how  they  will  cope.   It  was  difficult
    enough when the claimant was away in prison  and  she  feared  for  the
    future and how the boys would manage without his influence.

47. There are school reports and there are short manuscript notes from  the
    children  expressing  their  love  of  their  daddy.   There  are  also
    supportive letters from family and friends.

48. We have considered all of these things and are very aware of the impact
    of removing a father from a family but  that  is  what  Parliament  has
    decided has to be done unless the harshness is undue.

49. The claimant is not  simply  somebody  who  has  committed  a  criminal
    offence which resulted in his imprisonment.   He  has  committed  other
    offences.  He has shown himself to be disinclined to conform to  social
    norms.  Motoring offences are nothing to be proud of and these offences
    are of the serious kind involving irresponsible use of a car when in an
    unfit state without permission and not respecting court orders.  We  do
    not give a great deal  of  weight  to  these  things.   They  have  not
    precipitated the deportation decision but they are part  of  the  story
    and to the extent they are relevant they are entirely to the  detriment
    of the claimant's case.

50. We have to apply Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002.  We have to bear in mind  that  their  public  interest  requires
    deportation.  There are exceptions.  Exception 1 applies to someone who
    has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of his  life.
    The claimant has not.   That  is  enough  to  defeat  the  claim  under
    Exception 1 and it was not brought under Exception 1.

51. We accept the claimant could show that he was socially  and  culturally
    integrated in the United Kingdom although his repeated  offending  does
    create some cause to hesitate about concluding that.   There  would  be
    difficulties in returning to Angola but  he  has  not  made  out  "very
    significant obstacles".

52. More importantly, in any event he cannot rely on Exception 1 because he
    has not got the necessary residence.

53.  Exception  2  applies  where  there  is  a  genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying partner or parental relationship with  a
    qualifying child and the effect of deportation would be unduly harsh.

54. As far as the partner is concerned  she  allowed  the  relationship  to
    develop when she knew he was getting into trouble.  She is entitled  to
    be in the United Kingdom but she does not have to be.  She can choose.

55. As is explained above, the harshness on the children cannot  be  unduly
    harsh on the evidence that is before us.

56. We look as well to see if there  are  "very  compelling  circumstances"
    which might still justify a decision to allow the appeal.  We can  find
    none.  The claimant is a foreign criminal  with  strong  roots  in  the
    United Kingdom and no  strong  roots  in  the  country  of  nationality
    choosing to commit criminal offences  with  the  consequence  that  the
    public interest requires his deportation.   There  are  exceptions  but
    they do not apply here.

57. We also consider if  there  was  any  significance  in  the  claimant's
    partner being an EEA national.  We note that this has  been  considered
    by the Secretary of State.  He is  the  unmarried  partner  of  an  EEA
    national.  Any rights as an extended family member are weaker than  the
    comparable rights of a family member. It  might  be  different  if  the
    claimant had a residence card but he has not.  The case  has  not  been
    brought on the basis that there is a right to remain under EEA law  the
    grounds do not allege an EEA right and nor could they.  If there  is  a
    point to be made it needs to be made by another route.

58. It follows that putting everything together we do not see how, even  if
    everything is accepted at its highest,  this  is  an  appeal  that  can
    possibly succeed.

59. We not only set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  because
    of lack of reasoning, we substitute a decision dismissing the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed.  We  substitute  a  decision
dismissing the claimant's appeal against the decision to refuse  him  leave
to remain on human rights grounds.
