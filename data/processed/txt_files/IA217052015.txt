                                Mr MD Al AMIN
                                                                  Respondent

For the appellant: Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent: Ms C Hulse, Counsel, instructed by East London Law
Chambers Presenting Officer

                             DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The Secretary of State (SSHD) has been granted permission to challenge
   the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Gibbs who on  13  January  2016
   allowed the appeal of the respondent (hereafter the claimant)  against  a
   decision by the SSHD dated 3 June 2015 refusing to  grant  him  leave  to
   remain as a Tier 4( General) student and a decision to remove  him  under
   s.47 of the IAN Act 2006. The SSHD's ground  was  that  in  allowing  the
   appeal the FtT judge had erred in concluding that the claimant had  never
   received a letter sent by the SSHD on 26 March 2015 giving him 60 days to
   find a college with a valid licence. It  was  submitted  that  the  judge
   overlooked that the fact that the HOPO referred to the recorded  delivery
   number contained in the HO file and computer records.


   2. It is unnecessary  to  go  into  further  detail  because  Mr  Bramble
   properly conceded that the SSHD's grounds could not be maintained because
   the recorded delivery letter was  sent  to  the  claimant's  old  address
   whereas on 21 July 2014 in his application  form  for  Tier  4  (General)
   leave the claimant had  given  his  new  address  and  indeed  his  legal
   representatives had also gone on record before the 26 March  2015  asking
   that they be sent copies of any letters. Hence, the FtT judge was plainly
   right to conclude that the claimant had not received  the  letter  of  26
   March 2015 informing him his leave was being curtailed and that he had 60
   days to find a college other than Opal (which having earlier had  "highly
   trusted" status lost its licence in early 2015).


   3. For the above reasons I conclude that the FtT judge did not err in law
   and the judge's decision to allow the claimant's appeal must stand.
