For the Appellant:     Mr A. Pipe, Counsel, instructed by Jasvir Jutla & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs H. Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION and REASONS

      1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born in 1994.  She  appeals
         with permission the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
         Pacey) to dismiss her human rights appeal  against  a  decision  to
         refuse to grant her entry clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom.  She
         wishes to come here to settle with her spouse, Mr Mahomed [K].

      2. The ECO had refused to grant entry clearance for one reason  alone:
         he could not be satisfied that the sponsor was employed as claimed.
         During his consideration of the application the ECO  had  contacted
         the sponsor Mr [K] to ask him about the work that  he  did  in  the
         United Kingdom. The ECO took the view that during that conversation
         Mr [K] was unable to provide basic information about aspects of his
         employment: he could give neither the telephone number nor  address
         of his workplace,  was  unable  to  describe  the  outside  of  the
         building, did not know his salary or when he started working there.
          So, despite the fact that all of the suitability requirements  had
         been met by the Appellant, and despite the fact  that  the  sponsor
         had supplied all of  the  'specified  evidence'  relating  to  that
         employment, the application was refused.

      3. The Appellant appealed. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence that
         it had not been Mr [K] who had answered the telephone. He  was  not
         permitted to have his phone with him at work so had left his  phone
         with his father. His father had answered the call and that was  why
         he was unable to supply the basic information asked for. Mr [K] Snr
         had given evidence confirming that this was the case. He said  that
         the person on the other end  of  the  line  had  insisted  that  he
         continue to talk to them and so he had done so "in  sheer  fright".
         The Tribunal was told that Mr [K] Jnr had emailed the  Home  Office
         the  next  day  but  had  received  no  reply.  His  employer   had
         subsequently spoken to the ECO himself and confirmed that he worked
         there.

      4. The First-tier Tribunal rejected all of that evidence.  It  gave  a
         number of reasons for finding it not to be  credible.  It  did  not
         accept the  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  employer  that  they  had
         confirmed that he worked there when  contacted  by  the  ECO.  This
         evidence was rejected on the grounds that it was not credible  that
         the employer would remember such a call over 12 months later.   The
         appeal is dismissed on the grounds that the Appellant has  not  met
         the financial requirements of Appendix FM. The Tribunal then  finds
         no reason to go on to consider Article 8 'outside of the rules' and
         the appeal is thereby dismissed.

      5. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier Tribunal erred in the
         following material respects:

          i) In declining  to  conduct  a  Razgar  analysis  of  Article  8
             'outside the rules';

         ii) Failing to make findings on the sponsor's  evidence  that  his
             father was to blame;

        iii) Failing to  take  material  evidence  into  account,  viz  the
             specified  evidence  relating  to  the  sponsor's   employment
             provided with the application, and the evidence supplied post-
             decision to rebut the suggestion that this employment was  not
             genuine;

         iv)  Irrationally  rejecting  the  evidence  from  the   sponsor's
             employer about contact with the ECO.

    Discussion and Findings

      6. At the hearing I asked the parties to identify the legal  basis  of
         the ECO's decision.   After some hesitation Mr Pipe pointed to  the
         decision which states "you do not meet  the  eligibility  financial
         requirement of paragraphs E-ECP.3.1 to 3.4" and "I therefore refuse
         your application under EC-P.1.1(d) of the Immigration Rules".

      7. Paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) reads:

             EC-P.1.1. The requirements to be met for entry clearance as  a
             partner are that-

             (a) the applicant must be outside the UK;

             (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for entry
             clearance as a partner;

             (c) the applicant must not fall for refusal under any  of  the
             grounds in Section S-EC: Suitability-entry clearance; and

             (d) the applicant must meet all of the requirements of Section
             E-ECP: Eligibility for entry clearance as a partner.

      8. It is difficult to discern why the application fell to  be  refused
         with reference to this provision. The  Appellant  was  outside  the
         United  Kingdom  (where  she  remains),  she  had  made   a   valid
         application, the decision-maker had  expressly  accepted  that  the
         application did not fall for refusal on suitability grounds, and as
         far as I could make out she met all of the requirements of  section
         E-ECP.3.1-3.4:

             E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence, from
             the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

             (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

                  (i)  �18,600;

                  (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

                  (iii)      an additional �2,400 for each additional child;
                  alone or in combination with

             (b) specified savings of-

                  (i)  �16,000; and

                  (ii) additional savings of an  amount  equivalent  to  2.5
                  times the amount which is the difference between the gross
                  annual income from the  sources  listed  in  paragraph  E-
                  ECP.3.2.(a)-(d)  and  the  total  amount  required   under
                  paragraph E-ECP.3.1.(a); or

             (c) the requirements in paragraph  E-ECP.3.3.  being  met.  In
             this  paragraph  "child"  means  a  dependent  child  of   the
             applicant or the applicant's partner who is-

                  (a)  under the age of 18 years, or who was under  the  age
                  of 18 years when they were first granted entry under  this
                  route;

                  (b)  applying for entry clearance as a  dependant  of  the
                  applicant or the applicant's partner, or is in the UK with
                  leave as their dependant;

                  (c)  not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

                  (d)  not an EEA national with a right to be admitted to or
                  reside in the UK under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
                  2006.

             E-ECP.3.2. When determining whether the financial  requirement
             in paragraph E-ECP. 3.1. is met  only  the  following  sources
             will be taken into account-

             (a) income of the partner from specified employment  or  self-
             employment, which, in respect of a partner returning to the UK
             with the applicant, can include specified employment or  self-
             employment overseas and in the UK;

             (b) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;

             (c) any specified maternity allowance or  bereavement  benefit
             received by the partner in the UK  or  any  specified  payment
             relating to service in HM Forces received by the applicant  or
             partner;

             (d) other specified income of the applicant and partner; and

             (e) specified savings of the applicant and partner.

             E-ECP.3.3. The requirements to be met under this paragraph are-



             (a) the applicant's partner must be receiving one or  more  of
             the following -

                  (i)  disability living allowance;

                  (ii) severe disablement allowance;

                  (iii)      industrial injury disablement benefit;

                  (iv) attendance allowance;

                  (v)  carer's allowance;

                  (vi) personal independence payment;

                  (vii)      Armed Forces Independence Payment or Guaranteed
                  Income Payment under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme;

                  (viii)       Constant   Attendance   Allowance,   Mobility
                  Supplement  or  War  Disablement  Pension  under  the  War
                  Pensions Scheme; or

                  (ix) Police Injury Pension; and

             (b) the applicant must provide evidence that their partner  is
             able to maintain and accommodate themselves, the applicant and
             any dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public
             funds.

             E-ECP.3.4. The applicant must provide evidence that there will
             be adequate accommodation, without recourse to  public  funds,
             for the family, including other family  members  who  are  not
             included  in  the  application  but  who  live  in  the   same
             household,  which  the  family  own  or  occupy   exclusively:
             accommodation will not be regarded as adequate if-

             (a) it is, or will be, overcrowded; or

             (b) it contravenes public health regulations.

      9. The ECO having expressly accepted that the Appellant  had  supplied
         all of the specified evidence, and the decision making no reference
         to any of the 'general grounds for refusal', it is clear  that  the
         decision to refuse was incoherent on its face. If the Appellant met
         all of the requirements, she should have been given leave to  enter
         as a spouse.

     10. Mrs Aboni accepted this analysis and  agreed  that  notwithstanding
         the fact that no-one appears to have  pointed  this  out  to  Judge
         Pacey, it was an error of law for the Tribunal to  have  failed  to
         appreciate that the decision itself was flawed.  If  there  was  no
         reason given under the Rules to  refuse  the  Appellant,  that  was
         obviously relevant to  the  question  of  whether  it  would  be  a
         disproportionate interference with the Appellant's Article 8  right
         to be with her husband.  The 'credibility' of the witnesses  before
         the Tribunal was in those circumstances of little relevance.

     11. I should add for the sake of completeness that  I  accept  that  Mr
         Pipe's grounds, as  summarised  above,  were  also  made  out.  The
         Tribunal entirely fails to take into account the  uncontested  fact
         that all of  the  specified  evidence  relating  to  the  sponsor's
         employment was  submitted  with  the  application.  This  included,
         contrary to its findings at paragraph 25 of its decision, his  P60s
         covering the relevant period. As for the finding that  it  is  "not
         credible" that the sponsor's employer would be able to  recall  the
         ECO's telephone call, this is entirely unreasoned, and contrary  to
         the evidence of the ECO himself, who admits  on  the  face  of  the
         refusal  that  the  call  took  place:  "however  as  part  of  our
         consideration of your application on 15  May  2017  a  Home  Office
         official telephoned your sponsor's employer, Ryalls HMB Ltd".

     12. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

     13. The re-making will not  take  long.  As  I  note  above  the  ECO's
         decision does not itself contain a  clear  reason  as  to  why  the
         application was refused, since the Appellant is found to  meet  all
         of the requirements of the rules cited therein. If it could at  one
         time have been  argued  that  the  decision  to  refuse  leave  was
         nevertheless  proportionate  because  of  the  doubts   about   the
         sponsor's employment and documentation, that day has  passed.  That
         is  because  Mr  [K]  has  now  produced   statements   from   HMRC
         demonstrating that in the year in question he  declared  an  income
         from employment at Ryalls of �3997, precisely  the  amount  he  had
         claimed to have earned in the first place.  The Respondent  accepts
         that these statements are accurate; on that basis Mrs Aboni invited
         me to allow the appeal[1].

    Decisions

     14. The determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  material
         errors of law and it is set aside.

     15. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it on human  rights
         grounds.

     16. I was not asked to make a direction for  anonymity  and  I  see  no
         reason to do so.

     17.  The  Respondent  will  no  doubt  wish  to  action  this  decision
         expeditiously given that it has now been some two years  since  the
         Appellant made her application.
