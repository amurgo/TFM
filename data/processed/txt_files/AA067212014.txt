                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Seelhoff of Seelhoff solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania.  In the First-tier  Tribunal  it
    was felt appropriate to make an anonymity direction.  Given  that  this
    relates to the personal life of the appellant and his partner and there
    being limited public interest in the disclosure of  the  identities  of
    the parties, I make an anonymity direction.

 2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Morgan promulgated on  20th  November  2014.  The  judge
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent
    dated 22nd August 2014 to remove the appellant from the UK.

 3. By decision made on the 13th April 2014 leave to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was granted. Thus this case appears before me to determine  in
    the first instance whether or not there is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    original determination.

 4. In granting permission Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins gave the  following
    reasons:-

       "3 I am particularly concerned that the First-tier Tribunal may  not
       have given proper regard to the  evidence  of  societal  disapproval
       against gay people even in the context of an "Article 8" rather than
       an asylum claim.

       4 I am also concerned that  the  possible  difficulties  facing  the
       appellant  returning  from  Albania  as  a  gay  partner  have  been
       overlooked. His previous immigration history might be an obstacle to
       his re-entry. How this impacts on his claim is not clear but  it  is
       at least arguable that the point needs to be considered more than it
       has been."

Factual background

 5. The appellant came to the UK in 2000. He claimed asylum claiming to  be
    from Kosovo. He pursued his claim through to an appeal. His appeal  was
    dismissed. It was found on the evidence that the appellant  was  not  a
    Kosovan but that he was Serbian. His appeal was  finally  dismissed  in
    2002.

 6. In December 2006 the appellant met a  British  National,  who  for  the
    present is identified as PC. They developed a relationship and began to
    live together in January 2007.

 7. In March 2010 the appellant seeking to regularise his status in the  UK
    made fresh submissions to the respondent and an application  for  leave
    to remain in the UK based on his relationship  with  PC.  By  September
    2012 the application had not been  decided  and  the  appellant  issued
    judicial review proceedings.

 8. The appellant's representative claims that  he  had  to  re-submit  the
    application in March 2012 with supporting documents as  the  respondent
    had lost the papers. Whatever the cause of the delay, nearly 2 ï¿½  years
    passed before a decision was finally made.

 9. Finally the appellant was interviewed and a decision made to remove the
    appellant in February 2013.

10. In his application the appellant was admitting that he was an  Albanian
    and a homosexual but those claims were not accepted and the  respondent
    set removal directions for Serbia, in accord with the findings  in  the
    previous appeal.

11. In the application and  appeal  the  appellant  was  relying  upon  his
    Article 8 family life with PC. There were appeal  proceedings  both  in
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper  Tribunal  but   ultimately   the
    immigration decision  was  withdrawn  as  the  appellant  produced  his
    Albanian passport and an identity card.  The  respondent  undertook  to
    reconsider the application in light of the fact that the appellant  was
    an Albanian national.

12.  On the  24th  August  2014  the  respondent  refused  the  appellant's
    application and made the present decision to remove  the  appellant  to
    Albania. The appellant appealed against that decision.

13. The appeal appeared before Judge Morgan, who dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal.  The  grounds  of  appeal  were  in  part  based  upon  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

14. On behalf of the appellant it was asserted that, whilst in paragraph  2
    of the determination Judge Morgan correctly states that  the  appellant
    was no longer pursuing the asylum ground, the  judge  does  not  engage
    with  the  fact  that  that  did  not  constitute  a  concession   that
    homosexuals were not at risk  in  Albania.  The  reason  given  by  the
    appellant's  representative  for  not  pursuing  asylum  was  that  the
    appellant  would  be  able  to  live  discretely  in  Albania  and  his
    homosexuality would not become known to the appellant's  family  and/or
    the general public. Thus the appellant himself would not  be  at  risk.
    However it was still  maintained  that  homosexuals  were  at  risk  in
    Albania.

15. The appellant's representative on behalf of the appellant asserts  that
    the distinction has relevance as it would  impact  upon  the  appellant
    making an application to enter the UK as the  partner  of  PC  and  the
    proportionality of making the appellant return to Albania to make  that
    application. Reliance was placed on the  fact  that  the  appellant  in
    order to make the application would have to disclose  the  identity  of
    the person, who he was seeking to join in the UK.  The  application  in
    Albania would have to be made through  an  agent.  Documentation  would
    disclose the nature of the appellant's relationship, the foundation for
    his application for entry. The appellant's family  and  others  through
    the  agency  would  or  could  become  aware  of  the  nature  of   the
    relationship. The appellant by  reason  of  his  relationship  becoming
    known would be at risk of mistreatment.

16. In submissions the appellant's representative relied upon Ganesabalan v
    SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 as providing guidance as to how the issues  under
    Article 8 outside the rules  should  be  approached.  The  most  recent
    guidance on Article 8 has been given in the cases of MM & others v SSHD
    2014 EWCA Civ 985 and The SSHDv  SS (Congo)  2015  EWCA  Civ  387.  The
    emphasis being on assessing  whether  there  are  factors  outside  the
    criteria in  the  rules  which  are  material  in  the  proportionality
    exercise.

17. The appellant's representative seeks to assert that  the  risk  to  the
    appellant of his sexuality becoming known and  his  being  at  risk  by
    reason thereof and that the separation and delay caused by the  removal
    of the appellant and his  having  to  make  an  application   are  such
    factors.

18. As set out in paragraph 12 of the decision by Judge Morgan the evidence
    of the appellant and PC was not challenged as to their relationship. It
    was accepted that this was a genuine, substantial relationship that was
    to be acknowledged was akin to marriage and that if the appellant  were
    allowed lawfully to remain in the UK the parties  would  enter  into  a
    civil partnership/marriage.

19. The first issue being whether in carrying out the assessment of article
    8 and proportionality the judge had taken account of the potential risk
    to the appellant that in making the application his  relationship  with
    PC would become known and would expose  the  appellant  to  a  risk  of
    mistreatment.

20. That issue is dealt with in paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of  the  decision.
    In submission before Judge Morgan it had been submitted that the "there
    was insufficient evidence to  justify  the  appellant's  concerns  that
    entry clearance would cause a real risk of  the  appellant's  sexuality
    becoming known to his family".

21. In paragraph 16 the judge specifically considers whether the making  of
    the application would result  in  the  appellant's  relationship  being
    disclosed to his family. The judge finds that it would not. That was  a
    finding of fact that the judge was entitled to  make  on  the  evidence
    that was before him.

22. The  judge  also  in  paragraph  16  acknowledges  that  Albania  is  a
    conservative society where homophobic attitudes persist. It  was  clear
    that the judge did take account of the nature of society in Albania and
    was aware that homophobic attitudes were prevalent.

23. In paragraph 14 the judge takes account of the submissions made by  the
    appellant's representative. Those submissions included that it would be
    dangerous for the appellant to return to Albania to make an application
    for entry clearance and that there was  no  provisions  for  vulnerable
    clients to submit applications.  The  judge  in  that  paragraph  takes
    account of the submission that it would not be safe for  the  appellant
    to lodge an application.

24. The judge clearly took into account the risks to homosexuals in Albania
    and was aware that the submission by the appellant's representative was
    that the appellant would be at risk by reason of the need  to  make  an
    application. However the judge satisfied that it was proportionate  for
    the appellant to return to Albania to make an  application  for  entry.
    The judge was satisfied that the  process  of  making  the  application
    would not expose the appellant to any risk as the judge in paragraph 16
    specifically states that the fear f such was not objectively justified.



25.  The  second  issue  relates  to  the  separation  and  delay   pending
    consideration of the appellant's application for entry. The  judge  has
    within paragraph 18 found that taking those factors into  account  that
    the decision was proportionately justified.

26. It was accepted that the appellant could  not  succeed  at  this  point
    under the Immigration Rules, in part in respect of Appendix FM for  the
    reason that the appellant had remained in the UK  unlawfully  for  more
    than the prescribed period and because  he  did  not  have  an  English
    Language Certificate.

27. The  circumstances  justifying  consideration  of  Article  8  are  the
    potential risk  to  which  returning  and  making  an  application  the
    appellant would be  exposed.  The  judge  clearly  has  considered  the
    submissions in respect thereof and has given valid reasons for  finding
    that the appellant would not be at risk.

28. In the circumstances there is no error of law in the  decision  of  the
    judge.

Decision

29. There is a no material error of law in the determination.  I uphold the
    decision to dismiss this appeal on all grounds.
