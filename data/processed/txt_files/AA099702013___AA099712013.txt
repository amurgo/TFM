For the Appellant: Miss Pickering instructed by Parker Rhodes Hickmotts
Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mrs Petterson - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On the 15th July 2014 the Upper Tribunal heard the appellants cases
        in relation to the allegation First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Duff  had
        made a material error of law in his  determination  promulgated  on
        the 27th March 2014  in  which  the  Judge  dismissed  the  appeals
        against the direction for removal from the United  Kingdom  to  the
        Russian Federation which accompanied the rejection of their  claims
        for asylum or any other form of international protection.


     2. It was found that the only ground on which  permission  was  sought
        which had arguable merit was that the country expert  had  asserted
        that a number of factors meant the appellants will be recognised on
        return as failed asylum seekers from the UK, which is perceived  by
        the Russian authorities as a haven for North  Caucasus  terrorists,
        such as to place them at risk. It was found this  element  had  not
        been considered as  a  freestanding  issue  or,  if  it  was,  that
        adequate findings were not made.


     3. Direction were given that the adverse credibility findings of Judge
        Duff shall stand and that  the  scope  of  this  hearing  shall  be
        limited to considering the issue of risk on return to a national of
        Dagestan who is no more than a failed asylum seeker returning  from
        the United Kingdom. Following the hearing,  as  the  assessment  of
        real risk has to be based upon the individual circumstances  of  an
        appellant, the issue  is  being  considered  by  reference  to  the
        specific facts of these appellants.


     4. During the hearing the  country  expert,  Robert  Chenciner,  asked
        whether this tribunal  was  also  reconsidering  the  decisions  in
        relation to other areas of this region such as Chechnya but this is
        not the purpose of the hearing.



Background


     5. The appellants are both citizens of Russian. The first born on 17th
        June 1981 and the second, his mother, on 31st  October  1957.  They
        arrived in the United Kingdom on 28th June 2013 having  flown  from
        Spain and claimed asylum on 9th July 2013.


     6. The basis of the claims were problems  the  appellants  claimed  to
        have relating to the father of the first appellant and  husband  of
        the second appellant, who was a  government  employee  holding  the
        rank of Major in the militia and who provided security to the  head
        of the government of  Daghestan.  He  investigated  the  murder  of
        Shamil Abidov and discovered  a  link  to  the  special  forces  of
        Spetznaz or the FSB. As a result he was accused of  kidnapping  and
        sentenced to a term of  imprisonment  of  12  years.  He  was  been
        arrested on 9th August 2000.


     7. Following the arrest the family home was searched and  after  about
        two years the second appellant was assaulted  when  entering  their
        apartment block when she was struck over the head from behind after
        which she required hospital treatment and then went  to  live  with
        her parents elsewhere.


     8. The first appellant travelled to Germany in either 1999 or 2000 and
        claimed asylum on 23rd November 2000 in another name  and  claiming
        to be of Chechen ethnicity. The claim  was  rejected  on  7th  July
        2003. In 2004 the appellant returned  to  Daghestan  to  marry.  He
        returned to Germany in 2006 with his wife where on  19th  May  2006
        they both claimed asylum.


     9. By 2008 the first appellant had travelled to Sweden where he made a
        further claim for asylum although on  2nd  June  2008  the  Swedish
        authorities asked Germany to deal with the claim which was accepted
        and the first appellant returned to Germany.  On 18th November 2006
        the claim was refused by the German authorities  and  on  1st  June
        2011 the appellant returned to Russia where he was  joined  by  his
        wife and their child.


    10. The first appellant's father  had  been  released  from  prison  in
        February or March 2011 and the family re-united.


    11. The first appellant claimed that  on  5th  September  2011  he  was
        kidnapped by members of FSB and  detained  and  tortured  regarding
        involvement with a person suspected of a murder. He alleged he  was
        asked to work for the authorities and inform on Islamists who  used
        his mosque. He claims he was given two day to consider the  request
        and released. The family went to live in his wife's parents village
        and they left for Spain shortly thereafter via Moscow  airport.  It
        was said a friend of his father had arranged  for  them  to  obtain
        passports and made the necessary arrangements.


    12. Judge Duff found that the claims had been fabricated in  an  effort
        to achieve status in the UK and that the first  appellant  was,  in
        particular, "a wholly unsatisfactory witness who  sought  to  evade
        answering perfectly straightforward questions and who  contradicted
        himself in his evidence on a number of  occasions".  Contradictions
        between his evidence and that of the second  appellant  were  noted
        and the first appellant's history of  false  claims  and  deceptive
        behaviour was found to be significant.


    13. Judge Duff found the claim the first appellant's  father  had  been
        falsely accused and imprisoned not proved  and  the  claim  by  the
        first appellant that he himself had been  imprisoned  and  tortured
        originated from the two appellants accounts with  no  corroborative
        evidence and with elements of the claim  being  found  implausible.
        The claim was rejected.


    14. Judge Duff made two positive findings based upon the evidence which
        is that the appellants are of the ethnicity they claim and that the
        first appellant's father holds or has  held  a  position  with  the
        police.


    15. The appellants stand to be retuned as no more  than  failed  asylum
        seekers with no proven adverse profile.


   The country material and expert reports


    16. Robert Chenciner has provided four reports dated 6th January  2014,
        17th January 2014, 19th September 2014 and 10th December  2014.  He
        is a Senior Associate Member St Antony's College  Oxford  1987  and
        Hon Member Russian Academy of Sciences, Daghestan Scientific Centre
        1990 - .


    17. His specified areas of study and expertise are since 1983,  studied
        ethnography,  cultures,  human  rights  and  current  affairs   of,
        initially, the Caucasus, and subsequently all other  Former  Soviet
        States, excluding the Prebaltics. Country experience includes  USSR
        1983 - 1991; Former Soviet States 1991 - 2004 and  is  assisted  by
        people working locally on special topics i.e. corruption, religion.


    18. Robert Chenciner gave evidence  to  the  Tribunal  in  OY  (Chechen
        Muslim women) Russia CG [2009] UKAIT 00005, in October 2008 and has
        served as an OSCE Election monitor in Azerbaijan  in  October  2003
        and Russia in March 2004.


    19. Daghestan forms part of the geographical and politic area known  as
        the Russian North Caucasus. The map below  shows  its  geographical
        relationship to Chechnya and the Russian Federation.


    20. [pic]


    21. The US State Department report 2010, at page 2 stated:


              The conflict between the government and  insurgents,  Islamist
   militants and           criminal forces in  the  North  Caucasus  led  to
   numerous  human  rights  violations               by  all  parties,   who
   reportedly  engaged   in   killing,   torture,   abuse,   violence,   and
   politically motivated abductions with impunity. In Dagestan and Kabardino-
              Balkariya, the number of attacks on law enforcement  personnel
   increased               markedly.


    22. In February 2010 Moscow appointed as the  president  of  Daghestan,
        Magomedsalam Magomedov,  the  son  of  a  previous  president.  The
        country did not show any decrease in insurgency or  repression  and
        was plagued by increased violence which escalated  in  reaction  to
        the killing of a militant leader by the authorities who was alleged
        to have masterminded the twin female suicide bombers on the  Moscow
        Metro. It is a country with a long history of violence.


    23.  On  23rd  January  2013   President   Vladimir   Putin   dismissed
        Magomedsalam Magomedov from what the BBC described  when  reporting
        the event as being from "Russia's most  troubled  region  where  an
        Islamist insurgency is raging" and  moved  him  to  a  job  in  the
        Kremlin. Dr Ramzan Abdulatipov, an MP from the ruling United Russia
        party was  appointed  as  acting  president  until  elected  to  be
        president by the local parliament in September 2013.


    24. Terrorist violence from Daghestan against  the  Russian  Federation
        continued. A report dated 16th November 2013 reports that a husband
        of a suicide bomber who killed six people in Volgograd died after a
        stand off with the police.


    25. A comparative between Chechnya and Daghestan provided in support of
        the argument that the situation in Daghestan is worse than  in  the
        entire remaining parts of the North Caucasus refers to:


              i.  anti NGO laws passed by Moscow that  require  all  Russian
   NGO's               with foreign funding to make a  detailed  declaration
   and apply for                registration, which was  thought  to  be  an
   attempts to crush  human                    rights  and  other  perceived
   oppositions,  especially  those  working   in                 the   North
   Caucasus.   It   is   said   independent   NGO's   have   been    subject
   to repression for  several  years  with  many  investigative  journalists
     and editors being killed with impunity.


               ii.  The  killing  of  the  owner  of  the  only   uncensored
   publication in                        Daghestan in December  2011,  which
   reported on rebel activity  and                 state  corruption.    The
   killing is widely thought to have been                      organised  by
   the  state  security  services.  It  is  said  a  'hit  list'  of   eight
   journalists including the man killed has been circulated in 2009.


              iii.     2011 and 20012 killing and wounding in Daghestan. The
   situation               within Daghestan is more repressively  controlled
   than in other parts                   of Russia. The conflict between the
   state and rebels claimed 400 lives                 and over 400 seriously
   wounded in 2011 in a population of 3 million.                   One third
   of  the  casualties  were  rebels,  one  third  police  and   the   other
   third civilians.


                  For the first even months of 2012 Daghestan was the  prime
   base for                insurrection  in  the  North  Caucasus  with  262
   terror related crimes, 42                 more  than  for  the  whole  of
   2012. In April  2012  there  were                          reconciliation
   meetings between the Salafi and Sunni Muslims in the                 main
   Mosque  which  proved  ineffective.   The   authorities   sent   military
   reinforcements   to   Daghestan   from   Chechnya   and   seven   special
     detachments of Interior Ministry troops were set  up  in  Daghestan  to
          fight the insurgence. Officials admitted that the army  was  being
   used                 to  fight  the  rebels  as  the  police  had  proved
   ineffective.


    26. An article published by the Jamestown Foundation : Lack of Conflict
        Resolution Mechanisms and State Interference in  Religion  Seen  as
        Destabilizing Dagestan; Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 11 Issue: 186
        contains the following:


              "Religious driven conflict in the North Caucasus are caused by
   the government's             interference in religious matters, according
   to Enver Kisriev, a Moscow based              expert of Daghestan  origin
   "I   do    not   understand,   why   the    political    leadership    of
   Russia think that it will be able  to  establish  some  sort  of  Russian
   Islamic                 organisation that will, so to  speak,  faithfully
   serve the government, be loyal to             the authorities and, at the
   same  time,  be  highly  popular  among  Muslims  who                will
   sincerely believe that the  leaders  of  this  pseudo-church  are  indeed
     exceptional, devout Muslims", he said.  "These  two  things  cannot  be
   combined.               Since this is a hopeless task, I have no idea why
   the government puts such                  immense effort into it, pushing
   the people out from the  belief  in  God.   People               now  are
   forced to join opposition forms of Islam, because they do not accept  the
          policy of establishing a religious organisation sponsored  by  the
   government."


              .......


              It appears that the ongoing insurgency and  counter-insurgency
   campaigns  in             Dagestan  have  created  complex  relationships
   involving the economic and                political interests of  various
   groups in  Dagestan.   Since  Moscow  has  blocked  the            normal
   political process in the republic, politics has  migrated  to  the  semi-
   legal          space of special operations, insurgencies and a fight over
   economic resources.              Religion  has  partly  channeled  social
   protest, but even religion is no longer an             acceptable form of
   protest  for  the  state.   The  Russian  government  is,   in   essence,
   attempting to establish a totalitarian society in part of  its  territory
   and targeting           the adherents of one religion.


    27. Section 3.2 of the 10th December 2014 report contains a  number  of
        items of news for the period 6-10  December  2014,  some  of  which
        relate to the same matter, as evidence that anti-terrorism killings
        and resistance continues.


    28. It is noted the Boston marathon bombers  were  ethic-Chechens  from
        Daghestan.


    29. The report also  refers  to  a  meeting  at  Chatham  House  and  a
        conversation with a named source who agreed with  Robert  Chenciner
        that the country guidance on human rights in Chechnya  should  also
        apply to Daghestan and that Russians  do  not  distinguish  between
        Chechens and Daghestanis. The Russian army had ceased  conscription
        in Daghestan because they reportedly did  not  want  a  significant
        Muslim presence in the army.


    30. It is also said:


              "Any Chechen Daghestani and other  north  Caucasian  returnees
   are in addition at           risk of being accused of  links  with  ISIS.
   There are many theories about whether              the  Caucasus  Emirate
   has made a deal with IS, including a video of Daghestani             emir
   of Vilayat Daghestan (one of the four districts of the Caucasus  emirate)
          which appeared on the 27 November 2014 had sworn allegiance to IS,
   was in fact             a fake to smear the Daghestani rebels.  It is not
   clear how many Chechens and           Daghestanis have joined IS in Syria
   with figures estimated to be between a few             hundred and  1500.
   It is also not  clear  if  any  have  officially  returned.   Bearing  in
   mind Russia is Assad's most important ally, any  suspected  IS  returnees
   could          expect harsh treatment."


    31. It also said that Chechens  are  fighting  on  both  sides  of  the
        conflict in Ukraine.


    32. It is said that return from the  UK  is  an  additional  factor  as
        President Putin thinks the UK is a  safe  haven  for  Chechen/North
        Caucasian terrorists and so any Chechen/North  Caucasian  returnees
        from the UK has suspected links with the London "terrorists".   The
        Russian authorities and public do not differentiate between Chechen
        and others from the North Caucasian region, especially if a  female
        is wearing a hijab and a man a beard  which  are  part  of  Russian
        terrorist profiling. It is said the authorities would send them  to
        the secret services in Daghestan  after  violent  questioning  them
        about why they travelled to the  UK  without  a  visa  and  without
        permission  unless  they  were  a  supporter  of  the   pro-Russian
        Kadyrovtsi Chechen militia.


    33. It is  said  the  names  of  both  appellants  and  their  son  are
        recognisable to Russians and the  Russian  authorities  as  Islamic
        names of people from the North Caucasus  i.e.  Daghestan  and  non-
        Russian.


    34. Robert Chenciner has seen photographs of the  appellants  and  from
        the same states they have recognisable features of a typical north-
        Caucasian/Daghestan  face  -  black   hair,   long   nose,   sallow
        complexion, large eyes, non-Russian cheekbones, face shape.  It  is
        also said that when speaking to  the  appellants  by  telephone  he
        detected  a  Caucasian  accent  when  speaking  Russian  which   is
        recognisable from both Russian and other Caucasians.


    35. The 14th January 2014 report  comments  upon  likely  treatment  on
        return at the airport. The appellants had left  Daghestan  on  25th
        June 2012 and flew to Madrid where they  remained  for  three  days
        before flying to London. They used  their  own  Russian  Federation
        Passports issued in Makhachkala in  May  2012  with  tourist  visas
        obtained by the first appellant's father's  friend.  The  passports
        were destroyed on arrival in London, as it was claimed the agent in
        Daghestan had instructed, to prevent return on arrival. It is  said
        the appellants will be unable to obtain a replacement passport  and
        so will be returned with an extraordinary travel document issued by
        the Russian Embassy in London.


    36. It is specifically stated that:


              "The appellant was not likely to be stopped when  he  left  in
   2012 because he had              not been charged with a crime and  there
   was no all-Federation 'wanted' notice              posted for him. On the
   other hand on return, because he has 'black' /chorny            Caucasian
   features, recognisable Islamic Russian names and if  of  military  age  -
     32/33 he would be likely to be detained by border police and or FSB and
                  violently questioned in a verbally unpleasant manner  with
   physical violence            about why he had gone to the UK and  why  he
   had stayed for a long time as             opposed to a student  visit  or
   other visit.  Under such pressure he would be likely             to  tell
   his story in detail.  With regard to police violence at  the  airport,  I
   heard a             personal story told in confidence of  a  person  from
   Daghestan being beaten up at              Moscow airport c  2007  for  no
   reason other than he was a Muslim from                 Daghestan.


              Russian Federation is an anti-Caucasian racist  police  state.
   Daghestan and                Chechnya are part of the Russian  Federation
   and police abuse and corruption are            the  same  throughout  the
   Russian Federation which includes Russian airports.             He  would
   be asked these types  of  questions  as  part  of  their  anti  terrorism
     activities and to fulfill  their  quota  of  suspected  terrorists,  as
   described in note 5,             section 3.1 of my  first  report.   They
   would suspect that he had  claimed  asylum            because  he  is  an
   ethnic-born   Caucasian   evidently   deported   from    the    UK    and
   extract his story or obtain an enforced confession as in the  April  2014
   example             below, suspecting that he had been  in  contact  with
   Russian Caucasian terrorists              while in the UK and detain  him
   as a suspect for being a member  of  an  illegal                formation
   and/or linked to his 2011 interrogation  in  Daghestan.   If  he  had  an
   Internal Passport but never had an International passport and left Russia
                  illegally, then he would be forced to explain why he  left
   illegally. He would need              an ETD to enter.


               In  my  opinion  it  does  not  matter  if  his  history  was
   fabricated, as the                    Determination  found,  he  and  any
   other (rare, i.e. easily noticed as he stands  out            from  other
   the  passengers,  please  see  section  2.1.2  below)  Caucasian  Russian
   citizen men of fighting age who  are  identifiable  and  return  from  UK
   especially              after a long stay are automatically suspected  of
   being foreign-financed  rebel               extremists  terrorists.  This
   appears  to  be   similar   from   the   country   point   of   view   to
   Chechen males profiling in RM (Young Chechen Male - Risk - IFA) Russia CG
              [2006] UKAIT 00050.

    37. The need to secure an ETD from the Russian Embassy in London  would
        also alert the local Daghestan police that he was about  to  return
        and they would routinely be likely to  inform  the  airport  border
        police as would the embassy in London that someone with  an  ethnic
        north Caucasian name was being returned from the UK. In relation to
        the availability of information the report  at  2.1.3,  section  2,
        para 7 states:


              "Russia appears to  be  a  xenophobic  police  state  and  any
   travellers  returning  are               recorded  for  Russian  security
   services on flight passenger lists, especially from             countries
   who  host  refugees  whom  the  Russian  authorities   consider   to   be
   terrorists (section 2.5.3 original report and section 2.5 below) such  as
   UK.   Few             ethnic  north  Caucasian  returnee  detentions  are
   reported as they are not high             profile and/or not of  interest
   to the Russian press. Two 2014 examples are as               follows.  1.
   The first describes in some detail  what  happened  at  the  airport.  As
   reported by a lawyer from the  respected  leading  Russian  Human  Rights
   Centre              "Memorial", on  27  March  she  went  to  Shermetievo
   airport to collect her cousin             an almost 21 year  old  Chechen
   martial arts athlete who was being trained in               martial  arts
   in Thailand and was expected to return  for  a  holiday,  but  failed  to
   appear on his scheduled flight.  The lawyer went to  the  airport  border
   office of           the  FSB  who  said  all  passengers  had  come  out.
   Shortly after  she  was  approached               by  two  plain  clothed
   officers  who  asked  her  if  she  was  waiting  for   him.    She   was
   asked to go to an interview room and questioned about his  religious  and
   political           views. They said that  there  was  nothing  to  worry
   about, they just  needed  to  fix  a               few  problems  on  his
   passport.    Next   day    she    discovered    that    he    had    been
   arrested on a fabricated charge of participation in the Chechen  National
              Liberation Movement (i.e.  a  perceived  terrorist).   He  was
   taken  to  court  at  7.30am               without  a   lawyer.    During
   interrogation which continued until 3.00 am he                  confessed
   his participation in illegal armed organisations.  As a result the  court
          decided to detain him  for  about  nine  weeks  until  May  28  in
   preparation of a              complaint  (to  open  a  case).  (Returning
   Chechen arrested in Moscow,4 April 2014,           Waynakh Online Chechen
   rebel   website)   In   my   opinion   to   have    coerced    a    false
   confession would indicate  that  he  was  both  verbally  and  physically
   abused. 2.              This is an example of Moscow and Daghestan police
   cooperation linked to                 perceived terrorists.  On March  11
   2014 five Daghestanis arriving on a flight from             Cairo  Egypt,
   where  they  had  spent   two   months   were   arrested   by   Daghestan
   security forces without charge  to  clear  potential  links  to  jihadist
   groups in Egypt.             In early January 2014 some  rumours  emerged
   that  two  suspected  suicide                 bombers   wanted   by   the
   authorities in Moscow were living in Egypt.



Discussion



    38. Robert Chenciner referred to  case  law  relating  to  Chechnya  in
        relation to which  there  are  a  number  of  cases.  The  evidence
        regarding the physical appearance and accent above  is  not  a  new
        matter as a similar argument was made by Mr Chenciner in the  cases
        below.


    39. In RM (Young Chechen Male - Risk -  IFA)  Russia  CG  (2006)  UKAIT
        00050 the Tribunal said that a young Chechen male will not as  such
        be at real risk of persecution or a breach of Article 3  either  on
        return to Russia, or on the rail link to Chechnya, or in  Chechnya,
        and, as an alternative, has a viable internal relocation option  in
        Ingushetia. However a Chechen, who is recorded  as  wanted  by  the
        Russian authorities in connection with or for supporting the rebels
        in Chechnya, will be at  real  risk  on  return  at  Moscow  or  St
        Petersburg Airports, and anywhere else in the  Russian  Federation.
        He will not however be a refugee if his own conduct is  enough  for
        Article 1F to exclude him.  This decision replaces  MR  (Chechen  -
        Return) Russia CG [2002] UKIAT 07562 as current country guidance on
        these issues.


    40. However, in OY (Chechen Muslim women) Russia CG (2009) UKAIT  00005
        the Tribunal indicated the position had changed somewhat since  RM.
        The Tribunal found, despite the existing  country  guidance  cases,
        there are circumstances in which a female Muslim Chechen may be  at
        risk and may not be able to relocate within Russia.  In  this  case
        the  appellant  was  of  predominantly  Chechen  but  part  Russian
        ethnicity and a Muslim.  Her husband was of Russian ethnicity.  She
        had been detained in 2002 and again in 2006 and she was ill treated
        during each detention.  The Respondent relied on AV  (IFA  -  Mixed
        Ethnicity Relationship - Russian/Chechen) Russia  CG  (2002)  UKIAT
        05260 and  argued  that  the  option  of  internal  relocation  was
        available. The Tribunal had before it evidence from  an  expert  Mr
        Chenciner who said that  the  appellant's  family  name  would,  in
        Russia, indicate that she was of the  Muslim  faith  and  from  the
        Caucasus.  If she tried to change her name and was able  to  do  so
        this would be recorded with her earlier name and the  rest  of  her
        history.  Ethnic Russians would look at her and conclude  that  her
        facial features were not those of  an  ethnic  Russian.  They  were
        likely to conclude that she came from either Chechnya or  somewhere
        in the Northern Caucasus.  Many Russians would  describe  her  with
        the pejorative word "Chorny" which means  "black".  Russians  apply
        this to Caucasians.  Many Russians would view  a  woman  wearing  a
        headscarf as linked to Wahibi terrorists.  Moderate, devout  Muslim
        women who wear hijab or headscarves are often  targeted  as  Wahibi
        extremist terrorists by the Russian authorities. It was clear  that
        another Russian would recognise her as having a  Caucasian  accent.
        Mr Chenciner indicated that she would be seen as a potential threat
        because she would be perceived as a Muslim woman trying  to  settle
        in non-Islamic Russia and because she would be  returned  from  the
        United Kingdom which the Russian authorities perceive as  a  hotbed
        of Islamic terrorism.  As she would be  travelling  on  a  one  way
        ticket the likelihood was that she would stopped  at  the  airport.
        If a perception arose of any connection  with  Chechen  insurgents,
        then she was likely to be detained for a lengthy period and  suffer
        further serious ill-treatment. If she was fortunate  enough  to  be
        able to pass through the airport on arrival it was not likely  that
        without an internal  passport  she  would  be  able  to  travel  to
        Chechnya without being stopped, identified and  detained  with  the
        same outcome as if she had been stopped at the  airport.   Even  if
        she was able to reach Chechnya  she  would  be  at  risk  from  the
        Russian supported authorities.  Such an  individual  would  not  be
        able to live in Chechnya with  a  husband  or  partner  of  Russian
        ethnicity because he would be at constant risk from the authorities
        who, whilst they are supported by the Russian  central  government,
        are also Chechen in outlook and attitude.  He  would  also  face  a
        real risk of death at the hands of the Chechen population.  If  she
        lacked an internal passport it would be unduly harsh to expect  her
        to attempt to relocate.  She would not be able to live anywhere  in
        Russia for any length of time without running a real risk of  being
        stopped, identified as Chechen, having the lack of  a  registration
        document discovered and being forced to return to Chechnya.


    41. In EM LM (IFA-Chechen) Russia CG (2003) UKIAT 00210 the  appellants
        were citizens of Russia, settled  in  Chechnya,  who  had  suffered
        considerable problems when the  conflict  there  broke  out.  Their
        father, an army officer, and the first Appellant's husband, also  a
        soldier, had been killed by Chechen rebels. They had  lost  contact
        with their mother, who was half Chechen and half Russian,  and  the
        second Appellant,  who  was  unmarried,  had  inherited  distinctly
        Chechen features.  The appellants  were  together  when  they  were
        raped by Russian soldiers. The Tribunal noted  that,  according  to
        the CIPU report something in excess  of  250,000  people  including
        almost the entire Russian, Armenian, and Jewish population had left
        Chechnya  as  a  result  of  the  conflicts  there.  The   Tribunal
        acknowledged that the appellants could not live safely in  Chechnya
        because they were not Chechens. The Tribunal also noted a report by
        Robert Chenciner, a Senior Associate Member of St Antony's  College
        Oxford, who explained the difficulties the appellants would have in
        the event of their return to Russia. Firstly they had to  get  into
        the country.  To do this they would have to reveal their links with
        Chechnya.  They would attract attention for two reasons. Their name
        was "recognisably Islamic" rather than Russian and they would  have
        temporary travel documents issued by the United Kingdom. They would
        be questioned. If they said they came from  Chechnya  it  would  be
        assumed that they were returned asylum seekers and  they  would  be
        treated as suspected  Chechen  collaborators  and  terrorists.   Mr
        Chenciner   explained   that   ethnic   Russians   from   Chechnya,
        particularly those of mixed  ethnicity,  were  treated  with  great
        suspicion and contempt and  they  tend  to  be  ill  treated.   The
        Tribunal bore in mind that Russia was not a free country. To travel
        within it people needed an internal passport and  this  would  show
        their names (Islamic) and the nationality of their  parents.  Every
        time  that  they  had  dealings  with  officials  they  would  risk
        opprobrium or worse and they would have  to  meet  many  officials.
        The expert had recognised that many displaced people from  Chechnya
        have been given refuge in Ingushetia, but the refugee  camps  there
        are controlled by the Russian military forces. The expert said that
        there was a risk of the appellants' detention  and  transfer  to  a
        filtration camp because they would be assumed to be Chechen.  There
        they would be a risk  of  torture  or  death.   There  was  nowhere
        obvious for them to go in Russia.  The other  internally  displaced
        persons were not well treated. The Tribunal concluded that it would
        be unduly harsh to expect them to relocate.


    42.  The  most  recent  case  examining  this  issue  is  I  v   Sweden
        (Application no 6129-04/09 ECtHR September 2013). The  court  noted
        the situation in Chechnya, the  ongoing  disappearances,  arbitrary
        violence, ill treatment in detention facilities, particularly  with
        regard to certain categories of people such as former rebels, their
        relatives, political adversaries, journalists and  others  who  had
        complained to  international  organisations:  but  found  that  the
        unsafe general situation was not sufficiently serious  to  conclude
        that the return of Chechen  applicants  to  Russia  amounted  to  a
        violation of Article 3 though all the facts of an individuals  case
        had to be considered.



  43. The judgment is as follows:


              1.  General principles

          54.  The  Contracting  States  have  the  right  as  a  matter  of
      international law and subject          to  their  treaty  obligations,
      including the Convention, to control the entry,              residence
      and expulsion of aliens  (see,  amongst  others,  NA.  v.  the  United
      Kingdom,         cited above, � 109).

          55.     However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to
      an  issue  under             Article   3,   and   hence   engage   the
      responsibility  of  that  State  under  the  Convention,         where
      substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing  that  the  person
          concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of  being  subjected  to
      treatment contrary        to Article 3. In  such  a  case,  Article  3
      implies an obligation not to deport the             person in question
      to that country  (Saadi  v.  Italy  [GC],  no. 37201/06,  �  125,  28
      February 2008).

          56.     In determining whether it has been shown that an applicant
      runs a real risk of       suffering treatment proscribed by Article  3
      the Court examines the foreseeable          consequences of sending an
      applicant to the country of destination, bearing in          mind  the
      general situation there and his personal circumstances. It will do  so
      by      assessing the issue in the light of all material placed before
      it, or, if necessary,         material obtained on its own  initiative
      (see H.L.R. v. France, 29 April 1997, � 37,         Reports  1997-III,
      and, more  recently,  Hirsi  Jamaa  and  Others  v. Italy  [GC],  no.
      27765/09, � 116, 23 February 2012). The assessment of the existence of
      a real risk       must  necessarily  be  a  rigorous  one.  It  is  in
      principle for  the  applicant  to  adduce        evidence  capable  of
      proving  that  there  are  substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,
      if the measure complained of were  to  be  implemented,  he  would  be
      exposed to  a          real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
      contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited         above, �� 128-129  and
      NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, � 111).

          57.     The Court must be satisfied that the  assessment  made  by
      the authorities  of  the         Contracting  State  is  adequate  and
      sufficiently supported by domestic materials as           well  as  by
      materials originating from other reliable and objective  sources  such
      as,           for  instance,  other  Contracting  or   non-Contracting
      States, agencies of the  United          Nations  and  reputable  non-
      governmental organisations (see,  NA.  v.  the  United        Kingdom,
      cited above, � 119).


                  2.  The general situation for Chechens returning  to  the
           Russian Federation

        58.   Having regard to its case-law  concerning  disappearances  and
      ill-treatment in          Chechnya (see, among many others,  Bazorkina
      v. Russia, no. 69481/01, 27 July       2006; Imakayeva v. Russia,  no.
      7615/02, ECHR 2006-XIII (extracts);  Luluyev  and           Others  v.
      Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006-XIII (extracts); Baysayeva v.  Russia,
      no.          74237/01, 5 April 2007;  and  Akhmadova  v.  Russia,  no.
      25548/07, 3  April  2012)  and         having  regard  to  the  recent
      information on the human rights and security             situation  in
      Chechnya, the Court is  well  aware  of  on-going  disappearances,  of
      arbitrary  violence,  of  impunity  and  ill-treatment  in   detention
      facilities, notably       with regard to certain categories of people,
      such as former rebels, their relatives,         political  adversaries
      of  Ramsan  Kadyrov,   journalists,   human   rights   activists   and
      individuals   who   have   lodged   complaints   with    international
      organisations.  The         Court  is  also  aware  of  the   reported
      interrogations of  returnees  and  of  harassment        and  possible
      detention and ill-treatment by the Federal Security Service  or  local
      law-enforcement  officials  and  also   by   criminal   organisations.
      Nevertheless, the         Court  considers  that  the  unsafe  general
      situation there is not sufficiently serious         to  conclude  that
      the  return  of  the  applicants  to  Russia   would   amount   to   a
      violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example Bajsultanov
      v. Austria,      no. 54131/10, �� 64-72, 12 June 2012 and  Jeltsujeva
      v. the Netherlands (dec.),             no. 39858/04, 1 June 2006).


                  3.  The applicants' individual situation

          59.     Turning to  the  applicants'  individual  situation,  they
      maintained that they had      been ill-treated by the "Kardyrov group"
      and were at risk of being ill-treated       anew upon  return  to  the
      Russia,   because   the   first   applicant   took   photographs   and
      wrote reports about numerous crimes committed  by  the  State  against
      Chechens         between 1995 and 2007.

          60.     The Government have questioned the applicants' credibility
      and pointed to       various inconsistencies  in  their  stories.  The
      Court accepts that, as a general             principle,  the  national
      authorities are  best  placed  to  assess  not  just  the  facts  but,
      more particularly, the credibility of witnesses since it is  they  who
      have had an      opportunity to see, hear and assess the demeanour  of
      the individuals concerned          (see R.C. v. Sweden, no.  41827/07,
      � 52, 9 March 2010). But at the same time it        acknowledges  that
      owing  to  the  special  situation  in  which  asylum  seekers   often
      find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them  the  benefit
      of the doubt         when it comes to  assessing  the  credibility  of
      their statements  and  the  documents           submitted  in  support
      thereof. However, when information  is  presented  which         gives
      strong  reasons  to  question  the  veracity  of  an  asylum  seeker's
      submissions,          the  individual  must  provide  a   satisfactory
      explanation for the alleged                 discrepancies (see,  among
      other authorities, N. v. Sweden, no. 23505/09, � 53, 20      July 2010
      ).

          61.     In the present case the national authorities  did  not  as
      such question that the first       applicant  had  been  subjected  to
      torture. They  stated,  however,  taking  into           account  that
      victims  of  torture  cannot  be  expected   to   provide   completely
      coherent and consistent statements,  that  even  though  the  evidence
      supported his        statements that he had been subjected to torture,
      the first applicant had  not             established  with  sufficient
      certainty why he  had  been  subjected  to  it  and  by          whom.
      Notably, as to the first applicant's explanation that  he  was  a  key
      figure       and wanted by the Russian authorities with a  significant
      price on his head             because he had carried out  journalistic
      work to their detriment, the Migration          Court pointed out that
      his statements had been remarkably vague and that             although
      he claimed that he had collected material for twelve years, he had not
              been able to provide any concrete examples of what he had done
      or been able to      provide any form of evidence of his  work.  Thus,
      the Migration Court found          reason to question the  credibility
      of the first applicant's statements.

          62.     This leads to the crucial question of whether the isolated
      fact that a person has        been subjected to  torture  suffices  to
      demonstrate that he or she, if deported to the      country where  the
      ill-treatment took place, will face a real  risk  of  being  subjected
      again to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court is aware  that  in
      R.C. v. Sweden       (quoted above, �� 50 and 55), it found that since
      the asylum seeker in that case         had proven  that  he  had  been
      subjected to torture, the onus rested with the State         to dispel
      any doubts about the risk of his being subjected  again  to  treatment
      contrary to Article 3 in the event that  the  expulsion  were  carried
      out. However,        leaving aside deportations to countries where the
      general situation is sufficiently      serious to  conclude  that  the
      return of any refused asylum seeker thereto would        constitute  a
      violation of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court acknowledges  that
          in order for a State to dispel a doubt such as mentioned  in  R.C.
      v. Sweden, the       State must at least be in a  position  to  assess
      the asylum seeker's individual              situation.  However,  this
      may be impossible, when there is no proof of the asylum       seeker's
      identity and when the statement provided to  substantiate  the  asylum
      request gives reason to question his or her credibility. Moreover,  as
      stated above,        the  Court's  established  case-law  is  that  in
      principle it is for the person to  be             expelled  to  adduce
      evidence   capable   of   proving   that   there    are    substantial
      grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of  were  to  be
              implemented, he or she would be exposed  to  a  real  risk  of
      being subjected to        treatment contrary to Article 3. Where  such
      evidence is adduced, it is for the          Government to  dispel  any
      doubts about it. Accordingly, the Court considers that       where  an
      asylum seeker, like the first applicant, invokes that he  or  she  has
          previously been subjected to ill-treatment, whether undisputed  or
      supported by         evidence, it may nevertheless be expected that he
      or she  indicates  that  there  are         substantial  and  concrete
      grounds for believing that upon return to the home       country he or
      she  would  be  exposed  to  a  risk  of  such  treatment  again,  for
      example  because  of  the  asylum   seeker's   political   activities,
      membership of a       group  in  respect  of  which  reliable  sources
      confirm a continuing pattern of ill-        treatment on the  part  of
      the  authorities,  a  pending  arrest   order,   or   other   concrete
      difficulties  with  the  authorities  concerned  (see,   inter   alia,
      H.N. v. Sweden, no.       30720/09, � 40, 15 May  2012;  Yakubov  v.
      Russia, no. 7265/10, �� 68 and 83-94, 8         November  2011;  H.N.
      and  Others  v. Sweden  (dec.),  no.  50043/09,  24  January   2012;
      Panjeheighalehei v. Denmark (dec.), 11230/07, 13 October 2009); Jean
      M. V.            Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), 37913/05, 27 March 2008;
      and Fazlul Karim v. Sweden         (dec.), no. 24171/05, 4 July 2006).

          63.     In the present case, the applicants' case  was  thoroughly
      examined by both the          Migration Board and the Migration Court,
      before which  the  applicants  were        heard  and  represented  by
      counsel. There are no indications that  the  proceedings        before
      those domestic authorities lacked effective guarantees to protect  the
              applicants against arbitrary  refoulement  or  were  otherwise
      flawed. Both               instances  found  reason  to  question  the
      credibility of the applicants' statements       (see paragraph  11  as
      to the Migration Court's reasoning) and they thus            concluded
      that the applicants had  failed  to  establish  that  they  should  be
      regarded         as refugees or aliens otherwise in need of protection
      within the meaning of the          Aliens Act.

           64.      The  Court  finds,  in  agreement   with   the   Swedish
      authorities, that there are            credibility issues with  regard
      to   the   applicants'   statements,   notably   as   to   the   first
      applicant's alleged twelve years of journalistic activities, which  he
      claimed  was       the  main  reason  for  the  ill-treatment  of  the
      applicants by the FSB and Kadyrov's         group. As to  the  Court's
      request   for    documentation    or    evidence    of    the    first
      applicant's work,  the  Court  received  a  compilation  of  incidents
      allegedly            documented by  the  first  applicant  during  the
      period from 1995 to 2007. He did       not develop on the link between
      his work and  the  compilation  of  incidents.           Moreover,  he
      submitted  only  one  example  of  an  article  (see   paragraph   20)
      allegedly based on his reports, but he contended that he  was  not  in
      possession of        any articles where his name  was  mentioned.  The
      Court notes in addition that the       first applicant did not  submit
      any articles written by him either, whether               unsigned  or
      written  under  a  pseudonym,  nor  did  he  point   to   one   single
      photograph taken by him and published by one of  the  many  well-known
      sources          or media which he claimed had used his  material.  In
      these circumstances, the       Court  must  conclude  that  the  first
      applicant  have  failed  to  present   any              documents   or
      information  which  would  lead  it  to  depart  from   the   domestic
      authorities'  conclusion  that  there  are  reasons   to   doubt   the
      applicant's credibility.

          65.     Consequently, it agrees with the domestic authorities that
      the applicants failed to      make it plausible that they would face a
      real risk of being subjected to ill-            treatment upon  return
      to  the  Russian  Federation  because   of   the   first   applicant's
      alleged journalistic activities.

          66.     As stated above,  the  Court  is  aware  of  the  reported
      interrogation of returnees  and          of  harassment  and  possible
      detention and ill-treatment by the Federal  Security           Service
      or local law-enforcement officials and also by criminal organisations.
              Nevertheless, it considers that the general situation  is  not
      sufficiently  serious  to        conclude  that  the  return  of   the
      applicants thereto would constitute a violation of       Article 3  of
      the  Convention.  The  Court  emphasises  that   the   assessment   of
      whether there is a real risk for the person concerned must be made  on
      the basis of         all relevant factors which may increase the  risk
      of ill-treatment. In its view,  due           regard  should  also  be
      given  to  the  possibility  that  a  number  of  individual   factors
      may not, when considered separately, constitute a real risk; but  when
      taken        cumulatively  and  when  considered  in  a  situation  of
      general  violence  and                heightened  security  the   same
      factors  may  give  rise  to  a   real   risk   (see,   for   example,
      NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, � 130).

          67.     The Court notes that in their decisions  of  October  2008
      and July 2009, the            Migration Board and the Migration  Court
      did not make a separate assessment of       this specific risk in  the
      applicants'   case,   notably   that   the   first    applicant    has
      significant and visible scars on his body, including  a  cross  burned
      into his chest.      The medical certificates stated that  his  wounds
      could be consistent with his            explanation  both  as  to  the
      timing (October 2007) and the extent of the torture to       which  he
      maintained he had been subjected, and in their  judgment  of  15  July
      2009 the Migration Court contended that the first applicant's injuries
      had              probably  been  caused  by  ill-treatment  resembling
      torture.

          68.     Thus, in case of a body search of the first  applicant  in
      connection with  possible       detention  and  interrogation  by  the
      Federal Security Service or local law-          enforcement  officials
      upon  return,  the  latter  will  immediately  see  that   the   first
      applicant has been subjected to ill-treatment for whatever reason, and
      that those       scars occurred in recent years, which could  indicate
      that he took active part in the        second  war  in  Chechnya.  His
      situation therefore differs significantly from, for           example,
      the  applicant  in  Bajsultanov  v.  Austria  (cited  above)  or  from
      returnees of         Chechen origin who took active part in the  first
      war in Chechnya only, and who          are therefore not  as  such  at
      risk of being persecuted  by  the  present  authorities           (see
      paragraph 37 above).

          69.     Taking those factors into  account  cumulatively,  in  the
      special circumstances of      the case the Court finds that that there
      are substantial grounds for believing that      the  applicants  would
      be  exposed  to  a  real  risk  of  being   subjected   to   treatment
      contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if  deported  to  the  Russian
      Federation.      Accordingly, the Court finds that the  implementation
      of the deportation order      against the applicants would  give  rise
      to a violation of Article 3 of the              Convention.

    44. The first applicant has a history of attempting to secure asylum in
        Europe. His claims  in  Germany  failed  and  he  was  returned  to
        Daghestan with  no  evidence  of  the  type  of  adverse  attention
        mentioned by Robert Chenciner occurring. It is also noted  that  in
        2011 he was able to approach the Russian  embassy  in  Germany  and
        secure a new passport and exist visa subsequently.


    45. The claim to have suffered persecution and to  have  been  arrested
        and  detailed  in  Daghestan  was  found  by  Judge  Duff  to  lack
        credibility. There is no  evidence  of  adverse  interest  and  the
        appellants are no more than failed asylum seekers.


    46. Country evidence relating to  risk  has  been  provided  by  Robert
        Chenciner who was found by Mr Justice Collins to  have  produced  a
        speculative report on Ukraine in Venediktov v SSHD [2005] EWHC 2460
        Admin but whose evidence was accepted by the Tribunal in the  above
        cases.


    47. The factor  present  in  this  application  that  was  not  present
        previously is that the appellants will be returned from the UK.


    48. As Robert Chenciner states, it matters not that the claim made  was
        found to lack credibility. It is the perception of  the  appellants
        in the minds of their alleged  persecutors  that  is  the  relevant
        factor. The evidence given is that the factors particular to  these
        appellant will identity their place of return  and  ethnic  origin.
        Mrs. Petterson did not adduce country material to  demonstrate  the
        expert's  opinion  was  incorrect  or  speculative  or  succeed  in
        discrediting  the  same  in  cross-examination.  The  situation  in
        Daghestan is clearly unstable  with  active  conflict  between  the
        authorities and Islamic grounds viewed by the state as  terrorists.
        The view expressed of  the  UK  in  the  evidence  by  the  Russian
        authorities is plausible and mirrors statements made  by  President
        Putin in interviews.


    49. The appellants have nothing to hide in  relation  to  their  claims
        which were found to be fabrications.  At the point of return it  is
        plausible to the lower standard applicable that the  border  police
        will be aware of their return. The  submission  by  Mrs.  Petterson
        that there is no real risk as the first appellant is returning with
        his mother and family but this has not been shown to eliminate  any
        such risk, especially as a number  of  suicide  bombers  have  been
        women. If the authorities have concerns, which  is  likely  on  the
        evidence, the appellants face a real risk of being detained at  the
        airport for questioning as to their  movements.  Roberts  Chenciner
        describes the nature of such questioning which is likely to involve
        both verbal and physical interrogation. The evidence shows that the
        threshold for the engagement of Article 3 is likely to  be  met  in
        such circumstances even if the authorities eventually  accept  that
        there is no involvement with the rebels and release the  appellants
        and allow them to return home.  Based upon the cumulative effect of
        the factors relevant to these appellants, and  notwithstanding  the
        rejection of the core aspects of their asylum claims,  the  appeals
        are allowed on Article 3 ECHR grounds.
