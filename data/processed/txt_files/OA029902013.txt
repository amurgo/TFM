Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Not represented

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent Johnny Cassel Chambers, whom I shall  refer  to  as  the
    appellant as he was before the First-tier Tribunal,  is  a  citizen  of
    Jamaica and his date of birth is 22 April 1966.  He made an application
    to enter the UK as a partner and the applicant was refused by  the  ECO
    in Kingston on 7 December 2012.  The application was refused solely  on
    maintenance  grounds.   It  was  not  accepted  that  the   appellant's
    partner's,  Anne  Marie  Fayne,  income  was  sufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

The Background

2.   The appellant appealed and his appeal was allowed by Judge of  the  FtT
    Woodhouse in a determination which was promulgated  on  16  April  2014
    following a hearing on 18 March 2014.  The Secretary of State  made  an
    application for permission to appeal and  this  was  granted  by  Judge
    Hollingsworth in a decision of 23 May 2014.  The grounds seeking  leave
    to appeal assert that the FtT made a material misdirection  in  finding
    that there were compelling circumstances and yet  failing  to  identify
    what these are.  It is argued that the Judge did not adequately  reason
    why  the  circumstances  were  exceptional  or  why  the  decision  was
    unjustifiably harsh.

3.    I  heard  oral  submissions  from  Mr  T  Melvin.    The   appellant's
    representatives did not attend the hearing before me and  nor  did  the
    sponsor.  The findings of the FtT are contained within paragraphs 45 to
    56 and read as follows:


         "45. In addressing the appellant's case I note that the decision to
             refuse his application was taken on 7 December 2012.   It  was
             based solely on the sponsor's  financial  circumstances.   The
             respondent accepted all other aspects of the appellant's case.
              The relationship was accepted as genuine  and  subsisting  as
             was the adequacy of the accommodation.


         46.  The respondent acknowledged that  the  sponsor  was  employed,
             that she had savings and the prospect that  she  had  provided
             for her old age by  establishing  a  pension  plan  with  both
             Scottish Widow and with Equitable Life all of  which  she  had
             provided for from her own income.  She had her own property in
             London which was of some significant value.


         47.  There was no doubt therefore  on  the  respondent's  part  the
             sponsor was someone who was financially sound  but  not  sound
             enough to have income at the date of decision of �18,600.  The
             shortfall could not be overcome because the  calculations  set
             out in the Rules require the figure for savings in  excess  of
             the �19,000 available to this appellant.

         48.  The pension provisions recorded as available in 2014 have  now
             been  revised  to  May  2016.   I  accept  that  this  was  an
             unintentional  error  on  the  sponsor's  part.   However  the
             evidence before me which I saw no reason  to  doubt  was  that
             �33,000 in cash would be available to  the  sponsor  when  she
             reaches the age of 55 in two years' time.

         Conclusion

         49.  Although the appellant's representatives made valiant  efforts
             to address  the  shortfall  to  which  the  respondent  refer,
             reducing it I accept to the sum of �307, it  is  not  disputed
             that the shortfall remains.  Therefore the appellant is unable
             to comply with paragraph EC-P.1.1.(d) of Appendix  FM  of  the
             Immigration Rules.

         50.  However I then went on to consider  whether  under  the  Rules
             there are any compelling circumstances that I am  required  to
             consider.

         51.  In addressing these circumstances I accept that the parties to
             this relationship are in middle age.  This is a late  marriage
             and a genuine relationship the respondent accepts.

         52.  The original application was made  in  October  2012.   In  an
             interview with the ECO on 7 December 2012 the  sponsor  stated
             that the marriage was intended for June/July 2013.

         53.  However despite a prompt decision by  the  ECO  a  delay  then
             ensued in the  review  of  this  appeal.   There  was  a  very
             substantial delay subsequently to list this before this appeal
             before the Tribunal which resulted in a further delay of  nine
             months.

         54.  In the period that elapsed since the application was made  the
             sponsor's employment  situation  has  improved  substantially.
             Details of  her  CareTech  employment  were  produced  at  the
             hearing.   They  were  not  disputed  by  Mr  Lenanton.    Her
             employment was confirmed that since  June  2013  she  has  now
             completed  her  provisional  employment  and  is  now  on  the
             permanent staff with an income  in  excess  of  �20,000.   She
             continues to have her savings.  Before me  she  stated  and  I
             accept  that  she  has  a  house  in  London  which  she   had
             conservatively valued at �250,000.  Her neighbour  is  seeking
             to sell a similar house for �330,000.  House prices in  London
             are increasing at a very considerable rate.  I have no  reason
             to doubt that such was  the  case.   I  also  note  that  this
             property is free of mortgage.

         55.  The sponsor has arranged  her  finances  so  that  she  has  a
             prospect of retiring at the age of 55 in two years' time.  She
             is not therefore a person scrapping around for funds.  She  is
             quite clearly highly regarded as an employee  and  financially
             sound, able to provide very well  indeed  for  this  appellant
             upon his arrival.

         56.   While  the  Presenting   Officer   maintains   that   another
             application should be made setting out the  sponsor's  present
             employment and her financial increments so as to  comply  with
             Appendix FM of the Rules I can see no reason why  this  couple
             should be obliged to do so.  They have waited patiently for  a
             decision so as to embark upon their  marriage  in  their  late
             years.  They have spent a period of eighteen months waiting an
             opportunity  to  have  their   case   heard.    In   all   the
             circumstances of this case I conclude that they should not now
             be required to go back  to  the  beginning  again  to  make  a
             further application and on this basis I found that  there  are
             compelling reasons why this appeal should be allowed."

Error of Law

4.   The FtT erred in allowing the appeal under the rules.  It  is  contrary
    to the findings at [49] and it is clear that the  appellant  could  not
    meet the maintenance requirements of rules.  However, in my  view,  the
    FtT intended to allow the appeal under Article 8 and this was  conceded
    by Mr Melvin.  The FtT found that there were compelling  circumstances.
    The issue is whether the decision (to allow the appeal under Article 8)
    is lawful and sustainable.   The  reasons  the  FtT  gave  for  finding
    compelling circumstances are that the parties are  in  middle  age  and
    their relationship is genuine.  In addition there had been a  delay  in
    considering the application and the British  citizen  sponsor,  at  the
    date of the hearing, was found to earn sufficient  funds  in  order  to
    satisfy the rules.  (She has savings, a pension and considerable equity
    in her home).

5.   This is an application for leave  to  enter  as  opposed  to  leave  to
    remain and EX.1. of the rules does not apply.   However,  it  is  still
    incumbent on the FtT to decide  whether  or  not  there  is  a  further
    Article 8 claim. It is not necessary to use the words "exceptional"  or
    "compelling" to describe the circumstances as long as that can be  said
    from the substance of the decision.   In  my  view,  the  FtT  did  not
    identify sufficiently compelling circumstances to grant  leave  outside
    the rules.  There was no weight attached to the fact that the appellant
    was not able to meet the requirement of the rules  and  the  legitimate
    aim (in this case which is  the  economic  well-being  of  the  country
    through the maintenance of immigration control).  In addition the Judge
    attached weight to the fact that the appellant could, at  the  date  of
    the hearing, meet the rules whilst because this is an  entry  clearance
    decision, it is  the  circumstances  pertaining  at  the  date  of  the
    decision and not the hearing which the Judge should have considered. In
    my view the reference to compelling circumstances was  a  reference  to
    post-decision evidence and the application of the  impermissible  "near
    miss" test.  This is a material error and  I  set  aside  the  decision
    pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 ( "the 2007 Act") I remake the decision  pursuant  to  Section
    12(2)(b)(ii) of the 2007 Act. There was no further evidence  relied  on
    by either party.

6.   The appellant cannot satisfy the rules and the issue is  whether  there
    is a further Article 8 claim.  The application is for the appellant  to
    join his partner here in the UK and there is an article  8  claim.  The
    first three questions in the guidance in Razgar, R (on the  Application
    of) v. SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 should be answered in the affirmative.   The
    decision in my view is necessary  in  the  interests  of  the  economic
    wellbeing of the country (the maintenance of immigration control).

7.   The appellant cannot satisfy the rules.  I accept  that  the  appellant
    and the sponsor are now (at least at the date of the hearing before the
    FtT) self-supporting. The maintenance requirement of the rules  is  not
    disproportionate  in  this  case  and  there  are  no  exceptional   or
    compelling circumstances.  The  delay  by  the  ECM  in  reviewing  the
    decision  of  the  ECO  does  not  in  my  view  amount  to  compelling
    circumstances.    The   decision   to   refuse   the   application   is
    proportionate, lawful and sustainable.

8.   In the light of the fact that the appellant did not attend the  hearing
    before me, it may be that he has decided to make a further  application
    for entry clearance on the basis of his partner's present salary.

The Decision

9.   The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

10.  The appeal is dismissed under Article  8  of  the  1950  Convention  on
    Human Rights.
