                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

1.   In this decision I will refer to  the  parties  by  their  designations
    before the First-tier Tribunal (FtT).

2.   The respondent  appeals  the  decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hillis  (the  Immigration  Judge)  to  allow  his  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse the appellant leave to  remain  in  the
    UK.  The Immigration Judge found  that  notwithstanding  the  appellant
    failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was  engaged.  He  found
    that the respondent had not been able to  show  that  the  interference
    with the appellant and his sponsor's family life was  proportionate  to
    the maintenance of  effective  immigration  control.   The  Immigration
    Judge's decision is dated 28 June 2015 and was promulgated  on  2  July
    2015.

3.   Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun gave the respondent permission to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal on 29 October 2015 because  the  Immigration  Judge
    appeared to have failed to make a proper finding  on  the  question  of
    whether it would be unjustifiably harsh to require  the  appellant  and
    sponsor to return to Pakistan, where they could continue  their  family
    life.  The grounds were at least arguable, in her view.

4.   The grounds criticised the Immigration Judge,  pointing  out,  that  no
    weight had been given to the public  interest  in  enforcing  effective
    immigration control.  The Immigration Judge  appeared  to  have  ridden
    roughshod over the requirements of the Immigration Rules and had failed
    to properly consider the requirements of the Rules, as well as the fact
    that it was not unjustifiably harsh for the appellant to  continue  his
    family life in Pakistan with the sponsor.  These amounted  to  material
    misdirections of law.  Article 8 does not oblige the UK to  accept  any
    person who wishes to form a family life in  the  UK  without  complying
    with the Immigration Rules.  The  obstacles  to  the  re-settlement  in
    Pakistan of the appellant and the sponsor were not insurmountable. Were
    they to do so, the couple could continue to enjoy their family life.

The Hearing

5.   The hearing was fairly brief.  A letter dated 16 March  2016  had  been
    submitted shortly before the hearing but was received  by  the  hearing
    centre on 18 March (the day  of  the  hearing).   In  that  letter  the
    appellant's representatives asserted that their client  had  a  "strong
    claim" on the basis that it would be  disproportionate  to  expect  the
    appellant to return to Pakistan and lodge a fresh application  when  it
    was clear that all the Immigration Rules would be met.

6.   Mr Aziz attended the hearing and made oral submissions on his  client's
    behalf as well as relying on the letter referred to.  He said that  the
    appellant had been in the UK for  five  years,  that  the  sponsor  was
    earning over the ï¿½18,600 threshold required but he  had  not  "put  the
    money in the bank" so that there were two missing entries in  the  bank
    statements submitted to the respondent.  This meant  that  he  did  not
    comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Rules.   He   described   the
    requirements that his client go  back  to  Pakistan  to  make  a  fresh
    application for entry clearance as a "waste of  time"  and  serving  no
    purpose.  Accordingly, the judge was "right" to allow the appeal  under
    Article 8, having regard to the leading case of Razgar [2004] UKHL  27.
    The appellant had clearly established a family life in the UK and based
    on the facts there was no purpose served in splitting up the family.

7.   Mr Diwnycz submitted that the sponsor could not  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules as he had not deposited the money into the account evidencing the
    necessary funds for the purposes of those  Rules.   There  was  nothing
    "compelling" about the case.  It had been  wrong  for  the  Immigration
    Judge to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

8.   At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as  to  whether  there
    was a material error of law and if so what should be done about it.

Discussion

9.   An assessment under Article 8 requires a two stage approach:

    (1)  Whether the appellant meets the requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules?


    (2)  Whether there are exceptional or compelling circumstances  in  the
         case making it necessary to go beyond those Rules?

10.  The Immigration Judge correctly summarised  the  respondent's  case  in
    paragraphs 15-16 as follows:


    (1)  that it was simply a matter of choice for the  appellant  and  his
         sponsor to live in the UK and there were no insurmountable or  very
         significant obstacles preventing their return to Pakistan;


    (2)  there were no compelling circumstances requiring the claim  to  be
         considered outside the Immigration Rules.   Having  regard  to  the
         recent case of SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ  387  the  appellant  could
         return to Pakistan and make a fresh application.   His  wife  could
         travel there with him once she had paid her "cash" wages  into  her
         bank account for the relevant six-month period.

11.  Having found that the appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration  Rules  in  paragraphs  23  and  24  of  his  decision  the
    Immigration Judge failed to go on and ask whether it was  necessary  to
    go beyond those Rules.  He should have asked himself whether there were
    compelling circumstances requiring him to do so.   There  plainly  were
    not and it was wrong to characterise the requirement of  the  appellant
    to return to Pakistan, from whence he came in November 2011, to make  a
    fresh application, as a "significant interference with  the  appellant"
    or with his family life with the sponsor.  There was no adequate  basis
    for the Immigration Judge to conclude that it would "put  a  strain  on
    the marriage" as the respondent  had  submitted,  if  the  parties  did
    decide to part for a few months this would  be  a  matter  of  personal
    choice.  The respondent was not bound to facilitate family life in  the
    UK amongst those who did not comply with the Immigration Rules.  In  my
    view the respondent correctly submitted  that  this  was  a  matter  of
    choice.

Conclusions

12.  I do not seek to belittle the inconvenience and expense  to  which  the
    appellant will be put by having to return to Pakistan.   However,  this
    must be seen in the context of the need to have a firm but fair  system
    of  immigration  control.  For  the  reasons  already  set   out,   the
    Immigration Judge failed to adopt the two-stage approach which has been
    suggested by a number of recent authorities, including  SS  Congo,  and
    therefore erred. The Immigration Judge treated this  case  as  a  "near
    miss", although he did not expressly say so.  He was wrong to  conclude
    that the expense of leaving the  UK  for  a  period  of  months  was  a
    "compelling reason" or a "significant obstacle" against doing  so.   In
    addition,  the  Immigration  Judge  failed  to  consider  properly  the
    provisions of Section 117A-D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 adequately.  Those provisions explicitly recognised the public
    interest in the need for integration of those coming to the UK  and  to
    have regard to the need to ensure the economic well-being  of  the  UK,
    which includes  meeting  minimum  financial  thresholds.   Furthermore,
    little  weight  should  attach  to  private  life  formed  where  one's
    immigration status is precarious (see Section  117B  (5)  of  the  2002
    Act).  The appellant came to the UK as a Tier 4 Migrant.  He was  never
    led to believe that he would be entitled to leave to remain in the  UK.
    The Immigration Judge appears to have paid little regard to the  public
    interest in maintaining effective immigration control.  The  respondent
    was entitled to take the view that until the  appellant  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules there was every  reason  to  fear
    that the appellant would become a burden on taxpayers.

13.  The appellant having established a family life in the UK  knowing  that
    he needed to return to Pakistan  at  the  end  of  his  leave  had  not
    established a proper basis for remaining in the UK by virtue of Article
    8.

14.  Having regard to the wider public  interest  explicitly  recognised  by
    the Immigration Rules and by Sections 117A-D of the  2002  Act  it  was
    wrong for the Immigration Judge to conclude that the appellant fell  to
    be considered under Article 8 in circumstances where he did not  comply
    with  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.    It   was   not
    disproportionate to require the appellant to  return  to  Pakistan  and
    make a proper application.  It would be likely that his wife, who is  a
    UK  national,  could  accompany  him  to  Pakistan  without  any  undue
    hardship.

Notice of Decision

15.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law.  I set aside that decision and  substitute  the  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal which is to dismiss the appeal against the  respondent's
    decision to refuse leave to remain.





16.  No anonymity direction was made by the FTT  and  I  make  no  anonymity
    direction.
