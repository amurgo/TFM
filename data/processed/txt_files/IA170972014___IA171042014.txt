Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr D Balroop, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan born respectively on 13th  July
    1986 and 2nd July 1982.  They had submitted a combined application  for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants
    under the points-based system  (PBS)  and  for  a  biometric  residence
    permit (BRP).  Their immigration  histories  were  slightly  different.
    The first Appellant Mr Asim was  granted  leave  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom on 13th September 2011 and the second Appellant Mr Ali on  27th
    January 2010.  Thereafter their leaves were extended as initially  Tier
    4 (General) Students and then as Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrants.
    They have never overstayed their visas and their applications were made
    in time.

 2. By Notices of Refusal dated respectively 25th March 2014 and 26th March
    2014 their applications were refused.  For the purpose of  this  appeal
    the content of those Notice of Refusals are relevant.   The  Appellants
    had been separately interviewed and findings made by  the  interviewing
    officer in the Notice of Refusal as to the  credibility  of  the  money
    available for investment, the Appellants'  business  plans  and  market
    research, and their previous educational and business experience.

 3. The Appellants appealed and the appeal came before Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Majid sitting at Taylor House on 1st October 2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on 9th October 2014  the  Appellants'  appeal
    was allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 4. On 15th October 2014 the Secretary of State lodged Grounds of Appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  Those grounds acknowledge that  whilst  the  issue
    was narrow and that whilst the judge is required to  give  reasons  and
    they need not be lengthy it was submitted that  the  reasoning  in  the
    determination was inadequate.  They contended that paragraph 16 of  the
    determination appeared to be the  only  paragraph  where  reasons  were
    proffered and it was unclear as to how the requirements  of  a  complex
    Rule had been fulfilled.  It was further unclear as to  why  the  judge
    found the Appellants to be credible  and  the  business  genuine.   The
    grounds noted that the Appellants had  been  awarded  no  points  under
    Appendix A by the Respondent because she did not accept the genuineness
    of the business.  That being the case the judge should have turned  his
    mind as to whether the documents before him  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraphs 41 and 41-SD of Appendix A.

 5.  On  24th  November  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted
    permission to appeal.  Judge Parkes concluded  that  the  determination
    was short on reasoning and explanation and the grounds were arguable.

 6. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  This is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  For the purpose of continuity throughout  the  proceedings  the
    Secretary of State is referred to herein as the Respondent and Mr  Asim
    and  Mr  Ali  as  the  Appellants.   The  Appellants  appear  by  their
    instructed Counsel Mr Balroop.  The Secretary of State appears  by  her
    Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Bramble.

Submissions and Discussion

 7. Mr Bramble takes me to the two Notices  of  Refusal.   He  acknowledges
    that the Appellants were interviewed on different days and  that  there
    are slight variations in the conclusions  reached  in  the  Notices  of
    Refusal but the issues  with  regard  to  the  credit  ability  of  the
    Appellants to become directors and invest money and  the  viability  of
    their business plans, market research and business experience were  all
    raised substantially in the Notices of Refusal.  He  submits  that  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal is short in  the  extreme  and
    that only the briefest findings of fact are made at  paragraph  13  and
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  has  failed  to  grapple  with  the
    refusal and to give logical and sensible reasons  in  response  to  the
    refusal of the Secretary of State to award  points  to  the  Appellants
    under Appendix A and as such there is a material error of law and  that
    the decision should  be  set  aside  and  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for rehearing.

 8. Mr Balroop submits that there is a two  tier  test  that  the  Tribunal
    needed to consider namely the reasons for refusal and what  was  before
    the court and thereafter what steps  should  have  been  taken  by  the
    Immigration Judge.  He points out that the basis of  refusal  is  under
    paragraph 245DD(h) and (i) and that the approach adopted regarding  the
    credibility of funds is a genuineness test and that  the  Secretary  of
    State found Mr Asim credible and Mr Ali not  credible  following  their
    interviews.  He takes me to Judge Majid's  determination  pointing  out
    that at paragraph 6 the judge has indicated he has considered  all  the
    documents and taken into account the  oral  evidence  tendered  to  the
    Tribunal.  He takes me to paragraph 10 of  the  determination  and  the
    contention that evidence has been produced to show that the  Appellants
    have ï¿½50,000 in their account to  be  deployed  in  the  business.   He
    emphasises that the money is not third parties' funds but available  to
    the Appellants.  He submits that with Mr Asim having already been found
    credible by the Secretary of State that whilst acknowledging  that  the
    determination is brief that the  judge  has  touched  on  all  relevant
    points and found Mr Ali credible.  He submits that the judge has looked
    at all the issues, read them and that the only  issue  outstanding  was
    whether they are genuine entrepreneurs and that the judge was  entitled
    to make the findings that he has and that there is no material error of
    law disclosed within the determination.

 9. Mr Bramble responds by pointing out that it is incumbent upon the judge
    to go through the Notice of  Refusal  letter  not  just  the  financial
    aspect  but  points  out  that  there  are  several  issues  e.g.   the
    credibility of market research which just have not been  looked  at  by
    the judge and that he does not engage with the  reasonableness  of  the
    business plan.  He submits that without a proper analysis it  is  quite
    impossible for the judge to have made the findings that he has.

10. Mr Balroop responds pointing  out  that  he  notes  that  the  evidence
    regarding the business plans were prepared by an  accountant  and  that
    the judge had evidence regarding same which is referred to at paragraph
    7 in the determination.  He reminds me that the  judge  heard  evidence
    and found that Mr Ali was credible and therefore submits that there  is
    a finding overall that both Appellants are credible and that the appeal
    should be dismissed.

The Law

11.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

12. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of the   evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent  with    truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

13. It is important to emphasise that I am not rehearing this matter.  I am
    purely considering whether or not there is a material error of  law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  I acknowledge  that  it
    is not a requirement for every document or  piece  of  evidence  to  be
    referred to by a First-tier Tribunal Judge but it is incumbent  upon  a
    judge to make findings and to give reasons for  his  findings.   It  is
    quite permissible for a judge  to  state  that  he  has  read  all  the
    documents and heard all the evidence  providing  he  then  goes  on  to
    analyse the relevant factors and to make findings.  That has not  taken
    place in this case.  All the judge had done is indicated that he  finds
    Mr Ali to be credible (for reasons  which  themselves  are  not  easily
    understood).  He has not gone on to analyse any  of  the  major  issues
    that were raised before the Tribunal.   It  is  not  sufficient  as  Mr
    Balroop  valiantly  submits  merely  to  suggest  that  the  judge  has
    considered all factors in reaching his determination.  He may have done
    so but he has to give reasons.

14. In this  instant  case  unlike  many  applications  by  entrepreneurial
    migrants there is not a challenge of the relevant funds being those  of
    a third party.  What is challenged is set out in considerable detail in
    the Notices of Refusal.  They include in the case of Mr Ali whether the
    money deposited is for the  purpose  of  investment  in  the  business.
    Generally they address the  areas  of  the  seeming  complete  lack  of
    failure of the Appellants to have carried out market research, to  have
    provided a sustainable business plan and to have  provided  a  detailed
    analysis of the business contracts that they hope to  embrace.   Whilst
    the previous educational experience is accepted of the Appellants their
    lack of business experience is challenged and whilst I acknowledge that
    it would be harsh to criticise an Appellant who  has  had  no  previous
    opportunity to obtain business experience merely because he has not had
    it that has to be linked to  the  overall  viability  of  the  business
    proposal.

15. I emphasise that I am not considering these issues before me today.  It
    is possible that  they  may  be  fully  explained,  that  the  business
    proposal is both viable and well thought through.  If that is the  case
    it is for the Appellants to show that to the Tribunal.  That  has  been
    made abundantly clear by the Notices of Refusal.  Those issues are  not
    addressed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   As  such  the  judge  has
    failed completely to consider the refusal to  award  points  under  the
    heading Attributes: Appendix A.  The failure to  do  so  constitutes  a
    material error of law.  Failure to look at  the  whole  fabric  of  the
    application by the Immigration Judge is wrong and this is the  approach
    that has been  adopted  by  the  Secretary  of  State  quite  properly.
    Further there is no indication as  to  whether  or  not  the  documents
    before the Immigration Judge met the requirements at paragraph  41  and
    41-SD of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and there is  no  analysis
    whatsoever of this documentation.  In all the  determination  fails  to
    produce any detailed findings and as such constitutes a material  error
    of law.

16. I would emphasise that is not  to  say  that  the  Appellants  may  not
    succeed.  What they have to do however is to show that  they  meet  the
    requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   In  such  circumstances  the
    correct approach is  to  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and to remit this matter to be heard on  the  first  available
    date 28 days hence at Taylor House before any other  Immigration  Judge
    than Immigration Judge Majid.  It may be that the  Appellants  need  to
    get their house in order.  To that end I attach a direction with regard
    to the finding of an up-to-date bundle.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge discloses a material error  of
law and is set aside.  The matter is remitted for rehearing at Taylor  House
on the first available date 28  days  hence  before  any  other  Immigration
Judge other than Immigration Judge Majid with an ELH of two hours.

That it be directed that the Appellants do serve the Secretary of State  and
lodge at the Tribunal an up-to-date bundle  of  documents  upon  which  they
seek  to  rely  in  support  of  their  application  at  least  seven   days
prehearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
