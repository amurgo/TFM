               The Queen on the application of Ali Ahmed Agha
                                                                   Applicant

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                        Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley


For a document to be a false document  under  the  Immigration  Rules  there
must have been an element of dishonesty in its creation and if this  is  not
immediately obvious in a case of an inaccurate document  then  that  element
must be engaged with in any refusal.



            Application for judicial review: substantive decision


Having considered all documents lodged and having heard the parties'
respective representatives, Mr D Sills, of counsel, instructed by Lawise
Solicitors, on behalf of the Applicant and Ms N Parsons, of counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the Respondent
at a hearing at Field House, London on 4 January 2017


Decision: the application for judicial review succeeds and the Applicant  is
granted relief in the terms set forth in [45] of this judgment




JUDGE LINDSLEY


    this is an application for judicial review by Mr Ali Ahmed  Agha.   The
    decision under challenge is that of the Entry Clearance Officer in  Abu
    Dhabi who refused a visit visa on 6th  September  2015.   A  pre-action
    Protocol letter was sent  on  5th  November  2015  and  the  respondent
    replied on 23rd November 2015  maintaining  the  original  decision  to
    refuse the visit visa.  Judicial review proceedings were  commenced  in
    time on 4th December 2015 and an acknowledgement of service  was  filed
    on 19th January 2016.


 2. Permission for judicial review was initially refused on the  papers  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins in a decision dated 27th January 2016  but
    then granted after an oral hearing on 19th April 2016 by Upper Tribunal
    Judge McGeachy on the basis that there was a lack of  information  that
    the entry stamp was forged which arguably meant that the  decision  was
    unlawful.

 3. Upper Tribunal Judge Keki? extended time for the respondent  to  supply
    detailed grounds of defence until 8th July 2016 and on  this  date  the
    respondent provided these and  a  bundle.   The  applicant  provided  a
    skeleton argument on 15th December 2016 and a bundle on  23rd  December
    2016 for the full judicial review hearing.  On 23rd December  2016  the
    respondent supplied a  schedule  of  costs  to  the  Tribunal  and  the
    applicant,  and  today  the  applicant  provided  a  schedule  to   the
    respondent and the Tribunal.

 4. The  surrounding  circumstances  of  the  case  are  as  follows.   The
    applicant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 4th  November  1991,
    and so is now 25 years old.  He visited the United Kingdom as a tourist
    in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and, on the  information  before  the  Tribunal,
    complied with his visa restrictions.  On 3rd September 2010 he  entered
    the UK with entry clearance as a student  valid  until  15th  September
    2012.  His leave was then extended in  the  same  capacity  until  30th
    November 2015.

 5. However, on 16th April 2014 the applicant's leave was curtailed  as  he
    had ceased to  attend  his  course  at  Middlesex  University  and  his
    sponsorship was withdrawn.  He was required by the respondent to  leave
    the United Kingdom by 30th November 2014.  Both parties accept that the
    applicant left the United Kingdom before this date and thus that he has
    never overstayed in the UK nor broken the conditions of his leave.

 6. On 28th November 2014 the applicant  left  the  United  Kingdom  on  an
    evening flight to  Pakistan  which  arrived  in  the  morning  of  29th
    November 2014.  The applicant maintains  on  receipt  of  the  decision
    under challenge that he realised at that  point  (and  not  previously)
    that his passport had been incorrectly stamped on arrival  in  Pakistan
    with a stamp dated 29th October 2014.  Both  parties  accept  that  the
    applicant in fact arrived in Pakistan on 29th November 2014.

 7. The applicant applied for entry clearance to visit his brother  in  the
    United Kingdom for a visit on 20th August 2015.  In this application he
    wrongly stated that he had re-entered Pakistan on  29th  October  2014.
    He has explained this as follows: he says that  this  happened  because
    the agent who completed the application form on  his  behalf  took  the
    date of his entry into Pakistan from the stamp in his passport and that
    he, the applicant, did not  notice  the  error  before  he  signed  and
    submitted the application form.

 8. The respondent refused the application  on  6th  September  2015  under
    paragraph V3.6 of Appendix V of the Immigration Rules on the basis that
    the applicant had used a false  document  as  a  document  verification
    report  verified  the  entry  stamp  as  false  to  a  high  degree  of
    probability.

 9. As a result of the nature of the decision to refuse the applicant entry
    clearance it is stated in  the  refusal  that  the  applicant  faces  a
    possible  ten  year  period  of  automatic  refusal   of   any   future
    applications.

10. On 5th November 2015 the applicant sent the respondent evidence that he
    had returned to Pakistan on 29th November 2015 in the  form  of  flight
    bookings, boarding pass and luggage tag, a  letter  from  the  FIA  and
    arrival footage and requested a review  of  the  decision.   The  Entry
    Clearance Manager reviewed the refusal and upheld it on  23rd  November
    2015.

11. It is the decision of 6th September  2015  supplemented  by  the  entry
    clearance manager's review of 23rd November 2015 that is the subject of
    this judicial review.

12. In summary, the grounds of challenge  are  as  follows.   It  is  first
    contended  that  the  decision  of  the  respondent  is  unlawful   and
    irrational because there is a failure to  consider  whether  the  wrong
    Pakistani arrival stamp was simply given in error given the lack of any
    possible purpose behind any attempt to amend it as  the  applicant  had
    not overstayed in the  United  Kingdom  even  if  he  was  recorded  as
    returning to Pakistan on the correct date.

13. It is, as I have already stated, accepted by all that the applicant  in
    fact returned to Pakistan on 29th November 2014.  As this was prior  to
    the date when his leave to  remain  as  a  student  was  curtailed  to,
    whether he went back on that date or on the date in the passport,  29th
    October 2014, he was not an overstayer.  The so-called  "rolling  back"
    of the date of his arrival would therefore serve no immigration purpose
    whatsoever.  The applicant had complied with immigration control at all
    other times and was leaving the United Kingdom voluntarily in line with
    an arrangement made with the respondent,  and  so,  it  is  argued,  it
    should  have  been  appreciated  he  had  no  propensity   to   violate
    immigration laws or a history of so doing.

14. It is submitted that the respondent therefore erred  as  there  was  an
    unlawful failure to consider whether the stamp was obtained erroneously
    rather than  improperly.  The  definition  of  false  document,  it  is
    contended by the applicant, requires dishonesty  at  some  stage,  even
    with  a  document,  and  this  element  of  dishonesty  had  not   been
    entertained and engaged with by the respondent in the refusal.

15. Secondly the applicant contends that the decision is unlawful for  want
    of giving any reasons in relation to this issue of attempted deception.
     It is simply asserted in the  decision  and  in  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager review that the date stamp is incorrect  and  therefore  it  is
    obtained by fraud.  This is not logical or sufficient reasoning if  the
    full meaning of "false" as set out above is appreciated.

16. Thirdly the applicant contends that the decision is in  breach  of  the
    respondent's  policy.   The  respondent's  policy  on  false  documents
    requires "positive evidence" of  dishonesty.   The  wrong  stamp  could
    simply be an innocent mistake caused by one dial  on  the  stamp  being
    inadvertently moved, and thus not obtained by dishonesty.  According to
    the policy, factual errors and not being  satisfied  the  applicant  is
    telling the truth are not enough to find dishonesty or  deception,  and
    this policy has, it is argued, therefore not been applied.

17. The evidence of Mr Martin Banks (an Immigration Liaison  Manager  based
    in Islamabad) obtained  by  the  respondent  in  the  course  of  these
    proceedings is said by the applicant not to be relevant as it  was  not
    available at the time of the decision-making and so cannot be  used  to
    rationally support the validity of that decision-making in retrospect.

18. It  is  further  contended  by  the  applicant  that  the  decision  is
    procedurally unfair.  It is noted that the applicant has  no  right  of
    appeal.  It is said in this context that an applicant must be given  an
    opportunity to provide any innocent explanations he may have  for  what
    may be prima facie false documents, in an interview before  a  decision
    is made.  It is contended that an Entry Clearance Manager review  after
    the event of a refusal is not a sufficient remedy because material that
    was not before the original officer at the time of decision  cannot  be
    properly considered if the matter is to proceed to a judicial review.

19. Finally, the applicant contends that the decision is  unlawful  because
    the wrong standard of proof has been applied.  It is contended that the
    criminal standard is appropriate given the draconian consequences of  a
    fraud allegation. In the alternative it is  also  argued  even  if  the
    civil standard is the appropriate standard robust evidence is  required
    and in these circumstances there was no such robust evidence before the
    respondent to properly and lawful conclude the applicant had  submitted
    a dishonest false document.

20. In response, in summary, the respondent says that  the  passport  is  a
    false document because it contains information which is not correct and
    that the definition of a false document is simply one that is incorrect
    and does not involve a contention of dishonesty.

21. In submissions, however, Ms Parsons, whilst not conceding  this  point,
    accepted that that might be a difficult argument in the light  of  what
    is set out in AA (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2010] EWCA Civ 773.  If the definition of false document  goes  beyond
    one which simply contains a statement of  factually  wrong  information
    then it is argued for the respondent that it was rationally open to her
    to refuse the applicant on the basis of the  information  contained  in
    the witness statement  of  Mr  Martin  Banks,  an  Immigration  Liaison
    Manager based in Islamabad.

22. Mr Banks notes that given the way in which Pakistani arrival stamps are
    physically  constructed  it  is  unlikely  that  there  would   be   an
    inadvertent stamping of a wrong date.  He also notes that  there  is  a
    second security check at which a senior Immigration Officer checks that
    date stamps do not  contain  errors.   He  points  out  that  Pakistani
    Immigration Officers are known to take bribes  to  "roll  back"  stamps
    (sometimes for sums as little as the equivalent of �3.50), and that  UK
    officials had provided evidence of some 185 such cases of  "roll  back"
    stamps to Pakistan's Federal Investigations Agency in 2016 alone.

23. It has been argued today by Ms Parsons that it was not an obligation of
    the respondent to set out this material in a refusal notice and that to
    require this to be done would be an over-onerous obligation.   She  has
    argued that whilst there  was  not  a  lot  of  information  about  the
    improper obtaining of the stamp in the decision the  use  of  the  word
    "falsify" on the second page of the refusal suggests  some  element  of
    human agency as does the use of the term  "non-genuine"  in  the  entry
    clearance manager's review letter.

24. Ultimately it is argued for the respondent that  the  refusal  contains
    sufficient material in terms  of  reasoning  for  the  decision  to  be
    lawful, particularly as there was no evidence of an innocent mistake by
    the Pakistani authorities in the context of the  applicant  having  put
    the wrong date on his application form and in the context of  it  being
    immaterial  as  to  whether  the  falsification  was   in   any   sense
    advantageous to him or material to the  application  according  to  the
    wording of paragraph V3.6 of Appendix V to the Immigration Rules.

25. Ms Parsons has also defended  the  system  of  a  decision  without  an
    interview as being perfectly lawful and argued that the entry clearance
    manager's review can provide an acceptable remedy  for  the  applicant.
    She argued that it is open to the entry clearance manager to  change  a
    decision made on receipt of further evidence submitted by an  applicant
    after  a  decision  contending  a  false  document  has  been  used  is
    communicated to that applicant.

26. Ms Parsons argued that to require the respondent to interview all those
    who are to be refused where an allegation of deception is made would be
    extremely onerous on the respondent and the evidence of Mr Banks  gives
    some small indication even in this narrow field  of  the  numbers  that
    might be involved.  There is no legal  authority  which  suggests  that
    deception refusals where there was no interview prior to the issuing of
    a decision are insufficient. There is no authority which suggests  that
    the respondent is not entitled to  make  a  decision  on  the  material
    before her in cases involving deception,  and  it  is  clear  that  the
    respondent acts lawfully so long  as  all  such  material  is  properly
    considered applying the correct standard of proof.

27. Ms Parsons submits that the evidential burden for showing deception was
    met by the material before the respondent at the time of decision,  and
    that the legal burden could also be seen as  being  met  when  all  the
    material before the respondent in this case is considered.

28. My conclusions are as follows.

29. It is first necessary to consider whether a false document is one which
    requires any element of dishonesty.  In reaching my conclusions on this
    issue I have been guided by what was said by the Court of Appeal in the
    case of AA (Nigeria).   I  note  that  in  that  case,  which  was  one
    primarily concerning the definition  of  a  false  representation,  the
    court  found  that  they  should  align   the   definition   of   false
    representation with that of false document.

30. At paragraph 67 it is said that:

    "It is plain that a false document  is  one  that  tells  a  lie  about
         itself.  Of course it is possible for a person to  make  use  of  a
         false document (for instance a counterfeit currency note, but  that
         example, used for its clarity, is rather distant from  the  context
         of this discussion) in  total  ignorance  of  its  falsity  and  in
         perfect honesty.  But the document  itself  is  dishonest.   It  is
         highly likely  therefore  that  where  an  applicant  uses  in  all
         innocence a false document  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  entry
         clearance, or leave to enter or to remain, it is because some other
         party, it might be a parent, or sponsor, or agent, has  dishonestly
         promoted the use of that document.  The response of  a  requirement
         of  mandatory  refusal  is  entirely  understandable  in   such   a
         situation.  The mere fact that a dishonest document has  been  used
         for such an important application is  understandably  a  sufficient
         reason for a mandatory refusal.  That is  why  the  Rule  expressly
         emphasises that it applies  'whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's
         knowledge'."

31. I conclude that it is contemplated in the above paragraph by the  Court
    of Appeal that there had been dishonesty in the creating of  the  false
    document at some point although not necessarily to the knowledge of the
    applicant.  I find that this  position  as  to  the  meaning  of  false
    document is supported by further statements later in the judgment in AA
    (Nigeria).

32. At paragraph 71, citing debates in Parliament prior to the  passing  of
    the legislation, it is recorded that Lord Bassam said as  follows:  "We
    mean a document that is forged  or  has  been  altered  to  give  false
    information.  If people submit such documents, our belief is that  they
    should be refused..."

33. Again, at paragraph 73 it is said as follows:

    "It is abundantly clear from that, in  my  judgment,  that  'false'  in
         relation to both 'representations' and 'documents' is being used in
         the same way and as requiring dishonesty, although not  necessarily
         in the applicant himself."

34. For a document to be a  false  document  under  the  provision  of  the
    Immigration Rules at V3.6(a) of  Appendix  V  I  find,  relying  on  AA
    (Nigeria), there must  have  been  an  element  of  dishonesty  in  its
    creation and if this is  not  immediately  obvious  in  a  case  of  an
    inaccurate document then that element  must  be  engaged  with  in  any
    refusal.

35. Applying these conclusions from AA (Nigeria) in the Court of Appeal  to
    the facts of this case I start from the position that a wrong date in a
    passport does not necessarily arise due to an element of dishonesty  or
    due to it having been altered by someone, and therefore I find that  it
    does not immediately of itself reveal dishonesty. This  is  because  it
    can arise due to the accidental changing of the wheel on the date stamp
    and human error in the checking processes.

36. It is clear the respondent understands and knows that date  stamps  can
    inadvertently be turned to the wrong point on the dial.  This is why Mr
    Banks in his statement engages with the likelihood of  that  happening.
    It is clear also from the statement of Mr Banks that stamps  have  been
    redesigned to make this less likely  to  happen  since  this  applicant
    returned to Pakistan.

37. There is a second check by another  immigration  officer  on  entry  to
    Pakistan, and whilst this makes it unlikely  that  a  stamp  which  has
    inadvertently been wrongly  endorsed  would  pass  through  immigration
    control it clearly does not make it impossible.  Human error may always
    occur.  Thus in this factual scenario,  in  order  to  properly  refuse
    under this provision of the Immigration Rules, I find there  needed  to
    be some consideration as to whether  there  was  dishonest  conduct  by
    someone in relation to the wrong date endorsement.

38. The decision made by the respondent I find  did  not  contemplate  that
    there was a need for  such  engagement  with  whether  there  had  been
    dishonest conduct by someone.  The decision reflects a  position  where
    if the date was incorrect then that sufficed for it to be false.  In  a
    simple linguistic sense this is of course correct but  it  is  not  the
    sense which I have found to be the relevant one for determining whether
    a refusal of this type based on submission of a false document  can  be
    lawfully made under paragraph V3.6 of Appendix  V  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

39. I find nothing in what is said either in the refusal of  6th  September
    2016 or in the Entry Clearance Manager's review letter which  indicates
    consideration or  explanation  of  dishonesty.   The  documents  simply
    recount the fact that the applicant did not enter on the date which  is
    endorsed in his passport.  This is of course agreed by everyone  to  be
    correct  but  there  is  no  consideration  of  whether  the  date  was
    dishonestly incorrectly  endorsed,  and  thus  of  this  vital  further
    element in whether the passport thereby properly amounted  to  a  false
    document.

40. As such I find that the applicant was not given even the  gist  of  the
    respondent's understanding as to why he had been dishonest  or  why  it
    was believed by the respondent someone else had been dishonest.

41. Perhaps if the document verification report had been  appended  to  the
    decision or the Entry Clearance Manager's review  (which  it  was  not)
    this might have provided some reasoning on this issue as in very  short
    form in this  document  there  is  an  engagement  with  the  issue  of
    dishonesty.  In that document it says  the  applicant  "had  improperly
    obtained Pakistan entry endorsement in his passport in order to deceive
    UK immigration and hide his travel history". However, as I  have  said,
    the document verification report does not form part of the decision and
    was not provided to the applicant until after he had commenced judicial
    review proceedings. I also observe that even if this reasoning had been
    included in the decision, to be lawfully sufficient it  ought  to  have
    been explained how  the  changed  endorsement  would  have  hidden  the
    applicant's travel history or deceived UK immigration control when  his
    arrangements for return had been  made  with  and  were  known  to  the
    respondent.

42. As such I find  that  the  decision  under  challenge  is  unlawful  in
    refusing the applicant under V3.6 of  Appendix  V  of  the  Immigration
    Rules for want of reasons engaging with the essential requirement  that
    the document could only be false if an element of  dishonesty  at  some
    point in the creation of the inaccurate date endorsement, as opposed to
    simple mistake, was identified.

43. In relation to the other issues raised by the applicant I do  not  find
    that the respondent  acted  unlawfully  in  failing  to  interview  the
    applicant prior to making a decision and I am satisfied that  an  Entry
    Clearance Manager  review  properly  conducted  rationally  considering
    further evidence can  provide  a  proper  remedy.  I  do  not  find  it
    necessary to go into issues of standards and burdens of proof as I have
    found the respondent has not engaged with  the  full  definition  of  a
    false document in the refusal, and has therefore failed to give  lawful
    reasons for her decision and this suffices for me grant  the  applicant
    the remedy he seeks.  If I had done I would not,  however,  have  found
    that a criminal standard of proof would  have  been  relevant  in  this
    case.

44. I therefore find it appropriate to grant judicial review in  this  case
    due to the decision lacking proper  and  sufficient  reasoning  on  the
    issue of  whether  the  applicant  had  submitted  a  falsely  endorsed
    passport. It goes without saying  that  allegations  of  use  of  false
    documents are serious ones and it is to be expected therefore that some
    reasons, sometimes referred to as the gist of the case, should be given
    for the conclusion that the document  is  false.  As  set  out  in  the
    refusal notice under challenge,  future  applications  may  be  refused
    under paragraph 320(7B)  and  paragraph  V3.7  of  Appendix  V  of  the
    Immigration Rules if an  applicant  has  submitted  a  false  document.
    Indeed,  the  word  "may"  in  that  context  might  be  considered  an
    understatement as the refusal would in fact be mandatory  if  deception
    had been used. I do not regard the giving of such` simple reasons as an
    onerous requirement on the respondent.

IT IS ORDERED THAT:

45. The respondent's decision of 6th September 2015 supplemented by that of
    23rd November 2015 is quashed.

Costs

46. In relation to costs the respondent  will  pay  the  applicant's  costs
    which I have summarily assessed as amounting to �12,218 of which �5,540
    are Counsel's fees and court fees.

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

MS PARSONS:

47. Can I ask for seven days to review the position?  I  am  not  going  to
    make an application now.



JUDGE LINDSLEY:

48. In that circumstance I will refuse and you can approach  the  Court  of
    Appeal.  I think this is more  likely  to  be  successful  in  speeding
    things  along.   In  the  absence  of  an  immediate  application   for
    permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal I refuse permission as I do
    not assess the case raises any questions of law of  major  significance
    or believe that I have erred in law in granting judicial review in this
    application.
