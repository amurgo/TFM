Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Kandola, Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    None


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Immigration History

 1. The Appellant in this appeal  was  the  Respondent  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing.  However, for ease of reference,  the  Appellant  and
    Respondent are hereafter referred to as they were before the First-tier
    Tribunal.  Therefore Mr Hussain is referred to as the Appellant and the
    Secretary of State is referred to as the Respondent.


 2. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan, whose date of birth  is  8
    August 1932. His appeal against the decision dated 17 September 2013 of
    the Respondent, to refuse to vary his leave to remain and to remove him
    to Pakistan was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Roopnarine-Davies
    (the Judge) under Article 8 ECHR in a determination promulgated  on  10
    March 2014.


 3. As to background, the Appellant came on a family visit to the UK to see
    his son, Mr MH Ravjani, the Sponsor. He has a visit visa which is valid
    from 12 July 2012 to 12  July  2017.  The  Sponsor  is  a  national  of
    Pakistan with leave to remain until  July  2013  as  the  spouse  of  a
    British citizen. The appeal before the Judge  proceeded  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant could not meet the settlement  rules  for  leave  to
    remain as an adult dependent relative under paragraph EC-DR of Appendix
    FM and that he could not meet the conditions  for  family  and  private
    life at Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules  [3].
    It was also confirmed that Article 3 was not in issue in respect of the
    Appellant's health, but that the security situation in respect of  Shia
    Muslims in Pakistan should be borne in mind as should the provisions of
    paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules in assessing the claim [4].

 4. In the grounds of application, the Respondent asserts  that  the  Judge
    erred because:


        a. She failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
           Appellant's rights under Article 8 would be breached  if  he  is
           removed to Pakistan when he had evidence before him that he  had
           good neighbours there and that his  son  visited  him  often  in
           Pakistan because he has business interests there. The  Appellant
           had a multiple entry visit visa until July  2017  and  he  could
           continue to visit the Sponsor in the UK and the Judge had failed
           to consider whether family life could continue  in  its  current
           form. There was evidence before the Judge that the Appellant had
           already sought treatment on the NHS and was likely  to  continue
           to require it. He had been to the UK before as a medical visitor
           and had paid for medical treatment and there was no  reason  why
           he could not continue to do this in the future; and


        b. The Immigration Rules,  as  clarified  by  the  changes  to  the
           Immigration Rules in July 2012, provide that  the  existence  of
           insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  outside  the
           UK is a key factor in assessing proportionality, even if  it  is
           not  determinative.  The  Immigration  Rules  now  provide   the
           relevant factors to  be  considered  which  reflect  the  public
           interest in the assessment of proportionality. It  is  submitted
           in the grounds of application that "The public interest achieved
           by applying clear rules must be measured by the  effect  of  the
           rules across the board, not just in relation  to  an  individual
           case. In this case the Tribunal did not apply this approach  and
           thereby misdirected itself in law."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Nicholson. He found that: the
    Judge stated that the Appellant's son's leave to remain had expired  in
    July 2013 and the Judge was not informed about his current  immigration
    status, and the Appellant had incurred an NHS debt of ï¿½7,609, which had
    not been paid despite his finding that the Appellant's family  had  the
    resources to settle  the  debt.  The  Appellant  had  claimed  that  he
    intended to return to Pakistan at the end of his visit and did  not  do
    so  because  his  medical  health  had  deteriorated  but   the   Judge
    specifically did not accept that at [12]. He allowed the appeal on  the
    basis that the Appellant had a family life with his son and  his  son's
    family and the Appellant required long term  personal  care  which  was
    "reminiscent of the requirement in  Appendix  FM  for  adult  dependent
    relatives"  and  because  of   this   that   there   were   "compelling
    circumstances". The Judge did not appear to accept that the Appellant's
    health had deteriorated and therefore he must  have  managed  alone  in
    Pakistan in the past. The rules on adult  dependent  relatives  require
    not only that the person requires long term  care  but  also  that  the
    person cannot get it in their home country. The  Appellant  owed  large
    sums for medical care that  he  was  not  entitled  to  and  his  son's
    immigration status was uncertain. Given these factors, Judge  Nicholson
    concluded, it was arguable that  the  Judge  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons for his findings and failed to give sufficient  weight  to  the
    public interest in refusing the application.


 6. The Appellant did not submit a Rule 24 response and did not attend  the
    hearing.


 7. I note that notice of hearing was sent to both the  Appellant  and  his
    representatives before the First-tier Tribunal, no application was made
    for an adjournment or as to why they had failed to attend and there was
    no evidence before me to indicate that they would attend if I adjourned
    the matter. If the Appellant had suffered from ill health, there is  no
    reason why his son could not have notified the Tribunal or attended the
    hearing on his behalf.


 8. I therefore proceeded with the hearing in their absence.


Submissions

 9. Mr Kandola submitted that at [17] the Judge correctly  directs  himself
    to Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] IKUT 00085 (IAC). However, he
    referred to the medical  grounds  but  the  medical  evidence  did  not
    establish that long term care would not be received  in  Pakistan.  The
    Appellant could not meet the provisions of Appendix FM at E-ECDR or  E-
    ILRDR. The  Immigration  Rules  not  only  required  the  Appellant  to
    establish that personal care was required but that it  was  unavailable
    in Pakistan and there was no one there to provide it. The Rules did not
    allow in-country switching to leave to remain as an  elderly  dependent
    relative. The Judge stated that there were compelling circumstances not
    sufficiently recognised under the Rules but the Rules provided for them
    in Appendix FM at E-ECDR and E-ILRDR of Appendix FM. The  Secretary  of
    State had taken a policy decision to prevent switching  by  overstayers
    or those who come to the UK as visitors, to prevent abuse  of  process.
    The matters set out by the Judge  at  [17]  did  not  amount  to  'good
    grounds' for granting leave outside the Rules; there  was  no  evidence
    that medical care was not available in Pakistan, the Appellant had  two
    daughters who lived in Pakistan and had  two  servants  when  he  lived
    there who took care of him [8]. Although it was stated that  the  house
    that the Appellant had resided in there had been sold, the  Appellant's
    son had paid the rent for it. At the hearing, it was  recorded  in  the
    minute taken by the Home Office representative (a  copy  of  which  was
    supplied to me) that the Appellant's son went to Pakistan  every  three
    months for about five days. There  were  material  considerations  that
    weighed against the Appellant in the balancing exercise and  the  Judge
    should have had regard to them in the proportionality exercise.


10. Having concluded his submissions, Mr Kandola confirmed that if  I  find
    that the Judge materially erred in law, he was content for me to remake
    the decision on the basis of the papers before me.



Decision and reasons

11. The Judge directed himself to the provisions of Gulshan  (Article  8  -
    new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 40 (IAC) and Shahzad at  [3],
    [11] and [17]. However, when actually conducting the assessment, whilst
    alluding to the provisions of Appendix FM, she did not clearly identify
    the  factors  to  be  weighed  in  favour  of  the  Respondent  in  the
    proportionality exercise.


12. Mr Kandola was correct to point out that the  Secretary  of  State  had
    made a policy decision to prevent switching by visitors from  leave  to
    remain as visitors to leave to remain as elderly  dependent  relatives,
    as provided by the provisions of Appendix  FM  E-ILRDR  to  prevent  an
    abuse of process. An applicant who applies for leave to  remain  as  an
    elderly dependent relative must first  have  made  an  application  for
    leave to enter in that category and to have supplied evidence  that  he
    is unable


    "... even with the practical and financial  help  of  the  Sponsor,  to
    obtain the required level of care in the country where they are living,
    because:


        a. It is not available and there is no person in that  country  who
           can reasonably provide it ; or
        b. It is not affordable" (paragraph E-ECDR.2.5 of Appendix FM).

13. The Judge did not accept the Appellant's submission that he intended to
    return to Pakistan after his visit and to continue visiting his  family
    on his multi visit visa but that his condition deteriorated  [12].  She
    considered the medical evidence, listed his conditions and symptoms and
    concluded that given the time frame he is  likely  to  have  had  these
    symptoms in Pakistan [13]. She found that his medical  conditions  were
    not such as to allow him to remain simply on the basis of  his  medical
    conditions [16]. She also found that he had accessed NHS care to  which
    he was not entitled, which was being repaid by "monthly  direct  debits
    of the paltry sum of ï¿½100" although the family had the funds to  settle
    the debt; and that the Appellant told the GP that he had moved  to  the
    UK in the sense that he had permanent status here, which was  not  true
    [14]. She also found that there is  scant  evidence  that  he  will  be
    harmed or persecuted on the basis of his religion or  otherwise  if  he
    returns [10]. However,  she  balances  his  previous  good  immigration
    history with these factors and states:


             "On the other hand, having regard to all the  evidence,  I  am
             satisfied that  the  appellant  requires  long  term  care  to
             perform everyday tasks due to a combination  of  his  age  and
             medical conditions, which is reminiscent of the requirement in
             Appendix FM for adult dependent relatives which taken together
             with his very strong level of closeness and dependency on  the
             sponsor and his family lead me to  conclude  that  "there  are
             compelling reasons not sufficiently recognised under the Rules
             and that there are thus "good grounds for  granting  leave  to
             remain outside them" - Shahzad  above.  I  conclude  that  the
             decision   is   not   justified   and   necessary    and    is
             disproportionate  to   the   legitimate   aim   of   effective
             immigration control under article 8". [17]


14. However, it is clear that  the  Immigration  Rules  provide  for  entry
    clearance as a dependent relative and  that under the  Rules  not  only
    must it be established that long term care is required but that  it  is
    not available pursuant to E-ECDR.2.5 or it is not affordable. The Judge
    found that the requirement for long term care  is  reminiscent  of  the
    provisions of Appendix FM without considering if they are in fact  met.
    This is to treat those who have gained admission as visitors  and  then
    switched more favourably than those who have taken  the  correct  route
    and obtained  entry  clearance  and  enables  them  to  circumvent  the
    provisions of the Immigration Rules.


15. This is not a case where the only  issue  weighing  in  favour  of  the
    Respondent is the policy requiring an  applicant  to  make  an  out  of
    country application (see Hayat (nature of Chikwamba principle) Pakistan
    [2011] UKUT 000444 (IAC)); there are legitimate enquiries that need  to
    be made. No finding was made by the Judge that evidence was provided to
    established that the Appellant was not able to return to  Pakistan  and
    make an out of country application for leave to enter  as  a  dependent
    relative at which point the relevant assessment will be made as to  the
    immigration status of the Sponsor as well  as  the  care  that  can  be
    provided in Pakistan. This is particularly relevant in the  Appellant's
    case as he has two daughters in Pakistan  who,  it  is  said  lived  in
    Karachi, where the Appellant's former home was  located,  and  had  two
    servants there to tend to his needs.


16. Furthermore, where specific provision has not been made to consider  an
    Article 8 application under the Immigration Rules it is not simply  the
    case that the direct application of Article 8 ECHR frees a  judge  from
    considering the Article 8 provisions of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Such
    assessments must be viewed through the substantive  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules which provide a guide to the factors which are to  be
    given weight in assessing the public interest in the Respondent's  side
    of the proportionality exercise under Article 8(2). Therefore,  in  the
    current case, it was  necessary  to  consider  the  provisions  of  the
    Immigrations Rules,  even  if  it  is  considered  early  on  that  the
    inability to switch  prevents  the  application  succeeding  under  the
    Rules. In the Appellant's case, it was necessary to consider paragraphs
    E-ECDR. 1.1 - 3.2, E-ECDR.1.1 - 1.3 and R-ILRDR.1.1 and  E-ILRDR.1.1  -
    1.5 and D-ILRDR1.1 - 1.4, which provide the starting point for weighing
    the public interest in the proportionality exercise. Findings  of  fact
    were not made on these factors.


17. I find that although the findings of fact which were made by the  Judge
    were open to  her  on  the  evidence  before  her,  and  therefore  are
    preserved, insufficient findings of fact were made on material  matters
    and therefore adequate reasons were not given by the Judge for  finding
    that there were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised by
    the Rules for a grant of leave applying Article 8  ECHR  directly.   By
    failing to consider whether an out of country application could be made
    and failing to consider the provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    determining proportionality, the  Judge  circumvented  the  Immigration
    Rules by allowing the appeal under Article 8. I therefore set aside the
    decision.


Remaking the decision


18. The parties were notified by directions to prepare for the  hearing  on
    the basis that if an  error  of  law  were  found,  I  may  proceed  to
    determine the appeal and therefore  any  additional  evidence  must  be
    submitted for the purposes of this hearing. No additional evidence  was
    submitted and I therefore make my findings  of  fact  on  the  evidence
    before me.


19. As the Immigration Rules at Appendix  FM  set  out  the  factors  which
    should be considered when deciding  Article  8  claims,  I  will  first
    consider those factors first, as follows:


        a. Pursuant to paragraph E-ECDR, The Appellant is a parent  of  the
           Sponsor, and the latter is over 18  years  of  age.  As  to  the
           immigration status of the  Sponsor,  pursuant  to  paragraph  E-
           ECDR.2.3 (b), the Sponsor stated in his witness  statement  that
           he was currently in the UK as the spouse of a  British  citizen,
           and that his original passport was with the Home Office  due  to
           an application for indefinite leave to remain and the copies  of
           his passport were provided which indicated that he had leave  to
           remain until 7 July 2013 (pp 147  and  151  of  the  Appellant's
           bundle). On the  balance  of  probabilities,  it  is  reasonably
           likely that his Sponsor is settled in the UK.


        b. It is reasonably likely that the Appellant, due to his  age  and
           illness,  requires  some  long-term  personal  care  to  perform
           everyday tasks pursuant to paragraph E-ECDR2.4. However,  it  is
           not established that such care is not available and there is no-
           none in Pakistan who can reasonably provide it or that it is not
           affordable pursuant to E-ECDR.2.5.


        c. Pursuant to R-ILRDR1.1, the Appellant is in the UK, he has  made
           an application  for  leave  to  remain  as  an  adult  dependant
           relative. However, he fails to  meet  the  suitability  criteria
           (paragraph S-ILR.2.3) because he has incurred NHS  charges,  and
           the relevant NHS body has informed the Secretary of  State  that
           Appellant has failed to  pay  charges  in  accordance  with  the
           relevant regulations on charges to overseas visitors;  there  is
           an e-mail from the Milton Keynes Hospital that the Applicant had
           incurred a total of ï¿½7,609.72. The Judge specifically notes that
           only the paltry sum of ï¿½100 a month is being paid  to  discharge
           this debt when the family have sufficient funds to discharge  it
           in full. S-ILR.2.1 provides that failure to meet this particular
           suitability criterion will result in the  application  'normally
           being refused on grounds of suitability'. This provision  is  to
           safeguard the economic wellbeing of the UK  and  therefore  adds
           weight to the public interest in the proportionality exercise.


        d. The Immigration Rules prevent switching  from  the  category  of
           visitor to that of leave  to  remain  as  an  elderly  dependent
           relative (paragraph E-ILRDR.1.2 of  Appendix  FM).  This  is  to
           prevent abuse of  the  system  by  such  relatives  entering  as
           visitors with a view to not returning. In the Appellant's  case,
           the Judge did not accept that he was unable  to  return  due  to
           deterioration in his condition [12]. This is a case in which the
           policy decision to prevent  switching  clearly  bites  and  adds
           weight to the public interest in the proportionality exercise.

        e. As to the provisions of E-ILRDR, the Appellant is not in the  UK
           with valid leave as an elderly dependent  relative,  it  is  not
           established that he  would  have  satisfied  the  provisions  of
           paragraph E-ECDR.2.5  but  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  his
           Sponsor is settled in the  UK  and  that  he  can  maintain  and
           accommodate him.


20. In considering whether there are arguably  good  grounds  for  directly
    applying Article 8, I note that  the  Immigration  Rules  consider  the
    relationship between the Appellant and the Sponsor but this is  only  a
    factual finding as to  whether  a  relationship  exists:  there  is  no
    assessment of the quality of the relationship or the strength of  ties.
    On the basis of the findings of the Judge as  to  the  quality  of  the
    relationship between the Appellant and his Sponsor's family, there  are
    arguably good grounds for applying  Article  8  ECHR  directly,  as  to
    which, I find as follows:


        a. Taking the five step approach set out in Razgar  v  SSHD  [2004]
           UKHL 27), removal will result in interference with  the  private
           and family life of the Appellant and, on  the  findings  of  the
           Judge, it is likely to have consequences of such gravity  as  to
           potentially engage the operation of Article 8. The  decision  is
           in accordance  with  the  law  because  he  cannot  satisfy  the
           provisions of the Immigration Rules,  and  the  legitimate  aims
           under Article 8 (2) are the maintenance of  the  economic  well-
           being of the country  through  the  maintenance  of  immigration
           control. This takes me to proportionality.


        b. The preserved findings are that there is a 'very strong level of
           closeness and dependency on the sponsor and  his  family'  [17],
           that generally the family have a good immigration  history  [15]
           and that the Sponsor supported the  Appellant  financially.  The
           Judge does not accept that  the  Appellant  did  not  have  pre-
           existing care needs. However, she  states  that  she  will  give
           '...the family the benefit of the doubt that they  realised  the
           extent of the impact of his age and medical conditions only when
           the  Appellant  began  to  live  with  them  here...'.  However,
           findings of fact have to be made on the evidence before her, not
           on giving an applicant the 'benefit of the doubt'. It  is  clear
           that the Sponsor visited and stayed with the Appellant regularly
           and that the Appellant  had  two  servants  caring  for  him  in
           Pakistan. The Sponsor would have been aware of  the  Appellant's
           needs when he stayed with him in Pakistan and it is not possible
           to state that he only became aware of them  when  the  Appellant
           stayed with him in the UK, simply because  the  Sponsor  had  in
           fact stayed with him many times in Pakistan.


        c. The Appellant has two daughters in  Karachi,  where  his  former
           home was and his medical  and  care  needs  were  being  met  in
           Pakistan. Although he had a property in Pakistan, he sold it and
           the Sponsor paid the rent on his rented property.  There  is  no
           reason why this arrangement could  not  continue.  There  is  no
           evidence before me that the Appellant  is  not  fit  to  fly  or
           indeed, that he cannot return to Pakistan with his  son  on  his
           son's next business trip there and  no  evidence  that  his  son
           could not settle him down in  Pakistan  and  submit  an  out  of
           country application. I find that the Appellant's lack of honesty
           in relation to his immigration status when he saw  the  GP,  his
           use of the NHS service to which he was  not  entitled,  and  the
           failure by his family to discharge the NHS debt even though  his
           family had the means to  discharge  it  [14],  must  be  weighed
           against the Appellant's previous good immigration history [15].


        d. Balancing these facts against the findings which  establish  the
           public interest in the maintenance  of  immigration  control,  I
           find that there is  a  strong  public  interest  in  maintaining
           immigration control. There is no  reliable  evidence  before  me
           that an out of country application cannot be made, or  that  the
           care and medical  needs  of  the  Appellant  cannot  be  met  in
           Pakistan. On the evidence in the round, whilst I accept that the
           Appellant has strong bonds with  his  son  and  his  family,  as
           evidenced  in  the  Appellant's  bundle,  and  there   will   be
           interference with family life if he is required to  leave,  this
           does not outweigh the public interest in the protection  of  the
           economic  well-being  of  the  country  through  firm  and  fair
           immigration control.


21.  I  find  that  refusal  of  the   Appellant's   application   is   not
    disproportionate when the interference with his private and family life
    is balanced against the legitimate public interest.


Decision


22. The decision of Judge Roopnarine-Davies discloses a material  error  of
    law as set out above. I set aside her decision. I remake  the  decision
    to dismiss the appeal under Article 8.


23. The appeal of the Respondent is allowed.



Anonymity

24. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.  No
    request has been made for an anonymity order and pursuant to Rule 14 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I find no reason  to
    make an order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD


     In light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award
under Rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
Rules 2005 and section 12(4) (a) of the  Tribunals  Courts  and  Enforcement
Act 2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011). As the  Respondent's  appeal  has  been
allowed, I make no fee award.
