For the respondent:    Mr S. Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was born on  23  January
       1987. He is a Tamil from Jaffna. He applied  on  24  December  2010,
       aged 23, for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to
       pursue a BSc in  Quantity  Surveying  at  Wolverhampton  University,
       having completed a BTech in the same discipline in  Sri  Lanka.   He
       was granted a student visa on 18 January 2011 and entered the United
       Kingdom on 29 January 2011. He  successfully  completed  the  course
       following  an  extension  of  his  leave  until  30  October   2012.
       Thereafter he overstayed.

    2. The appellant next contacted the Home Office on 24 July  2013  prior
       to his making a claim for asylum on 3 August  2013.  By  a  decision
       made on 2 September 2013, the respondent  refused  his  claim.  This
       followed the appellant attending interviews on 3 August  (screening)
       and 21 August 2013.

    The claim

    3. The respondent accepts the appellant is  a  Sri  Lankan  Tamil  from
       Jaffna. He claimed that in March 2008, now  over  8  years  ago,  he
       provided accommodation for two members of the LTTE in a property  he
       occupied in Colombo. They remained  there  for  some  25  days.  The
       appellant himself, however, denied that he himself was a  member  of
       the LTTE and had not done anything else to assist them.

    4. The centrepiece of his claim was that he was arrested on 25 December
       2010 at a checkpoint and taken to camp Joseph in  Vavuniya.  He  was
       there held for seven days during which time he was interrogated  and
       beaten. His release was effected through payment  of  a  bribe.  His
       release took place on 1 January 2011 at which point he was taken  to
       Colombo by an agent and assumed a different identity until  he  left
       the country.

    5. As will become apparent, the timing of this event is significant. It
       took place, co-incidentally, on the very next day after he made  his
       claim for entry clearance as a student. By the  time  the  appellant
       had been granted entry  clearance  as  a  student,  he  had  become,
       according to his account, a refugee. However, he entered the  United
       Kingdom as a student (and there is no doubt that he  was  a  genuine
       student) and completed his studies on or  before  30  October  2012.
       If he assumed a different identity  before  leaving  Sri  Lanka,  he
       entered the United Kingdom in his true  identity  with  valid  entry
       clearance.

    6. At the conclusion of his studies, he neither returned to  Sri  Lanka
       nor claimed asylum. He waited until the summer of the following year
       before doing so.

    7. It is as well to settle the issue that has bedevilled the hearing at
       this appeal. In the decision letter, the  respondent  recorded  that
       the application made by the appellant for entry clearance  was  made
       on 30 December 2010 which, if accurate, would have been  at  a  time
       when the appellant was, according to his own account, in custody. It
       is now accepted that this is incorrect.  I  accept  the  application
       for entry clearance was made on 24 December 2010.

    8. There are, of course, significant difficulties about the claim which
       arises from the chronology which I have set out. First, the event on
       which his claim for asylum was based took place over the space of 25
       days in 2008 and he was not arrested until December 2010, over  2  �
       years later. Second, the crucial acts of persecution took  place  in
       the seven-day period after he had made  his  application  for  entry
       clearance as  a  student.  The  application  followed  a  period  of
       preparation in which he had developed a settled intention to take up
       studies in the United Kingdom.  The application  would,  of  course,
       has been supported by the documentary evidence necessary in order to
       secure entry clearance: the offer of a place,  suitable  sponsoring,
       adequate financial resources and a genuine intention to  study.  All
       of this material would have been amassed over the  preceding  weeks.
       Third, according to his claim,  being  a  refugee  and  at  risk  of
       persecution, he waited until he has been in the United  Kingdom  for
       2� years before he claimed asylum.  Fourth, the claim, when  it  was
       made, followed months after his student leave had expired and  at  a
       time when he might have known that despite his being an  overstayer,
       his only legitimate means of regularising his presence in the United
       Kingdom was by establishing his asylum claim.

    9. Each of these elements has been explained by the  appellant  in  the
       evidence he has put forward. First, he explained the  delay  in  his
       arrest by stating that it was only on 25 December 2010 that  he  was
       identified by an LTTE informer that he  had  provided  accommodation
       some 2 � years before. Second, he asserted that  the  precariousness
       of his own position had not become apparent  until  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities had demonstrated their continuing  interest  in  him  by
       visiting his home on 2 or 3 occasions. In answer to question  43  of
       his interview, he variously expressed the last occasion as 2011  but
       corrected the date  to  2013.   The  answer  to  question  [44]  was
       recorded as

            "2013...January, I think"

   10. Then in answer to further questions he stated that  the  authorities
       had last visited in November 2011 after his visa expired in  October
       2011.  In fact, his visa  expired  in  October  2012  and  corrected
       himself to 2012; that is, October 2012 for  the  expiration  of  the
       visa and November 2012 as to the date of the last visit.  Since  his
       parents had told the authorities that he had left  Sri  Lanka  on  a
       valid student visa in 2011, there  was  little  further  information
       that they could provide or the authorities could glean from  further
       visits.

   11. Since arriving in the United Kingdom he claimed that the authorities
       continued to search for  him  alleging  that  he  had  escaped  from
       prison. They had visited his home on two or three  occasions  though
       he was uncertain as to the dates.

   12. His uncle gave evidence in accordance  with  three  statements.  The
       first dated 11 October 2013 [bundle 1, page 3] merely confirmed that
       he had arrived in the United Kingdom on 21  May  2012.   The  second
       (where material) stated that the uncle did not know of his  nephew's
       involvement with the LTTE in detail.  In addition, he stated that he
       came to know from his sister (the appellant's mother) that  the  Sri
       Lankan authorities visited his home in search of both the  appellant
       and himself.  The third referred to the fact  that  the  appellant's
       mental health was effected by the torture he  had  received  in  Sri
       Lanka.  He described how he and his wife woke the appellant  in  the
       morning and had to ask him to do routine tasks.  He accompanies  his
       aunt on simple things such as shopping.  The uncle asserts that  the
       appellant is in need of family support.

   13. In addition, the appellant's father has made a  statement.   He  has
       stated that, after his son was arrested  on  25  December  2010,  he
       contacted an EPDP member who arranged through an agent to secure his
       son's release through payment of a bribe and to secure his safe exit
       from Sri Lanka, notwithstanding a valid grant of entry clearance  to
       the United Kingdom which the appellant  used  to  gain  entry  as  a
       student.

   14. He also stated that the Sri Lankan authorities visited the house for
       the first time in November 2011.   This  was  11  months  after  his
       arrest and release from detention.  He stated that they told him  he
       had escaped from detention.  This, of course,  raised  the  question
       why they delayed calling at the appellant's home for 11 months after
       his  escape.   The  delay  is  unexplained  and  inexplicable.   The
       appellant's father truthfully told the authorities that he had  left
       in order to study in the United Kingdom.   He  also  said  that  the
       authorities had visited 'many times', although he could not remember
       the dates.  In his statement dated 11 February 2016,  he  said  they
       visited in January 2015 and, on this occasion, they warned him  that
       the appellant

            'had attended demonstrations in the United Kingdom  and  he  was
            working against the Sri Lankan government.'

   15. He went on to say that the Sri Lankan authorities last  visited  his
       home in August 2015.

   16. Since the claim was initiated, there  has  been  a  clear  shift  in
       emphasis.  It started as a claim to have harboured 2  LTTE  members.
       In her submissions, Ms Jegarajah hardly mentioned the original claim
       and focussed almost exclusively on the sur place claim.

   17. It is accepted that the uncle has  been  properly  recognised  as  a
       refugee.  He provided the names of senior personnel within the  LTTE
       with whom he was acquainted and, indeed, who attended his wedding.

   18. At the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellant  had
       submitted a report from Dr Raj Persaud dated 10  February  2016.  Dr
       Persaud is a consulting psychiatrist and emeritus  visiting  Gresham
       Professor for Public Understanding of Psychiatry. He  holds  or  has
       held a number of senior posts within the NHS  as  well  as  academic
       posts within the United Kingdom.

   19. He recorded the appellant's claim  to  have  been  tortured  in  the
       course of his detention commencing on 25 December 2010.  Dr  Persaud
       commented upon the fact that the appellant has two siblings  in  Sri
       Lanka; both deaf and  dumb.   His  parents  struggle  to  cope  with
       looking after them and problems would be exacerbated by  the  return
       of the appellant. He recorded that the authorities  were  attempting
       to target the appellant because of his having been a member  of  the
       LTTE (which has never been the appellant's case). He  described  how
       the appellant exhibited some classic features of PTSD  in  terms  of
       reliving past experiences,  high  anxiety,  startled  responses  and
       flashbacks. His  GP  had  prescribed  antidepressants  and  sleeping
       medication   which   Dr   Persaud    described    as    'heavy-duty'
       antidepressants over an extensive period because he suffers  serious
       and enduring mental illness. Various attempts were made to refer him
       to counselling and the GP recorded a diagnosis of  4  February  2016
       that the appellant was suffering from PTSD and was seriously unwell.
       Dr Persaud considered that it was particularly notable  as  recorded
       in the medical notes that a diagnosis of PTSD had been made and that
       his GP was worried about him and  believed  him  to  be  unwell  and
       treatment  resistant.  The  fact  that  he  had  been  referred   to
       counselling and psychotherapy was of evidential  value  in  that  it
       demonstrated the NHS viewed him as severely psychiatrically unwell.

   20. Dr Persaud took the view that there  was  a  well  established  link
       between traumatic experiences and  the  development  of  psychiatric
       disorder. His conclusion was that the appellant continues to  suffer
       from serious psychiatric disorder  including  Major  Depression  and
       PTSD most probably secondary  to  the  past  traumas  the  applicant
       claims.

   21. Ms Jegarajah did not seek to pursue a  claim  that  because  of  his
       mental state, removal would  breach  his  Article  2  or  3  rights.
       However, she relied on Dr Persaud's conclusions  and  in  particular
       his conclusions on page 12 in answer to questions  provided  by  his
       solicitor. Dr Persaud said

            I cannot tell definitively if he has been the victim of  torture
            but these psychiatric symptoms are compatible with  that  having
            happened in his past and it is consistent with  his  account  of
            what happened to him....I believe he has symptoms  of  PTSD  and
            Depression and these are often secondary to torture of the  kind
            he claims to  have  endured....The  clinical  picture  today  is
            consistent with the story he tells about what  has  happened  to
            him....He is very disabled by  the  symptoms  I  have  described
            above and can do none of the activities of daily life  including
            working, cooking, shopping for food or caring for himself.... He
            is clearly very dependent on his uncle and...depends on him  for
            all activities of daily living. He would not  cope  without  him
            back in Sri Lanka.

   22. A significant part of Dr Persaud's addendum report dated  15  August
       2016 is a response to matters raised in a hearing which  took  place
       on 12 February 2016 in which Dr Persaud's  3-month  suspension  from
       practice following a Fitness to Practice hearing in  June  2008  was
       relied upon  as  undermining  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  his
       evidence.  The Fast Track Procedure hearing arose from  a  complaint
       made to the GMC in relation to a  book  written  by  him  which  was
       tainted by plagiarism.  In the circumstances  of  this  case,  where
       other health-care professionals have  reached  a  similar  diagnosis
       upon the appellant's mental health, I do not approach  Dr  Persaud's
       past misconduct as undermining the opinion Dr  Persaud  had  earlier
       provided.  Whatever limitations there may be  about  the  diagnosis,
       those are not affected by Dr Persaud's June 2008 suspension.

    Analysis

   23. The centrepiece of the  appellant's  claim  to  have  suffered  past
       persecution is founded on his claim that he  provided  accommodation
       to 2 LTTE members for a period in  2008  of  somewhat  less  than  a
       month. On any view, this was an insignificant contribution  and  one
       which was wholly unexceptional. Given those living in  the  part  of
       Sri Lanka controlled by the LTTE  (many  of  whom  would  have  been
       sympathetic to an independent state though not necessarily the means
       the LTTE adopted to achieve it) there would have been large  numbers
       of Tamils who provided  assistance  to  the  LTTE  in  the  form  of
       accommodation, transport, provisions, clothing or the various  other
       forms of assistance that the civilian population provided to  assist
       the LTTE. It is simply inconceivable that all those people would now
       be at risk of recrimination because of their  past  activities.  Nor
       can there  be  any  logical  distinction  between  Tamils  providing
       assistance in the form of accommodation  in  Colombo  compared  with
       those who did so in the LTTE controlled area.

   24. Consequently, the appellant's claim to be at risk of persecution  as
       a result of a single act of assistance (when he was not a member  of
       the LTTE, nor politically motivated, nor had provided any other form
       of help), does not bear  close  scrutiny.  Furthermore,  it  is  not
       supported by the Country Guidance provided by the Tribunal.

    Country Guidance

   25. In GJ and others (post-civil war: returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]
       UKUT 00319 (IAC), the Tribunal summarised the  current  guidance  on
       Sri Lanka in these terms:

            (2)    The focus of the  Sri  Lankan  government's  concern  has
            changed since the civil war ended in May 2009.  The LTTE in  Sri
            Lanka itself is a spent force and there have been  no  terrorist
            incidents since the end of the civil war.

            (3)    The government's present objective is to  identify  Tamil
            activists in the diaspora who are working for  Tamil  separatism
            and to destabilise the unitary Sri  Lankan  state  enshrined  in
            Amendment 6(1) to the Sri Lankan  Constitution  in  1983,  which
            prohibits the 'violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka.
             Its focus is on preventing both (a) the resurgence of the  LTTE
            or any similar Tamil separatist organisation and (b) the revival
            of the civil war within Sri Lanka.

            (7)     The current  categories  of  persons  at  real  risk  of
            persecution or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka,  whether  in
            detention or otherwise, are:

                (a)    Individuals who are,  or  are  perceived  to  be,  a
                threat to the integrity of Sri  Lanka  as  a  single  state
                because they are, or are perceived to  have  a  significant
                role in relation to post-conflict Tamil  separatism  within
                the diaspora and/or a renewal  of  hostilities  within  Sri
                Lanka.

                (d)    A person whose name appears on a computerised "stop"
                list accessible at the airport, comprising a list of  those
                against whom there is  an  extant  court  order  or  arrest
                warrant.  Individuals whose name appears on a  "stop"  list
                will be stopped at the  airport  and  handed  over  to  the
                appropriate Sri Lankan authorities, in  pursuance  of  such
                order or warrant.

            (8) and ((9) [These paragraphs deal with sur place claims  which
            I shall deal with separately, albeit  as  part  of  the  overall
            assessment of the claim.]

   26. The crucial effect of the guidance is the focus by  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities upon those who represent a current risk.   Normally,  it
       is no longer a question of settling old  scores  or  punishing  past
       allegiances or actions.

   27. This makes simple good sense. There is a clear  distinction  between
       the likely attitude of the authorities in relation to those who were
       active participants  in  the  LTTE  and  have  never  changed  their
       attitude and those who, in the  course  of  the  conflict,  afforded
       assistance. In my judgment, it would require much greater assistance
       than the tangential contact with two members of the  LTTE,  for  the
       appellant to be currently at risk of serious  harm  that  transcends
       the end of the conflict, the development of a new political  reality
       (be  it  good  or  bad)  and  the  need  to  effect  some  form   of
       reconciliation  (however  partial)  in  order  to  avoid  continuing
       conflict. The obvious distinction that is drawn  between  those  who
       continue to represent  a  threat  to  the  state  by  espousing  and
       advancing a separatist claim and those who, historically, sided with
       or  aided  the  LTTE  is  both  obvious  and  logically  compelling.
       Consequently, the appellant's claim to be the subject of  continuing
       attention on the part of the authorities simply makes no sense. I am
       sure it has been made up.  If he is still at risk then so is  almost
       the entire Tamil population and certainly all those who offered  any
       form  of  assistance  to  the  LTTE  during  the  conflict.  Such  a
       conclusion  would  be  irrational  on  the  basis  of  the   current
       background material.

   28. This conclusion is consistent with  the  entirety  of  the  evidence
       about  the  continued  interest  shown  in  the  appellant  by   the
       authorities. Given the very limited role played by the appellant, it
       is simply not credible that the authorities,  in  light  of  present
       conditions, would show  a  continuing  interest  in  the  appellant.
       According to his father's statement, the authorities have  continued
       to show interest until as recently as August  2015  nearly  8  years
       after the event that is said to have ignited that  interest.  It  is
       not remotely likely that the authorities would spare  the  time  and
       energy to bring to justice a collaborator with the LTTE  whose  role
       was so limited. Secondly, it  defies  belief  that  the  authorities
       would, having been informed that the appellant had left to study  in
       the United Kingdom would, over a period of  many  years,  visit  and
       revisit the property in the forlorn hope that he would  be  present.
       If they had wanted to secure his arrest, it would have  been  simple
       enough to put him on a stop-list on arrival at the airport.  If  the
       appellant's account were  true,  these  visits  by  the  authorities
       having continued for eight years already  will,  inferentially,  re-
       occur indefinitely. Thirdly, whilst I entirely accept that  some  of
       the inconsistencies provided by the appellant as  to  the  dates  of
       these visits may properly be attributed to simple error  (which  the
       appellant immediately corrected) the evidence about these visits  is
       both inconsistent and vague. The appellant's father calculates  that
       there have been many such occasions. The appellant speaks of two  or
       three. The dates at which they are said to  have  taken  place  have
       varied from time to time. The uncle said that they were prompted  by
       the  authorities'  interest  in  the  appellant.  Other  sources  of
       information say that both the uncle and  the  appellant  were  being
       sought. Whilst I would not regard these inconsistencies as probative
       on their own, they remain  a  feature  which  supports  my  ultimate
       conclusion that the authorities have no  interest  whatever  in  the
       appellant for what he did, or did not do, in 2008.

   29. This conclusion is of course, taking against the background  of  the
       evidence as a whole. This includes  the  medical  evidence  from  Dr
       Persaud which I have already summarised. I  am  satisfied  that  the
       appellant is suffering from depression and from some or all  of  the
       symptoms of PTSD. Dr Persaud, understandably, is not in  a  position
       to make findings of fact in relation to the appellant's account.  In
       particular, it is certainly no part of  his  role  to  make  adverse
       credibility findings. This, inevitably, presents a difficulty in any
       diagnosis. Dr Persaud's  conclusion  that  the  appellant's  medical
       condition is consistent with trauma such as the appellant  described
       is a justifiable one. However, on the basis that  he  is  inevitably
       restricted to a consideration of the consistency of his symptoms  as
       they currently present themselves, it must result in an inability to
       assess whether those symptoms are consistent  with  another  history
       and a history different from that presented to him.

   30. There are features of the  appellant's  case  which  are  inevitably
       distressing for the appellant. I  am  satisfied  that  he  wants  to
       remain in the United Kingdom. I am  satisfied  that  notwithstanding
       the level of academic achievement he  has  attained  in  the  United
       Kingdom, there may be more limited prospects in Sri  Lanka.  I  have
       found that the appellant has been untruthful in his account  to  the
       authorities and he is under the burden of adverse findings  made  on
       previous hearings before the Tribunal.  His future is uncertain. His
       uncle's claim for asylum has, entirely justifiably, been successful.
        A return to Sri Lanka will thrust upon him  the  responsibility  of
       more direct involvement in the care  of  his  disabled  brother  and
       sister who are both deaf and dumb.  If some or all of these  factors
       are pressing upon the appellant's mind, it is impossible to discount
       the fact that they are likely to have an impact on his mental  well-
       being. Indeed, the evidence proffered by Dr Persaud speaks of a high
       level of depression amongst Sri Lankans resulting in  an  abnormally
       high risk  of  suicide.  The  poor  mental  health  from  which  the
       appellant suffers (and which I accept) may not be as a result of the
       experience in 2008 having taken place, a possibility that Dr Persaud
       is unable to comment upon. I have, of course, paid the most  careful
       attention to the medical  evidence  and  am  deeply  sympathetic  to
       anybody who suffers the blight  of  mental  illness  but  I  am  not
       satisfied that, taking it in the  round,  the  medical  evidence  is
       probative of the appellant's asylum claim.

   31. I am satisfied so that I am sure that the factors that propelled the
       appellant to leave Sri  Lanka  was  the  prospect  of  securing  for
       himself a degree from a British university in  a  practical  subject
       which would enhance the appellant's ability to maintain himself  and
       his family. I have no doubt that he  feels  a  continuing  sense  of
       responsibility towards his parents and his disabled siblings. He may
       well be the principal source of income for them all. Were he  to  be
       granted status in the United  Kingdom  such  as  to  enable  him  to
       practice his profession, I  have  little  doubt  that  the  economic
       advantages would be substantial and  the  prospect  of  losing  them
       would be  deeply  distressing.  The  insecurity  engendered  by  the
       prolonged asylum process cannot possibly assist.

   32. Even if the appellant had been  arrested,  (not  in  2010,  which  I
       reject) but at some earlier time as a result of his harbouring  LTTE
       members and even if that has had a profound  effect  on  his  mental
       health, I am satisfied that there is no continuing  risk  associated
       with the events in 2008.  Absent such a risk and absent reliance  on
       Articles 2 and 3 arising from his medical condition,  the  appellant
       fails to establish a claim for protection based on past persecution.



The sur place claim

   33. I now turn to consider  the  risk  by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities
       developed as a result of his sur place activities.

   34. I have already pointed out that the nature of this  claim  has  been
       developed in the course of these proceedings and  that,  during  the
       course of the hearing before  me,  it  had  become  the  predominant
       claim.

   35. The appellant's substantive interview took place on 21 August  2013.
       At that stage, the nature of the claim was, in essence, focussed  on
       the claim of past persecution. By that time,  he  had  been  in  the
       United Kingdom for nearly 6  years.  He  had  described  himself  as
       participating in demonstrations and LTTE events and  commemorations.
       He stated that he had participated in Mullivaikal Remembrance events
       and Heroes' Day. There had been a Black July event as  well  as  his
       demonstrating against the Sri Lankan  cricket  team  in  the  United
       Kingdom and the presence of the Sri Lankan President on  his  visit.
       In answer to questions 83 to 93 he said that  he  had  attended  two
       Heroes' day events and six demonstrations. He had  attended  Heroes'
       Day in 2011 and 2012. On those occasions the events had taken  place
       'somewhere in London' and he had come by  bus  to  attend  them.  He
       stated that, as a Tamil citizen, 'you wish to  remember  those'  who
       fought on his behalf. He was present 'just as a  participant'  [91].
       He had attended the Mullivaikal Remembrance  Day  event  at  Downing
       Street in  March  2013  and  the  Black  July  event  in  July  2013
       'somewhere in London'. He had attended a demonstration  against  the
       cricket team in Bristol at the beginning of 2013. The  demonstration
       against the presence of the Sri Lankan President had taken place, he
       said, at Heathrow airport in 2010.

   36. In his oral evidence, he described how he had become involved in the
       TGTE, the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam.  A letter from Mr
       Yogalingam appears in Bundle 3, pages 26-27.  The  organisation  has
       an address in 227 Preston Road, Wembley. The appellant's  activities
       are described as being a  volunteer  and  volunteering  to  organise
       several public events in the United Kingdom and that he  contributes
       to the best of his ability.  The events are not otherwise described.

   37. In cross-examination the appellant was reminded of what he had  said
       in his  August  2013  interview  (which  he  agreed  was  accurately
       recorded) as to the scope of his  activities,  see  the  answers  to
       questions 83 to 92.  He described  himself  accurately  as  'just  a
       participant'. He said in answer to question 102 hat he had not  been
       politically active in any other way since  arriving  in  the  United
       Kingdom.  It was put to him that  the  activities  described  by  Mr
       Yogalingam  in  his  January  2015  letter  suggested  more   active
       participation  and  involvement.   The   appellant   ascribed   this
       difference  to  activities  that  post-dated  his   interview   and,
       coincidentally,  the  development  of  his  asylum   claim.     Such
       additional involvement as Mr Yogalingam appears  to  have  suggested
       was not supported by further detail, either by Mr Yogalingam or  the
       appellant  himself.   I  prefer  to  rely  on  the  appellant's  own
       description of events in his interview when the same  are  supported
       by photographs which clearly establish his presence at an event.

   38. The appellant has produced numerous photographs. He admitted that he
       had no photographs  of  the  earlier  years.  The  photographs  must
       properly be seen in the context of his claim for  asylum  which  was
       initiated in 2013 and refused in September 2013.  Insofar  as  there
       are  photographs  of   his   attending   demonstrations   that   are
       contemporaneous with these matters, (or  post-date  them)  they  are
       clearly produced to challenge the decision and cannot  therefore  be
       relied  on  as  solely  attributable  to  a   developing   political
       conscience.  The photographs are posed in the sense that a cameraman
       has been asked to take the photograph; his clothing  and  the  items
       that he is holding are designed  to  portray  his  involvement  with
       Tamil demonstrations.  Given the nature of  the  photographs,  I  am
       satisfied that they were designed  as  pieces  of  evidence  in  his
       asylum claim and that the  person  or  persons  to  whom  they  were
       directed  were  decision  makers  within  the  Home  Office  or  the
       Tribunal.  That is not to  say  that  he  was  not  present  at  the
       relevant event; rather, that his recorded presence  was  undoubtedly
       made with a view to advancing his asylum claim.

   39. It is axiomatic that an asylum  seeker  is  entitled  to  protection
       under  the  Refugee  Convention  if,  as  a  result  of  sur   place
       activities, he is at the risk of persecution were he to be  returned
       even if that asylum seeker's participation in anti-regime activities
       is prompted solely by a wish to create or enhance an  asylum  claim.
       However cynical  it  may  be,  if  the  effect  is  to  establish  a
       reasonable likelihood that such participation creates the risk  then
       he is every bit as entitled to claim asylum  as  co-activists  whose
       motives cannot be impugned.

   40. The high point of the  appellant's  claim  is  that  his  photograph
       appeared as  one  of  a  crowd  of  protesters  on  the  Sri  Lankan
       President's own Facebook page. Whilst I do not  entirely  understand
       why the President of Sri Lanka would wish to have  on  his  Facebook
       page a photograph of protesters demonstrating  their  opposition  to
       his regime, I am satisfied that this  photograph  does  indeed  come
       from his Facebook page.

   41. On the strength of this evidence  (including  all  the  photographic
       evidence as well as his evidence  of  his  being  present  at  other
       events which were not photographed), the appellant  claims  that  he
       has established a profile as a supporter of a separatist  state  and
       thereby falls into one  of  the  categories  of  those  at  risk  of
       persecution  because  it  is  reasonably  likely  the   Sri   Lankan
       authorities are able to identify him when questioned on  arrival  in
       Sri Lanka.  At that stage he will reveal his anti-regime feelings.

   42. For the avoidance of doubt, I  exclude  from  my  consideration  the
       evidence provided by the appellant's father in  his  statement  that
       the authorities already knew of his participation in  demonstrations
       in London and had identified him sufficient to reveal  his  father's
       remark that in January 2015 they gave him a warning that  'he  would
       face the consequences as his son had attended demonstrations in  the
       United Kingdom and was working against the Sri Lankan government'.

   43. For the reasons I have already given, I reject  the  evidence  about
       continuing visits from the authorities in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, by
       advancing a claim that I am  sure  is  apocryphal,  it  reveals  how
       important the applicant and his witnesses consider it to establish a
       continuing interest on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities.

The Country Evidence

   44. The scope and effectiveness of Sri Lankan government surveillance in
       the United Kingdom is well established in  the  Country  Information
       and Guidance. In the report 'Sri Lanka:  Tamil  separatism'  (August
       2016) it is said at 6.9.3 and 6.9.4

            '... the intelligence services have continued in  2015  to  show
            detainees  who  have  returned  to  Sri  Lanka  photographs   of
            themselves attending Heroes' Day events and other commemorations
            abroad.   This  suggests  there  is   continuing   interest   in
            surveillance of diaspora events.'

   45. This is set by against the background  that  the  UN   Human  Rights
       report of 16 September 2015, (noted at paragraph 4.1.1 of the COIS),
       which spoke of the need for a comprehensive investigation  into  the
       allegations  of  serious  violations  and  abuses  of  human  rights
       committed by both sides in Sri Lanka during the  period  covered  by
       the Lessons Learnt and  Reconciliation  Commission.   This  followed
       increasing   international   concerns   about   the    absence    of
       accountability  which  addressed  the  evidence  of  the   extensive
       atrocities committed by both sides towards the end of  the  conflict
       in 2009 but potentially covering a much longer period.

   46. Ms Jagarajah also made reference  to  the  Country  Information  and
       Guidance report 'Sri  Lanka:  Tamil  separatism'  (August  2016)  at
       [6.1.9] and the continuing intimidatory tactics carried out  by  the
       security  forces   illustrated   by   the   activities   surrounding
       Remembrance  week  in  May  2015  involving  intelligence   officers
       harassing and threatening Tamils in their homes and  elsewhere  from
       participating in the events.  Surveillance,  including  the  use  of
       filming, it was said, aggravated  the  sense  of  intimidation.  The
       limited attempts to rehabilitate  former  LTTE  combatants  were  an
       example of the current government's attitude towards those  formerly
       involved in the LTTE. The US State Department report  for  2015  (13
       April 2016) stated [6.3.3]:

            'Reintegration of former combatants and other detainees released
            from  rehabilitation  remained  challenging  due  to   intensive
            surveillance by the military, social stigma (some  persons  were
            afraid to  associate  themselves  with  former  combatants,  who
            regularly had to report to the Army),  employment  difficulties,
            and psychological trauma.  Several  released  former  combatants
            reported torture or mistreatment,  including  sexual  harassment
            and abuse ...'

   47. Section 6.6 of the COIS  material  entitled  'Torture/ill-treatment'
       catalogues examples of credible reports of serious abuse  by  police
       and  military  forces.  The  same  theme  is  repeated  by   Amnesty
       International in its report of 24 February 2016;  the  International
       Truth and Justice project in its report  of  January  2016  and  the
       Human Rights Watch annual report for 2016.  All  are  noted  in  the
       COIS material [6.6.2; 6.6.3 and 6.6.4], amongst others.  The  point,
       therefore, taken by Ms Jagarajah is that the human rights  situation
       in Sri Lanka is poor, a broad contention with which I would agree.

   48. More importantly in the context of  this  appeal,  is  the  evidence
       found in section 6.9 dealing with the  Tamil  diaspora.  Whilst  the
       British High Commission in Colombo has listed some aid organisations
       once prescribed but no longer so, the TGTE is not on that  list.  In
       paragraph 6.10.3, the British High Commission recorded in  a  letter
       of 25 July 2014 that there was little or no evidence of  arrests  of
       members of  proscribed  Tamil  Diaspora  organisations.   There  was
       evidence that those returning may be questioned on  arrival  by  the
       Sri Lankan authorities, including the  Security  Service,  and  that
       such questioning may include seeking information  as  to  what  they
       have been doing whilst out of Sri Lanka including whether they  have
       been involved in one of the Tamil Diaspora groups.

    The case law

   49. There has, for many years, been a  debate  as  to  how  to  approach
       activities carried out in United Kingdom  should  be  assessed.   In
       Danian v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1999] EWCA  Civ
       3000 (28 October 1999), the Tribunal found Mr Danian  had  cynically
       tailored his activities so as to create a false  claim  for  refugee
       status.  However, there was no room for a  concept  of  'bad  faith'
       preventing an asylum claim succeeding for that reason  alone.   That
       said, any applicant will still have to establish that he has a well-
       founded fear of persecution and claimants of this type may not  find
       that burden easy to  discharge.  Indeed,  the  United  Nations  High
       Commission for Refugees acknowledged as much in a letter written  to
       the Tribunal.  This was not formulating any new theory,  but  simply
       acknowledging reality.  UNHCR was of the view that an  asylum-seeker
       who can establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution  on
       Convention grounds should fall under  the  scope  of  the  inclusion
       clauses, irrespective of whether the actions  giving  rise  to  such
       fear have been carried out in good or in bad faith.

   50. This was consistent with what Millett LJ said in Mbanza  [1996]  Imm
       AR 136, to  the  effect  that  putting  forward  of  a  baseless  or
       fraudulent claim did not in itself exclude  an  applicant  from  the
       protection of the Convention but there may be a number of  pragmatic
       reasons why his claim would be unlikely to be successful. Millett LJ
       observed at p 142:

           "The solution  ...  does  not  lie  in  propounding  some  broad
           principle of abuse of the system or attempting  to  pervert  the
           course of justice in order to justify a  breach  of  the  United
           Kingdom's international obligations, but in bearing in mind  the
           cardinal principle that it is for the applicant to  satisfy  the
           Secretary  of  State  that  he  has  a  well-founded   fear   of
           persecution for a Convention reason. Whether he can do so or not
           will largely turn on his credibility, and an applicant  who  has
           put forward a  fraudulent  and  baseless  claim  for  asylum  is
           unlikely to have much credibility left."

   51. At all times, the determination to be made is  whether  there  is  a
       genuine fear of persecution and whether that fear  is  well-founded.
       In BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on  return)  Iran  CG  [2011]
       UKUT 36 (IAC),  (Cranston  J  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy)
       summarised the Tribunal's views as follows in the  context  of  Iraq
       but  in  circumstances  where  the  Tribunal's  thinking  has  clear
       relevance to sur place claims wherever they may arise:

            1.     Given the large numbers of those  who   demonstrate  here
            and the publicity which demonstrators receive,  for  example  on
            Facebook, combined with the inability of the Iranian  Government
            to  monitor  all   returnees   who   have   been   involved   in
            demonstrations here,   regard  must  be  had  to  the  level  of
            involvement of the individual here  as  well  as  any  political
            activity which the  individual might have been involved in  Iran
            before  seeking asylum in Britain.

            2(a)   Iranians returning to Iran are screened  on  arrival.   A
            returnee who meets the profile of an activist  may  be  detained
            while searches of documentation are made. Students, particularly
            those who  have  known  political  profiles  are  likely  to  be
            questioned as well as those who have exited illegally.

            (b)    There is not a real risk of  persecution  for  those  who
            have exited Iran illegally or are merely returning from Britain.
            The conclusions of the Tribunal in the country guidance case  of
            SB (risk on return -illegal exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053 are
            followed and endorsed.

            (c)    There is no evidence of the  use  of  facial  recognition
            technology at the Imam Khomeini International airport, but there
            are a number of officials who may be able to recognize up to 200
            faces at any one time. The procedures used by  security  at  the
            airport are haphazard. It is therefore possible that those  whom
            the regime  might  wish  to  question  would  not  come  to  the
            attention of the regime on arrival. If, however, information  is
            known about their activities abroad, they might well  be  picked
            up for questioning and/or transferred to a  special  court  near
            the airport in Tehran after they have returned home.

            3.     It is  important  to  consider  the  level  of  political
            involvement before considering the likelihood of the  individual
            coming to the attention of the authorities and the priority that
            the Iranian regime would give to tracing him. It is  only  after
            considering those factors that the issue of whether or not there
            is a real risk of  his  facing  persecution  on  return  can  be
            assessed.

            4.     The following are relevant factors to be considered  when
            assessing risk on return having regard to sur place activities:

                (i) Nature of sur place activity

          . Theme of demonstrations - what do the demonstrators  want  (e.g.
            reform of the regime through to its violent overthrow); how will
            they be characterised by the regime?
          . Role in demonstrations and political profile - can the person be
            described as a leader; mobiliser (e.g.  addressing  the  crowd),
            organiser (e.g. leading the chanting); or simply a member of the
            crowd; if the latter is he active or passive (e.g. does he carry
            a banner); what is his motive,  and  is  this  relevant  to  the
            profile he will have in the eyes of the regime>
          . Extent of participation - has the person  attended  one  or  two
            demonstrations or is he a regular participant?
          . Publicity  attracted  -  has  a  demonstration  attracted  media
            coverage in the United Kingdom or the home  country;  nature  of
            that publicity (quality of images; outlets where stories  appear
            etc)?

                (ii) Identification risk

          . Surveillance of demonstrators -  assuming  the  regime  aims  to
            identify demonstrators against it how does it  do  so,  through,
            filming them, having agents who mingle in the  crowd,  reviewing
            images/recordings of demonstrations etc?
          . Regime's capacity to identify individuals - does the regime have
            advanced technology  (e.g.  for  facial  recognition);  does  it
            allocate human resources to fit names to faces in the crowd?

                (iii) Factors triggering inquiry/action on return

          . Profile - is the person known as a committed opponent or someone
            with a significant political profile;  does  he  fall  within  a
            category which the regime regards as especially objectionable?
          . Immigration history - how  did  the  person  leave  the  country
            (illegally; type of  visa);  where  has  the  person  been  when
            abroad; is the timing and method of return more likely  to  lead
            to inquiry and/or being detained for more than  a  short  period
            and ill-treated (overstayer; forced return)?

                (iv) Consequences of identification

          . Is there differentiation between demonstrators depending on  the
            level of their political profile adverse to the regime?

                (v) Identification risk on return

          . Matching identification to person - if a person is identified is
            that information systematically  stored  and  used;  are  border
            posts geared to the task?

   52. More recently in IM and AI (Risks - membership of Beja  Tribe,  Beja
       Congress and JEM) Sudan CG [2016] UKUT 00188 (IAC)  (Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Jordan and Blum) gave this opinion in relation to the risk  in
       paragraphs 209 to 215 in relation to sur place activities

            209. There is room for disagreement on the risk faced  by  those
                attending demonstrations.  It is, of course,  a  matter  of
                fact and not of law.  Thus in HB  (Ethiopia)  [2004]  UKIAT
                00235, the Tribunal said in the context of Ethiopia:

                     We have already set out Dr Campbell's assessment of the
                     risk faced by those involved with the UEDP in London in
                     paragraph 15, above.  On the basis of  his  assessment,
                     we are prepared to accept that the Ethiopian Embassy in
                     London monitors the political activities  of  Ethiopian
                     citizens resident in England.  However, we  are  unable
                     to accept that this means that the Embassy's  officials
                     are  capable  of  monitoring  the  activity  of   every
                     Ethiopian citizen. Simple constraints of resources must
                     inevitably mean that the Embassy will concentrate  upon
                     the  more  important  or  the  most  active  opposition
                     figures.  It cannot be  inferred  that  the  appellant,
                     described by the organisation  itself  as  "discharging
                     his responsibilities by way of attending  meetings  and
                     paying  his  membership  contribution"  is  an  obvious
                     target for surveillance.  There are  also,  of  course,
                     significant  difficulties  in   an   Embassy   official
                     identifying an individual, even if  his  photograph  is
                     taken.  Short of  having  a  database  with  which  the
                     photograph can be compared, surveillance by the Embassy
                     is unlikely to lead to identification  without  further
                     information  being  supplied.   Bearing  in  mind   the
                     appellant's  relatively  minor  role  in  the  UEDP  in
                     London, the Tribunal is not satisfied  that  the  fresh
                     material establishes that the appellant's activities in
                     London will place him at risk on return.   We  consider
                     that it is speculative to say that he is  monitored  in
                     the way suggested by Dr Campbell:

                         "As an active member of the London  branch  of  the
                         UEDP... his activities... will have been  monitored
                         by a Political Councillor at the Ethiopian  Embassy
                         in London."

            210.   Contrast this with what Sedley LJ said in YB (Eritrea)  v
                Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA  Civ
                360

                     As has  been  seen  (�7  above),  the  tribunal,  while
                     accepting that the appellant's  political  activity  in
                     this country was genuine, were not prepared  to  accept
                     in the absence of positive evidence that  the  Eritrean
                     authorities had "the  means  and  the  inclination"  to
                     monitor such  activities  as  a  demonstration  outside
                     their embassy, or that they would be able  to  identify
                     the appellant from photographs of the demonstration. In
                     my judgment,  and  without  disrespect  to  what  is  a
                     specialist tribunal, this  is  a  finding  which  risks
                     losing  contact  with  reality.  Where,  as  here,  the
                     tribunal has objective evidence which "paints  a  bleak
                     picture of the suppression of political opponents" by a
                     named government, it requires little or no evidence  or
                     speculation to arrive at a  strong  possibility  -  and
                     perhaps more - that its foreign legations not only film
                     or photograph their nationals who demonstrate in public
                     against the regime but have informers among  expatriate
                     oppositionist organisations who can name the people who
                     are filmed  or  photographed.  Similarly  it  does  not
                     require affirmative evidence to establish a probability
                     that the intelligence services of such  states  monitor
                     the  internet  for  information   about   oppositionist
                     groups. The real question in most cases  will  be  what
                     follows for the individual claimant. If,  for  example,
                     any information reaching the embassy is  likely  to  be
                     that the claimant  identified  in  a  photograph  is  a
                     hanger-on with no real commitment to the  oppositionist
                     cause, that will go directly to the issue flagged up by
                     art 4(3)(d) of the Directive.

            211.   In the present case we have the following  evidence.   It
                is clear that the Sudanese authorities conduct surveillance
                on its nationals. Normally a single reported incident of an
                embassy official using a camera to video  demonstrators  in
                2006, [129, above] would  hardly  be  persuasive  that  the
                practice is widespread but it  is  a  reasonable  inference
                that a regime that feels threatened from  those  abroad  as
                well as those at home will wish to gather such  information
                as is reasonably available as to the  level  of  opposition
                expressed by those in an expatriate  community  and,  where
                possible, the identity of the groups  and  the  individuals
                within them.  The evidence amply supports  that  view,  see
                paragraph [95] to [98] and [104] to [105] above.

            212.   It seems likely that there  will  be  informers  but  the
                success within which such informers are embedded in a local
                group is never  likely  to  be  established  affirmatively.
                Members of a small group of Sudanese nationals, all of whom
                know each other with a degree of intimacy, holding  private
                meetings  in  their  homes,  are  unlikely  to   have   any
                suspicions that one amongst them is an informer.   If  that
                applies to one local group,  the  members  of  other  local
                groups probably share a similar degree of confidence. There
                is  evidence  from  some  correspondents  that,  from   the
                questions asked when interviewed by  NISS  the  authorities
                did not have the level of  detailed  knowledge  that  would
                have been expected of them.   Whilst  these  considerations
                must be borne in mind, it  is  impossible  to  be  dogmatic
                about the reach of informants and the scope of surveillance
                that we know is practised.

            213.   It seems unlikely that photographs of those  attending  a
                demonstration outside an embassy where the photographer  is
                one of the group are likely to have been photographed by an
                informer.    There   are   formidable    difficulties    in
                ascertaining the identity  of  a  person  in  a  photograph
                unless the person in known to  the  person  who  identifies
                him.  Absent facial recognition techniques about  which  we
                have no evidence, there is no evidence that a person  could
                be  identified  from  banks   of   photographs   taken   at
                demonstrations across the world  when  he  is  returned  to
                Khartoum.

            214.   Notwithstanding these limitations,  we  accept  the  fact
                that  the  Sudanese  authorities  seek  information   about
                opposition activists in the United  Kingdom  and  there  is
                direct evidence that some returnees  have  been  confronted
                with photographs taken by covert operations in  the  United
                Kingdom conducted on behalf of the security  services.   It
                is not, therefore, a fanciful claim that individuals can be
                identified by embassy or other staff.  Speaking  generally,
                given the cost and effort of conducting surveillance, it is
                reasonable to assume that these  activities  would  not  be
                conducted if they were incapable of producing some  results
                and that the information obtained is  sufficient  to  merit
                the continuation of these efforts.  The  obvious  cost  and
                effort render it probable  (like  any  other  intelligence-
                gathering organisation) that these resources  are  targeted
                at those that pose the most obvious risk.  In  a  crowd  of
                dozens of people, surveillance is unlikely  to  be  carried
                through  in  an  attempt  to  identify  the   rank-and-file
                participants and is more likely to be focussed on  leaders,
                organisers, those often or regularly seen  at  such  events
                and those present at events which are likely to attract the
                particular sensitivity  of  the  Sudanese  officials  here,
                perhaps outside the embassy or  perhaps  at  a  significant
                anniversary or commemoration.

            215.   In the context of this case, obvious  difficulties  arise
                in relation to establishing what information finds its  way
                back to the authorities in Sudan about  the  activities  of
                individuals whilst in the United Kingdom.  It is a  forlorn
                hope that an individual will establish - save in the rarest
                of cases -  that  an  informer  has  identified  him  at  a
                particular event on a particular day  or  that  an  embassy
                official has photographed a protest in  circumstances  that
                he is then able to identify  the  participants.   We  doubt
                whether the risk can be elevated to a finding that there is
                a real risk of his doing  so.   Nevertheless  the  evidence
                should not be discarded for that  reason  alone  but  falls
                into the jig-saw of  evidence  building  up  the  composite
                picture of the individual.  It is at the end of this entire
                process that the decision maker  then  reaches  his  single
                conclusion on the issue of a real risk.

   53. In GJ and others (post-civil war: returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]
       UKUT 00319 (IAC), the Tribunal summarised the  current  guidance  on
       Sri Lanka in relation to sur place claims in these terms:

            (8)     The  Sri  Lankan  authorities'  approach  is  based   on
            sophisticated intelligence, both as  to  activities  within  Sri
            Lanka and in the diaspora.  The Sri Lankan authorities know that
            many Sri Lankan Tamils travelled abroad as economic migrants and
            also that everyone in the Northern Province had  some  level  of
            involvement with the  LTTE  during  the  civil  war.   In  post-
            conflict  Sri  Lanka,  an  individual's  past  history  will  be
            relevant only to the extent that it  is  perceived  by  the  Sri
            Lankan authorities as indicating a present risk to  the  unitary
            Sri Lankan state or the Sri Lankan Government.

            (9)    The authorities maintain a computerised  intelligence-led
            "watch" list. A person whose name appears on a "watch"  list  is
            not reasonably likely to be detained at the airport but will  be
            monitored by the security services after his or her  return.  If
            that monitoring does not indicate that such a person is a  Tamil
            activist working to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state  or
            revive the internal armed conflict, the individual  in  question
            is not, in general, reasonably likely  to  be  detained  by  the
            security forces.  That will be a question of fact in each  case,
            dependent on any diaspora activities  carried  out  by  such  an
            individual.

   54. The lead appellant in the Upper Tribunal was GJ but his  appeal  was
       allowed by the Upper Tribunal and he was not, therefore, a party  in
       the appeal to the Court of Appeal under the name  of  MP  &  Anor  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 829  (May
       LJ (Vice President) and Elias and Underhill LJJ).  The first  ground
       of appeal asserted that the Upper  Tribunal  reached  findings  that
       were more restrictive than the more generous  UNHCR  Guidelines  and
       which were  unsupported  by  the  evidence.   The  Court  of  Appeal
       rejected that submission.   However,  the  Vice  President  said  in
       relation to the sur place claim:

            24.    I find this somewhat elusive as a free-standing ground of
            appeal. There is plainly an overlap with the  first  ground.  On
            its  own,  its  target  seems  to  be  paragraph  336   of   the
            determination of the UT:

                "We do not consider that attendance at demonstrations in the
                diaspora alone is sufficient to create  a  real  risk  or  a
                reasonable degree of likelihood that a person  will  attract
                adverse attention on return to Sri Lanka."

            And paragraph 351:

                "Attendance at one, or even several  demonstrations  in  the
                diaspora is not of  itself  evidence  that  a  person  is  a
                committed Tamil activist seeking to promote Tamil separatism
                within Sri Lanka."

            The issue here is not that of the  politically  indifferent  who
            seek to bolster an asylum claim by opportunist participation  in
            sur place demonstrations in the hope of being  photographed  and
            perceived as suspicious (as  to  which,  see,  for  example,  KS
            (Burma) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA
            Civ 67). The concern is with genuine diaspora demonstrators  who
            may be put at risk on return as a  result  of  surveillance  and
            video recording or photography.

            25.    There was evidence before the UT  of  such  intelligence-
            gathering by the Sri Lankan authorities and that it has  reached
            a level of sophistication. However, it did not take the form  of
            a  cogent  correlation  between  mere  participation   in   such
            demonstrations and persecution on return. Nor, for that  matter,
            do the UNHCR Guidelines put it so low.  The  reference  to  LTTE
            "propaganda activists and those with,  or  perceived  as  having
            had, links to the Sri Lankan diaspora that provided funding  and
            other support to the LTTE" seems to assume a higher  level  than
            mere participation in one or more demonstrations.  No  doubt  it
            can form a part of the picture but I do not consider that it was
            legally erroneous of the UT to conclude that it  needs  more  to
            qualify as a risk category or operative risk  factor.  The  real
            issue in this case is how much more - essentially the  basis  of
            the first ground of appeal.

   55. Miss Jegarajah also relied upon  MP & Anor v Secretary of State  for
       the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 829 to suggest that there may be
       an additional category of risk directed to those who have  given  or
       have shown a willingness to give  evidence  of  war  crimes  to  the
       international authorities but the passage relied upon  by  her  does
       not establish such individuals form a distinct category of risk:

           At  the  moment,  the  evidence  about  these  circumstances  is
           understandably vague and speculative. It may well  be  that,  if
           international pressure were to lead to the  establishment  of  a
           different form of inquiry, the position would call  for  further
           consideration in a case  in  which  appellants  could  give  and
           adduce evidence about specific difficulties. However, we are not
           in that position (although Ms Jegarajah was  able  to  point  to
           current developments at the United Nations and  elsewhere  which
           could give rise to such developments). Nor is  the  evidence  of
           the second putative group  in  concrete  form.  It  rests  on  a
           passage in the report of Dr Smith which, on analysis,  seems  to
           relate to those who have provided evidence  of  war  crimes.  At
           this stage, there is no evidence of an  evidence-receiving  body
           beyond the LLRC, in relation to which protection is established.

Analysis of the sur place claim

   56. This has been a long preamble to  the  analysis  of  the  appellants
       claim. It stems from a problem which is entirely of the  appellant's
       own making. The appellant has not been truthful about his claim  for
       asylum and, whilst the desire to help his family (which both he  and
       they perceive is best  achieved  by  his  remaining  in  the  United
       Kingdom) is understandable, it has resulted in the appellant  having
       been found to be unreliable in his claim to be at risk. In doing so,
       he has enlisted the help of his family both here and in Sri Lanka to
       advance the claim that I have found is untrue.  They  have  done  so
       willingly.

   57. Hence the appellant, through his own and his  family's  evidence  is
       not able to be relied upon as credible in anything they  say  as  to
       risk the appellant faces and this includes his sur place  claim.  It
       is true that certain basic parts of it are assisted by  photographs.
       They show the appellant attended  demonstrations,  dressed  for  the
       part and holding  banners  and  placards  for  the  benefit  of  the
       cameraman. For the most part, the photographs were taken by  friends
       and fellow demonstrators.  I am satisfied that the  photographs  are
       directed  towards  those  considering  his  asylum  claim  and  were
       produced for that purpose.

   58. It follows that the appellant is  driven  back  when  advancing  his
       claim to the generic evidence  that  is  not  disputed.  It  is  not
       tainted by the appellant's own lack of credibility.

   59. What however is clear is that the appellant's new-found interest  in
       attending demonstrations was fired by the making of his asylum claim
       and the realisation that he had no other  means  to  avoid  removal.
       Whilst he was pursuing his studies  there  is  no  evidence  of  his
       making political statements about the plight of the  Tamils  in  Sri
       Lanka.  Indeed, what is  apparent  to  me  is  the  almost  complete
       absence of any political credo that establishes any genuine  passion
       for the cause of Tamil freedoms. It is not enough for Mr  Yogalingam
       to express the appellant's convictions on  the  appellant's  behalf:
       'he is an  ardent  supporter  of  our  mission'...'he  continues  to
       express his political aspiration publicly.' The exclusive  focus  in
       the appellant's  evidence  was  upon  attending  demonstrations  and
       making sure that his presence is recorded. The appellant  has  never
       been a member of the LTTE  and  before  his  arrival  here  is  only
       'political' involvement was accommodating two LTTE members for  less
       than a month in 2008. There is nothing to suggest that by  doing  so
       he was espousing a  particular  political  cause.  There  is  little
       evidence of any developed belief  pattern  beyond  his  presence  at
       demonstrations, a presence which I find is designed to  advance  his
       asylum claim and no more.

   60. In such circumstances, it is impossible  to  reach  the  conclusion,
       even to the lower standard of proof, that this appellant is  of  any
       interest whatever to the Sri Lankan authorities. When questioned, he
       will say no more than the truth: "I am, indeed, a Tamil but one  who
       has never been interested in politics. I share none of  the  beliefs
       of the LTTE. I do not espouse violence. I do not seek  to  overthrow
       the regime in Sri Lanka. I accept as a fait accompli the outcome  of
       the war that attempted to achieve other things.'

   61. As such, the appellant plainly falls well outside any categorisation
       of a person at risk.

   62. What difference, then, does it make that the appellant has  appeared
       in photographs of demonstrations? First,  we  know  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities  conduct  surveillance  on  United   Kingdom   residents
       attending demonstrations in order  to  seek  out  those  wishing  to
       undermine the unitary nature of the Sri Lankan state. Second, it may
       well be that the appellant's  photograph  has  been  viewed  by  Sri
       Lankan officials along with the  faces  of  many  hundreds,  perhaps
       thousands, of other Tamils in the United Kingdom and  across  Europe
       and America. The  rank-and-file  demonstrator  abroad,  though  more
       vocal, will not stand apart from Tamils in Sri Lanka in terms of the
       threat they pose to the unitary state. It is not simply  speculation
       but  it  would  be  perverse  to  assume  that  a   United   Kingdom
       demonstrator is deemed by the authorities to be the same as a  Tamil
       activist bent on unsettling the delicate political  balance  in  Sri
       Lanka. The Sri Lankan authorities must be taken to know the obvious.
       Any surveillance requires an evaluation  of  the  profile  of  those
       under surveillance.

   63. Hence, quite apart from the formidable difficulties of  establishing
       that the Sri Lankan authorities have or  will  have  identified  the
       appellant as a  separatist  through  face  recognition  or  informer
       infiltration, or otherwise putting a name to a  face,  or  comparing
       banks of photographs,  (only  some  of  whom  could  conceivably  be
       identified), there remains the fact that the appellant is not a risk
       to the Sri Lankan state and never has  been.  Notwithstanding  this,
       his claim is that he will be perceived to be  such  a  risk,  albeit
       mistakenly. This claim cannot legitimately be advanced relying  upon
       the appellant's direct evidence or that of his family  because  that
       evidence is unreliable.  Instead, the appellant has to rely upon the
       generic effect of  the  Country  Evidence.  That  is  precisely  the
       difficulty identified by the Courts  in  Mbanza  and  MP  &  Anor  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department.

   64. When I consider the evidence in the round I have  reached  the  firm
       conclusion that notwithstanding the appellant's claim to have  given
       himself a profile which is essentially  untrue,  he  has  failed  to
       establish that his efforts have acted successfully upon the minds of
       those Sri Lankan officials in the United Kingdom or in Sri Lanka.  I
       do not accept that he has successfully bamboozled them.

   65. For these reasons, I am not satisfied his sur place  claim  is  made
       out.

DECISION

    The Judge made  an  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  I  substitute  a
    determination

       Dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                           22 September 2016
                                  Appendix

                    (REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW)

 1. These are my reasons for finding an error of law.

 2. In a complex procedural history in this appeal there came a stage  when
    Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rimington  gave  a  determination  on  a
    specific issue which is material to the appeal before me.  In paragraph
    17 of her decision she said,

         "Evidence was put forward at the appeal that there was a  delay  in
         the processing of applications and that the application  was  dated
         when received in other words it had predated the recorded  time  by
         days.  In the event Mr Duffy for the respondent confirmed that  the
         application was recorded as made on 24 December 2010 one day  prior
         to the claimed arrest on 25 December 2010 (AIR question 19).   This
         was thus an error of fact and thus an error of law and renders  the
         determination unsafe in the credibility findings."

    Unfortunately that exact same error was  made  by  the  judge  in  this
    appeal when it came before her in a  determination  that  was  made  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge E B Grant promulgated on 3 March  2016.   The
    appellant repeated his claim to have been arrested and detained and ill-
    treated by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities.   In  paragraph  32  of  the
    determination she repeats the evidence provided by the father that  his
    son was arrested at a checkpoint by the army on 25 December 2010 on his
    way to Jaffna from Colombo.  He was detained for seven  days  according
    to the appellant's own evidence and released upon payment of a bribe.

 3. The difficulty as the judge saw it was that the appellant was  said  to
    have made a visa application on 30 December  2010  and  had  that  been
    correct he would have been lying in relation to his claim to have  been
    in detention at the material time.  The judge then went on in paragraph
    33 to say this

         "None of the explanations the  appellant  has  given  are  remotely
         credible when set  in  the  context  of  the  appellant's  father's
         evidence which says he was arrested on 25 December.  The  appellant
         says he was detained for seven days therefore  he  could  not  have
         made an application for a visa on 30 December if he was detained as
         claimed."

 4. Taken with the absence of any credible medical evidence to support  the
    appellant's claim that he was tortured  whilst  in  detention  and  the
    extremely belated production of medical evidence  before  the  Tribunal
    which was put forward on the day of the hearing,  the  judge  concluded
    that the significant  discrepancy  resulted  in  the  appellant  having
    fabricated his claim to have been arrested and detained.

 5. It is apparent to me that from paragraph 35 of her decision  the  judge
    built on  that  adverse  credibility  finding  to  reject  the  medical
    evidence as well and concluded in relation to that that  the  appellant
    had fabricated a claim to be mentally  ill  and  to  have  persuaded  a
    psychiatrist, Dr Persuad, about a medical condition that was in fact  a
    fabrication.

 6. I am satisfied that the judge in making those findings  fell  into  the
    same error as was identified by Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rimington
    in the earlier decision.  There is perhaps an issue as to  whether  one
    error infects another I rely upon the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
    in Haile [2001] EWCA Civ 663.  This was a case in which the Adjudicator
    had put forward six separate reasons for disbelieving the appellant but
    one of those reasons was seriously flawed.  Lord  Justice  Simon  Brown
    said in paragraph 25,

         "This was  really  a  most  regrettable  mistake  for  the  Special
         Adjudicator to have made. True it produced only one of six  reasons
         for disbelieving the appellant but it must  inevitably  lead  to  a
         sense of keen justice in the appellant and it cannot confidently be
         said to have made no ultimate difference to the result."

 7. That  decision  somewhat  elderly  was  reconsidered  by  Lord  Justice
    Neuberger, as he then was, in the case of HK v The Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ 1037 and in which  he  said  in
    paragraph 46

         "In this case I am satisfied that one cannot be confident that  the
         Tribunal would have rejected  HK's  case  on  the  basis  of  their
         reasons which have survived scrutiny in this court."

    Once again the court uses the word 'confident' and in my judgment  that
    is the way to approach cases where there has been one error  but  there
    may be other findings of fact  which  are  sustainable.   I  cannot  be
    confident that the finding made by the judge which was central  to  her
    credibility findings would have not made a material difference.   I  am
    satisfied that it did make  a  difference  to  her  assessment  of  the
    medical evidence because the judge deals with both in paragraph 35 in a
    single sentence showing just how closely the  two  adverse  credibility
    findings were related to each other and in those circumstances  I  have
    taken the view that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    contains a material error and should be set aside which is what  I  now
    do.
