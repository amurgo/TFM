MR JUSTICE BLAKE
Introduction

   1. The applicant is a national of Bangladesh born on 18 February 1989. He
      came to the UK in September 2009 with a Tier 4 student  visa  and  has
      been resident here since.

   2. Until 30 April 2014 he was allowed to take part time  work  under  the
      applicable Tier 4 rules; between April 2011 and April 2013 he  did  so
      work at an Indian restaurant called the Sesame Restaurant in  Kingston
      Road, New Malden.

   3. In April 2014 he was granted leave to remain for one year to  continue
      his studies for an extended diploma  in  business  and  administrative
      management at the London Regal College.  His  extension  of  stay  was
      subject to the condition 'No work except work placement'. At this time
      he was living with a cousin and his family.

   4.  In early June 2014 the applicant  returned  to  live  at  the  Sesame
      restaurant. He says that he was looking for somewhere quiet to  study,
      away from his cousin's children. He  was  offered  a  room  above  the
      restaurant premises rent free.

   5. On Saturday 28 June 2014 the restaurant  was  visited  by  a  team  of
      immigration officers on  suspicion  that  people  were  working  there
      without authority. The applicant was seen behind  the  bar  area.  The
      manager of the restaurant was interviewed as was the applicant  and  a
      note of that conversation was recorded. In substance the applicant  is
      recorded as saying "I come here to help them recently I moved upstairs
      and I come down" and he agreed that he got reward  in  terms  of  free
      food and accommodation  when  he  helped  them  (i.e.  the  restaurant
      owners).  The manager told the officers that the applicant helped  out
      Fridays and Saturday between 6.00 and 8.30 pm in return for free  food
      and accommodation.

   6. On the basis of that  information  a  Chief  Immigration  Officer  was
      satisfied that the applicant had been working at the  restaurant  part
      -time and was in breach of his prohibition  on  taking  employment.  A
      decision was made that he was liable for  removal  under  s.10  (1)(a)
      Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (IAA)   (prior  to  amendment  by  the
      Immigration Act 2014 (IA)). A notice was served to  that  effect  with
      the consequence that s.10 (8)  operated  to  invalidate  his  existing
      leave to remain. He was detained with  a  view  to  removal.  A  civil
      liability notice was served on the restaurant in the sum of �40,000 in
      respect of breaches of the employer's obligations by employing  people
      who were not entitled to work in the UK. Subsequently it  was  decided
      not to pursue enforcement of this notice.

   7. On 5 July 2014, the applicant was served with removal directions for 9
      July 2015. On 7 July he issued proceedings for judicial review.  These
      were served 8 July and resulted in the deferral of his removal. On  30
      July summary grounds in opposition to the application were  filed.  In
      substance they join issue with the applicant's assertion that  he  was
      not working. On 31 July he was granted bail pending the  determination
      of the judicial review hearing. This has removed any challenge to  his
      continued detention and there is no  claim  in  respect  of  his  past
      detention.

   8. Permission was refused by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on 16 February
      2015 on the basis :

        i.  the respondent was entitled to make the removal decision on the
           evidence;
       ii.  the applicant had the benefit of an alternative  remedy  namely
           an out of country appeal.

   9. The applicant renewed the application for permission  that  was  heard
      before UT Judge Warr on 24 April 2015. He granted  permission  on  the
      basis that the decision was arguably Wednesbury unreasonable. He noted
      that the alternative remedy point had not been taken  in  the  summary
      grounds or in the oral argument on the renewed application.  He issued
      standard directions requiring detailed grounds to be lodged within  35
      days of the permission decision and for lodging of skeleton arguments.
      The directions invited the respondent to raise the alternative  remedy
      point if so advised.

  10. Detailed grounds were lodged (it  would  appear  out  of  time)  on  1
      September 2015. These grounds were entirely silent on the  alternative
      remedy point.  They were confined comments on the evidence to  support
      the proposition that the  applicant  was  working  in  breach  of  his
      conditions.

  11. On 27 October the applicant lodged his skeleton argument in accordance
      with the directions. It was  directed  to  the  proposition  that  the
      applicant could not be said to  be  working  and  a  decision  of  the
      European Court of Justice was relied on in support of the  proposition
      that "purely marginal and ancillary  activities"  did  not  amount  to
      economic activity for the purpose of Community Law  (  Case  C  197/86
      Brown v Sec State for Scotland ECR 1988-0305 at 21]).

  12. On 5 November 2015, the respondent lodged her skeleton argument.  This
      document did, for the first time, take the  alternative  remedy  point
      and cited the relevant authorities. The skeleton also  drew  attention
      to paragraph 6  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  defines  employment
      generally (unless the contrary appears elsewhere) as  including  "paid
      and unpaid employment, paid and unpaid placements undertaken  as  part
      of a course or period of study  ,  self  employment  and  engaging  in
      business or any professional activity".


   The hearing


  13.  A properly paginated bundle was lodged as directed. Unfortunately  it
      did not include the skeleton argument of either party.   The  skeleton
      arguments did not make their way on to the court file or  the  log  of
      documents received. It was only at the hearing  that  they  were  made
      available to me.  This would appear to be an error in  the  Tribunal's
      administration, but it would be  helpful  for  the  future  that  such
      skeleton submissions were included in the bundle  as  that  forms  the
      judge's pre-reading for the application. It was nevertheless  apparent
      from the bundle of authorities prepared by the parties that, with  the
      exception of Brown,  each was concerned with the issue of  alternative
      remedy and ranged from  R (Lim) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  773   to  R
      (Mehmood and Ali) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 744, a judgment  handed  down
      on 14 July 2015.


  14. At the outset of the proceedings I raised  the  issue  of  alternative
      remedy with Mr Rendle. He said that he first became aware of the issue
      when it was  raised  in  the  respondent's  skeleton  of  5  November.
      Nevertheless, he was not prejudiced by the late raising of  the  issue
      and was able to address it.

  15. Mr Malik accepted that the matter had been raised late and  then  only
      in the skeleton argument  and  not  the  detailed  grounds.  Following
      exchanges with the court he applied to  formally  amend  the  detailed
      grounds to raise the issue. In the light  of  Mr  Rendle's  stance,  I
      granted him permission to do so.

  16. The amendment proved decisive at the hearing because I did not  accept
      Mr Rendle's submissions that there were here exceptional circumstances
      to justify proceeding by way of judicial review despite the  existence
      of an out of country appeal.

  17. Both advocates were agreed that this right of appeal was preserved for
      decisions taken prior to October 2014 when the amendments made to s.10
      IAA by the IA 2014 came into effect  as  the  transitional  provisions
      made by the order bringing  it  into  effect  preserve  the  right  of
      appeal. It was thus still available to Mr Miah to exercise.

  18. It was also common ground that if such a decision had been made  after
      the coming into force of the new regime laid down  in   the  IA  2014,
      there would no longer be an alternative remedy as:

        i. There was no appeal at all (in country or out of country) in the
           absence of a human rights or asylum point.


       ii. The appellate jurisdiction was confined to  decisions  on  human
           rights and asylum and no  longer  included  whether  immigration
           decisions were made in accordance with the law.

Conclusions:

  19. This litigation has been unfortunate and generated  unnecessary  costs
      for both sides.


  20. In the case of Lim (above) a person subject to immigration control was
      said to have worked in breach of permitted periods.  He challenged the
      decision to remove him without  an  in  country  right  of  appeal  by
      judicial review. Lloyd-Jones J (as he  then  was)   [2006]  EWHC  3004
      (Admin) decided two preliminary issues:

        i. The challenge was to the  existence  of  a  statutory  power  to
           remove  the  applicant  and  detain  him  pending  removal.  The
           precedent fact jurisdiction established  by  Khawaja  and  Khera
           [1984] I AC 74 applied. The question was whether  the  applicant
           had worked in breach of conditions and not whether a  reasonable
           immigration  officer  properly  directing   himself   could   so
           conclude.


       ii. There were sufficient reasons  to  proceed  by  judicial  review
           rather than an out of country appeal:  the  breach  alleged  was
           venial and removal seemed disproportionate; a genuine period  of
           study with a view to qualification  would  be  interrupted;  the
           appellate remedy provided  by  statute  would  not  be  able  to
           restore the applicant to the position he previously  enjoyed  if
           the respondent failed to demonstrate that there was a breach  of
           conditions.

  21. The Secretary of State appealed to the  Court  of  Appeal.  Sedley  LJ
      giving the principal judgment of the court upheld  the  judge  on  the
      first issue but reversed him on the second (see at [17]-19] and [22]).


  22.  On the second issue, it was pointed out that  judicial  review  is  a
      discretionary remedy of last resort and was not appropriate were there
      was an alternative remedy provided by Parliament, even if that  remedy
      was not as convenient for the applicant as a pre-removal decision.  It
      would only be exceptional circumstances that such a  challenge  should
      proceed by way of judicial review.

  23. The Lim decision has been consistently followed in the Court of Appeal
      ever since: notably in RK (Nepal) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 359  and  the
      recent decision in Mehmood and Ali (supra) at [49] to  [72]  where  at
      [68] Lord Justice Beatson noted that it was common ground that if  the
      appeal succeeded  on  the  facts  it  was  the  Secretary  of  State's
      obligation to give proper effect to the findings of the tribunal.

  24. There is a helpful decision of this Tribunal in Bilal Jan [2014] 00265
      (IAC) given in a constitution where Bean J (as he then was)  presided.
      The UT at [35] to [43] noted that the wide  scope  of  the  Tribunal's
      powers to decide whether a decision was in  accordance  with  the  law
      included the law or policy that should have applied when  the  primary
      facts were found and the requirement  to  act  fairly.  The  appellate
      jurisdiction was thus wide enough to determine: whether there had been
      a breach; whether the decision to remove was taken fairly and  whether
      proper regard had been had to any relevant policy on the question.

  25. In these circumstances, there is clearly a remedy that can address any
      legitimate contention in fact or law made by the applicant,  and  that
      means that leave to bring judicial review should normally  be  refused
      as a matter of judicial discretion where a  challenge  is  brought  to
      such a decision on grounds such as in the present case.

  26. I would add that the time to take a point about an alternative  remedy
      is at the permission stage when  costs  will  be  modest  and  a  full
      examination of the merits is not required. Once the court has  granted
      permission, then it would not be a sound  exercise  of  discretion  to
      refuse to entertain the application on its merits at  the  substantive
      hearing on the basis that there was an alternative to judicial review.
      I appreciate that in a number of the authorities permission  had  been
      granted but that was on the basis that the  alternative  remedy  point
      was specifically reserved to be argued at the full hearing.

  27. I, therefore, agree with the conclusion of Judge McGeachy in  refusing
      permission on this ground, and consider that it is a matter of  regret
      that the point and the relevant authorities were not raised either  in
      the AOS  or  the  oral  submissions  at  permission  hearing.   In  my
      judgement, it is more than a matter of regret that the point  was  not
      raised in the detailed grounds lodged in  response  to  the  grant  of
      permission by Judge  Warr.   The  applicant  was,  as  a  consequence,
      significantly misled as to the case he had to meet  until  5  November
      2015.  This is a consequence that can be reflected in the costs  order
      made at the conclusion of the case.

  28.  I disagree with Judge Warr that if the application had  proceeded  by
      way of judicial review, as opposed to statutory appeal under  the  old
      s.10 regime, that the relevant test would  have  been  the  Wednesbury
      reasonableness of the decision  that  the  applicant  was  statutorily
      liable to removal. The power to remove is given in  respect  of  those
      who are in breach and not those who are reasonably believed to  be  in
      breach; the power to detain could in theory be  challenged  by  habeas
      corpus, which is not  a  discretionary  remedy  and  where  the  court
      determines for itself whether  the  power  exists  on  the  particular
      facts.

  29.  All of the above is now  by  way  of  aside.   Once  the  grounds  of
      opposition were amended to raise alternative remedy, in  my  judgement
      there is no answer to  it.  The  marginal  nature  of  the  employment
      claimed to be in breach is not the answer in this case just as it  was
      not in Lim, despite  the  understandable  sense  of  disquiet  at  the
      disproportionate consequence visited on the applicant. The decision of
      the ECJ in Brown is nothing to the point; this court is not  concerned
      with whether the applicant was a worker within the meaning of  EU  law
      but whether he worked within the meaning  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
      The fact that a civil penalty notice did not proceed is not a relevant
      consideration to the existence of exceptional circumstances. Given the
      marginal nature of the work claimed, contested  proceedings  over  the
      proportionality of the fixed  penalty  might  have  been  lengthy  and
      costly and the result  uncertain;  the  same  might  be  said  if  the
      applicant had been charged with  a  criminal  offence  of  working  in
      breach.

  30. Having raised the matter with Mr Malik, it is pertinent to  add  three
      further observations to this judgment that may be relevant  in  future
      cases.

  31.  First,  although  they  have  not  been  the  subject   of   detailed
      submissions,  I  repeat  the  common  ground  that  the   transitional
      provisions to the changes made in 2014 will mean that the  conclusions
      reached in this judgment should apply to any  other  pending  case  of
      this  sort;  in  the  absence  of  truly   exceptional   circumstances
      permission to bring judicial review of similar  challenges  should  be
      refused.

  32.  Second, that in a case subsequently arising to which the transitional
      provisions do not apply, there will generally be `no appeal capable of
      being an alternative remedy and no jurisdiction in the appellate  body
      to determine the kind of issues that  may  arise  in  judicial  review
      proceedings: fairness, policy and public law proportionality. In those
      circumstances, the second proposition in  Lim  will  no  longer  bite.
      Judicial review is the only available remedy and will  be  appropriate
      to examine arguably unlawful acts.

  33. Finally, it appears to me that Mr Malik is right to contend  that  the
      new statutory regime makes the decision to curtail leave on the  basis
      of a breach, of conditions an immigration  decision  taken  under  the
      rules. Such decisions can only be challenged  on  conventional  public
      law principles rather  than  by  way  of  precedent  fact.  The  first
      proposition in Lim will thus also disappear and the unhappy harnessing
      together of the twin stallions of Khawaja precedent fact and declining
      jurisdiction as a matter of discretion will be a thing of the past and
      with it the quixotic search for the  exceptional  case.   The  owl  of
      Minerva flies by night. The law appears to me to be clearly stated  in
      the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in  R  (ota  Giri)  v  SSHD
      [2015] EWCA Civ 784 (28 July 2015) per Richards LJ  at  [14]  to  [32]
      reviewing the relevant principles and case law.


  34. I , therefore, dismiss  this  application  for  judicial  review.  The
      respondent seeks costs in  the  sum  of  �2200.  Having  succeeded  in
      defeating the application, in principle proportionate costs should  be
      payable by the applicant. I propose to drastically reduce  what  would
      otherwise be reasonable by reason of the failure to take the point the
      AOS, the argument before  Judge  Warr  and  in  the  detailed  grounds
      (served late). Significant costs could and should have been avoided if
      this had been done. I will award costs in the sum of  �500.   Mr  Miah
      will have to pay his own costs of the application, but  doubtless  his
      advisers will have to consider whether a discount  is  appropriate  by
      reason of their own apparent failure to grapple with the  decided  law
      and advise him appropriately
