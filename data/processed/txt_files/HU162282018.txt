                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Lodge promulgated on 26 February 2019 in  which  the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.






Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  18  April  1982  who
        applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom to join  her  husband
        Mr Christopher Njoku Ezenwa who is also the appellant's sponsor.
     3. The application was refused in a decision dated 4 July 2018  as  it
        was not found the appellant qualify for entry clearance under the 5
        - year partner route. The  decision-maker  was  not  satisfied  the
        appellant met the financial eligibility  requirements  of  Appendix
        FM,  the  English  language  requirement,  or   that   there   were
        exceptional circumstances  in  her  case  which  would  render  the
        refusal a breach of article 8 ECHR; for the reasons set out in  the
        decision under challenge. The refusal was considered  by  an  Entry
        Clearance Manager on 7 January 2019 who, whilst conceding that  the
        appellant had produced sufficient evidence to  show  she  satisfied
        the English language  requirement,  upheld  the  decision  for  the
        following reasons:


             "With regard to the appellant had not  meeting  the  financial
             provisions of Appendix FM, it is  clear  from  the  additional
             documentation submitted in the appeal bundle that because  the
             sponsor did not work in February 2018, his net pay for the six-
             month period under review from 06/10/17 - 06/04/does not  meet
             the requisite �9300.


             I have considered under paragraphs GEN  3.1  and  GEN  3.2  of
             Appendix FM  as  applicable,  whether  there  are  exceptional
             circumstances in the appellant's case  which  could  or  would
             render refusal a breach of article 8 of the  ECHR  because  it
             could or would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for
             the appellant or the appellant's family. Following a  thorough
             assessment of the appeal I am satisfied that there is no basis
             for such a claim.


     4. The Judge having  considered  the  documentary  and  oral  evidence
        provided by the sponsor sets out findings of fact from [13] of  the
        decision under challenge in which the Judge noted the sole issue in
        the appeal was whether the appellant met the financial requirements
        of Appendix FM  and  whether  the  appellant  had  established  the
        sponsor had an annual income prior to the decision date of �18,600.
     5. Findings of fact between [19 - 25] are in the following terms:

             "19.     Over the  period  October  2017  to  March  2018  the
                  sponsor received a total of �8319. That is  clearly  below
                  the �9300 required. The sponsor in evidence  said  he  had
                  been on holiday that is why no payslip  for  February  was
                  submitted. I accept his explanation but that does not  get
                  around the fact that his income for the 6 months prior  to
                  the date of the application does not  evidence  an  annual
                  salary of �18,600.


             20.  Looking at his income for the 12 months prior to the date
                  of the application, the 3 April 2017, the  schedule  shows
                  the total income from June 2017 - March 2018  of  �16,064.
                  For reasons I cannot discern I do not  have  the  payslips
                  for April and May 2017. Neither are those months listed on
                  the schedule. In the absence of those payslips  I  am  not
                  prepared to find that is income for the period April  2017
                  - March 2018 was above the minimum income requirement.


             21.  I have not been furnished with  any  evidence  from  HMRC
                  such as a P60 (which might have been helpful). I also note
                  that I have no explanation  as  to  why  the  schedule  of
                  earnings is from  June  2017  to  May  2018  when  a  more
                  appropriate schedule would have detailed the earnings from
                  April 2017 to the end of March 2018.


             22.  I  cannot  find  on  the  evidence  before  me  that  the
                  appellant meets the minimum income requirement of Appendix
                  FM.


             23.  Perhaps I should add that I am satisfied having regard to
                  the appellant's bundle that  the  appellant  has  provided
                  personal bank statements corresponding to the payslips for
                  the 6 months prior to the application.


             24.  This being a human rights appeal the appellant failing to
                  meet the Immigration Rules will not necessarily cause  the
                  appeal to fail. I have, however, not  been  provided  with
                  anything   to   suggest   there   are   any    exceptional
                  circumstances which would require me to look  outside  the
                  Rules.  Whilst  the  result  of  this   appeal   will   be
                  disappointing and upsetting to the appellant, it means she
                  is unable to join her sponsor in the  UK  at  the  present
                  time, that disappointment may be assuaged by the appellant
                  making a fresh application  which  meets  the  Immigration
                  Rules.  I  am  satisfied  the  decision  to   refuse   the
                  application  is  proportionate  having   regard   to   the
                  maintenance of effective immigration control.


             25.  The appeal is dismissed."

     6. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  the  relevant  parts  of
        which are in the following terms:

             "3.  It is submitted, firstly, that the judge failed  to  take
                  account of the sponsor's Santander  savings  account,  the
                  balance of which would  have  overcome  the  shortfall  in
                  income  in  the  period  preceding  the  application.  The
                  Santander  statements  which  were   provided   with   the
                  application  for  permission   to   appeal   show   wildly
                  fluctuating balances, however, and it would not have  been
                  possible  for  the  judge  to  conclude  that  there  were
                  sufficient savings to overcome the shortfall in the manner
                  contemplated by E-ECP 3.1(b) of Appendix FM.


             4.   The second and third grounds merit consideration  by  the
                  Upper Tribunal. The judge focused on the  six  and  twelve
                  month periods preceding the date of application  (3  April
                  2018), as required by Appendix FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
                  Rules. In circumstances in which  there  was  evidence  to
                  show that the sponsor had earned  more  than  the  MIR  in
                  other 12 month periods, however, it is arguable  that  the
                  judge failed to adopt an  approach  which  was  consistent
                  with the character and evaluation  which  Article  8  ECHR
                  requires: MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10: [2017] 1  WLR  771,
                  at [99].


             5.   As for the fourth ground, I have seen  no  evidence  that
                  the sponsor claimed before the First-Tier Tribunal to have
                  two jobs, let alone any  evidence  of  income  from  other
                  jobs.


             6.   In the circumstances, permission to  appeal  is  granted.
                  Whilst I do not personally  consider  the  first  or  last
                  grounds to be arguable, I nevertheless grant  unrestricted
                  permission to appeal in light of Ferrer  [2012]  UKUT  304
                  (IAC)."


Error of law


Preliminary issue

     7. At the commencement of the hearing before  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mr
        Ihebuzar handed up a copy of a decision of a Deputy  Judge  of  the
        Upper Tribunal dated 25th May 2016 following  a  hearing  at  Field
        House in London in which the appeal of an Entry  Clearance  Officer
        against a decision of another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal  who
        allowed the appellant's appeal was dismissed. It has not been  made
        out this is a reported decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  A  party
        wishing to rely upon an unreported decision  is  required  to  give
        consideration to the 'Practice Directions of  the  Immigration  and
        Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper  Tribunal,
        18  December  2018',  paragraph   11,   which   provides   that   a
        determination of the Tribunal which has not been reported  may  not
        be cited in proceedings before the Tribunal unless: (a) the  person
        who is or was the appellant before the First-Tier  Tribunal,  or  a
        member of that person's family, was a party to the  proceedings  in
        which the previous determination was issued; or  (b)  the  Tribunal
        gives permission.
     8. An application for permission must comply with the requirements  of
        paragraph 11.2 which provide that an application for permission  to
        cite a determination which has not been reported must (a) include a
        full transcript of the determination, (b) identify the  proposition
        for which the determination is to be cited and (c) certify that the
        proposition is not to be found in any reported determination of the
        Tribunal, the IAT or the AIT and  had  not  been  superseded  by  a
        decision of a higher authority.  Permission will only be granted on
        such an  application  where  the  Tribunal  considers  it  will  be
        materially assisted by citation of the  determination  as  distinct
        from the adoption in argument of the reasoning to be found  in  the
        determination.  The  Practice  Direction   identifies   that   such
        circumstances are likely to be rare particularly  in  the  case  of
        determinations   which   were   unreportable.   The   meaning    of
        "determination" is defined  in  paragraph  11.6  as  including  any
        decision of the AIT or the Tribunal.
     9. No application was made for  leave  to  rely  upon  the  unreported
        determination. There was no attempt  made  to  satisfy  the  formal
        requirements required by  the  Practice  Direction  or  any  reason
        established as to  why  the  decision  should  be  considered.  The
        earlier decision  clearly  stood  on  its  facts.  Accordingly  the
        decision of the Deputy Judge was not admitted.


Error of law finding

    10. It was conceded the appellant was only relying upon the second  and
        third grounds, relating to article 8 ECHR, it  being  accepted  the
        appellant was unable to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration
        Rules as found by the Judge.
    11. Guidance to caseworkers establishes that if an applicant for  entry
        clearance or leave to remain as a partner, child  or  parent  under
        Appendix FM does not otherwise meet the  relevant  requirements  of
        the Immigration Rules, the decision maker must move on to consider,
        under paragraph GEN.3.2. of Appendix FM, whether, in the  light  of
        all the information and evidence provided by the  applicant,  there
        are exceptional circumstances which would render refusal  a  breach
        of ECHR Article 8 because it would result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
        consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or
        another family member whose Article 8 rights it is evident from the
        information provided by the applicant would be affected.  If  there
        are such exceptional circumstances, entry  clearance  or  leave  to
        remain should be granted on the 10-year  route  to  settlement.  If
        not, the application should be refused. This approach  was  clearly
        adopted by the Judge too.
    12. It is argued on the appellant's behalf that the evidence before the
        Judge showed that the sponsor earned sufficient  income  to  enable
        him to support the appellant without recourse to public funds.   In
        the appeal bundle received on 5 June 2019 the appellant provided  a
        further  copy  of  a  number  of  documents  including  a  document
        described as a 'Breakdown of 12 months earnings' for the Sponsor at
        page 8. This document shows that between June 2017 and May 2018 the
        sponsor earned a total of �19,302.33. Mr Ihebuzar also referred  to
        the specific findings of the Judge at [15 -  17]  of  the  decision
        under challenge which are in the following terms:

             "15.     Within the appellant's bundle is a  letter  from  the
                  sponsor's employer (page  12),  the  letter  confirms  the
                  sponsor works on behalf of Independent Contractor Security
                  (ICS) as a security officer and has  been  employed  since
                  the 21 November 2013. The letter goes on to  say  that  he
                  works on a permanent basis  but  on  flexible  hours,  his
                  average earnings over the  last  previous  thirteen  weeks
                  (the letter is dated 23 July 2018) have been  �436.80  per
                  week working an average of 56 hours.


             16.  The reasons for refusal  letter  indicates  there  is  no
                  issue  with  regard  to  the  letter  from  the   employer
                  confirming his employment and gross annual salary. In  the
                  circumstances it is not clear to me if this was the letter
                  before the ECO as it does not appear to confirm his  gross
                  annual salary. Nevertheless having regard to  the  reasons
                  for refusal letter  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that  the
                  conditions of Appendix FM - SE have been met  with  regard
                  to the letter from his employer.


             17.  Turning to the issue of the earnings in  the  six  months
                  prior to the application date. I have been provided with a
                  schedule of the sponsor's earnings over the twelve  months
                  from June 2017 to May 2018. The schedule so far as  I  can
                  tell was prepared by the appellant's  solicitors.  I  have
                  checked it against the wage  slips  and  I  accept  it  as
                  correctly summarising  the  sponsors  earnings  over  that
                  twelve month period.  The  earnings  total  is  �19,302.33
                  which is above the threshold of �18,600."

    13. So far as the Immigration Rules are concerned the Judge noted there
        was no explanation for why the schedule of  earnings  provided  was
        from June 2017 to May 2018 when a more appropriate  schedule  would
        have detailed the earnings from April 2017  to  the  end  of  March
        2018. Indeed, in Hameed (Appendix FM - financial year) [2014]  UKUT
        00266 (IAC) it was held that the financial  year  for  purposes  of
        Appendix FM is the tax year, not the year selected  for  accounting
        purposes. In addition to the incorrect accounting period the  Judge
        also noted he had not been furnished with any  evidence  from  HMRC
        such as P60's which remained the case before  the  Upper  Tribunal.
        When this was point was raised the  appellant  seemed  to  indicate
        that such documents could be  provided  but  a  reaction  from  the
        appellant's representative  indicated  he  thought  otherwise.  The
        reality is, however, that no such documents have been provided.
    14. As well as being relevant to the  position  under  the  Immigration
        Rules the lack of satisfactory evidence relating to the appellant's
        position is also relevant to considering matters outside the Rules.
        In FK and OK Botswana [2013] EWCA Civ 238, Sir Stanley Burnton said
        that "The maintenance of immigration control is not an aim that  is
        implied for  the  purposes  of  article  8.2.  Its  maintenance  is
        necessary in order to preserve or to foster the economic well-being
        of the country, in order to protect health and morals, and for  the
        protection of the rights and freedoms of others. If there  were  no
        immigration control, enormous numbers of persons would be  able  to
        enter this country, and would be entitled to claim social  security
        benefits, the benefits of the National Health Service, to be housed
        (or to compete for housing with  those  in  this  country)  and  to
        compete for employment with  those  already  here.  Their  children
        would be entitled to be educated at  the  taxpayers'  expense...All
        such matters (and I do not suggest that they are the only  matters)
        go to the economic well-being of the country. That the  individuals
        concerned in the  present  case  are  law-abiding  (other  than  in
        respect of immigration controls) does not  detract  from  the  fact
        that the maintenance of a generally applicable  immigration  policy
        is, albeit indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article
        8".
    15. The Judge finds at [20] that in light of the nature of the evidence
        provided he was not prepared to find that the sponsor's income  for
        the period April 2017 to March 2018 was above  the  minimum  income
        required.  No arguable legal error is made out in relation  to  the
        dismissal of the appeal under the Immigration Rules.
    16. The grant of permission refers to the decision of the Supreme Court
        in R(on the application of MM (Lebanon) and Others) v Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10 in which the challenge
        to the acceptability in principle of the minimum income requirement
        failed.  It was found the minimum income  requirement  pursued  the
        legitimate aim of ensuring so far as was practicable that a  couple
        did not have  recourse  to  welfare  benefits  and  had  sufficient
        resources to be able to play a full part  in  British  life.   That
        legitimate  aim  justified  interference  with  Article  8  rights.
        However:
         (i) the rules left a gap regarding the welfare of  children  which
        was not adequately filled by the instructions  to  entry  clearance
        officers particularly so far as  treating  the  best  interests  of
        children as a  primary  consideration  was  concerned.   The  rules
        failed unlawfully to give effect to the duty under s55 of the  2009
        Act in respect of the welfare of children and the instructions were
        also unlawful;
         (ii) So far as alternative funding sources were concerned (such as
        prospective  earnings  of  the  foreign  partner  or  third   party
        support), whilst it was not irrational for the Secretary  of  State
        to give priority in the rules to simplicity of operation  and  ease
        of verification, operation of the same restrictive approach outside
        the rules was a different matter and much more difficult to justify
        under the Human Rights Act.  Nothing said in  the  instructions  to
        case officers could prevent the tribunal on appeal from looking  at
        the  matter  more  broadly.   There  was  nothing  to  prevent  the
        tribunal, in the context of the Human Rights Appeal,  from  judging
        for itself the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in
        the light of the evidence before it. In so doing, it would no doubt
        take account of such considerations as were discussed  in  Mahad  v
        Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16 including  the  difficulties
        of proving third party support.
    17. At [99] of MM (Lebanon), a paragraph specifically  referred  to  by
        the Judge granting permission, the Supreme Court find:

             "99.     Operation of the same  restrictive  approach  outside
                  the rules is a different matter, and in our view  is  much
                  more difficult to justify  under  the  HRA.  This  is  not
                  because "less intrusive"  methods  might  be  devised  (as
                  Blake J attempted to do: para  147),  but  because  it  is
                  inconsistent  with  the  character  of  evaluation   which
                  article 8 requires. As has been seen, avoiding a financial
                  burden on the state can be relevant to  the  fair  balance
                  required by the article. But that judgment cannot properly
                  be constrained  by  a  rigid  restriction  in  the  rules.
                  Certainly, nothing that is said  in  the  instructions  to
                  case officers can prevent  the  tribunal  on  appeal  from
                  looking at the matter more broadly. These are not  matters
                  of policy on which special weight has to  be  accorded  to
                  the judgment of the Secretary of State. There  is  nothing
                  to prevent the tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal,
                  from judging for itself the reliability of any alternative
                  sources of finance in the light of the evidence before it.
                  In doing so,  it  will  no  doubt  take  account  of  such
                  considerations as those discussed by Lord Brown  and  Lord
                  Kerr  in  Mahad,  including  the  difficulties  of   proof
                  highlighted in the quotation from Collins  J.  That  being
                  the position before the tribunal,  it  would  make  little
                  sense for decision-makers at  the  earlier  stages  to  be
                  forced to take a narrower approach  which  they  might  be
                  unable to defend on appeal."

    18. The Judge at [24] proceeds  to  consider  the  matter  outside  the
        Immigration Rules and specifically finds he had not  been  provided
        with anything to suggest there were any  exceptional  circumstances
        which would require the matter being considered further. The  Judge
        finds the decision to refuse the application  is  proportionate  to
        the legitimate aim relied upon.
    19. Mr Ihebuzar  was  asked  what  elements  constituted  circumstances
        sufficient to warrant  it  being  found  any  interference  with  a
        protected right would be disproportionate  such  that  the  Judge's
        findings could be said to be  infected  by  arguable  legal  error.
        Reference to the fact the appellant is now pregnant is not a matter
        that was before the Judge as this is a later occurring event  which
        may support a fresh application but not whether the Judge erred  in
        law on the basis of the information made available  to  the  First-
        tier Tribunal. The reality is that very little  was  offered  other
        than a bare assertion that the appellant and sponsor wish  to  live
        together in the United Kingdom and that the sponsor  could  support
        his wife. Whilst that may be understandable the  evidential  issues
        identified by the Judge still continue before  the  Upper  Tribunal
        supporting the submission by Mr Diwnycz that there was insufficient
        evidence to enable a finding to be made that the sponsor  was  able
        to support the appellant in the United Kingdom  and  that  to  find
        otherwise would be pure speculation.
    20. The protected right is clearly the family life that exists  between
        the appellant and her husband. The issue pursuant to article 8 ECHR
        will be the proportionality of the decision. On the one side of the
        balancing exercise is the desire  of  the  appellant  to  join  her
        husband in the United Kingdom so they can start or  continue  their
        married life  together.  On  the  evidence  before  the  Judge  the
        countervailing factors are however the inability of  the  appellant
        to satisfy the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  relating  to
        entry as a spouse as set out in Appendix FM, the failure to set out
        the extent of the sponsor's financial  position  clearly  which  is
        material  (in  the  article  8  exercise  the  assessment  of   the
        proportionality of the decision requires  clarity  in  relation  to
        which a settled pattern of sufficient income  would  have  been  of
        value),  and  the  ability  of  the  appellant  to  make  a   fresh
        application based on the new circumstances including the  existence
        of the pregnancy and the furnishing of adequate documentation  from
        HMRC together with from other sources to establish  the  correcting
        income position to demonstrate the economic welfare of  the  United
        Kingdom would not  be  adversely  affected  if  the  appellant  was
        granted entry clearance in a situation where she cannot satisfy the
        Immigration Rules.
    21. The conclusion of the Judge at [24] that he had not  been  provided
        with anything to suggest there are exceptional circumstances  which
        would require  detailed  examination  outside  the  Rules  and  the
        finding  that  the  decision   to   refuse   the   application   is
        proportionate  having  regard  to  the  maintenance  of   effective
        immigration control; has not been shown to be a finding infected by
        arguable  legal  error  based  upon  the  evidence  that  was  made
        available. The decision-maker  clearly  discharged  the  evidential
        burden upon  the  respondent  to  establish  that  the  refusal  is
        proportionate, and the appellant  failed  to  establish  sufficient
        evidence to counter this argument.


Decision

    22. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    23. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
