                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This appeal raises the following single issue:  should  an  applicant
       be refused leave to remain  on  a  mandatory  basis  under  paragraph
       322(1A) of the Immigration  Rules,  in  circumstances  where  he  has
       submitted  a  false  document,  absent  evidence  that  he   did   so
       dishonestly?

Background

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka.  He arrived  in  the  United
       Kingdom ('UK') on 18 September 2008 with leave to enter as a  student
       until  31  January  2012.   On  27  January  2012  he  submitted   an
       application for further leave to remain.  This application attached a
       degree certificate from the Open University of  Sri  Lanka,  said  to
       have been awarded to the appellant  in  2006.   The  application  was
       refused by the Secretary of State for the Home Department ('SSHD') in
       a decision dated 3 November 2012.  The decision states:
           "In your application you submitted a educational  document  from
           the  Open  University  of  Sri  Lanka  Faculty  of   Engineering
           Technology.
           I am satisfied that the educational document was false because D
           Rexam from the Open University of Sri Lanka have confirmed  that
           the Open University does not  offer  a  degree  of  Bachelor  of
           Information Technology & Networking  and  the  type  of  student
           registration  number  stated  is  not  relevant  to   the   Open
           University of Sri Lanka.
           As a false document has  been  submitted  in  relation  to  your
           application, it is refused  under  322(1A)  of  the  immigration
           rules.
           For the  above  reasons  I  am  satisfied  that  you  have  used
           deception in your application."

    3. The appellant appealed this decision to the First-tier Tribunal.   It
       is unnecessary  to  rehearse  the  lengthy  procedural  history  that
       followed, save to say that after his  appeal  was  dismissed  by  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  and   the   Upper   Tribunal,   the   appellant
       successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, where  the  matter  was
       settled by a consent order dated 7 April 2014, in  which  the  appeal
       was allowed and the matter remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal.   In
       the statement of reasons attached to the consent order  reference  is
       made to permission having been granted by  Moses  LJ  after  an  oral
       hearing on 19 November 2013 in the following terms:
           "The basis of the  grant  was  that  the  tribunal  should  have
           considered newspaper evidence provided by the appellant and that
           the central question was whether the appellant  was  aware  that
           his college was bogus."

    4. It is helpful to include extracts from the judgment of Moses  LJ  (RW
       (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1736) when granting permission  to
       appeal:
           "1.   This is an odd case in which the appellant claims that  he
           was, like many others in Sri Lanka, a dupe of  those  running  a
           college, a man called Sakvithi, who  ran  a  college  which  was
           really a front for, and a means of defrauding those who attended
           the college.  There are a number of  newspaper  reports  of  the
           relevant period showing how many  people  were  duped  into  the
           belief that this was a genuine  college.   When  this  appellant
           from Sri Lanka relied upon the certificate showing that  he  had
           obtained a degree for his further education  here  it  was  said
           that this was a false document and  therefore  by  reference  to
           paragraph 245ZX(a) and paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules, HC 395 of
           3 November 2002, not only was he not qualified  for  the  course
           but it would have the effect that he would not be able to  apply
           again both here and in a large number of other countries  within
           the Commonwealth.
           ...
           5.    In short, it seems to me that a  considerable  muddle  has
           entered  into  both  these  decisions  which  has  infected  the
           decision of the single judge refusing permission.  The point  is
           whether he appreciated that the certificate he  had  been  given
           was not genuine...
           ...
           7.    The judge refusing leave seems to have taken the view that
           because the  qualification  was  not  genuine,  refusal  of  the
           application was mandatory in any event.  Again,  that  does  not
           seem to be the way in which the Rules have been interpreted, see
           in particular Farqan Ahmed v SSHD [2011] UKUT 00351,  where  the
           Upper Tribunal clearly thought that it had to be shown that  the
           person deploying the document knew it was false.
           8.    I have been concerned as to whether  this  is  appropriate
           for a second appeal  but  bearing  in  mind  the  difficulty  of
           understanding what the Rule means in light of  the  decision  of
           this court in AA (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  773  and
           whether that can be applied to documents, contrary to  the  view
           of the single judge, it seems to me a matter  which  does  merit
           consideration by this court to clarify the matter."

The decision below

    5. In a decision dated 30 April 2015 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pooler
       concluded that the degree certificate relied upon  by  the  appellant
       was a false document for the purposes of  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  The  judge  recorded  the  facts  agreed  by  the
       parties as follows: (i) the Open University  of  Sri  Lanka  did  not
       award the appellant a degree;  (ii)  there  had  been  dishonesty  by
       someone else.  The appellant maintained that he had no  knowledge  of
       that other person's dishonesty until he received the SSHD's  decision
       in November 2012.

    6. The judge did not consider it necessary for the SSHD  to  prove  that
       the appellant knew that the certificate was false and /  or  that  he
       dishonestly used  it.   The  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant's
       acceptance that (i) the certificate was a  false  document  and  (ii)
       there  had  been  dishonesty  in  relation  to  it  by  another,  was
       sufficient to support a  finding  that  a  false  document  had  been
       submitted for the purposes of paragraph 322(1A).

    7. The judge did not  consider  it  was  strictly  necessary  to  assess
       whether the appellant had been shown to have  acted  dishonestly  but
       went on to do so on an alternative basis.   In  this  regard  it  was
       agreed that newspaper articles referring to the fraud were  reliable,
       in October 2008 allegations of fraud against Sakvithi  became  public
       knowledge and Sakvithi was arrested in 2010 but by  January  2013  he
       had not been convicted.  Having considered all the relevant  evidence
       the judge was not satisfied that the  appellant  had  discharged  the
       burden upon him that he "was not complicit in  the  dishonesty  which
       resulted in his obtaining a degree certificate".  The judge  went  on
       to address Article 8 of the ECHR, and dismissed the appeal both under
       the Rules and Article 8.

The issues in dispute between the parties

    8. Mr Lane relied upon his skeleton argument.   He  submitted  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing to  recognise  that  both
       Adedoyin v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773; [2011] 1 WLR 564 (also known and
       hereinafter referred to as 'AA Nigeria') and Ahmed  (general  grounds
       of refusal - material  non-disclosure)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00351
       (IAC) support the proposition that there needs to  be  dishonesty  or
       deception in the application  either  by  the  applicant  or  someone
       acting on his behalf.  Mr Lane therefore  submitted  that  the  judge
       erred in law  in  failing  to  consider  whether  or  not  there  was
       dishonesty in this application.

    9. Mr Lane also submitted that the judge erred in law when assessing the
       appeal in the alternative i.e. on the basis that  dishonesty  on  the
       part of the appellant was required, in placing the burden of proof on
       the appellant to  establish  he  was  not  dishonest.   Ms  Johnstone
       conceded that the judge erred in law in his application of the burden
       of proof but submitted  this  was  not  material  as  the  judge  was
       entitled to conclude  that  it  was  sufficient  that  the  appellant
       submitted a false document, having correctly directed himself  to  AA
       (Nigeria).  Both parties agreed that in these circumstances the  only
       issue  in  dispute  was  whether  the  judge  was  entitled  to  this
       conclusion.  If yes, the appellant's appeal fell to be dismissed.  On
       the other hand, if  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the  applicant  is
       necessary, then both parties agreed that the decision would  need  to
       be remade and that fresh findings would be necessary.

Legal framework

   10. Paragraph 322(1A) of  the  Immigration  Rules  provides  a  mandatory
       ground on which variation of leave to remain is to be refused:
           "...  where  false  representations  have  been  made  or  false
           documents or information have been  submitted  (whether  or  not
           material  to  the  application,  and  whether  or  not  to   the
           applicant's  knowledge),  or  material  facts  have   not   been
           disclosed, in relation to the application."

   11. Paragraph 320(7B) sets out the circumstances under which  a  previous
       breach of the UK's immigration laws attracts a mandatory  refusal  of
       entry clearance.  One such breach is:
           "... (d) using Deception in an application for entry  clearance,
           leave to enter or remain (whether successful or not) ..."

   12. There are a number of exceptions to this that  apply  dependent  upon
       the time that has elapsed since the applicant left  the  UK  and  the
       mode of departure.

   13. The grounds on which  entry  clearance  should  normally  be  refused
       includes the following at 320(11):
           "(11)  where  the  applicant  has  previously  contrived  in   a
           significant way to frustrate  the  intentions  of  these  Rules.
           Guidance will be published giving examples of  circumstances  in
           which an applicant who has  previously  overstayed,  breached  a
           condition attached to his leave, been an illegal Entrant or used
           Deception in an application for entry clearance, leave to  enter
           or remain (whether successful or not) is likely to be considered
           as having contrived  in  a  significant  way  to  frustrate  the
           intentions of these Rules."

   14. AA (Nigeria) (supra) considered the effect of 322(1A) and the meaning
       of the word 'false' i.e.  whether  it  is  used  in  the  meaning  of
       'incorrect' or in the meaning of  'dishonest'.   Rix  LJ  (with  whom
       Longmore LJ and Jacob LJ agreed) preferred the  latter  meaning  [66]
       for reasons he articulated at [66-75].  Rix LJ said this:
           "76.  For these  reasons,  I  conclude  that  Mr  Malik's  basic
           submission is correct. Whether as a matter of the interpretation
           solely of the relevant rules in paragraphs 320(7A), 320(7B)  and
           322(1A), but in any event when consideration is  also  given  to
           the assurances given in the Lords debate as supplemented by  the
           minister's letter to ILPA dated 4 April 2008, and to the  public
           guidance issued on behalf of the executive, the  answer  becomes
           plain, and in essence is all of a piece. Dishonesty or deception
           is needed, albeit not necessarily that of the applicant himself,
           to render  a  "false  representation"  a  ground  for  mandatory
           refusal.
           77.   If it  were  otherwise,  then  an  applicant  whose  false
           representation was in no way dishonest  would  not  only  suffer
           mandatory refusal but would also be barred from re-entry for ten
           years if he was removed or deported. That might not in itself be
           so very severe a rule, if only because the applicant always  has
           the option of voluntary departure. If, however,  he  has  to  be
           assisted at the expense of the Secretary of State, then the  ban
           is for five years.  Most  seriously  of  all,  however,  is  the
           possibility, on the Secretary of State's interpretation, that an
           applicant for entry clearance (not this case) who  had  made  an
           entirely innocent misrepresentation, innocent not only so far as
           his personal honesty is concerned but also in its origins, would
           be barred from re-entry  under  paragraph  320(7B)(ii)  for  ten
           years, even if he left the UK voluntarily."

Discussion

   15. Many of the reported decisions  addressing  322(1A)  and  its  sister
       provision in relation to entry clearance  (320(7A)),  have  concerned
       applications where it is said by the SSHD that false  representations
       have been made  by  an  applicant.  For  example  in  Harinder  Singh
       (paragraph 320(7A)-IS151A forms - proof) [2012] UKUT 00162 (IAC)  the
       Tribunal held that it was for the respondent to displace  the  burden
       upon her to establish that the  appellant  had  dishonestly  answered
       'no' when asked if he had ever been deported,  removed  or  otherwise
       required to leave any country including the UK in the last ten years.
        In Ahmed (supra) the applicant was said  to  have  wrongly  answered
       'no' to a question in his application form asking whether he had  any
       criminal  convictions.   This  was   considered   under   the   false
       representation  and  material  non-disclosure  limbs.   The  Tribunal
       observed in accordance with FW  (Paragraph  322;  untruthful  answer)
       Kenya [2010] 165 (IAC) that there was no essential difference between
       the two in circumstances such as these.

   16. AA (Nigeria) is also a 'false representation'  case.   The  appellant
       was said to have falsely answered 'no' to the question of whether  he
       had any criminal convictions. It is therefore understandable that the
       focus  of  the  judgment  is  upon  the  correct  approach  to  false
       representations and not the  use  of  false  documents.   However  in
       concluding that 'false' requires  'dishonesty'  Rix  LJ  specifically
       considered the position regarding false documents at [67] (underlined
       emphasis added):
           "First, "false representation"  is  aligned  in  the  rule  with
           "false document". It is plain that a false document is one  that
           tells a lie about itself. Of course it is possible for a  person
           to make use of a false  document  (for  instance  a  counterfeit
           currency note, but that example, used for its clarity, is rather
           distant from the context of this discussion) in total  ignorance
           of its falsity and in perfect honesty. But the  document  itself
           is dishonest. It  is  highly  likely  therefore  that  where  an
           applicant uses in all innocence a false document for the purpose
           of obtaining entry clearance, or leave to enter or to remain, it
           is because some other party, it might be a parent,  or  sponsor,
           or agent, has dishonestly promoted the use of that document. The
           response of a  requirement  of  mandatory  refusal  is  entirely
           understandable in  such  a  situation.  The  mere  fact  that  a
           dishonest  document  has  been  used  for  such   an   important
           application  is  understandably  a  sufficient  reason   for   a
           mandatory refusal. That is why  the  rule  expressly  emphasises
           that it applies "whether or not to the applicant's knowledge."

   17. Rix LJ contrasted this with a false representation as follows [68]:
           "Secondly,  however,  a  false  representation  stated  in   all
           innocence may be simply a matter of mistake, or an  error  short
           of dishonesty. It does not necessarily tell a lie about  itself.
           In such a case there is  little  reason  for  a  requirement  of
           mandatory refusal, although a  power,  even  a  presumption,  of
           discretionary refusal would be understandable. It is  noticeable
           that paragraphs 320 and 322 also contain grounds on which  entry
           clearance, leave to enter, or leave to remain, as the  case  may
           be, "should normally  be  refused".  If  on  the  other  hand  a
           dishonest representation has been promoted by another party,  as
           happened with the sponsor husband in Akhtar, then it is entirely
           understandable that the rule should require  mandatory  refusal,
           irrespective of the personal innocence of the applicant herself.
           Therefore, the reason of the  thing,  as  well  as  the  natural
           inference that "false" in relation to  "representations"  should
           have the same connotation as "false" in relation to "documents",
           together argue for a conclusion that "false" requires dishonesty
           - although not necessarily that of the applicant himself."

   18. It is clear from the Rix LJ's obiter remarks in AA Nigeria  that  the
       mere fact that a dishonest document has been used in  an  application
       is sufficient for there to be mandatory refusal under 322(1A).   This
       is consistent with the ratio in  AA  Nigeria  that  'false'  requires
       dishonesty.  As Rix LJ made  clear,  the  false  document  itself  is
       dishonest.  A false document is  therefore  different  from  a  false
       representation.  A false representation may simply be a  mistake  and
       does not tell a lie about itself in the way  that  a  false  document
       does.  It follows in accordance with this analysis  that  it  is  not
       necessary to go further and  determine  whether  or  not  a  document
       accepted  to  be  dishonest  in  itself,  was  used  dishonestly   or
       innocently.

   19. This analysis is consistent with the approach in JK  (India)  v  SSHD
       [2013] EWCA Civ 1080.  In that case the SSHD refused the  application
       to vary leave to remain on the basis that the applicant had submitted
       a false bank statement.  The applicant argued before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal that an agent had been involved in  the  submission  of  the
       application on her behalf and she was unaware  that  he  had  used  a
       false document.  By the time the matter reached the Court  of  Appeal
       the applicant's representative no longer relied upon  this  argument.
       Tomlinson LJ recorded the applicant's position as follows [7]:
           "It is now accepted by Mr Slatter on the appellant's behalf that
           the question of the appellant's personal  dishonesty  is  of  no
           relevance to the  determination  of  the  question  whether  the
           appeal can succeed in reliance upon the  Immigration  Rules.  He
           concedes that in the light of the decision  of  this  court,  to
           which I have referred, in Adedoyin, and given the plain  meaning
           of rule 322(1)(a), the application to vary the leave  to  remain
           fell to be refused."

   20. Tomlinson LJ approached the appellant's remaining submissions on  the
       basis that the appellant had not been complicit in the submission  of
       the false document and said this [14]:
           "It seems to me, even assuming in the  appellant's  favour  that
           she was entirely innocent, as she suggests, that the  case  that
           is put forward on her behalf under Article 8 is simply very  far
           short of that which would be required in the  present  situation
           to outweigh the policy considerations which plainly underlie the
           adoption  by  Parliament  of  rule  322(1)(a).  That   rule   is
           deliberately couched in terms intended to prevent the making  of
           dishonest applications and involves the result that applications
           are to be refused even though the dishonesty employed may not be
           that of the applicant himself or herself."

   21. The approach to false documents adopted by Rix LJ in AA (Nigeria) and
       Tomlinson LJ  in  JK  (India)  is  consistent  with  the  Immigration
       Directorate Instructions ('IDI') of July 2009 for paragraph  322  (as
       set out in AA Nigeria at [32]):
           "4. Paragraph 322(1A) - Deception used in a current application
           ...
           4.6 An application should be refused even  where  the  applicant
           does not know (or claims not to know) it is a false document."

   22. In AA Algeria Rix LJ was prepared to consider what the executive said
       publicly about the Rules in light of the  genuine  ambiguity  in  the
       word 'false' [70].  It is pertinent to note that in his exchange with
       the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, Lord Bassam, who spoke
       in the debate for the Government and gave certain assurances  defined
       a false document in this way "We mean a document that  is  forged  or
       has been altered to give false information.  If  people  submit  such
       documents, our belief is that they should be refused. It will be  for
       the BIA to prove that a document is false, and the standard of  proof
       has to be very high".

   23. Mr Lane submitted  that  the  remarks  of  Rix  LJ  concerning  false
       documents in AA (Nigeria) should not be read in  isolation  and  that
       Ahmed (supra) supports the  proposition  that  what  is  required  is
       dishonesty on the part of the applicant, or by someone acting on  his
       behalf, in the course of the making of the application.   In  support
       of this submission Mr Lane has pointed to  the  implicit  requirement
       derived from [67] of AA (Nigeria) that "some other party, it might be
       a parent, or sponsor, or agent, has dishonestly promoted the use"  of
       the false document.  Mr Lane submitted that the short question should
       be whether or not there was dishonesty in the application i.e. if the
       document was not dishonestly promoted in  the  application  then  the
       requisite requirement of dishonesty would be missing.  Mr  Lane  also
       sought to derive support for this from the reasons provided by  Moses
       LJ when granting permission.

   24. It is clear that Moses LJ regarded it as arguable that it needs to be
       demonstrated  that  a  person  deploying  a  false  document  in   an
       application, knew that it was false, and  derived  support  for  this
       from Ahmed.  However, it is important to  note  that  Moses  LJ  also
       considered the application of the ratio in AA (Nigeria) to documents,
       merited further consideration and clarification.  It does not  appear
       that Moses LJ was provided with a copy of JK (India).

   25. I now turn to Ahmed.  Ahmed was of course a  material  non-disclosure
       case.  The Tribunal focused upon  the  proper  approach  to  a  false
       representation and material non-disclosure, having  found  that  they
       are opposite sides of the same coin, requiring a consideration of the
       applicant's state of mind.  After this, the UT went on to observe  at
       [15]:
           "All aspects of paragraph  322(1A)  and  its  sister  paragraphs
           320(7A), 321(i) and 321A(2) are  treated  as  'Deception'  under
           paragraph 6 of HC 395, which strongly implies that mens  rea  is
           required on the part of the applicant.  If that were not so,  it
           would lead to the extraordinary situation that a person who  had
           made a perfectly honest mistake in filling out  his  application
           form for further leave to remain would be subject to a  re-entry
           ban under paragraph 320(7B)(d)  for  "using  Deception"  in  his
           previous application.  The consequence is  positively  draconian
           under  paragraph  320(7B)(d)(ii)  if  an  applicant  for   entry
           clearance "used Deception" in a previous application  for  entry
           clearance.  The re-entry ban would be for ten years.   That  can
           hardly be the  intended  consequence  of  a  wholly  inadvertent
           failure  to  answer  correctly  one  of  the  questions  in   an
           application form.  To include such a failure under the rubric of
           'Deception' would divorce that word, used as a term of art, from
           its ordinary  meaning,  which  is  not  the  way  in  which  the
           Immigration Rules are normally construed."

   26. In my judgment it cannot be said that mens rea is always required  on
       the part of the applicant in order for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
       invoke 320(7A) or its sister paragraphs.

   27. First, the very wording of the relevant Rules are  inconsistent  with
       such a construction.  A representation and / or  a  document  may  be
       false, "whether or not to the  applicant's  knowledge".   As  Rix  LJ
       observed in AA (Nigeria) at [68] where a dishonest representation  is
       promoted by another party, then the rule requires  mandatory  refusal
       "irrespective of the personal innocence of  the  applicant  herself".
       Rix LJ went on to say ""false" requires  dishonesty  -  although  not
       necessarily that of the applicant himself".  At  [76],  Rix  LJ  also
       stated  that:  "Dishonesty  or  deception  is  needed,   albeit   not
       necessarily that  of  the  applicant  himself,  to  render  a  'false
       representation' a ground for mandatory refusal."

   28. Second, the blanket requirement of  mens  rea  on  the  part  of  the
       applicant fails to  make  the  necessary  distinction  between  false
       documents and false statements for the reasons identified by  Rix  LJ
       in AA Nigeria at [67 and 68] as set out paragraphs 16 to 18 above.  I
       accept that Rix LJ's remarks regarding documents are obiter  but  his
       reasoning is persuasive and has been accepted by Tomlinson LJ  in  JK
       (India), albeit that appeal did not turn on the issue.

   29. Third, the fact that the theme of deception runs through the relevant
       IDI and entry clearance guidance (see Ahmed at [10 and 11]), does  no
       more than serve to identify the importance of dishonesty.  Indeed the
       IDI states that "an application should  be  refused  even  where  the
       applicant does not know (or  claims  not  to  know)  it  is  a  false
       document".   As  Rix  LJ  explained,  the  necessary  ingredient   of
       dishonesty lies in the false document itself.

   30. I acknowledge that the consequence of this approach may be draconian.
        However the use of false documents is a serious matter even  if  the
       falsity is unknown to the applicant.  The use of false documents  can
       be  distinguished  from  making  perfectly  honest   but   inaccurate
       statements.

Approach to Mr Wellalage's case

   31. In my judgment Judge Pooler did not err in law in concluding that the
       appellant's acceptance that the degree certificate that he  submitted
       with his application was false  and  there  had  been  dishonesty  by
       another, was a sufficient  basis  for  paragraph  322(1A)  to  apply.
       Judge Pooler was correct to find that it was not necessary for  there
       to be evidence of dishonesty on the part of the appellant  or  anyone
       acting on his behalf during the course of his application.

   32. When refusing the application under the Immigration  Rules  the  SSHD
       was therefore entitled to be satisfied that the  appellant  had  used
       deception in his application.  This must be considered in the context
       of deception as set out in the Immigration Rules and the IDI, and  as
       explained in AA Nigeria.  As discussed above this includes submitting
       a false or dishonest document, whether  or  not  to  the  applicant's
       knowledge.  In this case the appellant submitted a false document  in
       relation to which  it  is  accepted  there  had  been  dishonesty  by
       another.

   33. It follows that contrary to Mr Lane's  submissions,  there  has  been
       dishonesty in this application - a dishonest document was  submitted,
       whether or not to this appellant's knowledge.  It  matters  not  that
       the party who promoted the document is not a parent,  sponsor,  agent
       or representative of the appellant's. What matters is whether or  not
       a false or dishonest document has been submitted.

   34. For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

Decision

   35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  a  material
       error of law and is not set aside.
