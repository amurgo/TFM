                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Fowell promulgated on the 20 April 2016,  following  a  hearing  at
        Newport on the 19 April 2016, in which the  appellants  appeal  was
        dismissed on all grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant is a national of national of Ghana born  in  1965.  A
        chronology is  set  out  at  paragraph  7  of  the  decision  under
        challenge. This shows that the  appellant  started  working  for  a
        woman referred to in the decision as  'L'  in  Ghana  in  September
        2012. L is a said to be a family member.
     3. In November 2012 the appellant travelled to  the  UK  where  L  had
        previously relocated for work purposes. The appellant's job was  to
        care for L's children. It is said L works in the Embassy  of  Ghana
        in the United Kingdom (First Secretary Finance) from  October  2012
        and therefore has diplomatic immunity.
     4. L took the appellant's passport.  The  appellant  was  subsequently
        discovered in the street by the police having been  told  by  L  to
        leave the house they occupied. The appellant has  stated  that  her
        fear was of 'being destroyed' by L and her  husband  on  return  to
        Ghana.
     5. The appellant claimed to have been trafficked and so  was  referred
        to the  National  Referral  Mechanism  (NRM)  who  found  that  the
        appellant was the victim of trafficking and had been  subjected  to
        domestic  servitude.  No  issue  is  raised  in  relation  to   the
        respondent's obligations in relation to a person found to be victim
        of trafficking in this case.
     6. The Judge found there to  be  a  number  of  inconstancies  in  the
        appellant's account. It was noted that the core of the claim was  a
        threat to kill made by L although it was said there is no reference
        to this in the asylum interview. At [26], when referring to a reply
        to question 118 of the asylum interview, the Judge finds:


         26. Her concern here appears to be about having her things returned
         to her, and about her employment chances in  Ghana.   And  although
         there were other questions about the basis of her fear, it did  not
         become any clearer, and  there  was  no  mention  of  any  specific
         threat.  Nor was there any mention of attempts  to  locate  her  in
         Ghana until her witness statement.

     7. The Judge did not accept that the claim was credible  as  reflected
        in the final paragraph of the assessment of  the  protection  claim
        which is in the following terms:


         27. Overall therefore I do not accept the  appellant's  account  of
         this threat by L, or of attempts to locate her in  Ghana,  even  to
         the lower standard of proof. I do not doubt that she was  exploited
         and mistreated, as has been accepted, but it is well  over  a  year
         since she left her situation  at  the  embassy,  and  no  civil  or
         criminal claim can be pursued against  L.   The  suggested  motive,
         that L would not want any word  of  all  this  becoming  known  and
         harming her career,  lacks  real  weight,  especially  when  it  is
         suggested that she would therefore seek to track her down and  kill
         the appellant to silence her,  or  would  seek  to  use  government
         forces to help her.  That would of course be an incomparably  worse
         crime than her exploitation of the appellant, and in my view simply
         unrealistic.  It is far more likely that if any such direct  threat
         was made to her, that L knows that she is beyond any  sanction  and
         that her career will not suffer as a  consequence.   Accordingly  I
         cannot  find  that  the  appellant  has  a  well-founded  fear   of
         persecution, or that she is at real risk of suffering serious harm,
         and so her claim for asylum and  humanitarian  protection  must  be
         dismissed.


     8. Permission to appeal was granted on a renewed  application  on  the
        basis it is said the grounds are arguable.











Error of law


     9. Ms Fenny submitted that the statement by the  Judge  at  [26]  that
        there was no mention of a  specific  threat  is  incorrect  as  the
        appellant made reference on a number of occasions in her  screening
        interview to threats made to her in Ghana, details of which are set
        out at paragraph 6 of the grounds seeking permission to  appeal  to
        the Upper Tribunal.
    10. When asked to identify the Convention reason Ms Fenny stated it was
        as a member of a Particular Social  Group,  a  person  who  is  the
        victim of trafficking.
    11. In SB (PSG - Protection Regulations -  Reg  6)  Moldova  CG  [2008]
        UKAIT 00002 the Tribunal held  that  (i)  if  individuals  share  a
        common background which is an immutable characteristic they  cannot
        change and which defines the group by giving it a distinct identity
        in the society in question which has nothing to do with the actions
        of the future persecutors, then the group exists  independently  of
        the feared future act(s) of persecution. It  is  not  necessary  to
        show general discrimination as an identifying characteristic of the
        group; (ii) "Former victims of trafficking" and "former victims  of
        trafficking for sexual exploitation" are capable of  being  members
        of a particular social group within regulation 6(1)(d)  because  of
        their shared common background or past experience  of  having  been
        trafficked; (iii) the word  "and"  in  regulation  6(1)(d)  of  the
        Protection Regulations should be given  its  natural  meaning;  and
        (iv) in the context of Moldovan  society,  a  woman  who  has  been
        trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a member of a
        particular social group within regulation 6(1)(d),  the  particular
        social group in question being "former victims of  trafficking  for
        sexual exploitation". Whether a particular individual is at risk of
        persecution for membership of that group needs to be decided on the
        facts of the case.
    12. It has not been shown this is a case in  which  the  appellant  has
        been  forcibly  trafficked  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  domestic
        servitude but rather one in which she appears to have travelled  to
        continue  her  employment  with  L,  after  which  the   conditions
        materialised which satisfied the required definitions. It is not  a
        case in which the appellant has established a real risk of being re-
        trafficked to the UK or in which it has been  shown  to  be  unduly
        harsh to expect the appellant, as a lone women, to relocate to  the
        capital city of her country of origin  or  any  other  large  urban
        centre if she  anticipates  problems  in  her  home  area.   It  is
        accepted that such relocation must be reasonable, in  other  words,
        that it must not have such consequences upon the appellant as to be
        unduly harsh for her, but  this  has  not  been  made  out  by  the
        appellant on the evidence.
    13. It is also the case that the appellant has not established  a  real
        risk of persecution for reasons of her membership of that group  or
        to show that all the  members  of  the  group  are  susceptible  to
        persecution.
    14. Paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules states that:


        "An asylum applicant will be granted asylum in the  United  Kingdom
        if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:


        (i) he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at a port  of  entry
        in the United Kingdom;
        (ii) he is a refugee, as defined in regulation 2 of The Refugee  or
        Person  in  Need  of   International   Protection   (Qualification)
        Regulations 2006;
        (iii) there are no reasonable grounds for regarding him as a danger
        to the security of the United Kingdom;
        (iv) he does not, having been convicted by a final  judgment  of  a
        particularly serious crime, he does not constitute  danger  to  the
        community of the United Kingdom; and
        (v) refusing his application would result in him being required  to
        go (whether immediately or after the time limited by  any  existing
        leave to enter or remain) in breach of the Geneva Convention, to  a
        country in which his life or freedom would threatened on account of
        his race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of
        a particular social group".


    15. The appellant is in the United Kingdom and is not a person who  has
        been deemed to be a danger  to  the  United  Kingdom  or  a  person
        convicted of a particularly serious crime. What has not  been  made
        out is that requiring the appellant to return to  Ghana  will  mean
        she faces a real risk of persecution on account of  her  membership
        of the particular social group. As such  no  arguable  legal  error
        material to the decision to dismiss the appeal on  refugee  grounds
        is made out. No other Convention reason is claimed or arguably made
        out.
    16. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules states:


        "A person will be granted humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
        Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:


        (i) he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at a port  of  entry
        in the United Kingdom;
        (ii) he does not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2 of
        The  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of   International   Protection
        (Qualification) Regulations 2006;
        (iii) substantial grounds have been shown for  believing  that  the
        person concerned, if returned to the country of return, would  face
        a real risk of suffering serious harm and is unable, or,  owing  to
        such risk, unwilling to avail himself of  the  protection  of  that
        country; and
        (iv) he is not excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection.


        Serious harm consists of:
        (i) the death penalty or execution;
        (ii) unlawful killing;
        (iii) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of  a
        person in the country of return; or
        (iv) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life  or  person
        by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international
        or internal armed conflict.


  17. The appellant is in the United Kingdom  and  does  not  qualify  as  a
      refugee.  The  issue  is,  therefore,  whether   the   appellant   has
      established that substantial grounds have  been  shown  for  believing
      that if returned to Ghana she will  face  a  real  risk  of  suffering
      serious harm and is unwilling  or  unable  to  avail  herself  of  the
      protection of that country.
  18. The fact the appellant claims to be unable to seek protection  in  the
      UK as a result of L having diplomatic immunity is  not  the  issue  as
      there is no evidence of an ongoing direct  threat  from  L  since  the
      appellant was found  by  the  police  some  time  ago.  The  issue  of
      diplomatic immunity will not arise in Ghana. It is  noted  the  police
      have been  unable  to  assist  in  the  appellant  in  collecting  her
      belongings  as  the  Embassy  premises  are  protected  by  diplomatic
      protection. It is noted that when contact has been made with  a  named
      person at the Embassy that person asked where the appellant,  although
      no details were given of either her address  or  the  reason  for  the
      enquiry.
  19. It is not suggested that threats were made against the  appellant  and
      the appellants own case is summed up in her witness statement  in  the
      following terms:


         5.   I had come to the UK on the promise of employment.   I  worked
             for L as I was supposed to do, but she did not pay me what  we
             had agreed.  My contract  said  I  would  receive  �1,500,  we
             agreed that she would pay me �600, in reality I only  received
             �150.  I asked her for the rest of the money that she owed me,
             she gave me a form to sign I don't know what  that  form  was.
             Later on that night a man, whose name I forget,  came  to  the
             house, he claimed he worked for the Home  Office  although  he
             was Ghanaian.  He told me that I must leave the  house,  if  I
             did not leave he would arrange for the  authorities  to  come,
             that they would say they did not know me and that I  would  be
             taken, as an illegal immigrant. When I asked about  the  money
             that I was owed, she owed me �10,350 by this time, she told me
             that she would never give me the money, and  if  she  did  she
             would make sure that I never spent it.  I took this  to  be  a
             threat, that she would kill me.


  20. The nature of the dispute is therefore a  domestic  dispute  regarding
      payment of monies due with a  subjective  fear  in  the  mind  of  the
      appellant based upon what she claims was said to her.
  21. The appellant has no prospect of recovering her funds in the UK  as  a
      result of the protection from criminal and civil actions  afforded  by
      L's diplomatic immunity. The appellant fails to identify  any  way  in
      which she can recover wages due to her  from  the  UK  in  Ghana.  The
      appellant has failed to establish that she faced  any  risk  from  the
      authorities in Ghana. It was accepted by Ms Fenny that  the  case  has
      not been advanced on the basis that  the  UK  immigration  authorities
      will apply to the Ghanaian Embassy for an ETD  such  that  L  will  be
      aware of her imminent return. It  has  not  been  made  out  that  L's
      influence in Ghana is such that  the  appellant  is  at  risk  at  the
      airport or on return.  It is accepted that if the appellant return  to
      her family area L, as a member of that family, may  become  aware  but
      this in isolation does not establish a real risk of  harm.  The  Judge
      identified that the issue from L's point of view may be  the  risk  of
      harm to her career. The Judges finding  that  tracking  the  appellant
      down and killing her would be an incomparably worse crime is a finding
      available to the Judge on the evidence.
  22. The subjective fear has not been shown to be objectively well founded.
      This is not a case involving a fundamental aspect  of  the  appellants
      identity, such  as  religion  or  sexual  identity  that  it  will  be
      unreasonable to expect her to be discrete about, as per HJ (Iran)  but
      a domestic debt. There is no reason why the appellant cannot return to
      Ghana and establish herself there, in which case there  is  no  reason
      for L to even be interested in what she is doing.
  23. The appellant claims she will receive no protection in her  home  area
      as a result of corruption within the police but as she has  failed  to
      establish any credible reason why she would be of  interest  to  L  in
      Ghana, unless  she  herself  created  the  environment  where  L  felt
      threatened and reacted, the protection issue does  not  arise.  It  is
      settled law that a person cannot succeed in a claim based upon risk of
      harm to them if that person themselves is responsible  for  inflicting
      or causing harm.  It was not made out that the appellant will  not  be
      able to access a sufficiency of protection if required.  Although  the
      Ghanaian  Police  Service  have  in  the  past  come  under  criticism
      following  incidents  of  brutality,   corruption,   and   negligence,
      complaints of police abuse and misconduct lodged  by  the  public  are
      investigated  through  the  Police   Intelligence   and   Professional
      Standards Unit (PIPS). The Ghana Police website gives details  of  the
      Investigation Service. PIPS is  set  up  to  receive  and  investigate
      complaints from the public.  Individuals  with  allegations  of  human
      rights violations, or grievances against government agencies or public
      officials can also seek redress through the Commission on Human Rights
      and Justice (CHRAJ). It has not been made out that  the  appellant  is
      unable to approach the authorities or that if she did, protection will
      not be available to the Horvath standard.
  24. The appellant failed to establish substantial  grounds  for  believing
      that if returned to the Ghana she will face a real risk  of  suffering
      serious harm. The rejection of the claim to be entitled to a grant  of
      humanitarian protection has not been shown to be infected by  arguable
      legal error. The high threshold of Article 3 ECHR has not  been  shown
      to be breached.
  25. No arguable legal error material to the decision to dismiss the appeal
      has been made out.


Decision

    26. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


        I make that order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
