 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

                    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


mr justice collins:


1.   There are before  me  two  distinct  applications.   The  first  is  an
    application for judicial review of the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State which was made originally  in  August  2015  and  the  second  is
    against the subsequent decision of the Secretary  of  State  which  was
    made in November of 2015.  The reason why there  are  two  applications
    will  become  apparent  in  due  course.   I  should  simply  add  that
    permission was granted  in  relation  to  the  bringing  of  the  first
    application, but there were directions that there should be a rolled-up
    hearing in relation to the second.  There is incidentally in  addition,
    although it is not a matter obviously before me directly, an appeal out
    of time to the Tribunal which relies on a human rights claim which  was
    made additionally.  The application that was originally made was  based
    upon the first applicant's claim to remain in this country as a Tier  1
    Investor Migrant.  The second and third applicants are her husband  and
    son  and  were  joined  as  her  dependants.   The  background  can  be
    summarised fairly shortly.


2.   The first applicant herself is a national of China who  is  now  nearly
    62 years old.  Her husband and their son are both Chinese nationals and
    were dependants in relation  to  her  applications.   She  also  has  a
    daughter here who is a British national.  The  applicants  entered  the
    United Kingdom in May 2012 with an  entry  clearance  which  was  valid
    until 18 August 2015.  She made in July  of  2015  the  application  to
    extend their visas here. At that stage,  unfortunately,  they  did  not
    have any legal advice or assistance.  I  say  unfortunately  as  things
    have turned out.


3.   The requirement in order to qualify under the heading that they  sought
    leave, namely a Tier 1 Investor, was that, so far as material  for  the
    purposes of this case, that  she  invested  �750,000,  that  is  three-
    quarters of the �1,000,000 that was required, in Government  bonds  and
    the balance of �250,000 was to be in  assets  whose  value  was  to  be
    identified by the necessary documentation.   What  in  fact  the  first
    applicant wanted to know was whether the assets in  question  could  be
    property, namely houses, and her daughter in 2012 enquired  whether  it
    would be possible to acquire properties in order to meet the  necessary
    balance of  �250,000.   She  consulted  the  Home  Office  through  its
    guideline and she received the information as she deposes that it would
    indeed  be  appropriate.    That   certainly   was,   she   says,   her
    understanding.  In her statutory declaration she says:-


         "Sometime towards the end of June  or  beginning  of  July  2012  I
         contacted the Home Office general enquiries line on  behalf  of  my
         mother.  I spoke to a man but unfortunately I didn't take his name.
          I asked him specifically whether we could rely on the purchase  of
         two properties to make up the balance of funds for the purposes  of
         meeting the conditions of leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  Investor
         Migrant.  I made it clear that 75% of funds had  been  invested  in
         Government bonds and that I had cash in the bank  and  that  I  was
         seeking to purchase two properties" (pausing there, by "I", I think
         she must mean her mother).


         "The person with whom I spoke answered without hesitation  that  we
         could rely on both properties.  He informed me that the  properties
         would be considered as assets and that we could we definitely  rely
         on both properties to make up for the shortfall."


4.   It was back in 2012 that the  first  applicant  had  decided  that  she
    would indeed want to remain in this country, partly  no  doubt  because
    her daughter was here as a British citizen, and partly  it  seems  that
    her son had also wanted to make  his  way  here.   I  gather  he  is  a
    talented footballer and that is what he wants to go into.


5.   Having received that information she bought two properties: one  was  a
    home which was bought for �170,000 in Nottingham, and subsequently that
    was bought in August 2012, and later in September she bought  a  second
    property in Nottingham for �90,500 and that I gather is now let out  to
    tenants.  Their values as at May of 2015  were  �180,000  and  �115,000
    respectively, so they made up clearly, on  any  view,  whether  on  the
    original price or now the necessary �250,000.


6.   The first applicant makes clear that if she had appreciated that  there
    was any difficulty about relying on both properties she had  the  money
    available and would have put  it  somewhere  else,  for  example  in  a
    deposit account in a bank, or would  have  acquired  some  other  asset
    which would have been a qualifying asset within the provisions relating
    to her application.


7.   The application made was rejected by the Secretary  of  State  and  the
    rejection related to the decision that the second property, that is the
    one in which they did not live, was not a property which could  qualify
    in terms of the relevant Rule.  The  decision  in  question  was  on  4
    August 2015 and what was said was, and I quote:-


         "The value of your two houses makes up the shortfall  of  �250,000,
         however you can only claim points for the value of the  house  that
         you reside in"


     and that was the higher value of the two.


         "As the value of your investments over  the  next  2  years  and  9
         months requires a  minimum  of  �199,000  throughout,  insufficient
         evidence has therefore been provided to demonstrate  that  you  can
         make up this balance of funds, as specified under Appendix A of the
         Immigration Rules"


     and therefore the necessary points claimed were not provided.


8.   There was a right of administrative review, but  no  right  of  appeal.
    The refusal letter was somewhat ambiguous, or rather opaque, in that it
    said that the  application  had  a  missing  specified  document,  full
    details of which appeared earlier in the letter (at  a  glance  it  did
    not) and it was said that effectively the  new  document  was  not  one
    which could properly be sought by the Secretary of  State  in  reaching
    the decision.


9.   There was an application for administrative  review  and  that  led  to
    confirmation of the decision, but in the course of the application this
    was said, and again I quote:-


         "The applicant contacted the Home Office in 2012  enquiring  as  to
         whether she could rely on the investment of two properties to  make
         up for the balance of the funds  required  in  a  future  extension
         application.  She was  advised  in  the  affirmative.   Instructing
         solicitors also called the Home Office on 13 August 2015 (they give
         a telephone number) and spoke  to  someone  named  Christine  at  3
         o'clock in the afternoon who confirmed that an applicant could rely
         on the unmortgaged portion  of  both  properties  to  make  up  the
         shortfall in the balance of funds"


    and so that appeared to confirm the information  that  had  erroneously
    been given to the first applicant's daughter.


10.  The  administrative  review  was  decided  on  11  September  and  that
    information was completely ignored in reaching that decision.  In fact,
    all that was done was to rely on the same grounds as had been relied on
    before, so this is not a good start to good administration on the  part
    of the Home Office.  That  led  to  a  need  for  judicial  review  and
    solicitors on 21 September sent a pre-action protocol letter  in  which
    they relied specifically on the false information that  they  said  had
    been given and also sought to argue that the wording that it had to  be
    an "own home" was ambiguous.  What actually the Rules provide is  that,
    so far as property is concerned, and I quote:-


     "When using property only the unmortgaged portion  of  the  applicant's
         own home can be considered and the valuation must be provided on  a
         report issued by a surveyor who is a member of the Royal  Institute
         of Chartered Surveyors in the six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
         application".


     I do not need to concern myself with that.  It is the "own  home"  that
    matters and the submission made was that "own  home"  was  unclear  and
    could cover property owned, even though it was one not lived in.


11.  There was a response to the pre-action protocol letter  on  19  October
    2015 that set out the history.  It stated that it was  considered  that
    an applicant's "own home" must mean their primary  place  of  residence
    and that therefore only one of the properties could properly  be  taken
    into account, and then there was a transfer  of  �30,000  to  a  United
    Kingdom bank account, but that would have  been  insufficient,  it  was
    said, and in any event it failed to meet  the  necessary  three  months
    prior to decision  requirement  for  the  provision  of  the  necessary
    assets.  But Section 55 in relation to the first  applicant's  son  was
    taken into account and so,  it  is  said,  it  is  clear  that  it  was
    recognised (and properly recognised) that it was necessary to  consider
    that, but what was said is it had  been  concluded  that  the  need  to
    maintain the integrity of the immigration laws outweighed the  possible
    affect on the first applicant and her  child  that  might  result  from
    having to re-establish family life outside the United Kingdom.  Whether
    that is a proper conclusion in the light of the material  provided  is,
    to say the least, highly doubtful, however, as I say, it makes it clear
    that that was clearly taken into account.


12.  The first applicant decided on advice that it was sensible  to  make  a
    fresh application in the sense that the necessary amount of  money  was
    transferred and so would have been properly available.  This led  to  a
    fresh refusal of the claim on 26 November 2015, the application  having
    been made on 5 October 2015.


13.  In this case, so far as the balance is  concerned,  reliance  continued
    to be placed upon the second property, and thus  it  was  again  stated
    that she did not meet the necessary requirements and  for  some  reason
    best known to the author of the letter, whereas she  had  been  granted
    the relevant points in relation to the investment of �750,000 and  that
    it had been made within three months of the grant, that was said not to
    have been met.  Quite how  the  decision  that  the  �750,000  had  not
    properly been invested was decided is frankly impossible to understand.
     Be that as it may, it again was said that effectively nothing more was
    put to persuade the Secretary of State  that  the  decision  should  be
    changed.  Again, it seems that the transfer of the additional funds was
    entirely ignored in this fresh decision letter.  Furthermore, the  only
    reference to the alleged false information that had been given  to  the
    first applicant's daughter and to the solicitor was in these words:-


     "We have  considered  discretion  on  this  application  following  the
         factors outlined in the letter  provided  by  your  representative.
         That has not been applied as no evidence has been supplied that the
         Home Office has provided incorrect advice".


    How that could conceivably be a proper statement in the  light  of  the
    statutory declaration from the first applicant's daughter and that from
    the representative of the  solicitors,  together  with  the  attendance
    note, is frankly beyond me.  It really is extraordinary  that  we  find
    that sort of decision making on behalf of the Secretary of State  which
    is totally irrational in all the circumstances.  It is difficult to see
    how that could conceivably be justified.


14.  In any event, an administrative review of that  was  sought  and  again
    what was stated was again reliance on the  misinformation,  failure  to
    consider private and family life in the United Kingdom and  failure  to
    take proper account of the supporting  documents.   The  administrative
    review upheld the former decision, again, the misinformation relied  on
    was totally ignored, but Article 8 was relied on and was  rejected,  as
    again was Section 55 on the same basis, and that led to the decision to
    issue the second judicial review proceedings, which as I say have  been
    made the subject of the rolled-up hearing.  In fact, before that  there
    was a pre-action protocol letter, the response to which took the matter
    no further.  It simply did not raise any further  issues,  hence  as  I
    say, the fresh application.  I suppose it would have been  possible  to
    have sought to amend the existing provisions in order to deal with  the
    new refusal, but the decision taken was to issue  the  second  judicial
    review.  One way or another, clearly the fresh decision had to be taken
    into account and had to be dealt with.


15.  Now, in August of last year the  Secretary  of  State  issued  a  fresh
    letter which was said to be  supplemental  to  and  ought  to  be  read
    alongside the decision of 26 November 2015.  It  dealt  with  the  "own
    home" point and then it said, and I quote:-


     "You have claimed that you have contacted the Home Office between  June
         and early July 2012 enquiring as to whether you  can  rely  on  the
         investments of two properties to make up for  the  balance  of  the
         funds required in a future extension application.  It is noted that
         you did not take down details of the advisor and failed to  provide
         sufficient evidence of this advice"


     It referred to the Immigration Rules and the  investment  policy  which
    clearly stated,  it  was  said,  that  when  using  property  only  the
    unmortgaged portion of the applicant's own home  could  be  considered.
    It referred incidentally to the wrong policy, but I think there was  no
    material difference.  I say wrong policy because it refers to a  policy
    valid in 2012, whereas obviously the policy valid in  August  2015  and
    then in the autumn was the correct one, but as I say  I  do  not  think
    there is any difference, essentially, between the two  on  this  point.
    It goes on:-


         "You further assert that your representatives  contacted  the  Home
         Office on 13  August  2015  after  a  decision  was  made  on  your
         application dated 13 July 2015 and spoke  to  an  individual  named
         Christine who confirmed  that  the  unmortgaged  portions  of  both
         properties could be used to make up the balance of the funds.   You
         have also mentioned this advice in your admin  review  application.
         As mentioned above our policy clarified what it is  meant  by  'own
         home' and this was further explained in our response to  your  pre-
         action protocol letter on 19 October  2015.   In  any  event,  such
         advice could not give rise to a legitimate expectation at the  time
         of application that leave to remain would be granted".


    There was reference to the case of SH (Iran) [2014] EWCA Civ 1469 where
    it states:-


         "There is in the ordinary case no relevant legitimate  expectation,
         other than that the case will be considered on applicable  law  and
         policy at the time the decision is made."


16.  It is also worth noting that Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan  at  the  oral
    permission hearing indicates that the Secretary of State is unlikely to
    go against policy when he states:-


         "Notwithstanding the fact that the  respondent's  officials  cannot
         rewrite the law, give legal advice and are likely to attempt to  do
         so.  It is asserted that the onus was  on  you  to  check  the  new
         guidance before submitting your second application"


    The letter deals with Section 55 and then go on to deal with discretion
    and it is said that there were no reasons why the  Secretary  of  State
    should have considered exercising discretion.  It goes on:-


         "As mentioned above the Secretary of State does not accept that you
         were given wrong advice.  Furthermore, that cannot amount to a good
         reason  to  exercise  discretion.   The  Secretary  of  State   has
         considered the statements provided but is not  satisfied  that  the
         advice alleged was given.  In any event,  your  failure  to  obtain
         legal advice means that your circumstances do not  conduce  to  the
         exercise of discretion."


17.  I have seen some bad decisions in my time.   There  is  no  doubt  that
    this  was  an  entirely  genuine  application  inasmuch  as  the  first
    applicant has the necessary funds available and was  intending  to  and
    was meaning to obtain assets in this country which met the  Rules.   If
    she had known that a second property was not such as would  comply  she
    could and would have invested the money in some other way  which  would
    have complied.  So much is clear from  her  conduct,  both  before  and
    since the refusal was made.   There  is  no  reason  whatever  for  the
    Secretary of State rationally to doubt the evidence given by  both  her
    daughter and the solicitor as  to  the  advice  given.   There  are  no
    details as to what was said but it might be that it  was  assumed  that
    there could not be two "own homes".  It is difficult to comprehend that
    as a reasonable possibility.  The trouble is that  the  Rules  and  the
    requirements of these point based applications are exceedingly  complex
    and they are varied from time to time and regrettably it is exceedingly
    difficult, even for professionals, let alone  for  those  who  have  no
    professional advice, to follow precisely what is or is not required.


18.  It is apparent beyond any question the contrary is,  in  my  judgement,
    entirely  unarguable.  The  advice  given  persuaded  both  the   first
    applicant's daughter and the solicitor, who after  all  knew  what  the
    Rules provided, that the view taken by those giving advice on behalf of
    the Home Office was that the two properties would be sufficient.  There
    have been considerable arguments as to whether that amounts to a  clear
    and unambiguous statement that gives rise to a legitimate  expectation.
    Obviously it cannot change the Rule as the Supreme Court  has  recently
    made entirely clear. There is no possibility of changing what the Rules
    require, but there is a residual discretion, and it seems  to  me  that
    where there has been a  clear  misunderstanding  based  on  information
    given by the Secretary of State, there can be  no  better  reason  than
    that for exercising a favourable discretion.


19.  Of course, if there were any reason to doubt  the  genuineness  of  the
    application and the ability to find the necessary funding,  that  would
    be a different matter, but that does not arise in the circumstances  of
    this case.  I have no doubt whatever that the  decisions  made  by  the
    Secretary of State were entirely  unreasonable  and  indeed  the  first
    applicant passes the Wednesbury test in seeking  to  have  them  struck
    down because the misinformation resulted  in  unfairness.   It  is  not
    necessary to go on to consider whether  it  amounted  to  a  legitimate
    expectation, which itself of course is based on  fairness,  but  it  is
    apparent, in my judgement, and indeed I do not think there could  be  a
    clearer case than this that in the result these  applicants  have  been
    dealt with in an entirely inappropriate fashion.   If  ever  there  was
    maladministration, this case shows it.


20.  I am glad to say that, having regard to indications that  I  gave  this
    morning, further instructions have been obtained from the  Home  Office
    and it is recognised that it is necessary to make a fresh decision.  It
    is apparent from what I have said that it will,  in  my  judgement,  be
    entirely surprising if the decision was not one which was favourable to
    the applicants.  Mr Khubber has made the  point  that  they  have  been
    further disadvantaged because if the application had been allowed  back
    in 2015 there should have been a grant of then,  I  think,  two  years'
    leave to remain.  The result would now be  that  they  are  approaching
    five years and would be entitled  to  apply  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, but the result of the  decisions  and  the  draconian  language
    contained is to say that they  have  been  rendered  overstayers  as  a
    result of the refusals and unfortunately, where there is  no  right  of
    appeal, Section 3C cannot apply.  It seems to me that the law ought  to
    be that where a judicial review claim is made, that provides  the  same
    protection as 3C does in relation to an appeal, but that is not the law
    and that is a matter for primary legislation,  but  I  would  certainly
    take the view that the Home Office ought seriously to consider  whether
    Parliamentary changes are needed, since so many rights of  appeal  have
    been abolished and the only possible remedy is  judicial  review  in  a
    number of circumstances.  The one thing though that is  entirely  clear
    to me is that it would be manifestly wrong, unfair  and  irrational  to
    treat the applicants as overstayers and to use that in any way to their
    detriment in relation to any future claim that they make.


21.  Accordingly, and for the reasons that I  have  given,  I  am  satisfied
    that the decisions should be quashed.  Since  the  latest  decision  is
    that which is covered by the second judicial review, it seems that  the
    sensible course would be for me to quash  that  decision,  which  means
    that I grant permission, waive any further steps that need to be taken,
    although I have I think to get an  undertaking  to  pay  the  costs  of
    pursuing a claim for which  permission  has  been  granted.  The  first
    decision, the subject of the first application for judicial review  has
    been overtaken by the second, but clearly the first  claim  would  have
    succeeded as well.


22.  So far as the  appeal  under  human  rights  is  concerned,  that  will
    obviously now not be needed in the light of fresh  consideration  being
    given, although it might be sensible  to  make  clear  that  the  human
    rights claim  is  included  in  the  application  that  is  now  to  be
    reconsidered.  It has been, on the way it has been dealt  with  by  the
    Secretary of State, but as I say, in case there is some claim hereafter
    by the Secretary of State that there is  no  right  of  appeal  because
    there has not been a formal claim based on human rights, that should be
    put to rest for once and for all.


23.  In the circumstances, as I say, I would impress upon the  Secretary  of
    State the need to act fairly. After all,  the  boasts  when  the  Prime
    Minister was Home Secretary was that the system was supposed to be fair
    and this decision making  is,  on  any  view,  what  was  in  my  view,
    manifestly unfair.





Mr Khubber:   Just a couple of minor matters.  In relation to  the  judgment
                       I think, and you can reflect back  upon  it,  is  the
                       applicant's daughter actually over 18.  I  think  she
                       was born in 1979.


Mr Justice Collins:    I thought she was a minor at one stage.


Mr Khubber:   It's the son who is the minor.


Mr Justice Collins:    I will make that clear.  I'm sorry, that's my fault.


Mr Khubber:   And when you mentioned in the judgment the  reference  in  the
                       claim, I think it was to the son, and in terms of the
                       best interests issue because he is the minor.


Mr Justice Collins:    No, it's my fault.  For some  reason  I  had  got  it
                       into my head that it was the daughter and not the son
                       who was the minor.


Mr Khubber:   My Lord, in relation to costs I would simply say in the  light
                       of  the  judgment,   both   claims   were   justified
                       ultimately and we have succeeded in  terms  of  costs
                       following the event and I would ask -


Mr Justice Collins:    Well, you would have  been  entitled  -  I  mean  you
                       could either have amended or issued a fresh claim.


Mr Khubber:   Yes.


Mr Justice Collins:    Well, Miss Rowlands, I don't think anything  of  your
                       argument that they didn't need the first one  -  they
                       did, because there wasn't any right  of  appeal,  but
                       then they decided to make a fresh claim.


Miss Rowlands:    From the moment they made a fresh application -


Mr Justice Collins:    Then you say they should have abandoned the  first  -
                       it didn't make any difference did it, really?


Miss Rowlands:    Well, it has in previously  customised  information  we've
                       had to  have  a  separate  ........  in  relation  to
                       permission on both of them and there was a hearing on
                       -


Mr Justice  Collins:     Yes,  originally  permission  was  refused  on  the
                       papers.  Quite how a judge decided that I don't know,
                       but he did.


Miss Rowlands:    My Lord, I  would  make  a  submission  that  there  be  a
                       reduction in the amount of costs payable  to  reflect
                       the fact  that  the  claim  has  not  been  conducted
                       proportionally.


Mr Justice Collins:    Well, no I don't think  so.   They  were  put  in  an
                       impossible   position   by   your   thoroughly    bad
                       administration  and  I   don't   think   really   any
                       significant extra costs have been occasioned.   After
                       all, once they got permission on the first, then  the
                       second really would have followed suit, and as I say,
                       it could have been an amendment which would have  led
                       to the same thing and the same requirement to provide
                       the necessary material, so I think  there  is  really
                       nothing in the way that it was  done.   No,  you  are
                       entitled to all your costs  in  my  view.   Have  you
                       served -


Mr Khubber:   Sir, I don't think we've got a schedule of  costs  ready  yet,
                       no, but -


Mr Justice Collins:     Well,  in  that  case  you  will  have  to  serve  a
                       schedule.


Mr Khubber:   The previous order is in view of the costs -


Mr Justice Collins:    Well, subject to a detailed assessment if not  agreed
                       - that's the usual.


Mr Khubber:   Yes, that's the easiest way of dealing.


Mr Justice Collins:    That's what I must do.


Miss Rowlands:    The only issue there is that if a schedule  of  costs  had
                       been served we could have done  assessment  today  in
                       saving costs of -


Mr  Justice  Collins:     Well,  that's  a  matter  you  can  raise  on  the
                       assessment so that if an assessment is  needed.  Yes,
                       as I say, you will have to deal with the appeal.  You
                       need obviously to tell the First-tier  that  you  are
                       not going to  continue  with  it  and  you  won't  be
                       entitled to any costs in relation to that,  but  they
                       haven't incurred any.


Mr Khubber:   No, exactly - I mean that is the whole point of resolving -


Mr Justice Collins:    No, but what I am saying is that regrettably money  -
                       so you won't be able to recover any.  Alright.
