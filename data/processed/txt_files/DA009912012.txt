For the Appellant:     Miss Emma Rutherford, instructed by Thaliwal Bridge
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Neville Smart of the Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 11th October 2005 Mrs Fawad  landed  at  Manchester  Airport  on  an
    Emirates flight, having been issued with a Pakistani  passport  earlier
    that year in Peshawar, and having  subsequently  obtained  a  six-month
    visitor's visa.  She was accompanied by her  two  children,  Hamas  and
    Yoshua.  Different dates of birth have  been  given  for  the  boys  at
    different times: 24/4/01, 1/1/02 and 24/4/02  for  Hamas,  and  2/1/03,
    13/1/03 and 1/11/03 for Yoshua.  Mrs Fawad's  husband,  Muhammad  Saeed
    Khan, had come to England as a student the previous year, but Mrs Fawad
    had evidently not applied for entry clearance as  the  dependant  of  a
    student.  What she did do,  early  in  February  2006,  was  apply  for
    asylum, on the basis that she had arrived in the  United  Kingdom  with
    her two children clandestinely on 1st February 2006,  having  travelled
    from Afghanistan on various lorries, the journey having  been  arranged
    at the cost of $9,000 by a friend of her  husband's.   The  husband  of
    "Fawad Bibi" was said to be a commander  in  the  Hizb-e  Islami,  Said
    Ullah Jan, who had  been  arrested  by  government  soldiers,  but  had
    escaped.  The soldiers came back to the family home in Kunar  province,
    looking for the commander, and threatened to kill  Mrs  Fawad  and  her
    children if she did not tell them where her husband was hiding.  It was
    no longer safe to remain in Afghanistan, so  she  came  here,  with  an
    Afghan ID card to establish her identity.

2.    The asylum claim was refused in March 2006, but Mrs Fawad was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain for three years on the  strength  of  her
    story, and with it came access to welfare benefits.  Two more  children
    were born to Mrs Fawad, in March 2007 and October 2008.   There  is  no
    uncertainty about their dates of birth, since birth  certificates  were
    issued, with the name of the father  -  unsurprisingly  -  left  blank.
    There does not seem to be any doubt that the father was Muhammad  Saeed
    Khan.  It was certainly not Said Ullah Jan.

3.   In 2009 Mrs Fawad's deception came  to  light.   She  was  remanded  in
    custody in September 2009,  charged  with  eight  counts  of  knowingly
    possessing a false  ID  document,  of  obtaining  leave  to  remain  by
    deception,  and  of  obtaining  property  (viz  welfare  benefits)   by
    deception.  Having been convicted on 17th December, she  was  sentenced
    on 24th February 2010 to five terms of twelve months' imprisonment  and
    three terms of six months' imprisonment, all to run  concurrently.   In
    his sentencing remarks, Mr Recorder Kushner noted that "multiple fraud"
    was employed to obtain different benefits, amounting to ï¿½46,000 in all,
    and that the asylum claim which underlay it  was  "wrong,  without  any
    substance, without any foundation."

4.   On completion  of  the  custodial  part  of  her  sentence,  Mrs  Fawad
    continued in detention at  HMP  Eastwood  Park  under  Immigration  Act
    powers, before being released on bail  on  16th  April  2010.   In  the
    meantime, the Border Agency  had  notified  her  of  her  liability  to
    deportation under section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007,  and  on  22nd
    April her representative at the Immigration Advisory Service  wrote  to
    the Criminal Casework Directorate with reasons why it would  be  unsafe
    for Mrs Fawad to return to Pakistan.  She would be at real risk  of  an
    'honour killing', so great was the shame  which  her  imprisonment  had
    brought on her family.  If her husband refused  to  "personally  uphold
    this social obligation  and  take  action  himself",  then  her  family
    members would be obliged to take action "against her and her  husband."
    It was also pointed out that "it would not be in the  interest  of  the
    childrens (sic) for their lives to be interrupted by being removed from
    the UK."  In particular,  the  youngest  of  the  four  had  "a  health
    condition  that  requires  that  he  attends  outpatient  treatment  at
    hospital every month."

5.   In February 2011  Mrs  Fawad's  new  representatives,  Thaliwal  Bridge
    Solicitors, chased up this 'fresh claim', and on 25th March  they  sent
    off a statement from their client to the UKBA's Asylum Team Midlands at
    Solihull.  In this, Mrs Fawad  describes  the  dreadful  time  she  had
    living with her husband's family while  he  was  studying  in  England.
    This included being raped by a servant of her father-in-law.  To escape
    this treatment she came to the UK with her children,  but  her  husband
    took little interest in her, absenting himself from the  house  without
    any explanation.  Possibly, he was having an affair, but she dared  not
    tell him what had happened to her while in the  care  of  his  parents.
    Thus it was that she heeded the advice of some Pakistani women, who had
    befriended her in the park, to do as they had done and pretend to be an
    Afghan.  After all, they spoke Pashtu, and who was to  tell  that  they
    were not from Afghanistan?

6.   Mr Khan was so uninterested in his wife that he did not even bother  to
    ask her what the basis was for her  asylum  claim.   But  her  time  in
    prison coincided with a visit to the UK by her mother-in-law,  who  was
    scandalised by the shame brought upon the family.  This could  only  be
    blotted out by an 'honour killing'.  It was no use expecting Mr Khan to
    protect her if they went back to Pakistan.  He was very much under  the
    thumb of his family, and would never stand up for his wife.

7.   The asylum claim was not rejected until 15th October 2012, at the  same
    time as a deportation order was made under the 2007 Act.  An appeal  to
    the First-tier Tribunal came before Judge Forrester and Mr  Sheward  on
    11th February 2013 and was dismissed, but permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was granted by Judge Davey, who was concerned  that  the
    best interests of the four children had not been  taken  properly  into
    account.  When the matter came before me  today,  I  agreed  with  Miss
    Rutherford that there was indeed a material error of law in the  First-
    tier determination, requiring me to re-make the decision on the appeal.

8.   There are one or two odd mistakes in  the  determination.   The  period
    which the appellant spent in custody,  from  September  2009  to  April
    2010, is calculated as 14 months.  The children's  best  interests  are
    said to be "a paramount consideration."  And as Mr  Smart  points  out,
    the relevant date for the purposes of the appeal is said to be the date
    of decision (when the two older boys had been in the United Kingdom for
    just a few days more than seven years), rather than  the  date  of  the
    hearing.  Another unfortunate feature of the determination is that more
    than half of it  consists  of  a  lengthy  extract  from  Lord  Justice
    Richards' judgment in JO (Uganda) & JT (Ivory Coast)  [2010]  EWCA  Civ
    10.  His Lordship surveys the case law, both Strasbourg  and  domestic,
    on Article 8 very fully, but there was no need to 'cut  and  paste'  it
    into the determination.  It is the application of the principles to the
    case in hand that is crucial, and in this the determination falls down.

9.    The  panel  do  correctly  follow  the  'two  stage'  approach  of  MF
    (Nigeria), and look first at whether the appellant  can  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules.  They correctly identify paragraph 399(a)(ii)(a)
    as the only one under which the appellant might succeed, on  the  basis
    that two of her children have lived in the UK continuously for at least
    the seven years immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  immigration
    decision, and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the  children  to
    leave the UK.  In finding that it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave the UK, the panel  consider  only  their  ability  to
    adapt to a different environment, where they would still be part  of  a
    complete family unit.  The rule does not say that "it would not  be  in
    the best interests of the child to leave the UK", and it  may  be  that
    this should not be equated with  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK.

10.  But the best interests  of  the  child  must  certainly  be  a  primary
    consideration in performing the Article 8  balancing  exercise  outside
    the Immigration Rules, and when the panel get to  the  'second  stage',
    after the nine-page quotation from  JO  (Uganda)  and  a  further  long
    paragraph setting out Article 8 and the five questions posed in Razgar,
    they do not consider the best interests of the children in the  present
    case - despite ascribing to ZH (Tanzania) the  proposition  that  those
    interests are "a paramount consideration."  All they say  is  that  the
    family were only ever here on a short term basis,  with  no  legitimate
    expectation that they would be granted permanent residence.   There  is
    no specific mention of the two younger children at all.

11.  With a view to re-making the decision  on  the  appeal,  I  heard  oral
    evidence from the appellant and her husband, given in Urdu through  the
    court interpreter.  Mrs Fawad emphasized how well the  older  boys  are
    doing at school, and explained that the youngest boy, who still goes to
    nursery, has to see the doctor every three months for a scan, following
    an operation to remove one of his kidneys.  Miss Rutherford was able to
    obtain from her instructing solicitors a  faxed  copy  of  the  Nursing
    Discharge Summary, which shows that Muhammad Khan was admitted  to  the
    Birmingham Children's Hospital on 5th July 2012 for a left laparoscopic
    nephrectomy, being discharged the next day without needing to be  given
    any drugs.  Mrs Fawad added that the boy gets infections from  time  to
    time.  In cross-examination, she confirmed that the  three  older  boys
    attend the mosque, but could speak little or no Urdu or Pushtu.

12.  Mr Khan explained that, after getting leave to enter as  a  student  in
    2004, he obtained further leave in stages until, in  2008,  he  applied
    for leave to remain under the International Graduate Scheme.  This  was
    supported by a document from London  International  College  confirming
    that he had completed the course.  But it was not a qualification.   He
    had not given full attendance, and he needed to take a further test and
    pay the fees.  He assured Mr Smart that the document which he submitted
    in support of his application for leave to remain was supplied  to  him
    by the College gratis, and was not a forgery.  Like his wife,  Mr  Khan
    insisted that the children could speak little or no Pushtu or Urdu.

13.  In his closing submissions, Mr Smart doubted whether the children  were
    as ignorant of the languages  spoken  by  their  parents  as  had  been
    alleged.  He noted that Mrs Fawad had  not  pursued  the  asylum  claim
    which she raised in 2010, and asked me to reject Mr  Khan's  insistence
    that he had not gained admission to the International Graduates  Scheme
    by deception.  He must also have been aware of his wife's deception  in
    claiming asylum and gaining access to  benefits.   This,  contended  Mr
    Smart, put added weight into the public interest side of the Article  8
    balance, which in a deportation case was already  weighted  heavily  in
    favour of enforcing  the  deportation  order.   He  prayed  in  aid  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 for the importance, hitherto  overlooked,
    of the fact that Parliament has  legislated  to  the  effect  that  the
    deportation of foreign criminals is conducive to the public good.

14.  For her part, Miss Rutherford reminded me that  the  asylum  claim  had
    not been conceded before the First-tier Tribunal, albeit not vigorously
    pursued.  Her focus was on the best interests of the children,  two  of
    whom were now of an age  when  their  private  lives  lay  increasingly
    outside the confines  of  their  immediate  family  and  in  the  wider
    society, at school  and  with  their  friends.   The  disruption  which
    removal to Pakistan  would  cause  to  those  private  lives  had  been
    assessed by the consultant child psychiatrist, Dr  Sarah  Newth,  whose
    expert report was part of the Appellant's Bundle.  The younger two boys
    had not developed outside ties to such an extent,  but  they  had  been
    born here and their  main  language  was  English.   The  youngest  had
    medical problems, which would be best monitored in this country.   Miss
    Rutherford also drew attention to the fact that Mrs Fawad had  not  re-
    offended since her release in April 2010, and to the respondent's  long
    delay between  notifying  her  of  her  liability  to  deportation  and
    actually making a deportation order.

15.  Adopting the same two-stage approach  as  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I
    come to the same conclusion as  regards  Part  13  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It seems to me that a child can be reasonably expected to leave
    the United Kingdom when both his parents and his other siblings will be
    leaving too, even if it can be argued it is not in his  best  interests
    for the family to be removed.  But the best interests of the child must
    be a primary consideration when it comes to  the  Article  8  balancing
    exercise outside the Immigration Rules.  In the instant case, the first
    four questions posed by Lord Bingham in Razgar can all be  answered  in
    the affirmative.  It is the final question, whether it is proportionate
    to deport the appellant and (as is permitted under section  3(5)(b)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971, although no decision has been made  yet)  the
    members of her family, which is crucial to the outcome of this appeal.

16.  As Miss Rutherford very sensibly recognizes, if it  were  not  for  the
    children ~ who should not, as she says, be punished for the  wrongdoing
    of their parents ~ the Article 8 claim would be very weak indeed.   The
    two younger boys are now aged 6 and 4 respectively.  One  of  them  has
    not yet started school, and the other has not been at school very long.
     They are of an age when their home and their parents are very much the
    centre of their lives.  They will not yet have formed such strong  ties
    with the wider society  that  moving  to  another  country  with  their
    parents and siblings can be said to breach their right to  respect  for
    their private lives.  Muhammad underwent a successful kidney  operation
    last summer.  There are no sequelae of that operation.  He requires  no
    medication,  just  the  occasional  check-up.   That  can  be  done  in
    Pakistan, where treatment for the  infections  about  which  Mrs  Fawad
    complains can also be readily obtained.

17.  With the two older boys it is different.  Hamas is  now  11  years  old
    (possibly 12) and Yoshua is 10.  They have lived in  this  country  for
    over 7ï¿½ years, and are old enough to have formed  significant  ties  at
    school and in the wider society.   Moving  to  Pakistan  would  have  a
    significant impact on their private lives.  Indeed, this was the thrust
    of Dr Newth's psychiatric report.  The boys are doing well  at  school,
    and it will be a real wrench for them to be parted from their circle of
    friends.  But as well as their ties to the  United  Kingdom,  they  are
    also familiar with important aspects of Pakistani culture.  They, along
    with Hamad, regularly attend the mosque, and according to a letter from
    the management, they attend the Jamia Tul Salam five days a week  after
    school, from 4 to 6 p.m.  Like Mr Smart, I do not accept that the  Urdu
    and Pashto tongues are rarely used by their parents and their circle of
    friends and acquaintances, and it is common knowledge that children  of
    that age can attain fluency in another language very quickly.

18.  It must be borne in mind that millions of  people  migrate  to  another
    country every year, bringing their children with them, even though this
    means taking the children away from their  school  and  their  friends.
    They are not prevented from doing so on the ground that  this  violates
    the children's human rights.  Of course, the parents are usually hoping
    that migration will result in a better life for the family,  with  more
    money and better opportunities.  That may not be  the  case  in  moving
    from the United Kingdom to Pakistan, but this family  do  not  seem  to
    have been particularly badly off in Pakistan.   Mr  Khan  was  able  to
    demonstrate sufficient resources to be granted a student visa in  2004,
    while Mrs Fawad was able to  demonstrate  sufficient  resources  to  be
    granted visitor's visas for herself and  two  children  in  2005.   The
    children will not  be  facing  a  life  of  penury  or  destitution  in
    Pakistan, the country of their nationality.

19.  Insofar as it can be said that  the  best  interests  of  the  children
    would be served by  letting  them  continue  their  education  in  this
    country,  with  perhaps  a  better  standard  of  living,  it  must  be
    remembered that the best interests of the  children  are  not  a  trump
    card.  See on this the remarks  of  Lord  Justice  Davis  in  LH  &  HH
    (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  26.   Even  under  the  old   'seven-year
    concession',  when  indefinite  leave  would  normally  be  granted  to
    families with a child who had been living here for  seven  years,  this
    could be withheld if there were countervailing factors such as criminal
    behaviour.  Such factors obtrude in the present case.  If  the  parents
    had done nothing worse than overstay their leave, an  Article  8  claim
    based on the interests of the children would be much stronger.  But the
    conduct of the parents has greatly  strengthened  the  public  interest
    side of the proportionality balance.

20.  Mr Khan told the First-tier Tribunal that he had received  no  response
    to his application in 2009 for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study
    Work) Migrant.  That is not true.  Mr Smart has handed up a copy  of  a
    letter dated 2nd November 2009 from the Border Agency to Mr  Khan,  who
    had been living in Southall, well away from his wife  and  children  in
    Birmingham - a wise precaution, when Mrs Fawad was masquerading  as  an
    Afghan refugee whose husband was still in Afghanistan.  It appears from
    the letter that Mr Khan spent the academic year 2007-2008 in  full-time
    employment  with  JD  Sports,  rather  than  studying  at  the   London
    International College, which indeed informed the Border Agency that  he
    had not attended their programme of studies or paid their  fees.   What
    Mr Khan told us today about receiving  confirmation  from  the  college
    that  he  had  completed  the   course,   but   without   obtaining   a
    qualification, is not to be believed.   Besides,  Mr  Khan  would  have
    needed to demonstrate that he had obtained a qualification in order  to
    gain admission to the International Graduate Scheme.   He  clearly  did
    submit a Postgraduate Diploma  in  Management  Studies  which  was  not
    genuine.

21.  So Mr Khan both breached the conditions  of  his  leave  and  practised
    deception in order to obtain further leave.  But these  infractions  of
    our immigration law are dwarfed by the deliberate fraud  and  falsehood
    perpetrated by Mrs Fawad over a three-year period.  It is very much  in
    the  public  interest  that  public  confidence  in   our   system   of
    international protection be maintained.  A blatantly false claim,  such
    as that propounded by Mrs Fawad, damages the integrity of that  system,
    to the detriment not only of those  who  administer  it  but  of  those
    people genuinely fleeing persecution.  A case like this can only add to
    the  public  perception  that  many  asylum  claims  are  bogus.   Such
    behaviour should be deterred, and a long line of cases from  N  (Kenya)
    onwards has emphasized the  importance  of  deterrence  as  a  relevant
    factor to be weighed on the public  interest  side  of  the  Article  8
    balance.

22.  Miss Rutherford contends that the delay between  the  first  intimation
    that her client was being considered for deportation and the making  of
    a deportation order reduces the weight of the public interest  side  of
    the balance.  But much of that delay  was  due  to  Mrs  Fawad  putting
    forward another unfounded asylum claim, which was not  advanced  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, and on which no reliance is placed  now.   All
    of this must be considered in the light of the latest guidance from the
    Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria), in which Lord  Justice  Laws  explains
    that  in  respect  of  children  'a  primary  consideration'  means   a
    consideration of substantial importance, but that, it having been  laid
    down in primary legislation that deportation of a foreign  criminal  is
    conducive  to  the  public  good,  the  public  interest  side  of  the
    proportionality balance can only be outweighed by a very  strong  claim
    indeed.  In the present case, even according substantial weight to  the
    best interests of the children, the public interest side of the balance
    has manifestly not been outweighed.




     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
