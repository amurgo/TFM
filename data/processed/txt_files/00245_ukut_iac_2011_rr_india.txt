Proof of the requisite  funds  for  'Maintenance'  under  the  Points  Based
System is retrospective.  For example, a student must show  that  the  funds
were available for a continuous period of 28  days  before  the  application
for entry clearance or leave  to  remain  was  made.   If,  throughout  that
period,  an  overdraft  facility  could  have  been  used  to  withdraw  the
requisite funds, there is nothing in principle or in the  Rules  to  prevent
that from demonstrating that the requisite funds were available. PO  (points
based scheme: maintenance: loans) Nigeria [2009] UKAIT 47, which  takes  the
opposite view, was decided pre-Pankina on the basis of the Policy Guidance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  Rohan Rana is a student from India who initially got leave to enter  for
one year in October 2009, and then made an in-time application  for  further
leave on 8 October 2010.  The application was refused,  but  the  subsequent
appeal was allowed by Immigration Judge Sweet.  The Secretary of  State  has
been  given  permission  to  appeal  against  that  determination,  but  for
convenience I shall refer to Mr Rana as 'the appellant'.

2.  The refusal on 12 November 2010 was partly due to the  belief  that  the
appellant had outstanding  course  fees  of  �3,830,  but  Judge  Sweet  was
satisfied, from evidence shown to him, that those  fees  had  been  paid  to
Thames Valley University before  the  application  was  lodged  for  further
leave.   But  the  appellant  also  had  to  show  two  months'   worth   of
'Maintenance' under Appendix C, namely �1,200,  and  the  statement  of  his
father's account with  IndusInd  Bank  for  the  28-day  period  before  the
application did not show that  level  of  funds.   At  the  hearing  on  4th
January 2011, however, Judge Sweet was told that the  appellant's  uncle  in
Birmingham had  been  jointly  sponsoring  him  along  with  his  father  in
Jalandhar, and a statement to this effect  was  subsequently  produced  from
Karpal Singh Sohal.  There was also produced  a  statement  of  his  account
with the Bank of India for the period July-November 2010, and a letter  from
the Handsworth branch of  the  Bank  confirming  that  Mr  Sohal  "has  been
sanctioned an  overdraft  facility  of  �130,000  secured  against  freehold
property", and that at the date of the letter  (7  January  2011)  Mr  Sohal
could "draw down funds up to �67,703.22."

3.  Judge Sweet noted that at  the  time  of  the  application  for  further
leave, a lesser sum was available  to  Mr  Sohal,  but  it  was  still  over
�20,000, and thus easily covered the �1,200 which had to  be  available  for
the appellant's maintenance.  In the application for leave to appeal to  the
Upper  Tribunal,  it  was  acknowledged  that,  in  line  with   CDS   (PBS:
"available": Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC), the appellant's  uncle
could be a financial sponsor,  but  it  was  queried  whether  an  overdraft
facility could be used to show the availability of funds.   The  pre-Pankina
case of PO (points based scheme: maintenance: loans)  Nigeria  [2009]  UKAIT
47  had found that it could not, but that was based on what was said in  the
Policy Guidance, there being nothing in the Immigration  Rules  specifically
to bar reliance on an overdraft facility.

4.  When  the  appeal  came  before  me  today,   the   appellant   appeared
unrepresented, while the Secretary of State was represented  by  Miss  Alice
Holmes of the Specialist Appeals Team, who was dubious whether an  overdraft
facility could in principle be used to show maintenance funds.   I  can  see
no reason why not.  Under the  Points  Based  System,  the  availability  of
funds is retrospective.  A certain sum of money  must  be  available  for  a
certain period of time (here 28  days)  before  the  application  for  entry
clearance or leave to remain is lodged.   The  migrant  does  not  currently
have to show that the money is  still  available  when  his  application  is
decided, or when he arrives in the United Kingdom, or  at  any  other  point
after he submits his application.  If, during the 28-day period,  the  funds
could have been withdrawn from the account  in  question  without  exceeding
the limit of an agreed overdraft,  then  it  seems  to  me  that  they  were
'available' to the appellant in the required sense.

5.  In the instant case, the sponsor's  overdraft  facility  is  secured  on
freehold property, and is unlikely to be withdrawn at short notice.   It  is
clear from the statement and letter issued by the Bank  of  India  that  for
the six months between July 2010 and  January  2011  the  sponsor  has  been
permitted to overdraw his account by up to �130,000, but it has  never  been
overdrawn by  more  than  �118,000,  and  during  the  28  days  before  the
appellant's application, the account was  overdrawn  by  considerably  less.
Today, the appellant showed up statements of his  own  account  with  Lloyds
TSB, covering a period last year and indicating that the account  is  nearly
always healthily in credit.

6.  Miss Holmes sensibly agreed that, on the  facts  of  the  present  case,
there was every reason to suppose that adequate maintenance  has  been,  and
will continue to be, available to the appellant, who is  pursuing  a  degree
course with a 'recognised body'.

DECISION

7. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
