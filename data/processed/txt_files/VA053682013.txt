For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

No anonymity order requested or made


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant appeals against a determination by First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Wallace, dismissing his appeal against  refusal  of  a  family
       visit visa.


    2. The judge concluded at �40 that there was no reason  to  think  this
       was anything other than a genuine application, or that the appellant
       would have any desire to remain in the UK beyond his proposed 3 week
       visit; and at�43 that it was only natural for the sponsor to wish to
       be visited by her brother.  Mr Mullen fairly and correctly  conceded
       that standing those findings, to  which  the  respondent  raised  no
       challenge, there was no reason for the judge  to  have  gone  on  to
       dismiss the appeal for "lack of documentation".


    3. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
       appeal, as originally brought by the  appellant  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, is allowed.
