Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms D Revill, Counsel instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria and her date  of  birth  is  [  ]
    1957.  She came to the United Kingdom in 2005 on  a  visit  visa.   The
    Appellant remained here after the expiry of her visit visa. She made an
    application in 2008 for leave  to  remain  which  was  refused  by  the
    Respondent on 14 May 2009.  She was served with an IS.151A on  26  July
    2014.  The Appellant appealed against a decision of  30  July  2014  to
    remove her.  Her appeal was dismissed by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    2015.  This decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal and the matter
    was reheard by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Andrew  on  13  April
    2016.  He dismissed the appeal in a decision that was promulgated on 19
    April 2016.  Permission to appeal against that decision was granted  by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor on 7 December 2016.  The matter came
    before Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds on 22 March 2017 who  concluded  that
    Judge Andrew had materially erred and set aside the decision to dismiss
    her appeal under Articles 3 and  8.   Judge  Reeds  made  a  series  of
    directions.  The matter came before me for a substantive hearing on  15
    May 2017.

2.   Neither party complied with the directions of Judge  Reeds  in  respect
    of the filing and service of further evidence pursuant to  Rule  15(2A)
    of the 2008 Procedure Rules.  At the start of  the  hearing  Ms  Revill
    indicated that there had been a significant change in circumstances  in
    respect of the Appellant and her son, DB,  but  there  was  no  further
    statements of evidence and her intention  was  that  the  new  evidence
    would be given during examination-in-chief. I  did  not  consider  this
    positon to be satisfactory.  I  directed  Ms  Revill  to  take  further
    witness statements from the witnesses and to serve those on  Mr  Melvin
    so that he could consider the same.  Ms Revill submitted an  eight-page
    skeleton argument on the  morning  of  the  hearing  (contrary  to  the
    directions of Judge Reeds).  I expressed concern to Ms Revill about how
    the Appellant's case was presented, in the light of the fact that there
    was no comprehensive bundle before me.  The evidence had been served in
    a piecemeal fashion and there were documents submitted which did not on
    the face of it appear to be relevant.

3.   At the hearing on 15 May 2017, Ms Revill agreed that she would  prepare
    a comprehensive list of all the evidence on which the  Appellant  seeks
    to rely for the purposes of this appeal.  I directed a  bundle  with  a
    comprehensive index should be served and  filed  on  the  Tribunal  not
    later  than  29  May  2017.   A  bundle  (AB)  was  served  and   filed
    accordingly. Ms Revill did her utmost to assist the Tribunal and I make
    no criticism of her.

4.   Mr Melvin relied on a skeleton argument that was sent to  the  Tribunal
    on 5 May 2017.  However, he made an application under Rule 15(2A)  2008
    to adduce further evidence, namely evidence relating to an  outstanding
    NHS debt totalling ï¿½33,309.03 to the Royal  Brompton  &  Harefield  NHS
    Foundation Trust, a British Cardiovascular Society Report of Fitness to
    Fly and  General  Practice  Notebook  (Ref  British  Heart  Foundation)
    entitled Fitness to Fly.  The Respondent relies on the general  grounds
    for refusal in respect of the evidence of  the  outstanding  NHS  debt.
    However, the application was not made in a timely fashion in accordance
    with  15A  (2)  of  the  Procedure  Rules.   Ms  Revill   opposed   the
    application.  In my view, the evidence is material  to  the  issues  in
    this case.  Ms Revill was  not  able  to  identify  any  unfairness  or
    prejudice caused to the Appellant by its late service. I  admitted  the
    evidence.

5.       Mr Melvin submitted written submissions on 21 June 2017.    At  the
    hearing on 21 June, after Mr Melvin's submissions, sadly the  Appellant
    was taken ill and my understanding is that she was taken to hospital in
    an ambulance. Regrettably there was no effective  air  conditioning  at
    Field House on what was an extraordinarily hot day.

The Appellant's Evidence relating to her medical condition

6.   At the hearing Ms Revill stated that there was no reliance  on  any  of
    the documents that were not contained in the  AB  which  comprises  181
    pages. I have considered all  of  the  documents  in  the  AB.  I  have
    recorded what I consider to be the most important evidence, but I  have
    considered all the evidence in the AB. The following are those referred
    to by Ms Revill include:-


     Letter from Dr Kumar to Dr Gillham of 7 August 2008 (AB page 61)


     Dr Kumar states as follows: -

     "Being a known patient  of  significant  LV  dysfunction  secondary  to
             dilated cardiomyopathy, although  she  is  currently  free  of
             signs of failure she would be at a higher risk  of  developing
             symptomatic heart failure at high altitude.  If her journey is
             essential and unavoidable I would recommend that  she  informs
             the details of her illness to the light authorities so that if
             necessary, she might be able to get some  oxygen  supplements.
             During her stay in Nigeria, whenever she  is  symptomatic  she
             should seek immediate medical advice".

         A letter "To Whom It May Concern" from Dr J George, a GP registrar
         of 27 August 2014 (AB page 51-53).

     The author indicates that the letter has been prepared at  the  request
         of the Appellant and with her consent and the  letter  records  the
         Appellant's medical conditions as follows: -

             "1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)  for
                  which she is on warfarin  a  blood  thinner  and  requires
                  weekly blood tests.


             2.    Non-ischaemic   dilated   cardiomyopathy   (pathological
                  enlargement of the  heart)  -  in  my  recent  consult  it
                  appears that  symptom  control  has  destabilised  in  the
                  recent  past  as  manifested  by   ongoing   episodes   of
                  dizziness,   easy   fatigability,   exertional    dyspnoea
                  (shortness of breath), cardiac chest pain and palpitations
                  (racing heart).  She is awaiting a cardiology  review  for
                  which she has been referred.


             3.    For  conditions  1  and  2  (each   on   its   own   and
                  synergistically worse together) - she is at risk of  fatal
                  ventricular tachycardia which  could  lead  to  a  cardiac
                  arrest.    She   does   have   an   implantable    cardiac
                  defibrillator (ICD) which I understand  also  provides  on
                  demand pacing. This  requires  frequent  interrogation  to
                  ensure its integrity  which  is  done  at  the  specialist
                  cardiac centre in  Harefield  Hospital.   In  addition,  I
                  understand  that  the  ICD  device  automatically   status
                  reports on-line daily to the cardiac centre as well.


             4.   She also has asthma on step 2 treatment with long  acting
                  inhaled steroids.


             5.   She suffers with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.


             6.   She has moderate medical compartment degeneration of  her
                  left knee. This leaves her with  intermittent  significant
                  knee pain.  Although she was considered  for  arthroscopic
                  repair  it  was  felt  ultimately  that  in  view  of  her
                  significant  medical   comorbidities,   the   benefit   of
                  anthroscopic  surgery  was   outweighed   by   the   risks
                  involved."

     The GP goes on to state as follows: -

     "The combination of the aforementioned conditions in my  opinion  would
             leave her unsuitable to drive or to  undertake  long  distance
             travel and especially air travel.  She would  need  cardiology
             review and clearance from them if she were to undertake any of
             the aforementioned activities".

         Letter from Dr Travill,  a  Consultant  Cardiologist  at  Luton  &
         Dunstable University Hospital to the Appellant's GP, Dr Gillham  of
         19 November 2014 (AB page 49-50)

     The letter states that the Appellant  has  dilated  cardiomyopathy  and
         had implantation of CRTD device in 2009 and was seen by Dr  Travill
         for review.  Dr Travill states  that  the  Appellant  continues  to
         experience dizziness which can occur at any time and she had  given
         him  an  account  of  a  recent   occurrence   of   dizziness   and
         breathlessness.  Dr Travill indicates that  mobility  is  currently
         limited to a maximum of 80 yards on the flat due to breathlessness.
          It is  also  stated  that  she  experiences  paroxysmal  nocturnal
         dyspnoea three times a week and sometimes more, and  that  this  is
         associated with a cough.  Dr  Travill  also  states  that  on  some
         occasions the Appellant may struggle for breath after  sitting  for
         two hours.  He lists the Appellant's medication and  he  states  as
         follows: -

     "She asked if it was possible for her to fly to Nigeria.  I would  have
             significant reservations about this in the context  of  flying
             when she  may  become  cardiovascully  compromised  and  would
             certainly be at increased risk.  In addition, when in  Nigeria
             the facilities to manage her defibrillator are not  widespread
             or easily accessible".

         Letter from Dr I Merinopoulos to the Appellant's solicitors of  18
         June 2015 (AB page 95)

         The letter reads as follows: -

     "Dr Travill said that he would strongly advise against [the  Appellant]
             travel to Nigeria.  The worst-case scenario if Mrs  B  travels
             to Nigeria in the absence of appropriate facilities to  manage
             her device, would be a possible complication  to  happen  with
             the device which might not  be  possible  to  manage  in  that
             country.  For example, it is possible for the device to  start
             'firing'  (providing  ICD  shocks)  unexpectedly  and  in  the
             absence of enough medical expertise to manage that  situation;
             this can put her life at risk".

Background Evidence

7.   The Appellant relied on the following:-

         Letter from Dr Ndom of the  Federal  Medical  Centre  in  Nasarawa
         State in Nigeria of 12 September 2014 (AB page 63)


         The author states that they do not have the required expertise  to
         handle the home heart monitoring machine which is  to  be  directly
         connected to a landline phone and with readings  being  transmitted
         to the centre where it will be monitored.  It is  also  noted  that
         this would require constant electricity supply.  It is stated  that
         the  hospital  ambulance  is  not  equipped   to   handle   related
         emergencies and  that  there  is  concerns  about  getting  genuine
         medication because  of  the  circulation  of  fake  drugs.   It  is
         summarised  that  assuming  the  facility  and  the  logistics  are
         available, the patient to sustain treatment would  need  access  to
         considerable funds.


          The  Fight  Against  Fake  Drugs  by  NAFDAC  in  Nigeria   (44th
         International Course in Health  Development)  ICHD  (September  24,
         2007 - September 12, 2008, author Olike Chinwendu) (AB page 76-84)

     The report at page 144 of  AB1  addresses  the  problem  of  fake  drug
         proliferation in  Nigeria  which  has,  according  to  the  author,
         affected the credibility of the healthcare  system  and  can  exert
         very  harmful  effects  on  the  consumer  resulting  in   illness;
         disability and even death and anyone can be a victim.


         Article from www.howafrica.com (undated)(AB page 88-94)
     The article is  entitled  "Meet  Nigerian,  Dr  Olurotimi  Badero,  the
         world's only combined heart and  kidney  specialist  doctor".   The
         Appellant relies on the article with specific reference to page  92
         where  in  an  interview  with  Dr  Badero,  a  Nigerian  US  Based
         cardiologist, he stated that in Nigeria  "devices  like  pacemakers
         and  defibrillators  are  not  available  to  manage   some   heart
         conditions."

         The Report of Joint British-Danish Fact-Finding Mission  to  Lagos
         and Abuja, Nigeria 9-27 September 2007 and 5-12 January 2008 of  29
         October 2008 (AB Page 126-181)


         The Appellant submitted this document in support of her appeal and
         specific reference is made to  paragraph  6.11  which  is  entitled
         "Treatment for heart conditions and  cardiovascular  diseases"  and
         which reads as follows: -

             "The doctor stated that the most common type of cardiovascular
             disease that Nigerians suffer from is hypertension (high blood
             pressure),  with  8%-10%  of  Nigerians  suffering  from   the
             condition.  Drugs that can reduce blood pressure are available
             but are very expensive and are not affordable by the  majority
             of the population.  There are no specialist cardiovascular  or
             cardiothoracic centres in Nigeria, but treatment is  available
             for a wide variety of cardiovascular conditions and  diseases,
             including congenital heart conditions.  People suffering  from
             coronary heart disease or people who have  had  heart  attacks
             can be treated, in general, but coronary  artery  by-pass  and
             angioplasty  operations  are   not   available   in   Nigerian
             hospitals.  In general,  invasive  heart  operations  are  not
             available but heart valve defects, atrial septal defects,  and
             aneurysms can be treated.  Pacemakers  can  be  installed  and
             therefore patients with certain types of arrhythmias (abnormal
             heart rhythm) can be treated.  There is  inadequate  treatment
             available in Nigerian  hospitals  for  people  suffering  from
             primary cardiomyopathy (enlargement of the heart cavity). This
             condition in its end-stage can be cured through the use  of  a
             heart transplant but heart transplant operations are  not  yet
             available in Nigerian hospitals."

8.   The Respondent relied on the following:-

     The General Practice Notebook

     The Respondent relies  on  guidance  following  pacemaker  implantation
    which reads as follows:-

     "Fly after two days if no pneumothorax.  In the event of  pneumothorax,
         flying  should  be  deferred  for  two  weeks  following   complete
         resolution."

    and the guidance following ICD implantation  and  highlights  the  "lay
    explanation" which reads as follows: -


         "If you have had a defibrillator, the same  advice  for  pacemakers
         (above) applies but, in addition you should not fly after  the  ICD
         has delivered a shock until your condition is concerned stable"


    and the  "restriction  guidance"  which  is  given  for  following  ICD
    implantation is as follows: -


         "The same advice as for pacemakers above but, in  addition,  rhythm
         instability should be treated."

    British Cardiovascular Society Report entitled "Fitness to Fly for
    Passengers with Cardiovascular Disease"

     This article  dates  back  to  2010.   The  salient  parts  of  it  are
    contained in the summary and reads as follows: -

     "Following this review of evidence and after due consideration,  it  is
         clear that there are few cardiovascular conditions that warrant the
         denial of fitness to fly as a passenger.  Given the right aircraft,
         on board equipment  and  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced
         escort personnel, aircraft can act as flying intensive  care  units
         and carry extremely ill passengers.  For those with  cardiovascular
         disease who  are  not  cortically  ill  but  who  wish  to  fly  on
         commercial aircraft, the  aircraft  environment  does  not  pose  a
         significant  threat  to  their  health.   It  is  only  when  their
         underlying condition is associated with a significant risk of acute
         deterioration that reasonable restrictions should apply.  For those
         of  the  more  severe  end  of  the  spectrum  of  their   specific
         cardiovascular condition, services exist to help make  the  journey
         more easily and safely.

          ... Passengers are advised to plan their arrival at the airport in
         plenty of time to avoid having to rush to warn the  carrier  and/or
         airport authority of any  requirements  for  assistance,  including
         requirement for in-flight oxygen, well in advance of  the  date  of
         departure.  They are  strongly  advised  to  ensure  they  have  an
         appropriate supply  of  their  medication,  a  clear  list  of  the
         medications and doses they take and a letter  of  explanation  from
         their  doctor  regarding  their  condition,  drugs,  allergies  and
         devices (e.g. pacemaker)".

9.   The report goes on to consider  pacemakers  and  ICDs  at  paragraph  8
    reads as follows:-

         "8.1.1   In the UK over 40,000 new patients  receive  an  implanted
                pacemaker or ICD each year.  The majority of  these  devices
                are conventional pacemakers, but  there  are  an  increasing
                number of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) pacemakers
                and ICDs, with or without CRT capability.


         8.1.2    It is estimated that there are currently 380,000  patients
                with pacemakers, 6,000  patients  with  CRT  pacemakers  and
                33,000  patients  with  ICDs  (including  7,000   with   CRT
                capability)   in   the   UK.    (D.   Cunningham,   Personal
                Communication, 2009).  The majority of pacemaker  recipients
                are elderly (mean age at implant 75.5 years),  but  patients
                may receive a pacemaker at any age  from  infancy  to  adult
                life.  ...


         8.1.4    Patients receiving CRT and ICDs tend to be  younger  (mean
                age at implant 69.9 and 62.5 years, respectively)  and  more
                often have sic underlying cardiac disease such  as  previous
                myocardial   infarction,   cardiomyopathy,   impaired   left
                ventricular function and heart disease.  When assessing  the
                patient's fitness to fly, the nature and stability of  these
                underlying conditions require careful consideration and  may
                be of greater significance than the presence of the  device.




         8.1.5    Although the majority of patients with an implanted device
                may travel safely by air, there are a  few  specific  issues
                that should be considered before  travel  and  a  number  of
                concerns for which  the  patient  may  require  guidance  or
                reassurance."


    The OGN Nigeria 2013


    Neither party produced this. However, Ms Revill referred to it in her
    submissions. I have considered this document and the salient paragraph
    that reads:-


         "5.2     Caseworkers should give due consideration to the
             individual factors of each case and refer to the latest
             available country of origin information concerning the

             the information is not readily available, an information
             request should be submitted to the COI Service (COIS). "

 The Appellant's Evidence

10.  The Appellant adopted three witness statements (dated 29 January  2015,
    4 April 2016 and 15 May 2017) as evidence-in-chief.  Her  evidence  can
    be summarised.

11.  The Appellant came here in 1976 as a student and whilst in the  UK  she
    married her husband and her son, DB, was born here in  1981.  He  is  a
    British citizenship.  The Appellant  had  family  in  Nigeria  and  the
    family returned there in 1981.  She came back to the UK as a visitor in
    2003 and returned before the expiry of her visa.  She came  here  again
    in January 2005 to see DB.  It was during that visit that the Appellant
    became ill and she was diagnosed with a heart condition.

12.  In 2006 or 2007 she was told she had an enlarged heart  and  she  would
    have to go for tests.  The Appellant was prescribed  warfarin  (she  is
    allergic to aspirin and unfortunately, this  medication  is  destroying
    her kidneys and she now has chronic kidney disease).

13.  In 2007 the Appellant was admitted to hospital for several  months  and
    she was told that she  would  have  an  ICD  implanted.   She  had  the
    operation in 2009.  Because of the dangers of warfarin,  the  Appellant
    must have weekly blood tests.  She has a home monitoring machine which,
    if necessary, sends signals to the Royal Brompton & Harefield  Hospital
    who call for an ambulance should this be necessary.  She has been taken
    to Royal Brompton & Harefield Hospital on two occasions  (2015  witness
    statement).

14.  The ICD device is under  regular  review.   The  Appellant's  condition
    improved after the first year after it was implanted, but the  symptoms
    of palpitations, tiredness, breathlessness started to return.  She  has
    been told that she is at risk of having a heart attack (she had a minor
    heart attack in 2007).   She thinks the next appointment to monitor the
    ICD is in August 2017.   She  has  three  monthly  check-ups  with  the
    Consultant and her warfarin is  checked  weekly.         The  Appellant
    suffers from asthma and uses two inhalers.  She  has  swelling  in  her
    neck and pains in her knee.  She  uses  a  walking  stick  and  attends
    physiotherapy.

15.  The Appellant cannot travel on  a  flight  to  Nigeria  as  this  would
    affect her heart and she would be concerned that she would have a heart
    attack.  The Appellant would not be able to travel to Nigeria  or  live
    in Nigeria because of her health  problems.  The  treatment  which  she
    presently receives in the UK would not be available to her in  Nigeria.
      There are no adequate medical  facilities  in  Nigeria.   Her  device
    would not be monitored and there  are  inadequate  ambulance  services.
    Nigeria is not equipped to take care of her medical issues.  There  are
    many fake  drugs  in  Nigeria  and  there  is  no  constant  source  of
    electricity.  The Appellant is unable to work or  run  a  business  and
    would not be able to look after herself.

16.  The Appellant does not have any property and has no income in  Nigeria.
     She does not have a support network available to her.  Her parents are
    deceased.  Her mother passed away in 1997 and her father passed away in
    2011. Her siblings and cousin are in the USA.  She has no contact  with
    her husband and does not know where he is.  Her husband  did  not  like
    her to have friends so she did not have any in  Nigeria  and  he  would
    stop her from seeing friends.  She is supported by friends  and  family
    here but they would not be able to support her  in  Nigeria.   Whatever
    they give her would not amount to much because the cost  of  living  is
    higher there.

17.  Prior to March 2016 the Appellant and  DB  were  living  together.  The
    Appellant gave  a few addresses where she has lived since 2005.  DB has
    been studying in Manchester  since  2013  and  when  they  were  living
    together he had to attend college three days a week.  Whilst DB was  in
    Manchester she was looked after by LB  (her  son's  friend)  and  other
    friends who would come to the house to help her. The Appellant  and  DB
    had to leave their former home in  Luton  in  March  2016  because  the
    landlord sold the property.  DB went to live in Manchester in order  to
    complete his studies there whilst the Appellant moved in to live with a
    friend, CS, in Luton who is taking  care  of  her  now.  DB  is  living
    separately from her, but this is a temporary arrangement. The Appellant
    sees DB weekly and they are in contact every day.

18.  DB was not studying when she arrived in the UK, but after some time  he
    commenced studies at the University of Kent.  She  has  been  supported
    since she has been here by friends, family and DB who was able to  work
    during holiday periods.  DB has always paid the rent. She  thinks  that
    he has been funded by a Government scheme throughout his studies and he
    is now funding the course that he is doing.

19.  The Appellant is aware of having received a bill  in  relation  to  NHS
    care and DB will repay that once he is in employment.  He starts a  job
    at the end of the month, but he is not currently working because he  is
    at university.  She was not able to give details of  her  son's  future
    employers.  He has been to  India  where  he  has  been  working  on  a
    placement.  The Appellant cannot remember the last time DB went back to
    Nigeria. He did not travel there last year or the year before.

The Evidence of DB

20.  DB's evidence is contained in his  witness  statements  of  26  January
    2015 and 15 May 2017, both of which  he  adopted  as  his  evidence-in-
    chief. The evidence can be summarised.

21.  DB's evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was  that  he  lived  with
    his mother and has been her main  carer.   His  evidence  was  that  he
    cooks,  cleans  and  takes  care  of  her,  including  taking  her   to
    appointments.  His evidence was  that  he  made  arrangements  for  his
    friend, LB, or other friends and family to take care of her and that he
    has accommodated his mother at his home for approximately  nine  years.
    However, his evidence now is that this  is  no  longer  the  case.  His
    mother is now living with a friend in Luton and  he  is  in  Manchester
    where he is studying.

22.  DB is studying a BA Hons in Creative Media and Visual Communication  at
    Manchester  Metropolitan  University.   He  commenced  his  studies  in
    September 2013 and graduates this year at the  end  of  May.   For  the
    first two years whilst he was studying he had to be in  Manchester  for
    three days a week and he lived with his mother the rest  of  the  time.
    Whilst he was in Manchester his friend LB would take care of her.   His
    mother moved in with CS in March 2016 and he moved  to  Manchester.  DB
    has a job starting at the end of the month and a permanent job starting
    in July 2017 in Media Production.  Although  this  is  subject  to  him
    successfully completing his BA, he is expected to do so.   He  will  to
    repay his mother's NHS debt once he starts working.

23.   DB gave up his studies at  the  University  of  Kent  because  of  his
    mother's health condition.  He was studying when she came here in  2005
    but withdrew from the course in 2009.  He had a student  loan  to  fund
    his studies at the University of Kent.

24.      In 2009 he was working as a  musician.   The  group  was  based  in
    Nigeria and he would go there to perform between 2010 and 2012.  He was
    not studying during this period and he would  go  to  Nigeria,  usually
    during a festive period.   The longest period he stayed there was for a
    month-and-a-half, but it was usually less than that.

25.      DB has lost contact with his father.  When he returned  to  Nigeria
    he did not attempt to contact him or to locate him.  He did not see any
    of his parents' friends or members of his family during his visits.  In
    his absence, his friend, LB, and other members  of  the  family  looked
    after his mother.

26.    DB's current studies are funded by a student loan and he works  part-
    time.  He owes in the region of ï¿½20,000 because of his studies.  He has
    always paid his mother's rent.   He received  money  towards  the  rent
    from LB who lived with him and his mother before March 2016.

27.      DB would not be able to support his mother in Nigeria  and  neither
    could the aunts, uncles and other family members  here.   It  would  be
    difficult for her to take possession of any money sent to Nigeria.   He
    does not know whether his mother was working in Nigeria  prior  to  her
    coming to the UK and he does not know with whom she was living.

The Evidence of CS

28.   CS's evidence is contained in her witness  statements  of  26  January
    2015 and 15 May 2017 which she adopted as her  evidence-in-chief.   Her
    evidence can be summarised.

29.    CS is a British citizen and has known the Appellant since 1983.   The
    Appellant is like a sister to her.  She moved in to  live  with  CS  in
    March 2016. This is a temporary arrangement until her son  finishes  at
    university when she will move back with him.  The Appellant lives  with
    CS and her four children and two grandchildren and  they  all  help  in
    looking after her.  CS cooks for the Appellant, does her laundry, takes
    her to and from hospital appointments and helps her with  anything  she
    needs doing.  She does not charge her rent.  The Appellant cannot stand
    for long.  She cannot carry her food to  the  table  or  lift  anything
    heavy.  Sometimes she needs help to put on her socks. CS does not think
    the Appellant could survive without her help which CS will continue  to
    give even when the Appellant moves back to live with her son, DB.

30.  In oral evidence CS  stated  that  her  house  is  very  full  and  the
    Applicant shares a bedroom with CS's granddaughter who is  aged  6.  CS
    travels every year or so to Nigeria and has when there  tried  to  look
    for the Appellant's husband so that he can help support her.  It  is  a
    sensitive issue and she has not told the Appellant this.

The Evidence of PT

31.  PT's evidence is contained in his witness statement of 3 May  2017  and
    can be summarised.   He  is  fully  aware  of  the  Appellant's  health
    condition and the network of friends and family that she has who  rally
    around her to give her son, DB, help as he is at a crucial time as  far
    as his studies are concerned.  PT has been  driving  her  to  and  from
    hospital appointments whenever the need arises when neither DB  nor  LB
    are available to help.  The Appellant no  longer  has  family  ties  in
    Nigeria.  PT refers to the Nigerian President having to travel  to  the
    UK to receive medical treatment and care for problems that are  not  as
    serious as heart disease.

The Evidence of LB

32.  LB's evidence is contained in his witness statement of 26 January  2015
    and can be summarised.  He is an Irish national and he  has  known  the
    Appellant for around five years and is a good friend of  her  son,  DB.
    They live together.  The Appellant is like a second mother and they are
    close.  DB is the main person who cares for her but LB looks after  her
    when necessary and he is more than happy to do so.  He takes  her  food
    when she is too unwell to get out of bed  and  he  accompanies  her  to
    doctors' appointments.

Submissions

33.  The Respondent's case is that there is no  evidence  that  ICD  devices
    are unavailable in the whole of Nigeria and the burden of  proof  rests
    on the Appellant. There is nothing before the Tribunal by way of recent
    medical reports that specifically state that  the  Appellant  would  be
    unable to travel to Nigeria by plane.  There may be  references  to  it
    being inadvisable but nothing that suggests it would be  impossible  or
    life-threatening.  There  is  nothing  to  show  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant from the UK will lead to a breach of Article 3 and  there  is
    nothing to show that the Appellant is dying or  close  to  death.   The
    Respondent relies on N [2005] UKHL 31 (affirmed  by  ECHR  in  N  v  UK
    [2008] 47 EHRR 3931) and GS (India) & Ors v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  40.
    It is argued that these are domestic authorities that remain  good  law
    and reference is made to Lord Justice Laws in GS  confirming  the  very
    high  threshold  required  under  Article  3  stating   that   in   the
    "exceptional" class of case referred to in the authorities is "confined
    to deathbed cases" (paragraph 66).

34.      In respect of Paposhvili v Belgium  (Application  No  41738/10,  13
    December 2016) ("P").   The judgment is not binding on the  UK  courts,
    but in any event, the Applicant in that  case  died  during  litigation
    suggesting that his case may well have fallen  within  the  exceptional
    class of case envisaged.  The court emphasised in P that it is  not  an
    obligation for the returning state to alleviate the disparities between
    healthcare systems and it restates the  key  principles  applicable  in
    these cases.  The decision in P turned on the  fact  that  the  Belgium
    authorities had failed to carry out any assessment of the  risk  facing
    the applicant in light of  the  information  concerning  his  state  of
    health and the existence  of  appropriate  treatment  in  Georgia  (see
    paragraph 205).  The Respondent submits that this is not  the  case  in
    this appeal because an assessment has indeed been carried out.

35.  There is no medical document  which  makes  reference  to  DB  being  a
    carer.  There is nothing preventing support to continue  from  overseas
    through remittances and contact via the modern means of  communication.
    The ongoing treatment the Appellant is receiving is at  public  expense
    and  this  should  be  weighed  against  her  in  the   assessment   of
    proportionality.

36.  The Appellant's skeleton argument relies on P  which,  it  is  advanced
    clarified the correct approach where an Article 3 claim  is  argued  on
    medical grounds.  The approach in N v UK that death must be imminent or
    in case BA, a very exceptional one, was reaffirmed in P and  the  court
    went on to provide guidance on the meaning  of  "very  exceptional"  at
    paragraph 183.  The court also set out principles that apply  in  these
    kinds of cases.   P is a judgment of the ECtHR.  It  does  not  legally
    bind the Tribunal; however, the Tribunal is required by Section 2(1)(a)
    of the Human Rights Act 1998 to take it into account.   There  is  good
    reason for treating it as highly  persuasive  and  is  consistent  with
    domestic jurisprudence.  The court provided guidance as to the  meaning
    of other very exceptional cases and approved the judgment in N.

37.   The  Appellant's  evidence  establishes  that  there  are  substantial
    grounds to believe that if she is  removed  to  Nigeria  she  would  be
    exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in  her  health,
    leading to intensive suffering or to a significant  reduction  in  life
    expectancy. In respect of flying the Appellant  relies  on  the  letter
    from Dr Travill dated 19 November 2014  the  letter  "To  Whom  It  May
    Concern" from Lea Valley Medical Group dated 27  August  2014  and  the
    letter from Dr Merinopoulos of 18 June 2015.

38.       Reliance is also placed on the letter  from  the  Federal  Medical
    Centre of 12 September 2014 and  the  extract  from  a  research  paper
    summarising the widespread  problem  of  fake  drugs  in  Nigeria.   In
    addition, reference is  made  to  the  article  from  www.howafrica.com
    mentioning  the  absence  of  defibrillators  and  an  effective  first
    responder service in Nigeria.

39.  Ms Ravill referred me to the OGN of 2013. Neither party had a  copy  of
    this, but her submission was that it is clear from  the  document  that
    the position has not changed since  the  Danish  Fact  Finding  Mission
    report in 2008. The Appellant has  established  any  evidential  burden
    that is on her in accordance with P and the burden then shifts  to  the
    Respondent to show that sufficient medical treatment  is  available  to
    the Appellant in Nigeria to prevent a breach of Article 3 and that  she
    will be able to access it in practice. The  Respondent  has  failed  to
    discharge this burden by failing to  adduce  evidence  of  whether  the
    Appellant's condition can be effectively treated and her ICD  supported
    in Nigeria, or if whether the risks from the long-haul  flight  can  be
    eliminated.  The necessary treatment includes medication, monitoring of
    the Appellant's ICD and regular check-ups for the  rest  of  her  life.
    Even if the appropriate treatment exists  in  Nigeria  it  is  doubtful
    whether the Appellant could afford to pay for it  given  her  age,  her
    inability to work and the absence of family support  in  Nigeria.   The
    Respondent has not obtained assurances from the Nigerian state.

40.  In relation to Article 8  reliance  is  placed  upon  the  case  of  MM
    (Lebanon) & Ors v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10 in that  the  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules are only the starting point for  consideration  under
    the Convention.  The Appellant relies on  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  and
    the SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, Sales LJ at paragraph 14.

41.  It is possible for a  claim  regarding  medical  treatment  to  succeed
    under Article 8 even when it would  not  do  so  under  Article  3  and
    reliance is placed on MM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  279  which
    was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in GS (India).  Respect  to  family
    life, the case of Singh & Anor v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74  is  relied
    upon.

42.  The Appellant enjoys a private life in the UK and family life with  her
    son who cares for her and supports  her  financially,  practically  and
    emotionally, and has done for more than twelve years.  There  would  be
    an  interference  with  her  family/private  life.   There   are   very
    significant obstacles  to  the  Appellant's  integration  into  Nigeria
    because of the absence and unaffordability  of  appropriate  treatment,
    the absence of support for her ICD, the lack of family  in  Nigeria  to
    provide emotional and practical support, the Appellant's  inability  to
    work  in  order  to  support  herself  financially,  the   absence   of
    accommodation available to her on return, her limited  mobility,  which
    would  restrict  her  ability  to  access  medical  treatment  and   to
    participate in society and  the  risks  to  her  health  of  flying  to
    Nigeria.

43.  In the alternative the Appellant's removal would  be  disproportionate.
    The extent of her emotional and practical dependency on others and  the
    severity of her medical condition and  the  complex  and  sophisticated
    nature of her treatment lend her  private  life  a  special  compelling
    character that justifies  departure  from  the  normative  guidance  in
    Section 117B (4) and (5) (Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803).   Great
    weight should be attached to the Appellant's family life with  her  son
    and the relationship could not be replicated  in  Nigeria  because  the
    Appellant has no family there and would be isolated.   The  quality  of
    her life would be seriously diminished without her son's presence.  The
    Appellant is not financially independent but she is fully supported  by
    friends and family and is therefore unlikely  to  become  a  burden  on
    public funds.

P

44.  The salient paragraphs of P are as follows: -

         "183.    The Court  considers  that  the  'other  very  exceptional
                cases' within the meaning of  the  judgment  in  N.  v.  the
                United Kingdom (ï¿½ 43) which may raise an issue under Article
                3 should be understood to refer to situations involving  the
                removal of a  seriously  ill  person  in  which  substantial
                grounds have been  shown  for  believing  that  he  or  she,
                although not at imminent risk of dying, would  face  a  real
                risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in
                the  receiving  country  or  the  lack  of  access  to  such
                treatment,  of  being  exposed  to  a  serious,  rapid   and
                irreversible decline in his or her state of health resulting
                in intense suffering or to a significant reduction  in  life
                expectancy. The  Court  points  out  that  these  situations
                correspond to  a  high  threshold  for  the  application  of
                Article 3 of the Convention in cases concerning the  removal
                of aliens suffering from serious illness.


         184. As to whether the above conditions are satisfied  in  a  given
                situation, the Court observes that in  cases  involving  the
                expulsion of aliens, the Court does not itself  examine  the
                applications for  international  protection  or  verify  how
                States control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens.
                  By virtue of Article  1  of  the  Convention  the  primary
                responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed
                rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities, who
                are thus required to examine the applicants'  fears  and  to
                assess the risks they would face if removed to the receiving
                country, from the standpoint of Article 3. The machinery  of
                complaint to the Court is  subsidiary  to  national  systems
                safeguarding human  rights.  This  subsidiary  character  is
                articulated in  Article  13  and  Article  35  ï¿½  1  of  the
                Convention (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece,  cited  above,
                ï¿½ï¿½ 286-87, and F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, ï¿½ï¿½ 117-18).


         185.  Accordingly,  in  cases  of  this  kind,   the   authorities'
                obligation under Article 3 to protect the integrity  of  the
                persons concerned is fulfilled primarily through appropriate
                procedures allowing such examination to be carried out (see,
                mutatis mutandis, El-Masri v. the former  Yugoslav  Republic
                of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, ï¿½ 182, ECHR 2012; Tarakhel,
                cited above, ï¿½ 104; and F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, ï¿½ 117).


         186. In the context of these procedures, it is for  the  applicants
                to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating that  there  are
                substantial grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the  measure
                complained of were to be implemented, they would be  exposed
                to a real risk of being subjected to treatment  contrary  to
                Article 3 (see Saadi,  cited  above,  ï¿½  129,  and  F.G.  v.
                Sweden, cited above, ï¿½ 120). In this connection it should be
                observed that a certain degree of speculation is inherent in
                the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that  it  is  not  a
                matter of requiring the persons concerned to  provide  clear
                proof  of  their  claim  that  they  would  be  exposed   to
                proscribed  treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi   v.
                Belgium, no. 140/10, ï¿½ 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).


         187. Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the  authorities  of
                the returning State, in the context of domestic  procedures,
                to dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited above, ï¿½
                129, and F.G. v. Sweden,  cited  above,  ï¿½  120).  The  risk
                alleged must be subjected  to  close  scrutiny  (see  Saadi,
                cited above, ï¿½ 128; Sufi and Elmi  v.  the  United  Kingdom,
                nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, ï¿½ 214, 28 June 2011; Hirsi  Jamaa
                and Others, cited above, ï¿½ 116; and Tarakhel, cited above, ï¿½
                104) in the course of which the authorities in the returning
                State must consider the foreseeable consequences of  removal
                for the individual concerned in the receiving State, in  the
                light of the general situation there  and  the  individual's
                personal circumstances (see  Vilvarajah  and  Others,  cited
                above, ï¿½ 108; El-Masri, cited above, ï¿½  213;  and  Tarakhel,
                cited above, ï¿½ 105). The assessment of the risk  as  defined
                above (see  paragraphs  183-84)  must  therefore  take  into
                consideration general sources such as reports of  the  World
                Health  Organisation  or   of   reputable   non-governmental
                organisations and the medical  certificates  concerning  the
                person in question.


         188. As the Court has observed above (see paragraph 173),  what  is
                in issue here is  the  negative  obligation  not  to  expose
                persons to a risk of ill-treatment proscribed by Article  3.
                It  follows  that  the  impact  of  removal  on  the  person
                concerned must be assessed by comparing his or her state  of
                health prior to  removal  and  how  it  would  evolve  after
                transfer to the receiving State.


         189. As regards the factors to be  taken  into  consideration,  the
                authorities in the returning State must verify on a case-by-
                case basis whether  the  care  generally  available  in  the
                receiving State is sufficient and  appropriate  in  practice
                for the treatment  of  the  applicant's  illness  so  as  to
                prevent him or her being exposed to  treatment  contrary  to
                Article 3 (see paragraph 183 above). The  benchmark  is  not
                the level of care existing in the returning State; it is not
                a question of ascertaining whether the care in the receiving
                State would be equivalent or inferior to  that  provided  by
                the health-care system in the returning  State.  Nor  is  it
                possible to  derive  from  Article  3  a  right  to  receive
                specific treatment in  the  receiving  State  which  is  not
                available to the rest of the population.


         190. The authorities must also consider the  extent  to  which  the
                individual in question will actually  have  access  to  this
                care and these facilities in the receiving State. The  Court
                observes in that regard that it  has  previously  questioned
                the accessibility of care (see Aswat, cited above, ï¿½ 55, and
                Tatar, cited above, ï¿½ï¿½ 47-49) and referred to  the  need  to
                consider the cost of medication and treatment, the existence
                of a social and family  network,  and  the  distance  to  be
                travelled in order to have access to the required care  (see
                Karagoz v. France (dec.), no. 47531/99, 15 November 2001; N.
                v. the United Kingdom, cited a15 May 2017. bove,  ï¿½ï¿½  34-41,
                and the references cited therein; and E.O. v. Italy  (dec.),
                cited above).


         191. Where, after  the  relevant  information  has  been  examined,
                serious doubts persist regarding the impact  of  removal  on
                the persons concerned - on account of the general  situation
                in the receiving country and/or their individual situation -
                the returning State must obtain  individual  and  sufficient
                assurances from the receiving State, as a  precondition  for
                removal, that appropriate treatment will  be  available  and
                accessible to the persons concerned so that they do not find
                themselves in a situation contrary  to  Article  3  (on  the
                subject of individual assurances, see Tarakhel, cited above,
                ï¿½ 120)."


Findings and Reasons

45.  I did not find that the Appellant, DB or CS  were  credible  about  the
    Appellant's connections in Nigeria. I find that there were  aspects  of
    their evidence that was exaggerated and they have not been candid.  The
    Appellant's evidence was that she had noone left in  Nigeria  and  that
    she has not seen her husband since she  left  and  he  has  effectively
    abandoned her. However, her evidence and that of DB was wholly  lacking
    in detail  about  this  significant  event.   I  found  it  lacking  in
    credibility that both the Appellant and her son have not  attempted  to
    locate him and again on this issue the evidence was vague. The  general
    tenor of the evidence is that the  husband  and  father  abandoned  his
    family, but the evidence is  more  in  keeping  with  a  disappearance.
    However, there was no evidence that the Appellant or DB  had  attempted
    to contact members of his family to locate him. There was  no  evidence
    of a marriage breakdown  leading  up  to  abandonment.   The  Appellant
    failed to provide a sufficiently detailed and clear account of what had
    happened. I find that DB was vague about with  whom  his  mother  lived
    before she came here and contact with his father generally.

46.    On the second day of the hearing CS gave evidence about how  she  had
    attempted to locate the Appellant's husband, but I am  sceptical  about
    this. I realise that the issue  may  understandably  be  sensitive  and
    difficult to raise with the Appellant, but it is not credible  that  CS
    would not only fail to disclose this information to  the  Appellant  at
    the time, but has continued to do  so  until  giving  evidence  at  the
    hearing on 21 June, as she claimed. There is no reference to it in  her
    witness statement of 15 May 2017. I conclude, considering the  evidence
    in the round that CS was trying to fill  in  the  obvious  gap  in  the
    Appellant's evidence which was exposed in cross examination.

47.      DB in his  statement  made  no  reference  to  having  returned  to
    Nigeria and the Appellant stated that she could not remember DB  having
    returned to Nigeria.  However, when he was  cross-examined,  it  became
    clear that he had returned to Nigeria on several occasions between 2009
    and 2013 to perform music.  In my  view,  the  Appellant  intentionally
    failed to provide this evidence to the Tribunal to attempt to  distance
    herself from connections there  and  DB  had  intentionally  failed  to
    mention it in his witness statement for the same reasons.  I reach  the
    unavoidable conclusion that DB and the Appellant have family in Nigeria
    including the Appellant's husband and connections generally.

48.      The  evidence  was  at  best  vague  in  relation  to  funds.   The
    Appellant's evidence is that she relies on her son, friends and  family
    here and abroad (she has  siblings  in  the  USA).  DB's  evidence  was
    ambiguous because it is not sufficiently explained how he has been able
    to look after himself and his mother since she came here. He has a debt
    of ï¿½20,000 from his studies here. There was  very  little  evidence  of
    employment and it seems that he has mainly been  a  student  since  her
    arrival. The Appellant is now accommodated by CS and CS's  evidence  is
    that she sometimes helps the Appellant buy  medication.  The  Appellant
    has been here 12 years and there is no cogent evidence before me  which
    would explain how she has managed to maintain herself  throughout  this
    period.  In the light of the insufficient and generally vague  evidence
    in respect of funding and contacts in Nigeria, the reasonable inference
    to be drawn is that the Appellant's family in Nigeria, is at  least  in
    part, supporting her financially and could continue to do so. I do  not
    accept PT''s assertion that the  Appellant  does  not  have  family  in
    Nigeria. He may well believe this to be the case, but  considering  the
    evidence as a whole, I do not find this statement  accurately  reflects
    the position.  He did not give oral evidence.

49.      The Appellant and her son do not live together. The evidence of  LB
    represents the situation in 2015. I accept that BD  and  the  Appellant
    have lived together lived together, but he is not and has not been  her
    primary carer. When they were living together, he spent a  considerable
    period of time in Manchester, whilst she remained in Luton. There was a
    third person living in the house, LB, who would help the Appellant.  In
    my view, it is more likely that the present living arrangement has come
    about because DB wished to continue his studies and live  independently
    in the knowledge that his mother could rely on a number  of  people  to
    help her. He is only one part of the network that is available  to  her
    here.  I find that it is more likely than not that the Appellant  moved
    in to live with CS because she has nowhere else to live whilst here and
    not because she needs someone to care for her.  I accept that CS  helps
    the Appellant, as do others, but I do not  accept  that  the  Appellant
    needs a "carer" and that she could not  live  independently  with  some
    reliance on friends and or family for lifts to the hospital and certain
    household chores. I was not referred to any medical evidence to support
    the need for a live in carer.

50.      Whilst I do not doubt that DB is employable and  has  been  offered
    work in completion of his course, I do not  accept  that  the  evidence
    establishes that it is reasonably likely that he and  his  mother  will
    resume living together. I accept that they are close and see each other
    often, but they have not lived together since March 2016. The  evidence
    does not show financial dependency or that the Appellant depends on  DB
    to care for her.  I  have  considered  the  evidence  in  BD's  witness
    statement of 26 January 2015, in  which  he  asserts  that  he  is  his
    mother's  primary  carer,  but  this  evidence  was  an   exaggeration,
    considering that he did not live with his mother all week, but spent at
    that time part of  the  week  in  Manchester.  In  addition  there  was
    evidence before me of DB travelling to Nigeria and India. The Appellant
    and BD have embellished their evidence about their relationship and the
    level of dependency and care given by DB. However, I  accept  that  the
    Appellant is vulnerable because of health problems. I accept  that  the
    Appellant has some mobility issues and relies to some extent on  family
    (at times her son) generally to help her, but I do not accept that  her
    every day care needs are such that she cannot live independently.   She
    has failed to establish that she would not have the level of  care  she
    requires from family and friends in Nigeria.  I have taken into account
    all of the evidence from friends and family in the AB.



Article 3

51.  I accept Ms Revill's submission there is good reason for treating P  as
    highly persuasive and, in any event, it is  consistent  with  N  [2005]
    UKHL 31 (affirmed by ECHR in N v UK [2008] 47 EHRR 3931), in so far  at
    it seeks to explain the "other very exceptional cases."

52.  Ms Revill submitted that the Appellant has adduced evidence capable  of
    demonstrating that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that
    removal would expose her to risk, but  I  do  not  accept  this.  If  P
    establishes that there is an evidential  burden  of  any  kind  on  the
    Appellant (which once discharged shifts to the  Respondent),  this  has
    not been discharged; notwithstanding,  a  certain  degree  of  inherent
    speculation.

53.  The Appellant suffers from serious health  conditions.   She  has  non-
    ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney  disease,  asthma  and
    musculoskeletal problems.  She has  been  fitted  with  an  implantable
    cardiac defibrillator (ICD) which kick-starts her heart  and  which  is
    connected to a home monitor and provides daily online updates as to her
    condition.  It is beyond doubt that she receives a considerable  amount
    of treatment and monitoring whilst she is here.  She sees a  consultant
    cardiologist at least every three months and her ICD is monitored.  The
    evidence  before  me  does  not  establish  that  there  has  been  any
    significant  deterioration  in  the  Appellant's  condition   and   her
    condition is monitored  and  her  condition  stable.   It  is  not  the
    Appellant's case that she is at imminent risk of dying  should  she  be
    removed, but that her case is an exceptional case.

54.  In respect of a risk arising from flying, the most up-to-date  evidence
    relied on is the letter of 18 June 2015 from Dr I Merinopoulos in which
    he gives an account  of  Dr  Travill's  opinion.   Dr  Travill  is  the
    Appellant's consultant and he strongly advises against travel.  Set out
    in this letter is the  worst-case  scenario  and  the  conclusions  are
    conditional on the absence of  appropriate  facilities  to  manage  the
    Appellant's ICD and the possibility of the device not being able to  be
    monitored in Nigeria. The doctor is  also  concerned  about  unexpected
    problems  and   the   absence   of   medical   expertise.    From   the
    correspondence, it is clear that Dr Travill is not concerned with  risk
    on a long-haul flight to Nigeria, but he is giving  his  opinion  about
    the possibility of the lack of facilities and medical care in Nigeria.

55.  The evidence from Dr George (Lea Vale Medical Group)  is  almost  three
    years out of date and, in any event, the assertion that  the  Appellant
    would be "unsuitable...... to take long distance travel and  especially
    air travel" is inadequately expanded upon and  does  not  go  close  to
    establishing an Article 3 risk.  The Appellant relies on a letter  from
    Dr Kumar of 7 August 2008, which reflects the position almost a  decade
    ago and before the ICD was fitted. This states that the Appellant is at
    "higher risk of developing symptomatic heart failure at high altitude,"
    but goes on to state that if the journey is essential  and  unavoidable
    she would recommend that she informs the details of her illness to  the
    flight authorities so that if necessary she might be able to  get  some
    oxygen supplements." I have considered the  evidence  produced  by  the
    Respondent which, on the  face  of  it,  establishes  that  the  33,000
    patients with ICDs are not at risk per se as a result of  the  ICD  but
    the  nature  and  stability  of  the  underlying  condition   (in   the
    Appellant's case cardiomyopathy) requires careful consideration and may
    be of greater significance than the presence of the device, although it
    is noted that the majority of patients with  an  implanted  device  may
    travel safely. There is no evidence to  suggest  that  the  Appellant's
    condition is  not  stable.   Taking  all  of  this  into  account,  the
    Appellant has not adduced evidence  capable  of  demonstrating  a  risk
    under Article 3.

56.  Once returned to Nigeria it is  beyond  doubt  that  there  will  be  a
    change in  the  Appellant's  treatment  and  it  is  certain  that  the
    treatment she will receive in Nigeria will be inferior to that which is
    available to her here.  However, whilst I appreciate that  it  is  very
    disappointing that the Respondent has failed  to  produce  up  to  date
    evidence, the evidence produced by the Appellant  is  woefully  out  of
    date and inadequate. It may well have been the case that in  2008  that
    treatment was inadequate, but this evidence is almost a decade  out  of
    date. Ms Revill argues the position has not changed and seeks  to  rely
    on the 2013 OGN. This is four years out of  date;  however,  I  do  not
    accept that the reference to a COI, establishes that it  is  reasonably
    likely that the 2013 report is confirming  the  position  in  the  2008
    Danish  Immigration  Service  Report.  The  argument  is  tenuous.  The
    interview  with  a  Nigerian  US  based  cardiologist  is  undated  and
    ambiguous. The letter from Dr Ndom relates to one hospital in  Nasarawa
    state. The evidence has little if any evidential value in terms of what
    treatment is available in 2017.

57.  The background evidence is out of date and inadequate  not  capable  of
    demonstrating that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that
    there is no treatment available in Nigeria  to  treat  the  Appellant's
    condition. In respect of access to treatment, if it is  available  only
    at a cost, having found it reasonably likely that the Appellant  has  a
    source of income from Nigeria, and in the  light  of  her  evidence  of
    support from family and friends here (which could  continue),  she  has
    not established that treatment would not be  available  to  her.   BD's
    evidence  is  that  he  has  employment  here  to  commence  after  the
    completion of his course. His evidence was that he would then repay the
    debt to the NHS. He is not liable for the debt as it  was  incurred  by
    his mother and he could use his salary instead to support his  mother's
    treatment in Nigeria. I accept that whilst  in  the  UK  the  Appellant
    depends on a  certain  level  of  help  in  the  home  and  to  get  to
    appointments. Having found  that  it  is  reasonably  likely  that  the
    Appellant has a support network in Nigeria, this will facilitate access
    to treatment.  Whilst I accept that there may be a problem (or at least
    there was in 2007 -2008 which is the date of the evidence relied on  by
    the Appellant) with fake  drugs  in  Nigeria,  the  evidence  does  not
    establish that in 2017 the problem is such as to put the  Appellant  at
    risk.

58.  The Appellant has wholly failed to produce  any  relevant  up  to  date
    evidence relating to  the  availability  and  access  to  treatment  in
    Nigeria  capable of demonstrating risk under Article 3.  The  Appellant
    has not established that she faces a real risk, because of the  absence
    of appropriate treatment in Nigeria or  the  lack  of  access  to  such
    treatment, of being  exposed  to  a  serious,  rapid  and  irreversible
    decline in her state of health resulting in intense suffering or  to  a
    significant reduction in life expectancy.  For all  the  above  reasons
    the appeal is dismissed on Article 3 grounds.

Article 8

59.  The Appellant has not established that there would be very  significant
    obstacles to integration. Having considered  the  judgement  in  Kamara
    [2016] EWCA Civ 813 regarding very significant obstacles I take account
    what LJ Sales stated at para 14:-

     "In my view, the concept of a  foreign  criminal's  'integration'  into
         the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as set out
         in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad one. It is not
         confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain life while
         living in the other country. It is not  appropriate  to  treat  the
         statutory language as subject to some gloss and it will usually  be
         sufficient for a court or tribunal simply to direct itself  in  the
         terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of  'integration'
         calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether  the
         individual will be enough of an insider in terms  of  understanding
         how life in the society in that other country is carried on  and  a
         capacity  to  participate  in  it,  so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
         opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-
         day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable  time
         a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to   the
         individual's private or family life".


60.  The Appellant has been here for 12 years. I conclude  that  she  has  a
    support network in Nigeria. Her son returned there as recently at  2013
    and her close friend CS makes annual visits there. I do not accept  her
    evidence in respect of her husband  or  lack  of  contacts  in  Nigeria
    generally. There is no evidence that she would be  an  outsider  there.
    Whilst she has a number of health problems, they would not prevent  her
    from having a private life there where treatment will be  available  to
    her and she will be able to access it.  The Respondent does not  accept
    that there are very significant obstacles, but in any event, relies  on
    paragraph 322 (12) of the Rules, in respect of the outstanding debt  to
    the NHS. The Respondent asserts that the Appellant fails  to  meet  the
    suitability requirements of the Rules for the same reason.  Whilst  the
    Appellant falls for refusal under the  suitability  rules,  it  is  not
    material because she does not meet the requirements of 276ADE (1)  (vi)
    in any event. The Respondent has not exercised  discretion  under  para
    322 (12) and I make no decision in relation to this. It is not material
    to the outcome in this case. It is a matter for the  Respondent  should
    she wish to make a decision under para 322 (12).

61.  The Appellant and her son have not been straight forward  and  are  not
    credible concerning parts of  their  evidence.  However,  there  is  an
    element of dependency over and above the normal ties between mother and
    adult child, but not close to the extent claimed by the Appellant.  The
    Appellant  has  a  family  and  private  life  here  and  the  decision
    interferes with it. The decision ultimately turns  on  proportionality.
    The maintenance of effective  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest.  This Appellant is an overstayer  and,  whilst  I  sympathise
    with her, she is nevertheless a burden on taxpayers.

62.  In terms of the weight  to  be  given  to  her  private  life,  I  have
    considered that she has been in very poor health since she arrived here
    and I have attached more than a little weight to her private life,  but
    I also attach weight to the fact that  she  is  an  overstayer.  It  is
    material to  the  proportionality  assessment  that  she  will  receive
    inferior treatment when in Nigeria and  life  generally  will  be  more
    difficult for her; however, she has failed to produce  cogent  evidence
    which establishes the level of care in Nigeria and how it would compare
    to that she now receives and  the  implications  of  this.  However,  I
    accept it will not be to the standard  she  has  become  accustomed  to
    here.

63.  The Appellant is a lady with significant health problems with a  degree
    of vulnerability because, to  a  certain  extent,  she  is  reliant  on
    friends and family here.  Removal will be difficult and distressing for
    both the Appellant and her son and I have attached  significant  weight
    to the interference to their relationship, but I reject that she is  as
    dependant on him as claimed.  They have a  close  relationship  and  he
    helps her when he is in Luton, but they do not live together. I do  not
    accept that this is only temporary.  It is clear from the evidence that
    CS and BD are mobile and travel to Nigeria. The Appellant will  not  be
    wholly isolated from her friends and family here.  As an overstayer she
    has benefited from having a pacemaker fitted and medical treatment here
    over the 12 year period that she has been here. Significantly  in  this
    case I have rejected the evidence in  respect  of  the  life  she  will
    return to in Nigeria  in  terms  of  health  care  and  family  support
    available to her. I find that treatment is available and she will  have
    access to it. The decision will interfere with her family life with her
    son, but I find that she has family in Nigeria with  whom  family  life
    can be resumed. Removal is in the public interest.  The scales  tip  in
    favour of the Respondent and I conclude that removal is proportionate.

Application to Admit Post Hearing Evidence

64.  A day after the hearing, when I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, Mr Melvin forwarded to the UT, for  my  attention,  a  letter
    detailing unsuccessful applications made by members of the  Appellant's
    family. There is  evidence,  according  to  the  Respondent,  that  the
    Appellant entered the UK in 2005 with two other  sons  (two  more  sons
    made applications at this time and they were refused) and  their  human
    rights application was refused in 2008;  however,  they  remained  here
    without leave. One  of  them  made  a  human  rights  claim  which  was
    certified in 2016. He has since made further representations which  are
    under consideration. The other son made an asylum claim which is  under
    consideration. The Appellant's husband entered the UK as a  visitor  in
    2007 and was arrested for driving offences in 2008. Nothing  was  heard
    from him until he made an application for a visit visa  in  2014  which
    was refused. The Respondent seeks to admit this evidence.

65.  It is astounding that the Respondent has  not  produced  this  evidence
    earlier considering there have been to date three appeal  hearings  and
    it has always been an issue whether the Appellant  has  connections  in
    Nigeria. There is no  good  reason  advanced  that  explains  why  this
    evidence was not served in a timely fashion giving  the  Appellant  the
    opportunity to engage with it. The hearing  has  now  concluded  and  I
    refuse the application. The evidence is not admitted and I have had  no
    regard to it.


Notice of Decision

65.  The appeal is dismissed under Article 3 and Article 8.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
