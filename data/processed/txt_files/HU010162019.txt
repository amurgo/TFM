                            DECISION AND REASONS

This has been a remote hearing to which there has  been  no  objection  from
the parties. The form of remote hearing was skype for business.  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The appellant appeals, with permission, against the decision of  the  First-
tier Tribunal  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision
refusing her application for entry clearance under Appendix FM as the  adult
dependant relative of her son, Kevin Lee.

The appellant is a citizen  of  Tanzania  of  Chinese  origin,  born  on  13
November 1946. She applied for entry clearance to the UK on 5 October  2018,
to join her son in the UK. Her application was refused on 20  December  2018
on the basis that she had not  provided  any  documentation  to  demonstrate
that she required long-term  care  to  carry  out  every  day  personal  and
household tasks and that,  as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or  disability,
required a level of long-term personal care that could only be  provided  in
the UK by her relative there and  without  recourse  to  public  funds.  The
respondent noted that there was evidence to show  that  there  were  elderly
homes in Tanzania and considered that the appellant's son could pay for  her
medical treatment as well as for a place where she would receive  assistance
with her daily care in Tanzania.

The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision and her appeal  was
heard in the First-tier Tribunal on 3 September 2019 by First-tier  Tribunal
Judge O'Garro. The sponsor, the appellant's son, appeared before  the  judge
and gave oral evidence. He confirmed that his mother was a widow,  that  his
father died in 2003, and that he was an only child. He had  lived  with  the
appellant in Tanzania from 1994 to 1998 and had  then  come  to  the  UK  to
study. He had completed his studies and currently managed  his  own  company
as a software engineer and he sent the appellant money for her upkeep,  �500
a month. He was married with two children who attended  nursery  school.  He
had last visited the  appellant  in  2005.  The  appellant  had  an  ongoing
dispute in Tanzania about land and property she owned there,  which  started
in 2006, and had revealed a lot of  corruption  among  government  officials
and local businessmen, which  had  resulted  in  her  being  threatened  and
attacked. He also  feared  being  attacked  or  kidnapped  and  so  had  not
returned to Tanzania since 2005. The sponsor  said  that  he  spoke  to  the
appellant once or twice a week and she would tell  him  about  her  ailments
and her struggles to do shopping  and  cooking.  He  had  had  a  cousin  in
Tanzania who, together with his  wife,  had  helped  to  take  care  of  his
mother, by shopping and cooking and taking  her  to  hospital  appointments,
but they had then moved to Sweden in 2017. His mother's landlord  had  found
a young girl to assist his mother but  that  was  a  temporary  arrangement.
There was no-one in Tanzania to support  her  and  his  attempts  to  employ
someone to look after her had been unsuccessful. There  were  friends  there
who would check on her, but on one to provide her with the care and  support
she needed.

The judge found that the medical evidence provided  by  the  appellant  with
her application did not meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the
immigration rules. There was nothing to show that the report  from  Dr  Riaz
Ratansi was an independent report, as required by paragraph 34  of  Appendix
FM-SE. The letter provided from Dr  Naftali  B  Ng'ondi  on  behalf  of  the
Ministry of  Health  Permanent  Secretary  of  Tanzania  did  not  meet  the
evidential requirements in  paragraph  35  as  it  did  not  show  that  the
appellant was unable, even with the practical  and  financial  help  of  the
sponsor, to obtain the required  level  of  care  needed  in  Tanzania.  The
appellant therefore did not meet the  burden  of  proof  to  show  that  the
requirements  of  paragraph  E-ECDR  of  Appendix  FM  were  met.   As   for
'exceptional circumstances' under GEN.3.1 and 3.2 of Appendix FM, the  judge
did not accept that the appellant had established that she had  family  life
with her son and found, in any event, that her circumstances  did  not  come
close to being exceptional. The judge considered that  the  evidence  showed
that the appellant was mobile, that there was some security at her place  of
residence, that she was able to access medicines for her ailments  and  that
it was not shown that  she  required  long-term  personal  care.  The  judge
considered that the appellant  could  obtain  a  reasonably  good  level  of
personal and professional care and assistance with the financial  assistance
of her son and rejected the claim that there were no individuals  to  assist
for payment. The judge, relying on the case  of  Ribeli  v  Entry  Clearance
Officer, Pretoria [2018] EWCA Civ 611, considered  that  there  was  also  a
choice and the sponsor and his family could relocate  to  Tanzania  to  care
for the appellant. The judge found that the respondent's  decision  was  not
disproportionate and she accordingly dismissed the appeal.

The appellant sought permission to appeal Judge O'Garro's  decision  to  the
Upper Tribunal on the following grounds: that she  had  failed  to  consider
all the evidence in the assessment of the  appellant's  care  needs  and  to
provide adequate reasons for rejecting  that  evidence,  including  evidence
that the appellant had sustained a fracture  to  her  arm  and  head  injury
during an assault in 2017 and had been  found  collapsed  in  her  home  and
unable to move in May 2019; that she had failed to make findings on  whether
care abroad was  affordable;  that  she  had  failed  to  reach  sustainable
conclusions on the existence of family life; and  that  she  had  failed  to
take account of all material matters in assessing whether the sponsor  could
care for the appellant abroad.

Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier Tribunal on  26  February
2020 and the matter then came before me.

Hearing and submissions

As a preliminary matter, Ms Harper  sought  to  rely  upon  recent  evidence
showing the appellant's much deteriorated state  of  health.  She  submitted
that that evidence was admissible in considering the error of law matter  as
it showed the  significance  and  materiality  of  the  judge's  failure  to
consider the case before her about  the  deterioration  in  the  appellant's
health.  Ms Cunha objected to the evidence being admitted as  irrelevant  to
the error of law, since it was evidence which had not been before the First-
tier Tribunal. I made it clear that I would  not  take  that  evidence  into
account  in  considering  a  challenge  to  the  judge's  findings  on   the
appellant's state of health, as it  post-dated  her  decision,  but  that  I
would hear submissions about the deterioration in the appellant's health  at
the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing and  consider  the  evidence  on
that very limited basis.

Ms Harper submitted that the first ground was the judge's  failure  to  take
account of all the evidence or her failure to  provide  proper  reasons  for
rejecting the  evidence.  The  judge  failed  to  consider  the  appellant's
injuries and difficulties arising from her falls and  from  being  assaulted
and failed to consider the evidence about her being found collapsed  in  her
house in May 2019. The evidence before the judge was  that  the  appellant's
condition was deteriorating and  the  new  evidence  showed  that  that  was
correct as she currently suffered from dementia and  could  not  look  after
herself. Therefore, there were aspects of the appellant's  care  which  were
not addressed in the judge's decision. The second  ground  was  the  judge's
failure to consider whether the provision of care  was  affordable  for  the
sponsor. The judge made no findings at all whether the sponsor could  afford
to employ a domestic carer. The �500 a month which the sponsor sent  covered
the appellant's basic costs and medication and there were no  further  funds
available to employ a domestic carer.  The  third  ground  was  the  judge's
failure to make sustainable  findings  on  whether  there  was  family  life
between the appellant and the sponsor and her failure  to  take  account  of
relevant factors as set out in ZB (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  for  the
Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 834,  including  the  appellant's  stage  of
life and care needs. The fourth ground  was  the  judge's  failure  to  take
account of material matters when concluding that the sponsor could  relocate
to Tanzania to look after his mother. Such a requirement was unrealistic  as
the sponsor was not a Tanzanian national and could not  work  there  and  he
had a wife and two British children in the UK. The  appellant's  case  could
not be compared to that of Ribeli and the judge's reliance on that case  was
a material error of law.

Ms Cunha submitted, with regard  to  the  challenge  based  on  the  judge's
failure to consider whether the provision of care  was  affordable  for  the
sponsor, that the judge did not need to go that far  because  the  sponsor's
position was that he was providing sufficient money for her care. The  judge
did not need to take into account future care needs,  but  was  entitled  to
consider that the sponsor was currently financing her care needs.  Ms  Cunha
submitted that the judge was entitled to rely on Ribeli in finding that  the
sponsor had the option of going to Tanzania to look after  his  mother.  The
judge considered all  the  evidence  and  balanced  the  sponsor's  evidence
against the doctor's statement that the sponsor was  mobile.  The  sponsor's
evidence was also that his mother took taxis to get around and do  shopping.
The judge was therefore entitled to find that the appellant could  meet  her
own care needs.

Ms  Harper,  in  response,  submitted   that   the   failure   to   consider
affordability of care was a material failure by the judge.  The  appellant's
collapse in May 2019 gave rise to a certain level  of  care  which  had  not
been fully considered by the judge. The  sponsor's  evidence  was  that  the
money he had been sending to his mother was for her daily needs in terms  of
rent and food, but did not extend to paying for a carer. The judge  did  not
consider the history of the appellant's falls and deterioration.

Discussion and conclusions

Since the decision of Judge O'Garro on 24 September 2019,  further  evidence
has been produced to show the deterioration in the appellant's health.  Some
of that evidence was sent to the Upper  Tribunal  in  October  and  November
2020 and the rest was sent on 11 March 2021 and referred to by Ms Harper  at
the beginning of the hearing. The evidence includes  a  statement  from  the
sponsor dated 8 March 2021 referring to his mother  becoming  seriously  ill
from October 2020, suffering from confusion and  malnutrition  and  evidence
of a further period of hospitalisation in October 2020 and  a  diagnosis  of
senile dementia in addition to her previous conditions.

That is a very different situation to the one before Judge O'Garro  and,  as
I pointed out to Ms Harper at the hearing before me, I  fail  to  understand
why that evidence was not produced  as  part  of  a  fresh  entry  clearance
application rather than as part of this appeal which, at first instance,  is
concerned  only  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings  on  the
evidence before her. It seems to me that that  would  have  been  a  quicker
route and possibly a more cost  effective  one,  in  achieving  the  desired
outcome. As much as I have sympathy for the  appellant  and  sponsor,  given
this development, I  cannot  see  how  that  assists  in  undermining  Judge
O'Garro's decision and I cannot set aside Judge  O'Garro's  decision  simply
on the basis that there is new  evidence  which  may  lead  to  a  different
outcome in the appeal.  That  is  particularly  so  when,  contrary  to  the
assertion in the grounds, Judge O'Garro took account  of  all  the  evidence
available at that time and made full and proper findings on  that  evidence.
Ms Harper submitted that the new evidence was  relevant  in  so  far  as  it
supported  the  claims  made  before  Judge  O'Garro  that  the  appellant's
condition was  deteriorating.  However,  the  judge  was  not  able  to,  or
required to, speculate about the nature or extent of that deterioration  and
about the appellant's future condition, when none  of  the  evidence  before
her provided any specific information or prognosis in that regard.

Indeed,  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was,  in   parts,
inconsistent and ambiguous, as the judge pointed out at  [24]  and  [39]  to
[43].  The  evidence  from  the  sponsor  and  the  accompanying  statements
suggested that his mother required constant  care  and  assistance  yet  the
doctor's letters and other evidence indicated that she was mobile  and  able
to attend to her own personal living needs, as  the  judge  properly  found.
The evidence about access to care was not at all clear, with  some  evidence
such as the letter of 21 June 2018 from Dr Ratansi stating  that  there  was
no social  support  available  for  elderly  people  in  Tanzania,  but  the
somewhat ambiguous letter from Dr Ng'ondi dated 12  September  2018  stating
that there were elderly homes available for the elderly who  had  no  access
to support.

It is asserted in the grounds that the judge erred by  failing  to  consider
the impact of the serious injuries sustained by the appellant  in  accidents
and when assaulted, and the deterioration in  her  condition  when  she  was
found collapsed in her home in May 2019. However, those were  matters  which
the judge took into account. At [39] the judge considered  the  impact  upon
the appellant of a stroke in 2005 and injuries  from  assaults  in  2017  as
referred to in Dr Ratansi's letter and at [41] she considered  the  evidence
of Caroline Maumba who found the appellant lying in bed at her home  in  May
2019. It was not for  the  judge  to  speculate,  without  there  being  any
satisfactory and comprehensive supporting medical evidence,  that  that  was
the start of a decline in the appellant's health to the extent suggested  by
the most recent evidence. That was the point made  by  the  judge  at  [43],
whereby she made her findings within the confines of the evidence  available
to her and was entitled to reach the conclusions that she did.

The grounds also challenge the  judge's  decision  on  the  basis  that  she
failed to consider whether the provision  of  care  for  the  appellant  was
affordable. That  was  the  basis  upon  which  permission  was  essentially
granted. Ms Cunha's submission was that that was  not  a  material  omission
because the appellant's case  did  not  get  that  far  given  the  lack  of
evidence to demonstrate that she required long-term personal care. There  is
indeed some merit in that submission, particularly as the  sponsor's  second
statement, of 21 August 2019, in relation to his  finances  and  ability  to
fund a carer was in the context of funding a qualified  professional  round-
the-clock carer, whereas the judge found that the evidence did  not  suggest
that such a level of care was currently required by the  appellant.  Indeed,
a lack of funds was  not  a  reason  given  by  the  sponsor  in  his  first
statement of 5 October 2018 for  having  difficulty  finding  care  for  his
mother, but rather that he had not been successful  in  finding  a  reliable
carer. His evidence was that he  had  employed  several  carers  previously,
although none had worked out and there was no suggestion  that  he  did  not
have adequate funds for that purpose. The  matter  was  fully  and  properly
considered by the judge at [43] of her decision, with cogent  findings  made
in that regard. Accordingly, I do not consider that ground of  challenge  to
be made out.

 Neither do I find merit in the third ground, which challenges  the  judge's
findings on family life for the purposes of Article 8(1). The judge  clearly
had regard to all relevant matters when considering whether family life  was
established, applying the guidance in Kugathas v Secretary of State for  the
Home  Department  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31  and  having  full  regard  to   the
appellant's circumstances. In any event, as the judge made  clear  at  [38],
she went on to consider proportionality under  Article  8(2)  on  the  basis
that there was an established family life and  gave  detailed  consideration
to the  appellant's  medical  condition  and  living  circumstances  in  her
assessment.

The only ground which I find  to  have  any  merit  is  the  fourth  ground,
whereby I agree with Ms Harper that the judge's findings as to  the  sponsor
having the option to relocate to Tanzania  are  unrealistic  and  failed  to
take account of his family life and other  ties  in  the  UK  and  the  full
impact of such a move. However, it is clear by the brevity of  that  finding
and the way in which the judge expressed herself at [45] and [46] that  that
was a passing observation made in the alternative.  The  judge  had  already
reached a fully and cogently  reasoned  decision  on  proportionality  under
Article 8 prior  to  those  paragraphs  and  accordingly  any  failings  and
omissions in her observations  at  [46]  were  entirely  immaterial  to  the
outcome of her otherwise comprehensive and properly made decision.

In all of the circumstances it seems to me that the judge's  decision  is  a
sound and comprehensive one including a full and careful assessment  of  the
evidence and clear and cogent findings. The evidence before  the  judge  was
unarguably lacking and the conclusions she reached on the  appellant's  case
in the light of that limited evidence were fully and properly open  to  her.
I do not find any material errors of law requiring the decision  to  be  set
aside.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision.  The  decision  to
dismiss the appeal stands.
