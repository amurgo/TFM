                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Chapman,  promulgated  on  7th  April  2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on  19th  March  2015.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Mrs  Thauenthiny  Piratheepan.   The  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who  was  born  on  20th  March
    1983, and she is married to the Sponsor, Mr Ganeshan  Piratheepan,  who
    arrived in the United Kingdom in 1999, and has  subsequently  become  a
    British citizen.  They were married in Sri Lanka on 1st February  2012.
    They lived in Sri Lanka together until 3rd April 2012.   At  that  time
    the Sponsor returned to the UK and this is the last time that they have
    seen each other.  The marriage is a  genuine  and  subsisting  one  and
    there is no question about that.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is for entry clearance to come to  the  UK  as  a
    partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, but this claim  has
    been rejected by the Respondent Secretary of State on  the  basis  that
    the Appellant cannot show that the Sponsor satisfied  the  Rules  which
    required him to be earning  over  �18,600  from  his  two  employments.
    These employments are with Omniserve, where his  income  is  �16,093.25
    and from Sher E Punjab Market Ltd, where  his  income  is  �16,000  per
    annum.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that it was agreed that the issues  in  this  appeal
    were "Fairly narrow, and much of the evidence supporting the appeal was
    documentary, and unchallenged".  The Presenting Officer at the  hearing
    "Did not seek to challenge the evidence of the Sponsor, and I found him
    to be a truthful and credible witness" (paragraph 24).  It was accepted
    before the judge that the Appellant earned �16,093.25  from  Omniserve.
    However, he also maintained that he had a salary from Beacon  where  he
    was paid in cash until November 2013 and that the bank statements  show
    that he started having a salary paid into his account one month earlier
    in October 2013.  The judge observed that "The Sponsor can  demonstrate
    payments from Beacon into his bank account from October  2013  onwards"
    (paragraph 28).  However, the Appellant could not show that he had  the
    requisite salary payments, payslips, and corresponding bank entries for
    a six month period prior to the application, which  was  made  in  June
    2013 (paragraph 29).  Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge then went on to consider the Article 8 aspect of the claim in
    relation to family life, the judge observed that  "The  decision  under
    appeal would have an impact of sufficient  gravity  to  interfere  with
    that family life in a way to potentially engage Article  8"  (paragraph
    35).  However, the decision was in accordance with the  law  (paragraph
    36).  The Razgar principles were applied and followed  (paragraph  37).
    The income in this case amounted to over �22,000  per  annum,  and  the
    judge observed that, "If accepted, then the  Appellant  does  not  fall
    foul of any provisions of Section 117B" (paragraph 39).

 6. The judge took into account the fact that there  had  been  substantial
    delay in dealing with the  Appellant's  application  of  nearly  twelve
    months.  He noted that,

         "It is  most  unfortunate  that  the  Appellant's  application  was
         delayed by the legal challenge for the income threshold,  and  this
         was not  usually  a  factor  that  would  weigh  heavily  with  me.
         However, in the circumstances of this case, and combined with other
         factors, it is something to which I have given additional, although
         not significant weight" (paragraph 45).

 7. Other factors are also taken into account in relation to Appendix FM-SE
    (see paragraph 46).  The judge gave due consideration to the  competing
    interests on each side of the proportionality  exercise.   He  observed
    that there is a need to be fair and consistent given the requirement of
    protective  immigration  control.   However,   there   was   also   the
    obligation, which was a positive obligation,  to  promote  family  life
    (paragraph 48).  Taking everything into account (see paragraph 48), the
    judge dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules, but allowed  it
    under human rights grounds (see paragraph 50).

The Grounds of Application

 8. In the grounds of application, the Respondent Entry  Clearance  Officer
    alleged that the judge, having found that the Appellant could not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules, was wrong  to  have  allowed
    the appeal under Article 8 grounds.  This was a  material  misdirection
    in law.

 9. On 3rd July 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 2nd October 2015, Mr Kandola, appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer,  submitted  that  the
    appeal on her behalf was being withdrawn because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the Sponsors' income was  not  evidenced
    in the bank statements, being evidence only in the  cash  payments  and
    not in the bank.  However, there was a P60 here.  This was a  leave  to
    enter case.  It was not a leave to remain case.   It  could  be  argued
    that in these circumstances a fresh application should be made.

11. If a fresh application were to be made, then the fresh  evidence  would
    plainly confirm the fact that the Appellant was indeed able to meet the
    financial requirement threshold in that the income  did  reach  �22,000
    and the appeal could be allowed under the Immigration Rules.   However,
    given  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  only  rejected   this
    application on  the  basis  of  the  proper  failure  to  evidence  the
    financial situation through the bank statements, with  no  doubt  being
    cast on whether the relationship was a genuine and subsisting  one,  it
    should be possible to say that  the  basis  of  the  refusal  has  been
    removed.

12. The sole issue here was one of employment.  Although the Appellant  had
    not submitted evidence to show that her sponsoring  husband  was  being
    paid through the bank, there was a P60 which was also sent, and this is
    a matter of record, and this would have  confirmed  that  the  earnings
    were actually evidenced  through  an  official  source  in  the  manner
    alleged.  On this basis, and on balance, this  was  a  case  where  the
    appeal should be withdrawn.

13. There was no-one present on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  and  no  legal
    representation.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the  decision  did  not  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of  TCEA  2007)
    such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the  decision.
    This was a case where a  judge  had  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis that the Appellant's earnings  were  not
    submitted and evidenced through bank  statements.   There  was,  as  Mr
    Kandola has very fairly pointed out, a P60 included in the  Appellant's
    bundle, which was not referred to by the judge,  and  this  would  have
    enabled the judge to conclude that the appeal would succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

15. Nevertheless, the judge did proceed to allow the appeal under the Human
    Rights Act given Article 8 and his reasons for doing  so  are  properly
    and comprehensively set out.  The essential issues were the error  here
    is a material one, and given that the appeal  was  allowed,  and  given
    that the application by the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer has  now
    been withdrawn before me, I have no hesitation in concluding  that  the
    judge was correct in allowing the appeal.  There is  no  perversity  or
    irrationality in his conclusion.  The decision must stand.

Decision

There is no true error of law in the judge's  decision.   The  determination
shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
