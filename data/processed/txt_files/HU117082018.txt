                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State of 9th  May  2018
    to refuse his application for indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the  UK
    based on ten years' continuous residence.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bart-Stewart allowed the appeal  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  17th
    December 2018.  The Secretary of  State  now  appeals  with  permission
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Gumsley on 21st January 2019.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant arrived in  the  UK
    on 15th September 2007 with  entry  clearance  as  a  student  and  was
    granted leave to enter in that capacity until 31st December  2010.   He
    was granted further leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Worker)
    until November 2011 and subsequent leave to remain as a Tier  1  Highly
    Skilled Migrant until 2013 and then again  until  May  2016.   On  28th
    April 2016 he applied for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  a  Highly
    Skilled General Migrant and on 18th August 2017 this was varied  to  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten  years'
    continuous residence.

 4. The Secretary of State considered the application under paragraph  276B
    of the Immigration Rules.  However the  application  was  refused  with
    reference to paragraph 322(5) of the general grounds of the Immigration
    Rules on the basis that with his application dated 23rd March 2011  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant  the  Appellant  claimed
    that he had previous earnings of �51,212 during  the  period  from  1st
    March 2010 until 28th February 2011.  In  that  application  he  stated
    that he was employed by Mercury Security with gross earnings of �16,836
    and  that  he  received  dividend  vouchers  from  self-employment   of
    �37,875.55 for the period from 31st August  2010  until  17th  February
    2011.  However according to the reasons for refusal letter HMRC  checks
    show that the Appellant's tax return for 2010/11 was only filed on 22nd
    March 2016, four years and two months after the end of  the  accounting
    year for 2010/11 on 31st January 2012.   Therefore  it  was  considered
    that, although in his application of 23rd March 2011 he stated that his
    income was �51,212 during the period 1st March 2010  to  28th  February
    2011, he did not file a tax return for this  period  until  22nd  March
    2016 just before he made his application for indefinite leave as a Tier
    1 Migrant on 28th April 2016.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered this issue in the decision and
    concluded at paragraph 30 of the decision that  there  is  insufficient
    evidence that the Appellant's actions were deliberate  or  intended  to
    deceive and that the Secretary of State had not made out the allegation
    that false  representations  were  made  or  the  Appellant  failed  to
    disclose material facts for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  his  previous
    variation of leave. The judge found that his conduct was not such as to
    give rise to refusal under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

 6. In the grounds of appeal the Secretary of State contends that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge erred in her approach to the appeal by  failing  to
    apply the reasoning of the Upper Tribunal in the decision on R (On  the
    application of Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC) when
    assessing whether the Appellant acted dishonestly in  relation  to  his
    dealings with UKVI or  HMRC.   The  Secretary  of  State  set  out  the
    guidance set out in head note (v) of Khan and submitted that the  judge
    had not followed the recommended steps in Khan.  It is contended in the
    grounds that at paragraph 26 of the decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not find the explanation for the  accountant's  error  to  be
    plausible or credible.  It is argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    failed to provide reasons why it was accepted that the Appellant  would
    not have been aware of the errors sooner given that his  tax  liability
    would have been significantly more than expected as no tax  return  was
    made.  It is also contended that there are no findings as  to  why  the
    significant discrepancy was not rectified by the Appellant sooner given
    that he will have been aware that he did not receive a tax bill for the
    tax year in question.  It is argued therefore that the judge  erred  in
    her assessment of the Appellant's actions by failing  to  consider  the
    suggested factors set out in Khan.

 7. In the case of Khan Mr Justice Martin  Spencer  set  out  the  approach
    which should be followed as follows:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
         income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
         the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
         draw  an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
         dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR  within  paragraph
         322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an  inference  could  be
         expected  where  there  is  no  plausible   explanation   for   the
         discrepancy.


         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State must decide whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
         State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
         the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.


         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
         "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be  the
         end of the matter, given that the accountant will  or  should  have
         asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to
         have signed the tax return. Furthermore  the  Applicant  will  have
         known of his or her earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within a  reasonable
         time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
         entitled to conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion  that
         there has been deceit or dishonesty.


         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
         merely  careless  the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider   the
         following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which  they
         are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


               i. Whether the explanation for the error by the accountant is
                  plausible;


              ii. Whether the documentation which can be  assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;


             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;


              iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has  taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."


 8. Judge Spencer also said at paragraph 32 that  the  starting  point  is,
    where the Secretary of State discovers a significant difference between
    the income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
    the income declared to HMRC, he is entitled to draw an  inference  that
    the applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and therefore  should  be
    refused indefinite leave to  remain  within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge noted however that  it  does  not  follow
    that in all such cases a decision to refuse ILR would be lawful.  Where
    an applicant has presented evidence to  show  that  despite  the  prima
    facie inference he was not in fact dishonest but only careless then the
    Secretary of State is presented with a fact-finding task which must  be
    carried out fairly and lawfully.  The judge notes that the Secretary of
    State needs to remind himself:

         "That a finding that a person has been deceitful and  dishonest  in
         relation to his tax affairs  with  the  consequence  he  is  denied
         settlement in this country is a very serious finding  with  serious
         consequences and therefore the evidence must be cogent  and  strong
         although, as the authorities show, the standard of proof remains on
         the balance of probabilities."

 9. I accept that the judge did not specifically refer to the  decision  of
    Khan and the guidance given therein.  However I accept  Miss  Solanki's
    submission that the decision of Khan, which was  not  reported  at  the
    time of the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, was before the judge as
    it was contained in the bundle at pages 141 onwards.  I accept that  it
    was also referred to in the skeleton  argument  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

10. In my view it is clear that the judge did in fact take the approach set
    out in the decision of Khan. At paragraph 26 the judge  considered  the
    accountant's  explanation  for  the  late  filing.   The   accountant's
    explanation that they considered that the onus was on HMRC  to  send  a
    tax return to the Appellant was considered not to be plausible and  the
    judge pointed out that it was not clear why the  Appellant  would  have
    had to make several calls to HMRC rather  than  the  accountant  simply
    file the return once the omission was noted.

11. The judge went on to assess the Appellant's evidence  and  all  of  the
    documentary  evidence.   At  paragraph  28  the  judge  considered  the
    evidence that the net dividend  for  the  tax  year  from  2010/11  was
    recorded as having been paid between August 2010 and February  2011  by
    the company SRA Security Services.  The judge went on at  paragraph  29
    to note that there was no evidence that the  late  filing  of  the  tax
    return for  2010/11  led  to  any  reduction  in  the  Appellant's  tax
    liability at the time.  There was no actual underpayment  of  tax.   In
    fact the judge noted that the HMRC  calculations  show  self-assessment
    repayments by HMRC to  the  Appellant  and  repayments  of  PAYE  which
    amounts to almost the same amount deducted  from  the  dividends.   The
    judge said:

         "This tends to support the Appellant's account that  he  understood
         that the appropriate tax had been deducted from the  dividends  and
         paid  over  as  part  of  the  company's  tax  liability.    Having
         considered  the  statement  from  HMRC,   which   does   not   show
         underpayment, I consider that this does  not  support  the  motives
         attributed to the Appellant by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
         allegation of dishonesty."

12. It appears therefore that the judge  concluded  on  the  evidence  that
    there was no underpayment of tax  overall.   I  accept  Miss  Solanki's
    submission that the judge has worked through the steps set out in Khan.
     I accept, as submitted in her skeleton argument, that the Tribunal  is
    not required to  quote  dicta  from  a  series  of  authorities  (EA  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 10). I  also
    accept that the judge is not expected to repeat the case law or the law
    in a tick box fashion (Quarey, R (On the application of) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 47).

13. In this case, when the judge's decision making is analysed it is  clear
    that she did in fact follow the guidance set out in Khan, by  examining
    the evidence put forward by the Secretary of State and the evidence put
    forward by the Appellant and  concluding  on  that  evidence  that  the
    allegation of deception had not been made out.

14. In my view the judge's conclusions were open to  her  on  the  evidence
    before her and no material error has been disclosed.
