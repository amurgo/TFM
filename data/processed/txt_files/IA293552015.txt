                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Maxwell
    made following  a hearing at Bradford on 29th August 2016.

 2. The judge did not believe that there was  a  valid  appeal  before  her
    because  neither  protection  nor  human  rights  were  raised  in  the
    application or at any time before the refusal.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal.  It  was  granted  by  Judge
    Kelly on 19th January 2017.  Judge Kelly considered that the respondent
    had unwittingly misled the Tribunal into believing that  there  was  no
    valid right of appeal since it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the
    application was made on 21st August 2014 and accordingly ought to  have
    been dealt with under the old provisions of the 2002 Act.

 4. On 3rd February 2017 the Secretary of State accepted that the appellant
    did have a right of appeal against the decision and that the judge  was
    wrong to say that the appellant was covered by the new  Section  82  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  which  restricts  the
    right of appeal to the Tribunal to cases where the Secretary  of  State
    had decided to refuse a protection claim or a  human  rights  claim  or
    where the Secretary of State had  decided  to  revoke  the  appellant's
    protection status.

 5. The Secretary of State said however that  the  appellant  had  recently
    voluntarily made a departure from the UK.  Mr Diwnycz produced evidence
    of that departure which was on 12th December 2016.  His representatives
    confirmed that Mr Afzal has returned to Pakistan.

 6. Accordingly, the appeal is treated as abandoned by  virtue  of  Section
    104(4) of the unamended Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    because the appellant has left the UK.

Notice of Decision

 7. Appeal abandoned.

No anonymity direction is made.
