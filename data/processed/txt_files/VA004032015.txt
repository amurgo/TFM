                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (Appellant)
        against  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bird's   promulgated
        decision of 17 March 2016 allowing the Respondent's appeal  against
        the Appellant's refusal, dated 11 December 2014, to grant him entry
        clearance as a family visitor.





   Background


     2. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan, date of birth 09  January
        1976. He sought entry clearance to visit his nephew  (the  sponsor)
        and his  wife  who  were  about  to  have  their  first  baby.  The
        Respondent's  sister  and  mother  were  also  applying  for  entry
        clearance as visitors. The Respondent claimed he was  self-employed
        and was a 30% shareholder in a transport company of  which  he  was
        the marketing manager. The Respondent  had  a  monthly  income  and
        received dividends from his shares. He also had another business, a
        clinic, at which he was employed as a homeopathic doctor.


     3. Although the Appellant was satisfied that the sponsor was  able  to
        maintain and accommodate  the  Respondent  the  Appellant  was  not
        satisfied that the Respondent only intended a short  family  visit.
        Although acknowledging bank statements  and  business  registration
        documents the Appellant  considered  there  to  be  an  absence  of
        evidence of the income generated by  the  transport  business.  The
        bank statements showed that  large  deposits  were  paid  into  the
        account on 25 November 2014 and the provenance  of  these  deposits
        was unknown. There was also said to be an absence of evidence  that
        the clinic derived an income. Although evidence had  been  provided
        of land/property this did not evidence any  income  generated  from
        the property. The Appellant was not therefore  satisfied  that  the
        Respondent's circumstances were as indicated. The Appellant doubted
        the Respondent's intentions and refused the application.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

     4.  The  Respondent  could  only  appeal  on  a  limited  basis  under
        s.84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  In
        his appeal he claimed that the decision breached Article 8  of  the
        ECHR.  The  Respondent  provided  additional  documentary  evidence
        relating to his businesses as well as receipts taken from customers
        which were then deposited into the bank  accounts.  The  Respondent
        provided further evidence of his clinic and showed that  money  was
        received  from  the  patients  from  the  clinic.  He  additionally
        provided  documents  showing  that  he  was  registered  with   the
        government of Pakistan, National Council for Homeopathy, which show
        that he  was  able  to  provide  treatment  from  the  clinic.  The
        Respondent had a wife and children in Pakistan and they  were  well
        settled. Apart from that he had his parents, brothers  and  sisters
        and other close relatives living in Pakistan.


     5. The  sponsor  gave  evidence  at  the  hearing  and  there  was  no
        appearance by a presenting officer. The sponsor confirmed that  the
        Respondent had been invited to visit him and his  wife  and  family
        prior to the birth of their  child.  The  Respondent's  mother  and
        sister were granted entry clearance. The judge  asked  the  sponsor
        why he and his wife could not travel to Pakistan. The sponsor  said
        that his son, who was born in March 2015, had a heart  problem  and
        still had regular check-ups. They were unable to take  him  out  of
        the country at present. I pause at this point  to  note  that  this
        evidence related to events that post-dated the  date  of  decision.
        Under the terms of s.85 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
        Act 2002 the tribunal cannot take into account events that occurred
        after the date of the decision. The Respondent's mother had  stayed
        to assist the sponsor after the birth and had left within the  time
        period limited by her leave. The Respondent's father had visited in
        March and he too returned with  the  Respondent's  mother.  In  the
        sponsor stated that the Respondent had been a  close  part  of  his
        family when he was growing up. The Respondent lived next  door.  As
        the sponsor's father was often away on business the Respondent  was
        always around. The Respondent was like a father figure and that  is
        why the sponsor wanted him to be present when the  baby  was  born.
        The judge found the sponsor to be a  straightforward  and  truthful
        witness.


     6. The judge noted that the appeal could only succeed  (on  the  basis
        asserted by the Respondent)  if  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
        constituted a breach of Article 8. The judge acknowledged that  the
        Respondent and the sponsor were  very  close.  At  [14]  the  judge
        accepted that the Respondent could not succeed under the provisions
        of the immigration rules (appendix FM and paragraph 276  ADE).  The
        judge found that there was no family life between the  sponsor  and
        the Respondent as they were both adults and there were no  'special
        circumstances'. The judge found that  the  Respondent  did  have  a
        private life  which  "...  Involves  establishing  and  maintaining
        family relationships" [14]. The judge directed herself  as  to  the
        requirement for compelling  circumstances  necessary  to  allow  an
        appeal outside the immigration rules [supra].


     7. At [16] the judge found that the sponsor had a  close  relationship
        with the Respondent because of the Respondent's involvement in  his
        earlier  life.  The  judge  found  that  the  difficult   pregnancy
        experienced by the  sponsor's  wife  also  justified  consideration
        outside  of  the  immigration  rules.  The  judge  found  that  the
        Respondent, "... Certainly has private life which  is  engaged  and
        the [Appellant's] decision to  refuse  an  entry  clearance  is  an
        interference with this private life." The judge accepted  that  the
        Appellant had  the  right  to  maintain  an  effective  immigration
        control  and  went  on  to  consider  whether  the   decision   was
        proportionate.


     8. At [17] to [19] the judge considered the  evidence  that  had  been
        provided by the  Respondent  and  found  that  the  Respondent  was
        involved with 2 businesses (the transport business and the  clinic)
        and that his circumstances were  as  claimed.  At  [21]  the  judge
        concluded, having regard to her factual findings, that the  refusal
        of entry clearance constituted a disproportionate interference with
        the Respondent's right to private life under Article 8 and  allowed
        the appeal.

The grounds of appeal and the grant of permission

     9.  The  grounds  contend  that  the  judge  misdirected  herself   in
        concluding that the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  constituted  an
        interference of such gravity such as to  engage  the  operation  of
        Article 8. It was submitted that the refusal of a  visitor's  entry
        clearance for a short visit to the UK, in circumstances where there
        was no family life, was not an interference of Article  8.  It  was
        submitted that the refusal of entry  clearance  in  a  visit  case,
        without more, did not constitute an interference with  the  private
        life of the Respondent and his extended family members.  There  was
        said to be no finding of interference in the private  life  of  the
        sponsor or his family. Permission was  granted  by  the  First-tier
        Tribunal on the basis that the judge  may  have  erred  in  law  in
        allowing the appeal under the private life aspect of Article 8.

The error of law hearing

    10. There was no attendance by the sponsor  or  by  any  representative
        acting on behalf of the Respondent. I noted from documents  on  the
        tribunal file that a notice of the error of law hearing, giving the
        date,  time   and   address,   was   sent   to   the   Respondent's
        representatives (New Era Visa Professionals), the sponsor  and  the
        Respondent. The Respondent's representatives  gave  an  address  in
        Lahore, Pakistan. The notice of hearing was sent by airmail  on  31
        October 2016 to the Respondent and  his  legal  representatives  in
        Pakistan. The notice of hearing was sent  to  the  sponsor  at  his
        London address by 2nd class mail on the same date. I put the matter
        back in my list and asked my usher to telephone the number provided
        for the Respondent's legal representatives  and  the  sponsor.  She
        informed me that she tried the telephone numbers but there  was  no
        reply.  I  was  satisfied  that  the  Respondent  and   his   legal
        representatives, and the sponsor, were notified of the  date,  time
        and place of the error of law hearing  and  that  reasonable  steps
        were taken to inform the Respondent, his  representatives  and  the
        sponsor. Having regard to rules 2 and 38 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I considered it to be in the  interests
        of justice to proceed with the hearing.


    11. Mr Armstrong relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted that the
        judge had failed to consider the nature of the  private  life  that
        had existed between the Respondent and the sponsor,  and  that  the
        judge was not legally  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  was  an
        interference with  the  private  life  relationship  sufficient  to
        trigger the protection of Article 8.  No  issue  was  taken  by  Mr
        Armstrong in respect of  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  factual
        evidence before her and her conclusions  that  the  Respondent  did
        indeed have 2 businesses in Pakistan  from  which  he  received  an
        income.

Discussion

    12. The judge found that the Respondent and  the  sponsor  had  a  good
        relationship that stemmed from the sponsor's  childhood.  They  had
        lived next door to each other in Pakistan and the Respondent  acted
        as a father figure when the sponsor's father was away on  business.
        The judge however found that there was no family life  relationship
        between the sponsor and the Respondent  sufficient  to  engage  the
        protection of Article 8. This was because they were both adults and
        the love and affection between adult family  members  will  not  of
        itself justify a finding of  family  life  without  something  more
        (Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 630, at [24]).


    13.  The  judge  did  however  find  that  there  was  a  private  life
        relationship between the sponsor and the Respondent  and  that  the
        refusal of entry clearance constituted an  interference  with  this
        private life sufficient to trigger the protection of Article 8.


    14. There has however been no assessment in the judge's decision of the
        nature of the private life relationship between the Respondent  and
        the sponsor between the time that the sponsor left Pakistan and the
        Appellant's decision. In order to determine whether  there  has  in
        fact been an interference of  sufficient  gravity  to  trigger  the
        operation of Article 8 it was necessary for the judge to assess how
        the relationship had  been  maintained.  It  is  unclear  from  the
        decision when the sponsor left Pakistan. I note from the  documents
        in the Respondent's bundle that the sponsor had been issued with  a
        residence permit as a PBS dependent on 19 June 2013, to  expire  on
        19 June 2016. This suggests that the  Respondent  and  the  sponsor
        maintained  their  relationship   either   by   remote   forms   of
        communication (such as telephone or Skype) or by visits made by the
        sponsor back to Pakistan for approximately 1  �  years  before  the
        date of decision. The refusal of entry clearance did not  therefore
        interfere  in  the  manner  in  which  the  relationship  had  been
        conducted prior to that decision. The Respondent  and  the  sponsor
        were still able to communicate remotely and the sponsor would  have
        been able to visit the Respondent  in  Pakistan.  Even  though  the
        Respondent does not have to show very much in order to  demonstrate
        an interference with Article  8  private  life  rights,  I  am  not
        satisfied, on the evidence available to the  judge,  that  she  was
        entitled to conclude that there was an interference of the  private
        life  relationship  between  the  sponsor  and  the  Respondent  of
        sufficient gravity such as to trigger the protection of Article  8.
        In the circumstances I am satisfied that the judge materially erred
        in law in allowing the appeal on human rights grounds. In light  of
        the factual findings made by the judge, and in the absence  of  any
        further evidence, I proceed to remake the decision  of  the  first-
        tier Tribunal and I dismiss the appeal brought by Mr Khan.


    15. The judge did however engage in a detailed and thorough  assessment
        of the evidence before her relating to the Respondent's intentions.
        The judge made factual findings that the Respondent did receive  an
        income from both of his businesses, and that he  had  strong  roots
        with Pakistan sufficient to ensure his return. These  included  the
        fact that the Respondent was married with children, that he had his
        parents and other siblings and more  distant  relatives  living  in
        Pakistan, and the compliance by his other family members with their
        conditions of entry clearance. Although this appeal has  ultimately
        been dismissed the entry clearance  officer  should  consider  very
        carefully the  factual  findings  made  by  the  judge  should  the
        Respondent apply again for entry clearance as a visitor.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a material error of  law.  I
remake the appeal dismissing the visitor appeal.

I make no anonymity order.
