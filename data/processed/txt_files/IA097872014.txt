                                                                  Respondent


    Representation:
    For the Appellant: Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting Officer)
    For the Respondent:     Mr Ume-Ezeoke, Counsel, instructed by
                        Spiropoulos Lawal Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. On June 25, 2012 he applied  for
    permanent residence as the family member of an EEA  national  that  had
    permanent residence. On January 26, 2014  the  respondent  refused  his
    application.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on February 20, 2014 under section
    82(1)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002   and
    Regulation 26 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006.

 4. The appeal came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Andonian
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on September 12, 2014, and in a
    decision promulgated on September 29, 2014 he allowed the appeal  under
    the 2006 Regulations.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on October 7,  2014  submitting
    the FtTJ had erred. Permission to appeal was refused by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth on the basis the respondent had failed
    to bring the relevant matters to the attention of the FtTJ.  Permission
    to appeal grounds were renewed on December 3, 2014 and  permission  was
    granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Archer on  March  12,  2015.  He
    found the FtTJ failed  to  have  regard  to  the  implications  of  the
    decision of Case 378/12 Nnamdi Onuekwere v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department (hereinafter referred to as  "Case  378/12")  and  this
    amounted to an arguable error in law.

 6. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above. The appellant was not in attendance.

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and I see no reason to alter that order

PRELIMINARY ISSUES

 8. I raised with Mr Walker his three grounds of appeal. He  handed  to  me
    the appellant's previous determination from May 8, 2012  in  which  the
    appellant's appeal against the deportation order was refused.

 9. Having checked the file I advised the parties that  this  document  had
    not been submitted to the FtTJ and there  did  not  appear  to  be  any
    reference to previous  proceedings  in  the  determination.  Mr  Walker
    suggested the refusal letter contained the details but on checking both
    the court file and Mr Walker's file it was  noticed  that  the  refusal
    letter  contained  5  pages  but  was  missing  pages  2  and  4.   The
    respondent's original grounds  of  appeal  made  no  reference  to  the
    previous decision and I indicated to Mr Walker that the FtTJ could  not
    have erred where  he  had  nothing  before  him  that  mentioned  other
    proceedings and the refusal letter was incomplete. I informed Mr Walker
    that I saw no merit to Ground Two of his amended grounds of appeal.

10. With regard to Ground Three I indicated to both parties that they would
    only have to address me on this ground if I rejected Ground One of  the
    grounds of appeal. Both Mr Walker and Mr Ume-Ezeoke  agreed  with  this
    approach.

SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

11. Mr Walker relied on Ground One of his grounds of appeal  and  submitted
    that although the respondent had wrongly  accepted  the  appellant  had
    satisfied Regulation 15 of the 2006 Regulations it had  been  incumbent
    on the FtTJ to apply the Regulations correctly. There  was  no  dispute
    that the appellant received a custodial term of five years  in  October
    2009 and he remained in custody until February 2012. The appellant  had
    been granted a right of residence as a family member of an EEA national
    in March 2005 and in  order  to  satisfy  Regulation  15  of  the  2006
    Regulations he had to demonstrate he had resided with an  EEA  national
    for a continuous period of five years. He had been detained in  October
    2009 thus breaking the period of continuity and the European  Court  of
    Justice made clear in Case 378/12 that any period in  custody  did  not
    count and the period  in  custody  interrupted  the  continuous  period
    required under the Regulation 15. The Court made clear that periods  of
    residence could not be aggregated and he invited me to find an error in
    law and to remake the decision by dismissing it.

12. Mr Ume-Ezeoke  accepted  any  period  in  custody  did  not  count  but
    submitted that there was discretion in respect of whether  the  periods
    could be aggregated.  He  accepted  the  FtTJ  had  to  apply  the  law
    correctly regardless of what submissions were made to him.

FINDING ON MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

13. There was no dispute that  the  appellant's  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a family member of an EEA national commenced in March  2005.
    In order to obtain permanent residence he  had  to  satisfy  Regulation
    15(1)(b) of the 2006 regulations and show he had resided  with  an  EEA
    national in accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period  of
    five years.

14. There is no  dispute  that  on  October  12,  2009  the  appellant  was
    sentenced to five years imprisonment for drug offences.

15. The Court made clear at paragraph [27] of its judgement in Case  378/12
    that

         "In view of all the foregoing considerations,  the  answer  to  the
         first question is that Article 16(2) of Directive 2004/38  must  be
         interpreted as meaning that the periods of imprisonment in the host
         Member State of a third-country national, who is a family member of
         a Union citizen who has acquired the right of  permanent  residence
         in that Member State during those periods,  cannot  be  taken  into
         consideration of the context of the acquisition by that national of
         the  right  of  permanent  residence  for  the  purposes  of   that
         provision."

16. It therefore follows that the  period  between  October  12,  2009  and
    February 9, 2012 (date of release) could not count.

17. The issue is whether the periods March 2005 to October  2009  and  post
    February 9, 2012 could be aggregated and therefore enable the appellant
    to satisfy Regulation 15.

18. The answer to this lies in paragraph [32]  of  Case  378/12  where  the
    Court made clear that periods of residence cannot  be  aggregated.  The
    Court stated, "... continuity of residence is interrupted by periods of
    imprisonment".  Accordingly, the appellant could not satisfy Regulation
    15 and the FtTJ must have erred by agreeing  that  the  Regulation  was
    met. As the appellant cannot meet the requirement of Regulation  15  he
    is not entitled to permanent residence and his application must fail

DECISION

19. There was a material error. I set aside the decision and I  remake  the
    decision  and  dismiss  the  appellant's  application  under  the  2006
    Regulations.
