                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr  A Vaughan, instructed by AK Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Ms H Rackstraw, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Hari Krishnan, date of birth 12.1.84,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. The Secretary of State appealed against the determination of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Duff, who allowed the appeal against the decision of the
    respondent, dated 14.6.13, to refuse to vary leave to remain in the  UK
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant. The appeal was allowed on the basis
    that the decision was not in accordance with the law and  breached  the
    appellant's rights under article 8 ECHR.  The Judge heard the appeal on
    28.10.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.1.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.1.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I heard submissions and reserved my  decision  on  error  of
    law, which was promulgated to the parties on 18.2.14. I found an  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  such
    that it should be set aside and remade in its entirety.

 5. The remaking of the decision was then listed before me on 19.5.14.

 6. At the outset of the hearing before me on 19.5.14, Mr Vaughan sought to
    reopen the error of  law  decision.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having already been set aside, I declined to reopen the  error
    of law decision.

 7. The matter was heard with the linked appeal of Mr Abdul Basher Shamin &
    others,  IA/26687/2013.  Mr   Shamin   is   the   claimant's   Tier   1
    (entrepreneur) team partner. There were two separate decisions  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I am asked to draft separate decisions,  though
    the reasoning will largely be the same, as they were in the  respective
    determinations of Judge Duff.

 8. For the reasons set out herein, I found that there  were  a  number  of
    errors of law in the making of Judge Duff's  decision,  such  that  the
    determination should be set aside and remade. I attach as an  annex  to
    this determination my error of law decision.

 9. In summary, I found that the First-tier Tribunal:

      a)  Wrongly  took  into  account  evidence  not  submitted  with   the
         application;

      b) Wrongly dispensed with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41-SD  in
         relation to PBS specified evidence; and,

      c) Was in error to find that there was an obligation on the  Secretary
         of State to seek missing  information  as  part  of  an  evidential
         flexibility policy (or under paragraph 245AA);

      d) Was in error in the article  8  assessment  to  consider  that  the
         interference with family life was not necessary for the enforcement
         of  immigration  policy  and  misunderstood  and   misapplied   the
         proportionality balancing exercise;

      e) Wrongly applied a near-miss approach to  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

10. I heard submissions from the representatives of both parties,  received
    Mr Vaughan's skeleton argument, and reserved my  determination  on  the
    remaking of the decision in the appeal, which I now give.

11. Whilst Mr Vaughan represented both the Shamim family claimants and this
    claimant, Mr Krishnan, the whole of his skeleton argument and  most  of
    his submissions related exclusively to the particular circumstances  of
    the Shamim family and in particular  the  argument  that  one  or  both
    children were entitled to remain in the UK and thus the parents derived
    a right to remain under article 8 to care for that child and the  other
    child must also remain with the family.

12. For reasons given in my determination in appeal IA/26687/2013,  I  have
    found that the claimants Mr Shamim and his wife and two children failed
    to demonstrate that they met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    for leave to remain as a Tier  1  Entrepreneur  and  dependents.  Their
    appeals were also dismissed under human rights grounds.

13. Mr Vaughan did not seek to argue that Mr Krishnan met the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules. However,  he  submitted  that  the  following
    factors gave rise to entitlement to remain on the  grounds  of  private
    life under article 8 ECHR:

      a) The length of residence in the UK, since 2008;

      b) The time and effort put into setting up, developing and running the
         business;

      c) A positive contribution to the community in establishing two  full-
         time positions for employees of the business;

      d) The social and business ties that would be lost in having to  leave
         the UK;

      e) A contribution of real value to the community and the country;

      f) That his economic contribution  in  permitting  him  to  remain  is
         greater than the public interest in protecting the  economic  well-
         being of the UK by immigration control.

14. Without needing to set out the reasons afresh, it follows from my error
    of law decision that this claimant did not meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur, as  set
    out at �9 of that decision.

15. In particular he, along with his entrepreneurial team partner failed to
    comply with the specified evidence requirements of paragraphs 41 and 41-
    SD of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

16. Since the hearing before me,  there  have  been  a  number  of  further
    relevant decisions of the Upper Tribunal in relation to PBS cases.

17. In Durrani (Entrepreneurs: bank letters; evidential flexibility) [2014]
    UKUT 00295 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

             (1)   The requirements listed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of  the
             Rules are to be construed reasonably and  sensibly,  in  their
             full context.  Approached in this way,  the  letters  required
             from banks or other financial institutions are not designed to
             provide, and do not commit them to, any form of  guarantee  or
             assurance  to  any  party.   Rather,  the  function   of   the
             prescribed letters is to attest to the state of  the  relevant
             bank account on the date when they are written and to  provide
             certain other items of information  designed  to  confirm  the
             authenticity of the application  for  entrepreneurial  migrant
             status and its economic viability.  There is no difficulty  in
             the third party bank, with its customer's consent,  expressing
             its understanding, based on the customer's instructions,  that
             the use of specified funds in the customer's bank account/s is
             contemplated or proposed by the customer for  the  purpose  of
             financing   the   applicant's   proposed   business   venture.
             Accordingly, there is no substance in the  argument  that  the
             relevant  requirements  contained  in  paragraph   41-SD(a)(i)
             produce an absurd result and must, therefore,  be  interpreted
             in some other manner.

              (2)    The question of whether a  policy  exists  is  one  of
             fact.  There is no evidence that  some  policy  on  evidential
             flexibility, independent and freestanding of paragraph  245AA,
             survived the introduction of that paragraph in the immigration
             rules.

18. In Akhter and another (paragraph 245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 00297
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal Tribunal held that a bank letter, which  does
    not specify the postal address, landline  telephone  number  and  email
    address of the account holders is not thereby "in the wrong format" for
    the purposes of paragraph 245AA of the immigration rules (documents not
    submitted with applications).

19. In relation to  the  issues  in  this  appeal,  it  is  clear  that  no
    flexibility policy survived the introduction  of  paragraph  245AA  and
    that that limitations of that paragraph cannot be expanded  to  include
    defective documents as being  in  the  wrong  format.  The  above  case
    authorities entirely support my error of law decision  in  relation  to
    the application of evidential flexibility set out between �14  and  �33
    of that decision.

20. As explained in the error of law decision, under section 85A(4) of  the
    2022 Act the tribunal can only consider evidence which was submitted in
    support of and at the time of  making  the  application  to  which  the
    immigration decision related. Neither paragraph  245AA  nor  any  other
    evidential flexibility policy could assist the  claimant's  failure  to
    comply  with  the  specified  evidence  requirements,  or  permit   the
    consideration of evidence submitted later. In  the  circumstances,  the
    application and the appeal have to  considered  in  the  light  of  the
    evidence and documents submitted at the time of the application.

21. For the reasons set out in the error of law decision,  without  needing
    to repeat them further here, it is clear that  the  claimant  does  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 entrepreneur and his appeal in that regard must fail. Mr Vaughan
    made no submissions to the contrary.

22. Mr Krishnan makes no claim to having established family life in the UK,
    only private life. By the  operation  of  the  Immigration  Rules  such
    private  life  must  be  considered  under  paragraph  276ADE  of   the
    Immigration Rules. However, it is obvious, and Mr Vaughan did not argue
    to the contrary, that the claimant could not meet the  requirements  of
    276ADE. He has not had continuous residence in the UK for a  period  of
    20 years. Neither can he reasonably claim to have no ties to Bangladesh
    including family, social and cultural.

23. In the circumstances, it must follow that the  claimant  cannot  comply
    with any of the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  for  leave  to
    remain, either as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur or under paragraph 276ADE.

24. Having found the appellant  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain, the question next arises whether
    the appellant's circumstances might arguably be sufficiently compelling
    and insufficiently recognised within the Immigration  Rules  so  as  to
    justify granting the application outside the Immigration Rules  on  the
    basis of article 8 private life as the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State produces a result that is unjustifiably harsh.


25. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be  carried  out.  MF
    (Nigeria)  was  followed  in  Kabia  (MF:  para  398   -   "exceptional
    circumstances") 2013 UKUT 00569 (IAC).


26. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal set out, inter alia, that on the current state
    of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
           MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT  00393  (IAC);
           Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013]  UKUT  00045  (IAC);  they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


27. The case also explained that  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Article 8 family aspects of the respondent's position through the Rules
    and the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE.  Only  if  there
    were arguably good grounds for granting leave  to  remain  outside  the
    rules was it necessary for him for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
    consider whether there were compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules.


28. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:


    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)   MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)    It follows from this that any other rule which  has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)  Where an area of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

29. Applying the above guidance and case authority, and for the reasons set
    out herein, I have considered but find no  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  or  other
    compelling circumstances, not sufficiently recognised in the  Rules  so
    as to justify, exceptionally,  granting  the  application  outside  the
    Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR private life. Neither  do  I  find
    the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  unduly   harsh   in   the
    circumstances of this case.


30. In Gulshan the Upper Tribunal considered that it was not  unduly  harsh
    for a husband who originated  from  Pakistan  but  was  now  a  British
    national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was seeking leave  to
    remain as his spouse. The panel  acknowledged  that  the  couple  would
    suffer some hardship, as he had been in  the  UK  since  2002,  he  had
    worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and  other
    state benefits, some of which could not  be  transferred  to  Pakistan.
    Whilst this claimant's circumstances are  different,  the  decision  is
    illustrative of the Tribunal's view of what does and does not amount to
    unjustifiably harsh.


31. I take into account all that has been urged upon me in relation to  the
    claimant's business activity and alleged contribution to the community,
    country and economy. I also take account of his  residence  here  since
    2008. However, he has no right  or  legitimate  expectation  to  remain
    except in compliance with the Immigration Rules. He is not entitled  to
    remain in the UK just because he wishes to do so. There is a route  for
    being able to remain as an entrepreneur and it was for the claimant  to
    demonstrate  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that   he   met   the
    requirements applicable to all applicants who  wish  to  remain  as  an
    entrepreneur. As explained in my error of law  decision,  there  is  no
    near miss principle that can  assist  the  claimant;  his  claim  under
    private life is not strengthened by the degree to which  he  failed  to
    demonstrate compliance with the Rules. He is not entitled  to  ask  for
    the  requirement  to  be  overlooked  or  excused  in  his  case.   The
    requirements are deliberately strict and  the  timetable  requires  the
    evidence to be submitted at the time of  the  application.  It  follows
    that the consequences of failure to comply with  the  requirements  are
    severe, but that does not in any way justify using  article  8  private
    life as a form of shortcut to compliance with the Immigration Rules.


32. Frankly, there is nothing whatsoever compelling  about  the  claimant's
    private life circumstances. They are unremarkable and no more than  one
    might expect given his length of residence in the UK  since  2008.  The
    Immigration Rules provide a separate route for consideration  of  leave
    to remain on the  basis  of  private  life.  Paragraph  276ADE  is  the
    Secretary of State's response to private life rights under  article  8.
    It is deemed that if an applicant  has  not  lived  in  the  UK  for  a
    continuous period of 20 years then he will not be entitled to remain on
    the basis of private life unless he can show that he has no ties to his
    home country including family, social and cultural. The  claimant  does
    not meet those requirements.


33. In the circumstances, taking  account  of  the  evidence  as  a  whole,
    especially those matters urged upon me by Mr Vaughan, I find that there
    are no  compelling  circumstances  and  certainly  none  insufficiently
    recognised under the Immigration Rules so as to justify, exceptionally,
    granting leave to remain outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR on  the
    basis that the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  is  unjustifiably
    harsh. I find that it is not unjustifiably harsh on the facts  of  this
    case.


34. Even if I had proceeded to a Razgar five-step consideration of  article
    8 ECHR private life, I would have found that the degree of interference
    with the claimant's private life was insufficiently grave as to  engage
    article 8. Even if article 8  was  so  engaged,  when  considering  the
    proportionality  balancing  exercise  between  on  the  one  hand   the
    claimant's private life circumstances and on the other  the  legitimate
    aim of protecting the economic well-being of the UK though  immigration
    control, I would have found the decision entirely proportionate for the
    reasons cited above. The claimant did not meet the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain when there was a  route  open  to
    him to seek  leave  to  remain  in  that  capacity.  There  is  nothing
    remarkable about his  private  life  that  would  outweigh  the  public
    interest  in  removing  him  from  the  UK  or   would   otherwise   be
    disproportionate for any other reason proffered. He  will  be  able  to
    continue his private life in Bangladesh and to  maintain  contact  with
    the friends and associates he has in the UK  through  modern  means  of
    communication and by occasional visits. There  is  nothing  about  that
    private  life  which  requires  his  presence  in  the   UK   for   its
    continuation.


Decision:

     The appeal in respect of the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

     The appeal in respect of article 8 ECHR is dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr  R  Reynolds, instructed by AK Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Mr Mangion, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Hari Krishnan, date of birth 12.1.84,  is  a  citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Duff, who allowed the appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 14.6.13, to refuse to vary  leave  to
    remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  The  appeal  was
    allowed on the basis that the decision was not in accordance  with  the
    law and breached the appellant's rights  under  article  8  ECHR.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 28.10.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.1.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.1.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. The matter was heard with the linked appeal of Mr Abdul Basher Shamin &
    others,  IA/26687/2013.  Mr   Shamin   is   the   claimant's   Tier   1
    (entrepreneur) team partner. There were two separate decisions  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I am asked to draft separate decisions,  though
    the reasoning will largely be the same, as they were in the  respective
    determinations of Judge Duff.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Duff should be set aside.

 7. Following the submissions of the representatives on the issue of  error
    of law, I reserved my decision, which I now give.

 8. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first entered the UK in 2008 with leave to remain  as  a  student.  His
    leave was subsequently extended  as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant.
    On 18.12.12 he made an application for further leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur),  along  with  Mr  Shamim.  The  application  was
    refused on the basis of failure of the appellant  to  comply  with  the
    evidential requirements under Appendix A paragraphs 41-SD and 46-SD. It
    is the appeal against that decision which came before Judge Duff.

 9. The particular failures relied on by the respondent are as follows:

      a) Insufficient evidence that the  entrepreneurial  team  had  already
         invested �30,000 into the business 'Fairway Business  International
         Ltd;'

      b) The bank letter does not state the claimant's name or that  of  his
         entrepreurial  team  partner,  or  that  the  monies  held  can  be
         transferred to the UK;

      c) The legal representative's letter related to a previous declaration
         and not the one made with the current application. Further, it  did
         not clearly confirm the third party's  identificateion  details  or
         their  signature.  The  letter  does  not   come   from   a   legal
         representative who is authorised to practice in the country of  the
         third party;

      d) Insufficient evidence that the  claimant  is  engaged  in  business
         activity. None of the advertisements give the partners names.  None
         of the contracts include a contact telephone number of the  clients
         or original signatures from both parties, or  have  signatures  but
         pages missing from the contracts;

      e) No evidence was submitted to demonstrate that that the business  is
         subject to UK taxation.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Chohan noted that  the  grounds
    submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  wrongly  applied  the
    flexibility policy as outlined in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]
    UKUT 00042 (IAC).

11. "It is apparent from the judge's determination that the  appellant  did
    not meet the requirements of the  relevant  immigration  rules.  It  is
    clear from paragraph 15  of  the  judge's  determination  that  it  was
    accepted by the appellant and his representative that the appellant had
    failed to supply certain documentation to the respondent. Without going
    into detail, the judge concluded that the respondent should have  given
    the appellant the benefit  of  the  doubt  and  requested  the  missing
    material. It is concluded that this submission was  unfair.  The  judge
    then proceeded to allow the appeal under article 8 taking into  account
    the unfairness under the Rodriguez principles. Indeed, it  is  apparent
    from paragraph 17 of the determination that the  judge  considered  the
    appellant's failure to meet the requirements of the  immigration  rules
    as, "trivial failures in respect of the immigration rules."

12. "Considering the determination as a whole I do find that it may be open
    to argument that the judge wrongly applied the  flexibility  policy  as
    enunciated in the case of Rodriguez. It  follows  from  that  that  his
    findings in respect of article 8 may well be wrong in law. Hence I find
    that there is an arguable error of law. All grounds may be argued."

13. For the reasons set out herein, I find that  there  were  a  number  of
    errors of law in the making of Judge Duff's  decision,  such  that  the
    determination should be set aside and remade.

14. Judge Duff noted the evidential failures at �7 of the determination. At
    �2  the  judge  recognised  that  by  reason  of  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  only  evidence  submitted
    with the application could be considered in a PBS case. The application
    was made on 18.12.12 and the refusal decisions followed on 14.6.13.  At
    �11 Judge Duff noted the claimant's reliance on  further  documentation
    submitted after the date of application and concluded at  �12  and  �14
    that the Secretary of State had failed  to  take  account  of  all  the
    evidence submitted, "as it ought to have been." For the reasons set out
    below, I find that to be an error of law.

15. As drafted, section 85A provides that when considering a PBS appeal the
    Tribunal may consider evidence adduced by the appellant only if it  was
    submitted in support of, and at the time of making, the application  to
    which the immigration decision related. Immigration Rule  34G  provides
    that an application is made on  the  date  it  is  sent  or  submitted,
    depending on how it is submitted.


16. Previous authority suggesting that an application  remains  open  until
    the date of decision has been overturned. In Raju, Khatel and Others  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 754 the Court of Appeal  made  it  clear  that  AQ
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ  833  was,  "not  authority  for  the
    proposition... that applications  were  "made"  throughout  the  period
    starting with the date of their submission and finishing with the  date
    of the decisions".  Rule 37 of the Immigration Rules governs  the  date
    of  the  application.  Paragraph  34G  precludes  the  concept   of   a
    'continuing application' which started when it was first submitted  and
    concluded at the date of the decision either of the Secretary of  State
    or, on appeal, of a Tribunal.


17. Despite the apparent effect of section 85A, in Nasim and others  (Raju:
    reasons not to follow?) [2013]  UKUT  00610(IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    stated, inter alia,

         " As  held  in  Khatel  and  others  (s85A;  effect  of  continuing
         application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044  (IAC),  section   85A   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 precludes a  tribunal,
         in  a  points-based  appeal,  from  considering  evidence   as   to
         compliance with points-based Rules, where  that  evidence  was  not
         before the Secretary of State when she took her decision;  but  the
         section does not prevent a tribunal from considering evidence  that
         was before the Secretary of  State  when  she  took  the  decision,
         whether or not that evidence reached her only  after  the  date  of
         application for the purposes of paragraph 34F  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

18. At �76 of Nasim, it is clear that this view was obiter and not part  of
    the rationale for the decision.  However, it appears from �73 that  the
    respondent's position before the Upper Tribunal was that an application
    is to be treated as continuing for  evidential  purposes  after  it  is
    initially submitted to the  SSHD,  enabling  an  applicant  to  provide
    further evidence in addition to that  initially  submitted.  There  may
    have been a particular reason for such a concession in that appeal  and
    it may be a matter entirely restricted to that  case.  However,  whilst
    the respondent could consider evidence  submitted  after  the  date  of
    application, the Tribunal cannot as it is clearly prohibited from doing
    so by 85A(4); I can find no authority to the contrary.


19. Paragraph 245AA was not considered in Nasim, as that case dealt with  a
    different set of criteria for the now-closed post study work route at a
    time before paragraph 245AA was introduced into the Rules in  September
    2012.


20. In the circumstances, I find that there was an error of  law  in  Judge
    Duff taking into account evidence that  was  before  the  Secretary  of
    State before she made her decision, and not taken into account by  her,
    as such evidence had not been submitted with the application.

21. Further, at �15 of the determination Judge Duff  purports  to  dispense
    with the requirements  of  41-SD  in  relation  to  the  advertisements
    submitted as evidence of engagement in business activity, finding that,
    "the material taken together satisfied the  requirement."  The  judge's
    opinion  that  it  would  make  no  commercial  sense   for   published
    advertisements to have  the  claimant's  name,  or  that  of  his  team
    partner, as opposed to the name of the  business  is  irrelevant.   The
    specific requirement in 41-SD (c)(iii) is that the  advertisement  must
    contain, "the applicant's  name  (and  the  name  of  the  business  if
    applicable) together with the business activity." It is not open to the
    First-tier Tribunal to dispense with the stated requirements; to do  so
    is a clear error  of  law.  I  will  deal  below  with  the  evidential
    flexibility point made in the alternative in �15.

22. At �16 the judge accepted that none of the contracts had the  telephone
    numbers of the clients on  them.  At  �17  the  judge  notes  that  the
    claimant accepts failing  to  provide  the  required  evidence  of  tax
    registration. At �19  Judge  Duff  finds  that  because  of  these  two
    evidential failures, described as "minor aspects  of  the  rules,"  the
    appeal cannot be allowed on the basis that the application was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules. However, he proceeded  to  allow
    the appeal on the basis that the decisions were not in accordance  with
    the law on the following basis set out in the determination at �17  and
    �19:

23. That the evidential failures, "ought to have prompted the Secretary  of
    State to make an enquiry of the claimant  pursuant  to  the  evidential
    flexibility  policy  in  existence  at  that   time...   A   caseworker
    considering the case clearly ought to have  had  sufficient  reason  to
    believe that the missing piece of evidence existed or at the  least  to
    have been uncertain as to whether it existed  and  to  have  given  the
    benefit of the doubt  to  the  (claimant)  and  requested  the  missing
    material."

24. For the reasons set out below, I find that Judge Duff made an error  of
    law in reliance on evidential flexibility to allow the appeals.

25. In relation to the evidential flexibility policy, in  Alam  and  others
    [2012] EWCA Civ 960 the Court of Appeal held that the exclusion of  new
    evidence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    s.85A applied to all appeals made after the date that section  85A  was
    brought into force. The Court accepted the Respondent's contention that
    the check as to the validity of applications  was  a  very  preliminary
    check to see whether there were obvious omissions: e.g. no fee paid, no
    photograph supplied, no signature on the Student Declaration at the end
    of the form. The Court of Appeal accepted the  distinction  between  an
    invalid application, which would not be considered unless  the  obvious
    defect was cured, and an application that was a valid application,  but
    nevertheless fell to be rejected because, on examination, the applicant
    had failed to score that required number of points, e.g. because he had
    failed  to  supply  a  specified  document.   In   the   circumstances,
    irrespective of any argument as to whether submitted documents were  in
    the  wrong  format,  the  failure  to  provide  a  specified  document,
    including  in  this  case  the  contracts,   advertisements   and   tax
    registration, were omissions fatal to the application.


26. Judge Duff relied on Rodriquez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT  00042
    (IAC). However, Rodriquez  was  further  considered  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal, Rodriquez [2014] EWCA Civ 2, where the  court  almost  entirely
    disagreed with  the  conclusions  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  as  to  the
    applicability of an evidential flexibility  policy  to  PBS  cases.  Ms
    Rodriguez had failed to demonstrate by  her  submitted  bank  statement
    that she had the necessary funds over the required  28-day  period  and
    her application for further leave to remain as a student  was  refused.
    The First-tier Tribunal decided that pursuant to section 85A  it  could
    not take account of further bank statements showing  additional  funds.
    She then appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal,  relying  on  an  evidential
    flexibility policy in a letter dated 19.5.11.

27. It should be pointed out that in Rodriguez, the incorporation  of  what
    was the evidential flexibility policy into  the  Immigration  Rules  at
    paragraph 245AA was not directly material to the three  appeals  before
    the Court of Appeal, as it came about after  the  relevant  dates.  The
    Court of Appeal was  considering  the  contention  that  an  evidential
    flexibility  policy,  referred  to  as  the  PBS  Process  Instruction,
    published in June 2011, was the version  potentially  relevant  to  the
    three appeals before the court. The document appears as Appendix  B  to
    the Upper Tribunal Rodriguez decision.

28. The Court of Appeal found that the letter of 19.5.11 was  not  intended
    to herald an unequivocal relaxation of the Immigration Rules  over  and
    above the process instruction; it was merely  referential  to  existing
    policy and mooting a temporary trial. At �92, it was  held  that  taken
    overall, the process instruction,  "is  demonstrably  not  designed  to
    given an applicant the  opportunity  first  to  remedy  any  defect  or
    inadequacy in the application or supporting documentation so as to save
    the application from refusal after substantive  consideration."  In  Ms
    Rodriguez case there was no reason to believe that she had other  funds
    available to her and she had not met the requirements of the  Rules  in
    that she failed to  submit  the  specified  documentation  showing  the
    required minimum amount over the 28 day period required.  Consideration
    of the policy did not and would not have  assisted  Ms  Rodriguez.  The
    court found that the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal in her  case
    was correct.

29. The PBS Process Instruction policy, predating paragraph 245AA, purports
    to deal with missing evidence or a minor error. It states, inter  alia,
    that there is no limit  on  the  amount  of  information  that  can  be
    requested from the applicant; that multiple pieces of evidence  can  be
    requested; and that where there is uncertainty as to  whether  evidence
    exists, benefit should be given to the  applicant.  At  section  3,  it
    provides  that  before  seeking  additional  information,  it  must  be
    established that the evidence exists, or sufficient reason  to  believe
    that it exists.

30. In any event, by the time of the facts in the present appeal,  the  PBS
    Process Instruction had been incorporated into the Immigration Rules on
    6.9.12 in paragraph 245AA, setting out that  only  documents  submitted
    with the application will be considered and  that  documents  submitted
    after the application will only be considered in certain  circumstances
    where 245AA(b) applies.  This  relates  to  a  missing  document  in  a
    sequence, or a document in the wrong format, or the supply  of  a  copy
    instead of the  original.  "The  UK  Border  Agency  will  not  request
    documents where a specified document has not been submitted,  or  where
    the UK Border Agency does not anticipate that addressing  the  omission
    or error ... will lead to a  grant  because  the  application  will  be
    refused for other reasons."

31. The examples set out at step 3 of the process instruction are virtually
    identical to paragraph 245AA as it stood  in  September  2012.  In  the
    circumstances, I find no significant difference in the  application  of
    the policy between this document and paragraph 245AA of the Immigration
    Rules. In any event, neither the application of the process instruction
    nor paragraph 245AA could rescue the several evidential failures in the
    present case. In the circumstances, it is not  necessary  to  determine
    whether paragraph 245AA displaces the process instructions.

32. It is obvious that an error in a contract document cannot be  cured  in
    the same way as a missing document in a series or failure to provide an
    original document rather than a copy, as that would mean  the  creation
    of an entirely new contract document. Similarly, an advertisement  that
    does not contain the correct information  cannot  be  cured  without  a
    completely new advertisement. There was thus no basis  for  considering
    there might be evidence in existence in relation to  these  two  issues
    that met the requirements of the Rules. Further, the failure to provide
    the correct document to evidence that the business  is  subject  to  UK
    taxation does not falls within  the  types  of  documents  set  out  in
    245AA(b), or the process instruction. This was  not  an  error  in  the
    documentation supplied but a complete failure to provide  the  required
    documentation  to  meet  this  part  of  the   requirements.   In   the
    circumstances, there was no requirement for the Secretary of  State  to
    make further enquiries  of  the  claimant  in  relation  any  of  these
    evidential failures.

33. In summary, the claimant's case is not assisted  by  considerations  of
    evidential flexibility. If follows that Judge  Duff  erred  in  law  in
    concluding that the appeal should be allowed on that basis.

34. Judge Duff went on  to  consider  the  claimant's  circumstances  under
    article 8. However, as Mr Reynolds accepts, if the Secretary of State's
    decision were not in accordance with the law,  Judge  Duff  should  not
    have gone on to consider article 8 but should have allowed the  appeals
    to the limited extent that it remained for the Secretary  of  State  to
    make decisions that were in accordance with the law. Thus, even on  the
    claimant's there was an error of law in the decision of Judge Duff such
    that the determination cannot stand.

35. I turn now to article 8 considerations. The First-tier Tribunal allowed
    the appeals on the basis of article 8 family and private life.

36. Judge Duff noted at �17 that this claimant, unlike Mr Shamim, does  not
    have an established family in the UK, but found that he had a very well
    developed private life, a part of which was the business in which  they
    were  engaged.  The  judge  considered  that  it  would  be  completely
    artificial and unfair to come to different conclusions in  relation  to
    each of them. This is an error  of  law  since  at  this  part  of  the
    determination the judge was considering  not  the  application  of  the
    Rules, but this claimant's private life in the UK. The judge relied  on
    the family life of Mr Shamim to justify  permitting  this  claimant  to
    succeed under article 8. I can see no justification for doing so.

37. Article 8 provides that:

           "Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           "There shall be no interference by a public authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


38. At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


39. Following Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC)  it  is  clear  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

         "After applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may be
         arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is
         it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);"

40. Broadly speaking MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Nagre make clear
    that the  Immigration  Rules  as  now  in  force  are  to  be  read  as
    incorporating Article 8 of  the  ECHR  but,  of  course,  the  existing
    jurisprudence continues to bind the decision maker and  the  courts  in
    its interpretation of those  Immigration  Rules.  Put  another  way,  a
    decision purporting to be made in compliance with the Rules  will  only
    be sustainable if it is reconcilable with  those  legal  principles  as
    well as the structure of the Rules itself. Otherwise the decision maker
    will have failed to apply the respondent's policy that refusal  of  the
    application must not result in unjustifiably harsh consequences such as
    to be disproportionate under Article 8. Only  if  there  were  arguably
    good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the rules would it be
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether  there
    were compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules.

41. Taking full account of those matters recited by Judge  Duff  and  other
    matters evident in the case papers before  me,  I  find  no  compelling
    circumstances, for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules on  the  facts  of  this  appeal.  Neither  do  I  find  evidence
    sufficient  to  render  the   decision   either   disproportionate   or
    unjustifiably harsh; whichever test  is  applied.  There  were  clearly
    stated rules for leave to remain,  with  which  the  claimant  has  not
    complied. The claimants must be taken to understand that they  have  no
    inherent right to remain in the UK unless and  until  they  can  comply
    with the Immigration Rules for doing so.

42. In his article 8 considerations, Judge  Duff  referred  to  the  Razgar
    steps in considering article 8, but found that the interference was not
    necessary for the enforcement of immigration policy. With respect, that
    was a misunderstanding and misconstruction  of  the  Razgar  steps.  In
    essence, the judge conflated the necessity of protecting  the  economic
    well-being of the country with the proportionality  balancing  exercise
    and in doing so made a material error of law.

43. The judge then went on to  consider  at  �17  that  he  had,  "not  the
    slightest doubt that the  decision  was  entirely  disproportionate  in
    relation to the trivial failures in respect of the immigration  rules,"
    and purported to additionally allow the appeal on  that  basis.  Whilst
    the judge was entitled to take account of the claimant's private  life,
    there  was  little  reasoning  evident  in  the  determination  for   a
    conclusion that such private life was sufficient to render the decision
    disproportionate. There is little more than the fact that he  has  been
    in the UK for a number of years and is  engaged  in  business  with  Mr
    Shamim. The judge cites no other factors in the claimant's favour.

44. Further, the  judge  entirely  failed  to  take  into  account  in  the
    balancing exercise the very significant factors weighing in  favour  of
    the Secretary of State's decision,  including  that  the  claimant  had
    failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules for  leave  to
    remain in the UK. The judge erred in concluding which provisions of the
    Rules had not been complied with. The judge, also  wrongly,  took  into
    account his conclusion that the claimant should  have  been  given  the
    opportunity to correct what he described as a minimal failure to comply
    with two trivial aspects of the Immigration Rules.

45. Once one  strips  out  the  errors  of  law  from  the  proportionality
    assessment, there remains little, if anything, in favour of  permitting
    the claimant leave to remain outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  In  the
    circumstances, without needing to elaborate further, it is  clear  that
    the article 8 proportionality assessment, if such was required at  all,
    was fatally flawed.

46. Further, on  the  present  case,  whilst  the  evidence  that  did  not
    accompany the  application  and  was  excluded  from  consideration  in
    respect of the  Rules,  could  potentially  be  brought  into  play  in
    relation to article 8, it does little to strengthen such an  article  8
    claim, as the claimant is not entitled  to  succeed  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 simply  by  the  degree  to  which  he  failed  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.


47. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Frances noted that the  grounds
    submitted that, following Miah [2012]  EWCA  Civ  261,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal wrongly applied the Near-miss principle in the  assessment  of
    proportionality.

48. "It is arguable that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    Evidential Flexibility Policy applied and it was unfair not to give the
    First (claimant) an opportunity to correct the omission, given that the
    first (claimant) had failed to  supply  specified  documents.  Further,
    contrary to Miah, the judge  appears  to  have  applied  the  near-miss
    principle  in  his  assessment  of  proportionality.  The  grounds  are
    arguable."

49. In Miah, Burnton LJ stated at �26, "In my judgement, there is no  Near-
    Miss principle applicable in the Immigration Rules.  The  Secretary  of
    State, and on appeal the Tribunal,  must  assess  the  strength  of  an
    article 8 claim, but the requirements of  immigration  control  is  not
    weakened by the degree of non-compliance with the  Immigration  Rules."
    It follows that it is not open to the Tribunal to allow the  appeal  on
    the basis of a near miss, as held in MM and SA (Pankina: near-miss).

50. Further, in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath said:

          "55.    Thus the balance drawn by the rules may be relevant to the
         consideration of proportionality......

         56.  Although the context of the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated  with  a
         formalised "near-miss" or "sliding scale" principle.....Mrs Huang's
         case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not turn on how
         close she had  come  to  compliance  with  rule  317,  but  on  the
         application of the family values which underlie that rule  and  are
         at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss under the  rules
         cannot provide substance to a human rights case which is  otherwise
         lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
         dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the  Secretary  of
         States' discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right...."

51.  The  facts  of  Patel  &  others  are  worth  summarising.  Mr  Alam's
    application for leave to remain as a  Tier  4  student  under  the  PBS
    system  was  refused  as  he  had  failed  to  provide   the   relevant
    documentation with his application.  By  the  time  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal he had produced  qualifying  bank  statements  but  the
    Tribunal held that they were excluded  from  consideration  by  section
    85A, but went on to regard the evidence as relevant to  article  8  and
    found the decision disproportionate on the basis that the appellant now
    met the requirements of the Rules.  The  Upper  Tribunal  reversed  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, finding that the judge  had  erred
    in treating the new evidence as effective compliance with the Rules for
    the purpose of article 8. The Supreme Court  considered  that  the  new
    evidence could be excluded  insofar  as  it  related  to  human  rights
    grounds and article 8  considerations,  and  could  take  the  evidence
    outside the scope of exception 2 in section 85A. However, on the  facts
    of the case, the Supreme Court found no error in the  approach  of  the
    Upper Tribunal, as there was little merit in the article 8 claim,  even
    if some weight was given to the unusual circumstances in which he  lost
    his ability to rely on the new evidence, because of  when  section  85A
    came into force. The evidence did not significantly improve  the  human
    rights case and there is no near miss or sliding scale principle to  be
    applied.


52. For the reasons set out herein, I  find  that  Judge  Duff  made  clear
    errors in respect of his consideration of the appeals in application of
    the Immigration Rules, even though he  ultimately  concluded  that  the
    appeals could not succeed under the Rules, the  degree  to  which  they
    failed to meet the Rules was in fact greater than the judge  concluded,
    which would also have a significant bearing on the  proportionality  of
    the decision under article 8.

53. As far as the near-miss argument is  concerned,  I  am  satisfied  that
    Judge Duff was not consciously seeking to apply a  near-miss  principle
    to the appeal, but the effect of referring to the failure  to  satisfy,
    "two minor aspects of the rules," and "trivial failures in  respect  of
    the immigration rules," as justification for the decision to allow  the
    appeal was to apply the  purported  near-miss  principle  to  the  case
    either independently or  as  part  of  the  article  8  proportionality
    assessment. That was also an error of law.

54. At the conclusion of the hearing before me, I reserved my  decision  on
    error of law. Mr Reynolds submitted that if I found only  an  error  of
    law in relation to Judge Duff going on to consider article  8  when  he
    found the decision was not in accordance with the law, I  could  remake
    the decision without any further hearing. However, if I found errors of
    law as contended for by the Secretary of State, he  submitted  that  it
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

55. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. However, the facts of this case are
    clear; it is the conclusions from and the application  of  the  law  to
    those facts which is in issue. In the circumstances, I see  no  purpose
    in remitting the appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  propose  to
    remake it in the Upper Tribunal.

56. Before doing so, given that I adjourned before reaching a  decision  on
    error of law, I consider  it  appropriate  to  allow  the  parties  the
    opportunity to make further representations  in  writing,  should  they
    choose to do so.

Conclusions:

57. For the reasons set out herein I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I reserve the remaking of the decision to the Upper Tribunal.

     I issue directions.

Consequential Directions

58. The representatives of the Secretary of State  and  the  claimants  may
    submit further representations in writing within 14 days of the receipt
    of this error of law decision.

59. The appeal should be relisted before myself at the  earliest  available
    date thereafter convenient to the parties.

60. Failing written  response,  I  will  proceed  to  remake  the  decision
    consistent with the conclusions made herein.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been set aside to be remade.
