                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Camp, promulgated on 1st September 2014 following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 20th  August  2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeals  of  the  Appellants,  whereupon  the  Appellants
    applied for, and were  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are a mother and two children.  The  mother,  the  first
    Appellant, was born on 20th  March  1976.   The  daughter,  the  second
    Appellant, was born on [ ] 1999.  The third  Appellant,  the  son,  was
    born on [ ] 2002.  Their sponsor is Mr Ming Wu, a British citizen,  and
    the husband of the first Appellant, and the father of  the  second  and
    third Appellants.  On 26th April 2016, the first Appellant applied  for
    entry clearance to settle in the United Kingdom  as  the  wife  of  the
    Sponsor,  and  the  two  children  as  his  daughter  and  son.   Their
    applications were refused on 29th July 2013, and an appeal against that
    decision was heard by Judge Camp on 20th August 2014.

 3. A feature of the facts in this case is that the first Appellant and the
    Sponsor married in 1998, and then divorced two years  later,  following
    which there was a period of twelve years when they were unmarried.  The
    Sponsor was in the United Kingdom for eight of  those  years  until  he
    returned to China for a visit in 2012, and at that stage  he  remarried
    the first Appellant, but this was after the Sponsor had acquired ILR in
    the United Kingdom.  When the British Embassy in  Beijing  undertook  a
    field visit, to ascertain the status and nature of this  marriage,  the
    first Appellant told  the  officials  that  she  and  the  Sponsor  had
    divorced so that the Sponsor could marry a British citizen to remain in
    the United  Kingdom.   In  their  interview  on  17th  July  2013,  she
    contradicted herself and said that they had divorced because of China's
    "one child" policy.  They had a girl and wanted a  boy  and  could  not
    legally achieve this while they  were  married.   The  first  Appellant
    completely denied having given a different explanation when interviewed
    on the field trip.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge heard evidence from the Sponsor that  he  had  visited  China
    from 16th April 2012 to 9th  July  2012  and  he  had  lived  with  the
    Appellants.  He referred to the telephone records  (page  322  onwards)
    and he pointed out how these calls were to  the  first  Appellant,  his
    wife.  The two children wanted to come to the United Kingdom.  He  said
    that they spoke some English and he produced photographs which included
    himself and the Appellants (page 263).  He had obtained his passport in
    March 2012, following the grant of ILR under the asylum legacy  policy.
    When cross-examined, he had said that he had loved his wife, and whilst
    it was true that he had a relationship with  someone  else  because  he
    wanted to remain in the United Kingdom, "his wife was  more  important"
    (see paragraph 12 of the determination).

 5. The judge held that the facts, whereupon the Sponsor had  divorced  his
    wife, the first Appellant, and then gone to the UK, and  only  returned
    back to China after having acquired ILR, were more compatible with  the
    first Appellant's original assertion to the field  trip  officers  that
    "the  Sponsor  wanted  to  obtain  British  nationality  therefore  the
    suggestion that it was the one child policy  which  brought  about  the
    difference" (paragraph 27).

 6. The judge also held that there was "contradictory  evidence  concerning
    the nature of telephone  calls  between  the  Sponsor  and  the  second
    Appellant", because one person said that they were  made  in  order  to
    enquire after the children, and the other said that it was because  the
    Sponsor loved the first Appellant.  The judge also said that the  first
    Appellant "displayed very little knowledge of the Sponsor's life in the
    United Kingdom" (paragraph 29).  There  were  therefore  doubts  as  to
    credibility of the evidence  raised  and  to  the  subsistence  of  the
    relationship and intention of the parties (paragraph 30).

 7. The judge also had doubts about the maintenance that the Sponsor  could
    provide for himself and his family.  He held that, "... at the date  of
    the decision, there was no evidence that the Sponsor's income  met  the
    requirements of the Rules."  He referred to "his P60 from the year 2013-
    2014, which was not issued until after April 2014" and he  added  that,
    "[t]his document does not necessarily shed light on  the  situation  at
    the date of the decision" (see paragraph 19).

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state  that  the  judge  erred  in  the  two
    following respects.  First, the judge took into account  the  voluntary
    nature of the Sponsor's departure from China and  that  he  could  have
    returned to China at any time that he wished.   The  judge  also  noted
    that the Appellant wife could not explain why  the  Sponsor  could  not
    return to China  to  support  the  family  there.   However,  this  was
    irrelevant to the question of whether this  was  a  genuine  subsisting
    marriage.

 9. Second, it was also an error for the judge to have  stated  that  there
    was no income that met the requirements of the Rules  with  respect  to
    maintenance because the P60 was not issued until after April 2014.  The
    date of the decision was 29th July 2013.  The P60 for the  year  ending
    5th April 2014  showed  a  gross  income  of  �25,147.84  (with  a  tax
    deduction of �3,139.60).  The prescribed amount for a spouse  with  two
    children is �24,800 (with �18,600 being for the spouse plus �3,800  for
    the first child and �2,400 for the second child).  When the application
    was submitted there was  a  letter  dated  15th  March  2013  from  the
    Sponsor's employer stating that the Sponsor  received  a  gross  annual
    salary of �24,960 or �480 per week.  Therefore the  judge's  conclusion
    with respect to maintenance was irrational.

10. On 10th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

11. On 17th November 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 8th April  2016,  Mr  Walsh,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellants.  He submitted  that  in  2012  the  Appellant
    acquired ILR and then went to China  and  spent  two  months  with  his
    family.  In 2000 he had divorced.  But one of the  children,  the  son,
    was actually born after the divorce.  He had then  entered  the  UK  in
    2004, but he had subsequently returned back to  his  family  in  China.
    The Respondent had contested even the fact that they  were  his  family
    but DNA evidence  now  proved  (see  page  244)  that  these  were  his
    children.  Mr Walsh submitted that error lay in  the  determination  in
    the following respects.

13.  First,  there  was  the  evidence  in  relation  to  the   maintenance
    requirement.  The Appellant  submitted  evidence  of  employment  since
    August 2012.  He worked as a head chef in a  Chinese  restaurant.   The
    application was made in  April  2013.   He  had  produced  evidence  of
    �16,640 for the period July 2012 to April 2013 (see paragraph 19).   He
    only had to show six  months'  employment  records.   The  evidence  he
    produced demonstrated that he had enough earnings of �24,800,  such  as
    to be able to meet the maintenance requirements.   For  the  six  month
    period before the application, the Appellant included  the  application
    wage slips (going back to August  2012).   This  showed  an  income  of
    �2,080.  For the appeal itself he  submitted  up  to  date  wage  slips
    (April 2013 to July 2014) (see pages 295  to  307  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle).

14. These include the wage slip for July 2013 (date of  decision  was  29th
    July 2013) which showed a monthly income of  �2,080.   The  other  wage
    slips were in line with this (see pages 96 to 97  of  the  Respondent's
    bundle).  All these amounts  showed  that  the  Appellant  was  at  the
    material time earning above the prescribed amount  of  �24,800  (�2,080
    PCN).  The judge did  not  reject  the  appeal  for  reasons  that  the
    prescribed documents were not  provided.   Instead,  the  judge  simply
    states that the wage slips before and  at  the  date  of  the  decision
    showed a gross income of �16,640 (but this referred  only  to  the  six
    month period) and this is wholly inaccurate as the wage  slips  show  a
    monthly wage slips of �2,080 gross per month.

15.  Second,  there  was  the  issue  of  accommodation.   There  is  often
    considerable confusion about the  requirement  to  show  accommodation.
    The Rules do not say that a person must specifically say  where  he  or
    she will live.  All that is required is a statutory undertaking by  the
    Sponsor that  accommodation  is  available.   It  is  then  up  to  the
    Respondent to show that this is untrue.  In the nature of things, it is
    possible to say that accommodation would be available,  but  then  when
    the  parties  arrive,  the  circumstances   could   change,   and   the
    accommodation could be provided elsewhere.  At ECP2.4  the  requirement
    is only to show that accommodation is available.  This the Sponsor  had
    done.  The judge was accordingly wrong to have said that,

         "The Sponsor's employer has now stated that the Appellants would be
         accommodated in different accommodation.  Again, this was not so at
         the date of the decision.  I am not able to say that  it  has  been
         shown that the proposed accommodation was adequate at the  date  of
         the decision" (see paragraph 20).

    This was wrong.

16. Third, there was the whole question about whether this  was  a  genuine
    and subsisting marriage.  The difficulty here was that  the  judge  had
    really embarked upon a consideration of this question  in  relation  to
    Article 8 (from paragraphs 35 onwards) because it is  in  this  section
    that the judge had said that the Appellant could not  explain  why  the
    Sponsor could not return to China to support the  family  there.   This
    was entirely relevant to the  question  of  whether  the  marriage  was
    genuine and subsisting.  Mr Walsh submitted that none  of  the  factors
    that the judge referred to, such as the motive for leaving  China,  the
    ability and willingness to return to China and so forth,  are  relevant
    to a consideration under the Immigration Rules of whether the  marriage
    is genuine and subsisting.  The question of whether  the  family  could
    live in China as a family unit may be relevant  to  classic  Article  8
    jurisprudence but has no application to the marriage/spouse's rule, and
    is only relevant to the "primary purpose rule" which  was  abolished  a
    long time ago.

17. For his part, Mr Diwnycz submitted that he would rely upon the Rule  24
    response.

18. First, if the judge did rely upon Appendix FM, not on  the  Immigration
    Rules, as far as the marriage is concerned,  there  was  a  substantial
    overlap between the two situations, such that the error could not be  a
    material error.

19. Second, the grounds did not show exactly  what  documents  were  relied
    upon to present the case that maintenance and accommodation  could  not
    have been an issue.  At page 284 of the Appellant's bundle, there is  a
    letter from Hotcha (Bristol) Limited which makes clear that there is  a
    three bedroom accommodation and that, "as part of his employment he  is
    provided free accommodation".

Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007).  My reasons are as follows.  First, there is an obvious error in
    the judge having held that the Sponsor could only point  to  income  of
    �16,640 because this referred to only the six month period, whereas  it
    was clear that with the gross monthly income of �2,080 per  month,  the
    Sponsor was earning �24,800,  which  was  considerably  more  than  was
    required for a wife and two  children  to  support.   Wage  slips  were
    provided right down to the date of the hearing.

21. Second, it is an error to  say  that  just  because  the  accommodation
    arrangements  might  have  changed  that   no   evidence   existed   of
    accommodation.  The judge held that, "the Sponsor's  employer  has  now
    stated  that  the  Appellants  would  be  accommodated   in   different
    accommodation" (see paragraph 20), but this does not matter because the
    only requirement under the Rules is to provide a statutory  declaration
    which identifies the accommodation.  The Appellant  had  complied  with
    the Rules and it was open to the Appellants to change their mind  under
    the Rules.

22. Third, however, and more importantly, there is the issue of whether the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting.  As indicated at the outset, it is
    a striking feature  of  this  case  that  the  Sponsor  and  the  first
    Appellant married  in  1998  and  divorced  in  2000,  with  the  third
    Appellant, the youngest child, definitely born on [ ]  2002,  following
    which the Sponsor went to the United Kingdom in 2004.  When questioned,
    the first Appellant initially said that the Sponsor wanted to  marry  a
    British citizen to remain in the United Kingdom.  At interview she said
    that they had divorced because of China's "one child" policy.

23. Whatever the situation, it does not follow that  because  parties  have
    divorced and remarried, that the  marriage  cannot  be  a  genuine  and
    subsisting one.  There may be any number of reasons  why  people  marry
    and divorce.  Some may be less noble than others.  It may well entirely
    have been the case that the parties did divorce in order to enable  the
    Sponsor to go to the UK to marry and acquire rights of  residence.   It
    may also have been the case that they divorced because  they  wanted  a
    second child and China's "one child"  policy  prevented  that.   It  is
    significant that the third Appellant was indeed born on [ ] 2002  after
    the divorce.

24. What is important, however, is that the enquiry into  the  question  of
    whether this is a genuine and subsisting marriage has to be even handed
    and free from preconceptions.  The Sponsor returned back to China to be
    with his family for two months.  There  were  telephone  calls  between
    them.  I do not regard it as inconsistent at all that the Sponsor  said
    that he made telephone calls to enquire  after  the  children  and  the
    first Appellant said that this was because he loved her.  Both could be
    the case, and one normally would expect this to be the  case,  where  a
    father is ringing his wife and children  in  the  same  household  (see
    paragraph 28).

25. However, the biggest error lies in the statement that  there  was  "the
    voluntary nature of the Sponsor's departure from  China  and  the  fact
    that he could have returned there to be with his wife and children  had
    he wished to do so" (see paragraph 32).  The judge  at  this  stage  is
    considering the application of the Immigration Rules and  the  question
    of whether this is a genuine and  subsisting  marriage,  but  has  made
    observations here which would have been relevant to Article  8  of  the
    ECHR, but not to the application of the Immigration Rules and the judge
    does indeed refer to Article 8 in terms  in  the  same  paragraph  (see
    paragraph 32).

26. This consideration used to  be  relevant  in  the  old  days  when  the
    "primary purpose" rule applied and indeed I note from the determination
    that concern was raised by the Appellant's representative at  the  time
    that the approach of the immigration authorities to this  marriage  had
    indeed been reminiscent of the "primary purpose"  appeals.   There  was
    indeed one question that, "I put it to you  that  your  remarriage  and
    [the Sponsor'] visit is purely to facilitate your entry to the UK" (see
    paragraph 18 of the determination).  That approach is  flawed  and  has
    coloured the subsequent determination of the appeal before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

27.  Accordingly,  I  find  that  there  is  an  error  of  law   in   this
    determination.

Remaking the Decision

28. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence submitted, and the submissions that  I  have  heard
    today.  I am remaking this decision by remitting this  appeal  back  to
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge, to be heard by a judge other than  Judge
    Camp because under Practice Statement 7.2(b) the nature  or  extent  of
    any judicial fact-finding which is necessary in order for the  decision
    in the appeal  to  be  remade  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective in Rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

29. This appeal is to be considered free from the shadow  of  the  "primary
    purpose" rule that has been a solid feature of these cases de  novo  at
    the earliest opportunity at Birmingham Sheldon Court.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original decision.  I remake  the  decision  as  follows.   This  appeal  is
remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal at Birmingham Sheldon Court  to  be
heard by a judge other than Judge Camp.

No anonymity direction is made.
