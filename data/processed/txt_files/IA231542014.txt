Representation:

For the claimant: Ms A Davies, instructed by Matrix Law
For the appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler promulgated 26.1.15, allowing on human
    rights grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse her  application  for  an  EEA  derivative
    residence card, pursuant to regulation 15A  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 12.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    19.3.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 14.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I found that there was an error of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination of Judge Butler should be set aside and remade.

 5. At �42 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal the judge found  that
    the appellant and her  daughter  did  not  have  derivative  rights  of
    residence in the UK. The judge found that the appellant and her husband
    were not credible witnesses and their accounts were  inconsistent.  The
    judge also concluded that if the appellant left, the whole family would
    leave with her. Although there is no compulsion for them to do so, that
    would be the choice of the family members. The appeal thus fell  to  be
    dismissed in relation to the Regulations. There has been no  appeal  or
    cross-appeal in relation to that part  of  the  decision  and  it  must
    stand.

 6. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    judge gave weight to immaterial matters, the hypothetical separation of
    the family; failed to give adequate weight to the fact that the  family
    would leave together with the children's best interests being to  leave
    with their parents; failed to apply section 117B of the 2002  Act;  and
    failed to provide adequate reasons for accepting the  claimed  lack  of
    contact between child and father in the light of serious issues  as  to
    the credibility of the appellant and her husband.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Chambers  considered  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the best interests of the children
    at �47, deciding at  �48  that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with both parents, "but it is not shown on a fair  reading
    of the decision that  the  judge  gave  weight  to  the  countervailing
    factors argued in the grounds. Permission is granted."

 8. In essence, the issue in the error of law hearing is whether the  judge
    should have gone on  to  consider  the  appellant's  case  outside  the
    Regulations on the basis of family life pursuant to article 8 ECHR, and
    whether that assessment, resulting the appeal  being  allowed  on  that
    ground only, was adequate.

 9.  I  find  that  having  found  that  the  claimant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Regulations, and there being no  removal  decision,
    there was no basis for the judge to go on to consider article  8  ECHR.
    An application for a derivative residence card is  an  application  for
    recognition of a status, a right to reside, it is  not  an  application
    for leave to remain or a change  in  immigration  status.  The  refusal
    decision did not require the claimant to leave  the  UK  and  explained
    that there had been no consideration as to whether  her  removal  would
    breach article 8 ECHR; if she wanted the Secretary of State to consider
    an application leave to remain on the basis of private or  family  life
    she should make a  separate  charged  application  on  the  appropriate
    specified form. A decision  to  refuse  to  issue  the  residence  card
    requested  cannot  in   the   circumstances   be   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellant's article 8 rights. Article 8 is not  a
    proper basis for allowing the claimant's appeal if  she  fails  on  the
    residence  card  point.  The  claimant  did  not  make  an  article   8
    application for leave to remain on the basis of private or family  life
    rights when she made the EEA application. She could have made  such  an
    application, and was not obliged to await a removal decision to do  so,
    but did not. The two routes are quite distinct and involve separate and
    different considerations. If an article 8 application is  not  made  to
    the Secretary of State it is not properly before the Tribunal and  has,
    for understandable reasons, not been considered  by  the  Secretary  of
    State. It would be wrong in principle for the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    make the one and only determination of a substantive human rights claim
    that has not been considered by the Secretary of  State,  though  there
    was a mechanism available to the claimant to seek such a consideration.



10. The claimant may seek to rely on JM (Liberia)  [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1402,
    which concerned a person who simultaneously claimed asylum and made  an
    article 8 ECHR claim. The Court of Appeal considered  whether  a  human
    rights claim could be considered in the absence of an  imminent  threat
    of removal from the UK. The case was solely about the jurisdiction of a
    Tribunal hear and determine an article 8 claim  raised  before  it  and
    turned on the particular construction of section 84(1)(g) of  the  2002
    Act. It is not authority for the proposition that a decision to  refuse
    a residence card will automatically  raise  human  rights  issues.   JM
    (Liberia) was decided long before the Immigration  Rules  incorporated,
    in 2012, article 8 family and private life  claims,  so  as  to  render
    decisions of the Secretary of State article 8 compliant.  It  has  been
    pointed out elsewhere that if the First-tier Tribunal  was  obliged  to
    consider an article 8 claim on an EEA application, where it  has  never
    been considered by the Secretary of State, it would  be  tantamount  to
    granting carte blanche to avoid making an  proper  application  on  the
    correct form and accompanied by the correct fee rather  than  the  non-
    chargeable EEA application process.

11. In any event, JM (Liberia) is rather put in doubt by FK (Kenya) v  SSHD
    [2010] EWCA Civ 1302, Lord Justice Sullivan observed,

         "Question (iii): family life. Before dealing with this  question  I
         would observe that it is very doubtful whether it  was  appropriate
         for the Article 8 issues raised  by  the  appellant  to  have  been
         resolved at this stage when there had been no removal decision.  If
         and when a removal decision is made the appellant will be  able  to
         appeal against that decision and as part of that appeal he will  be
         able to include Article 8 grounds in his appeal. It will of  course
         be for the Secretary of State  to  decide  whether  to  deport  the
         appellant as a  person  who  has  committed  criminal  offences  or
         whether he should be removed under the Immigration Rules.  It  will
         be for the Tribunal at the stage  of  any  appeal  against  such  a
         decision to weigh the relevant factors as they exist at that  time.
         It seems to me therefore that it was  at  best  premature  for  the
         Tribunal to be asked to  consider  the  Article  8  issue  in  this
         appeal."

12. As it happens, in that case the appellant  had  asked  the  Immigration
    Judge to consider the Article 8 issue and Lord  Justice  Sullivan  said
    that "the appellant can hardly complain  now  that  that  is  what  the
    Immigration  Judge  proceeded  to  do,"  the  appellant  appealing  the
    decision.

13. It is arguable that in line with the cases of Lamichhane v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2012]  EWCA  Civ  260  and  Jaff  (s.120
    notice; statement of "additional grounds") [2012] UKUT  00396(IAC),  in
    the absence of a section 120 notice, there is no jurisdiction  for  the
    Tribunal to consider any ground  for  the  grant  of  leave  to  remain
    different from that which was  the  subject  of  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State appealed against. An appellant on  whom  no  section
    120 notice has been served may not raise before the Tribunal any ground
    for the grant of leave to remain different  from  that  which  was  the
    subject of the decision of the Secretary  of  State  appealed  against.
    However, section 120 relates to an application to enter  or  remain  in
    the UK, or an immigration decision under section  82  is  made  against
    him. In the circumstances, it is doubtful that section 120  applies  to
    an EEA case.

14. In Ahmed [2013] UKUT 0089, the case now the subject of a  reference  to
    the CJEU as NA, the issue was conceded by  the  respondent.  There  the
    court consider the question, 'Does the fact that her children  are  EEA
    nationals mean that the decision refusing to grant her a residence card
    violates her right to respect for family life under Article 8 ECHR?' It
    was submitted that although the decision at issue in the case - refusal
    of a permanent residence card - "was not a removal decision,  it  would
    appear, on JM (Liberia) [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1402  principles,  that  the
    Tribunal should  consider  the  case  on  the  basis  that  a  putative
    consequence of the  refusal  decision  is  that  the  respondent  would
    proceed to direct her removal to Pakistan." The Tribunal  proceeded  on
    that basis.

15. However, the decision by the Upper Tribunal in Ahmed  to  consider  the
    article 8 arguments when urged to do so by both parties in the peculiar
    circumstances of that case, is not authority for the  proposition  that
    the Upper Tribunal is obliged to  determine  a  putative  human  rights
    claim in the context of an appeal  relating  to  the  EEA  Regulations,
    especially when it has not been addressed in the original  decision  of
    the Secretary of State. The Upper  Tribunal  in  Ahmed  considered  the
    argument in respect of article 8 only because it was  invited  to,  and
    nobody suggested that it would be inappropriate for it to do so.

16. To the extent that article 8 considerations arise on the facts  of  the
    present case, they do so purely by virtue of article 8 being raised  in
    the grounds of appeal. It follows that article 8 can only be considered
    on the same basis as suggested by Sullivan LJ in  FK  (Kenya),  namely,
    whether the refusal of a residence card amounts to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the claimant's right to family  life.  It  is  not  a
    question  whether  her  enforced  removal  would  amount  to   such   a
    disproportionate interference. On the facts of this case, the  decision
    to refuse to grant an EEA  residence  card  cannot  be  regarded  as  a
    sufficiently interference with the claimant's private and  family  life
    rights so as to engage article 8 at all.

17. In any event, the article 8 assessment of Judge Butler was flawed for a
    number of reasons. First, the judge launched straight  into  article  8
    ECHR without ever considering Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE.  If  the
    judge was entitled to consider private  and  family  life  at  all,  he
    should have done  so  first  through  the  prism  of  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE. There was no  such  consideration.  Neither  did  the
    judge consider in the proportionality assessment, as he was required to
    do so, the public interest considerations under  section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act. Neither did the judge make any proper  consideration  in  the
    assessment of the best interests of the child apply the  correct  legal
    principles from Zoumbas  and  EV  (Philippines).  I  reject  Ms  Davies
    submissions that these matters could all be somehow  divined  from  the
    decision read as a whole.

18. It follows that the decision cannot stand and must  be  set  aside  and
    remade, preserving the finding that the  claimant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the  Regulations  for  the  derivative  residence  card
    sought.

19. In remaking the decision, taking account of the fact  that  the  appeal
    fails under the Regulations, I find, for the reasons set out above that
    even though article 8 is raised in the grounds of appeal to the  First-
    tier Tribunal, there is no basis or need to consider article 8  private
    and family life. I find that the decision of the Secretary of State  to
    refuse to issue the residence card sought does not amount to such grave
    interference with the claimant's or her child's private and family life
    rights so as to even begin to engage article 8  ECHR  at  all.  In  the
    circumstances, I consider that issue no further.

Conclusions:

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
