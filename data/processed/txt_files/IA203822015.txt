Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Mair (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant a citizen of Pakistan, appeals  with  permission  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Saffer) promulgated on 3rd December 2015, in  which  it  dismissed  her
    appeal against the Respondent's refusal of 15th May 2015, to grant  her
    leave to remain in the UK.

 2. Included in her application are  two  dependant  children.  Her  eldest
    child Iman is now an adult born 6th September  1994  and  her  youngest
    child Jamal,  is  a  minor  born  26th  November  1999.   Both  of  the
    Appellant's children are citizens of Pakistan.

Background

 3. The Appellant entered the UK, with her two children on 27th  May  2006,
    as a spouse with valid entry clearance until 8th  May  2008.  She  came
    here to join Mr Abid Hussain (the  father  of  Iman  and  Jamal).   Her
    intention, on entry, was to settle here.

 4. However took no steps to regularise her position on expiry of her  visa
    in May 2008.  She only realised she  said,  that  she  was  in  the  UK
    without  leave  when  she  made  enquiries  about   acquiring   British
    citizenship in 2012.  She said that she had relied upon  her  husband's
    relatives to deal with any visa issues because they had dealt with  her
    original application.

 5. In 2012 when she applied for citizenship she said, she was living  with
    her husband and the two children.  She said that she  and  her  husband
    are now estranged.  It would seem that there is a  question  mark  over
    the Appellant's estranged husband's status.  There is also  a  question
    mark  about  his  whereabouts.   The  Appellant  says  that  since  the
    estrangement took place, neither she  nor  the  children  know  of  his
    whereabouts.

The Application

 6. The  Appellant  applied  originally  for  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration Rules and outside the Rules under Article  8  ECHR  on  3rd
    September 2012. The application was refused. Following judicial  review
    proceedings however, the Respondent made a further decision on 15th May
    2015, to refuse the Appellant leave to  remain.   The  applications  of
    both Iman and Jamal as dependants of  their  mother,  were  refused  in
    line.  The Appellant appealed the refusal to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal Hearing

 7. When her appeal came before the FtT, Judge Saffer heard  evidence  from
    the Appellant, her eldest son Iman (now an  adult)  and  various  other
    relatives  and  friends.   The  judge  recorded  that  Jamal  was  "too
    stressed" to attend  the  hearing  but  nevertheless  had  submitted  a
    statement.  The judge clearly had regard to that statement  because  he
    makes reference to it at [16].

 8. In addition he notes the evidence of the other  relatives;  letters  of
    support; a GP's report concerning the Appellant together with potential
    job offers for both the Appellant and Iman.  He also took into  account
    letters from Jamal's school.

 9. After considering that large  body  of  evidence,  the  judge  directed
    himself with reference to the Immigration Rules,  Article  8  ECHR  and
    Section 55 Borders and Immigration Act "best interests of  the  child".
    He also referred to a large amount of current  jurisprudence  which  he
    sets out at [8].

10. Having considered all those matters the judge dismissed the Appellant's
    appeal on all grounds and of course the appeals of Iman and Jamal since
    they fall into line with hers.

Permission to Appeal

11. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal the judge's decision  on
    the grounds that the judge had not properly  directed  himself  on  the
    best interests of the child (Jamal) and  in  particular  the  important
    stage which Jamal had reached in his education.  It was also said  that
    the judge had not  properly  considered  Article  8  ECHR  because  the
    Appellant's estranged husband is not  subject  to  any  deportation  or
    removal order and it was claimed is seeking legal guidance  to  resolve
    the issues which occur over his status. The grounds conclude by  saying
    that the Appellant's husband had no intention  of  leaving  the  United
    Kingdom.

12. It was also claimed in the grounds  that  the  judge  had  assumed  the
    extent of family relationships in Pakistan.  There is nowhere  for  the
    Appellant and her two sons to go to in Pakistan, because her mother and
    sister are now leaving Pakistan for Ireland.  Finally, it  was  claimed
    that the judge had failed to factor in the job offer which is available
    to the Appellant, because he found it was not genuine.

13. Permission to appeal was granted in the following terms:

         "2.  It is arguable as  averred  in  the  first  paragraph  of  the
             grounds that the judge did not properly direct himself  as  to
             the  best  interests  of  Jamal.   The  judge  considers   the
             disruption to Jamal's education of  moving  to  Pakistan,  but
             arguably did not take into account the stage his education had
             reached, namely that it was said he  was  studying  for  GCSEs
             [16].  In addition, although the judge did direct  himself  to
             the relevant case-law (see [8] [b]) as to long  residence,  it
             is arguable he did not take into account the  significance  of
             long residence in Jamal's  case,  namely  more  than  7  years
             continuous residence in the UK during a particularly formative
             period in a child's life (6ï¿½ -16).  The judge found that Jamal
             could not fulfil the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  because
             when the application was originally made (in 2012) he had  not
             lived in the UK for 7 years.  The judge then  determined  that
             there was no  'gap'  so  that  Article  8  did  not  fall  for
             consideration outside the rules, but it is arguable that  here
             was a 'gap', given at least that Jamal  had  by  the  date  of
             decision, lived in the UK for 8 years and by the date  of  the
             hearing for 9 years and was now a  "qualifying  child"  within
             the meaning of section 117 of the 2002 Act.  When  considering
             proportionality in the alternative, the judge  arguably  erred
             in finding that Jamal  was  not  a  'qualifying  child'  [49].
             Although the judge did then find that it  was  reasonable  for
             Jamal to reintegrate to life in Pakistan he referred  back  at
             [49] for his reasoning to the earlier sections of his decision
             where he did not specifically consider the significance  of  7
             years' residence at a formative stage because of  his  finding
             about paragraph 276ADE.

           3.   I  consider  the  other  parts  of  the  grounds  are   mere
             disagreements with the judge's  sustainable  factual  findings
             about ties to relatives in  Pakistan  and  the  reality  of  a
             skilled job offer for  the  appellant  who  not  only  had  no
             qualifications or experience, but had  never  worked  at  all.
             Although the appellant's husband might not be the subject of a
             removal notice, there was no basis for concluding  that  there
             would be anything preventing his removal to  Pakistan  or  any
             legal basis for his remaining in the UK  given  that  some  18
             months had passed since  his  refusal  of  naturalisation  and
             there  was  no  indication  that  he  had  mounted  any  legal
             challenge to the respondent's decision or made any application
             to remain in the UK.

          4.  I do not however restrict the grounds which may be argued,  as
             if the judge did err in  his  consideration  of  Jamal's  best
             interests, then his approach to Article 8 generally  may  fall
             for consideration, particularly so far as ties to  the  larger
             family in the UK are concerned (third para grounds)."

     Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law such that the decision
    must be set aside and remade.

The UT Hearing

14. Before me Ms Mair appeared for the  Appellant,  Ms  Pettersen  for  the
    Respondent.  Both representatives made submissions.   Ms  Mair  in  her
    submission pointed out that the judge had failed to provide  sufficient
    reasons to show  that  he  had  turned  his  mind  to  whether  it  was
    reasonable for Jamal to relocate to Pakistan.   She  pointed  out  that
    there was substantial  case  law  dealing  with  long  residence,  when
    children have been here in their formative years.  She  submitted  that
    Jamal came to the UK age 6 and is now 16 years of  age.   She  accepted
    that he has now finished his GCSE course but said  the  judge  did  not
    make a complete assessment when taking into account  what  amounted  to
    Jamal's best interests.  She referred to the Upper Tribunal decision in
    PD and Others (Article 8 - conjoined family claims)  Sri  Lanka  [2016]
    UKUT 00108 (IAC) as persuasive authority that the  decision  should  be
    set aside and remitted to the FtT for a fresh hearing.

15. Ms Pettersen on behalf of  the  Respondent  referred  to  her  Rule  24
    Response.  She said that the decision should stand because  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, as the fact-finder,  had  taken  into  account  all  the
    relevant evidence before it.  It was also clear from a reading  of  the
    decision that the judge had had regard to the evidence before  him  and
    made a detailed assessment, supported by reasons, showing why it  would
    not be unreasonable to expect Jamal to leave  the  United  Kingdom  and
    accompany his mother back to Pakistan as part of her family unit.

16. The judge had referred to the disruption to Jamal's education of moving
    to Pakistan.  It is clear that the judge fully appreciated  that  Jamal
    had been here for  a  significant  amount  of  time,  but  nevertheless
    concluded as he was entitled to do, that it was  not  unreasonable  for
    Jamal to return to his home country accompanied by his mother and elder
    brother.

Consideration

17. I find that the decision of Judge Saffer does not warrant setting aside
    for material error.  My reasons for so finding are set out here below.

18. It is clear from a full reading of the  decision  that  the  judge  has
    conducted a full and thorough hearing and from what I can see has taken
    account of all the evidence placed before  him.  In  his  decision,  he
    devotes several lengthy paragraphs to setting out the Appellant's claim
    and recording the evidence before  him.  It  is  clear  that  he  fully
    recorded Jamal's undated statement because that full account is set out
    in [16].  Equally he sets out at length his reasons  for  finding  that
    none of the Appellants  can  come  within  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    despite what is said in the grounds, I find that in [45]  to  [49],  he
    considers Article 8 ECHR in the alternative.

19. The main ground on which permission appears to have granted relates  to
    Jamal and whether the judge failed to take into account, whether  Jamal
    was a qualifying child under Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.   It  was
    said any such failure would then impact on whether  he  had  reached  a
    critical stage in  his  education  and  life  particularly  as  he  was
    studying for GCSEs examinations.  (By the time of  the  hearing  before
    me, Jamal had taken his GCSE's.)  I find that when the  judge  said  at
    [49] "The children are not British (Zoumbas) or qualifying children for
    the purpose of Section 117 of the 2002 Act" that  may  well  have  been
    incorrect, but the fact is that  the  decision  shows  that  the  judge
    prudently went on to consider the evidence in the  alternative,  as  if
    Jamal were a qualifying child. He directs himself at [45] that he  must
    consider a component of reasonableness in relation  to  Jamal  which  I
    find echoes the wording of the question which  Section  117B(6)  poses,
    namely is it reasonable to expect a child to accompany  its  parent  to
    their country of origin?

20. It is clear from a full reading of the decision that this is a question
    which the judge ask himself, in substance, albeit  not  in  form  [48].
    The judge has considered that Jamal is a child  under  the  age  of  18
    years who has lived in the United Kingdom for several years.  Criticism
    has been made that  the  judge  has  ignored  the  case  law  on  "long
    residence" but I disagree. Each case is fact sensitive  and  the  judge
    has clearly considered the test of reasonableness [48].  He  has  taken
    into account Jamal's education but has found as a fact that Jamal could
    continue his schooling in Pakistan.  He did not accept that Jamal  does
    not speak Urdu. He accepted that Jamal would take  a  little  while  to
    adjust but looking as the factors  including  those  contained  in  the
    evidence before him, he carried out  the  appropriate  assessment  with
    reference to EV Philippines and AM Malawi and decided that Jamal's best
    interests lie in returning to Pakistan with his mother.

21. I can see nothing perverse in those findings. There is nothing to  show
    that  the  judge  has  ignored  evidence  that  is  favourable  to  the
    appellant. There is a requirement in any appeal that a  judge  consider
    all available evidence. This is what the judge did. It was open to  the
    judge to attach weight to the various factors contained in the evidence
    before him.  He has made findings which were reasonably open to him  on
    that  evidence.   Whilst  I  accept  another  judge  may   have   found
    differently, that is not the test before me.  The judge's findings  are
    fully reasoned and are ones which were open to him to make.  Indeed  he
    acknowledged that the Appellant and her family, including Jamal,  would
    no doubt suffer a degree of hardship upon return to Pakistan, and would
    need to adapt, but there were no significant factors  preventing  that,
    nor was it unreasonable for Jamal, notwithstanding his  long  residence
    in the UK, to return with his mother to their country of nationality.


Notice of Decision

There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal. The decision therefore stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
