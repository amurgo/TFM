For the appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Presenting Officer.
For the respondent:    No appearance.


                            DIRECTIONS TO PARTIES

1.    At the hearing on 31 May 2019,  there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on
    behalf of Mr  Marlon  Samuel  (hereafter  the  "claimant").  Mr  Walker
    informed me that the respondent's records indicate  that  the  claimant
    was released from detention in January 2019. Mr Walker submitted a copy
    of the claimant's PNC record which appears to indicate that he was made
    the subject of an order which prevented him from carrying  out  certain
    actions or activities within certain areas, including [D~] Way.

2.    It is not clear  whether  the  terms  of  the  Order  meant  that  the
    claimant was unable to live at, or have access to, 33 [D~] Way so as to
    receive the Notice of Hearing dated 1 May 2019 that was sent to him for
    the case management review hearing on 31 May 2019. This is the  address
    that the Upper Tribunal was  most  recently  provided  for  service  of
    documents on the claimant.

3.    Regal Solicitors, the claimant's representatives, informed  the  Upper
    Tribunal by a facsimile message on 31 January 2019 that  they  were  no
    longer acting for him.

4.    The  claimant  has  not  notified  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  he  has
    instructed any other solicitor or representative, nor has  he  notified
    the Upper Tribunal of his current address if he is no  longer  able  to
    live at, or have access to correspondence sent to him at 33 [D~] Way.

5.    Accordingly, I concluded that the Notice of Hearing dated 1  May  2019
    was duly served on the  claimant.  Given  that  the  claimant  has  not
    contacted the Upper Tribunal  to  inform  the  Upper  Tribunal  of  his
    current address for service of  documents  and  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective, I decided to exercise my discretion  and  proceed
    with the hearing.

6.    By an Order dated 13 March 2018,  the  Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
    Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  it  and  set  aside  the  following
    decisions:

    (i)    the decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Canavan  dated  21  March
         2016; and

    (ii)   the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  Carroll  dated  3
         September 2015.

7.    This means  that  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
     State's decision dated 24 April 2013  remains  outstanding  before  the
     First-tier Tribunal.

8.    At the hearing on 31 May 2019, I requested Mr  Walker  to  notify  the
     Upper Tribunal in writing, on or before 14  June  2019,  the  following
     information:

    (i)    the date of the claimant's release from detention;

    (ii)   the address to which he was released; and

    (iii)  clarity as to the conditions impose  upon  him;  in  particular,
         whether  he  was  permitted  to  live  at,  or   have   access   to
         correspondence sent to him at, 33 [D~] Way.

    Such information will assist the First-tier Tribunal when  it  re-lists
    the claimant's appeal for hearing.

9.    On 5 June 2019, the Upper Tribunal  received  from  the  Secretary  of
    State documents which included the following:

    (i)    A cover letter dated 5 June 2019.

    (ii)   The claimant's bail  conditions  dated  7  February  2019.  This
         imposes,  inter  alia,  a  residence  condition,  but  the  address
         specified is not 33 [D~] Way.

    (iii)  A copy of a decision letter dated 30 July 2018.

10.   The First-tier Tribunal will no doubt wish to consider very  carefully
    the address/addresses to which the  Notice  of  Hearing  for  the  next
    hearing should be sent, if the claimant  does  not  notify  it  of  his
    current address and/or his new representatives.
