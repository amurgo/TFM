Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr R. Solomon, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant is a citizen of Romania who was born on 5
    November 1968.  He is said to have arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2007.

 2. On 22 September 2015 a decision was made by the respondent  to  make  a
    deportation order against the appellant under the Immigration (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations"). The  appellant
    appealed against that decision and his appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Juss ("the FtJ") at a hearing at Birmingham on  30  June
    2016.

 3. The respondent's decision to make  a  deportation  order  followed  the
    appellant's conviction on 16 May 2013 for an offence under The Proceeds
    of Crime Act 2002, and is described as an offence involving  conversion
    or transfer of criminal property, that offence having  occurred  on  21
    December 2012, although it seems to me that the offence occurred not on
    one single date but over a period of time. He was  sentenced  to  three
    and a half years' imprisonment on 30 January 2014.

 4. The FtJ set out the circumstances of the  offence  which  involved  the
    diversion of a payment of funds for what seems to have been a  building
    project.  The payment for the project was �479,985 but it was  diverted
    to  another  account  related  to  the  appellant.  Some  �209,000  was
    transferred. The appellant was stopped as he  attempted  to  leave  the
    country with �56,100 hidden in the lining of his suitcase.

 5. In his decision the FtJ referred to the OASys report and what  it  said
    about the risk of reoffending which was described  as  low.  There  was
    also another issue raised in the OASys Report in  terms  of  any  other
    risks that there may be but that was not an issue that featured in  the
    appeal and it is not necessary for me to  say  anything  further  about
    that.

 6. In submissions on behalf of the  respondent  the  decision  letter  was
    relied on.  It appears that there was  some  possible  misunderstanding
    about the level of protection that the appellant was afforded under the
    EEA Regulations in that the FtJ recorded that the appellant could  only
    be removed on imperative grounds.   Those imperative grounds only apply
    where someone has had 10 years' residence in the UK which the appellant
    manifestly did not have.

 7. There are various references in  the  judge's  decision  to  imperative
    grounds,  at  [10]-[13]  and  [19],  the  latter   occurring   in   his
    consideration of Article 8 of  the  ECHR.   The  FtJ  referred  to  the
    appellant's personal circumstances including his domestic circumstances
    and his wife's ill-health.  He concluded that the appellant presented a
    low risk of harm to the public.  That seems to have been the conclusion
    of the OASys report in terms of the Proceeds of Crime Act offence.

 8. The FtJ recorded at [14] that the  appellant's  offence  was  the  only
    offence that he had been convicted of, that the risk  of  harm  to  the
    public was in the lowest category of risk possible to specify, and that
    it was described as a one-off offence.

 9. At [15] he referred to the appellant's wife's ill-health and the effect
    that this has had on the appellant and no doubt, and obviously, on  his
    wife too, and the care that he provides for her.

10. In the respondent's grounds of appeal it is argued that the  FtJ  erred
    in law in his conclusion that the appellant was entitled to the highest
    level of protection, namely that achieved by having 10 years' residence
    in the UK. Even without taking into account the time that the appellant
    had spent in prison he did not benefit from that level  of  protection.
    It is argued that the  FtJ  mistook  a  concession  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent as to permanent residence for  a  concession  on  10  years'
    residence, and indeed that concession is in the  respondent's  decision
    letter at [13] and [14]. There is no concession in the decision  letter
    as to imperative grounds.

11. Accordingly, it is argued that the FtJ applied a  higher  threshold  of
    protection than the appellant was entitled to and  that  that  infected
    the whole of his decision.  There  is  also  argument  in  relation  to
    Article 8 of the  ECHR  which  concerns  the  failure  of  the  FtJ  to
    recognise the factors set  out  in  section  117  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  ("the  2002  Act")  in  terms  of  the
    considerations to be taken into account, in particular under s.117C.

12. In the 'rule 24' response on behalf of the appellant it is argued  that
    whatever may be said about any errors of law  in  the  FtJ's  decision,
    those errors of law are not material.

13. In submissions on behalf of the respondent, Mr Melvin contended that it
    was clear, irrespective of any  misunderstanding,  that  the  appellant
    could not benefit from imperative grounds and the FtJ's  error  clearly
    affected the whole of his decision.

14. In terms of whether the FtJ's finding in terms of genuine, present  and
    sufficiently serious risk meant that any error of law on the imperative
    grounds issue was not material, Mr  Melvin  referred  to  the  decision
    letter in which there is a wholesale rejection of the  contention  that
    the appellant represents  a  low  risk  of  reoffending.  It  was  also
    submitted that the FtJ had not considered the decision letter  and  the
    points made on the issue of the risk of  reoffending.   Again,  it  was
    reiterated that having applied the  wrong  test  as  to  the  level  of
    protection the judge ought to  have  assessed  the  issue  of  risk  of
    reoffending in the light of the correct filter, as it were, in terms of
    the level of protection.

15. In submissions, Mr Solomon relied on the rule 24 response to the effect
    that any errors of law on the part of the FtJ were not material.

    Conclusions

16. In the EEA Regulations, specifically reg. 21, it states that a relevant
    decision must not be taken  except  on  imperative  grounds  of  public
    security in respect of an EEA national who has resided in the UK for  a
    continuous period of at least 10 years prior to the relevant decision.

17. Under reg. 21(3), a relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a
    person with a permanent right of residence  under  reg.  15  except  on
    serious grounds of public policy or public security. It is accepted  by
    the parties that there is plainly a material difference  between  these
    two levels of protection, 'imperative' involving the  higher  threshold
    of protection.

18. I am entirely satisfied that the FtJ erred in  law  in  his  conclusion
    that the appellant was entitled to the higher level of protection, that
    is to say on imperative grounds. That plainly cannot be the case having
    regard, at the very least, to the length of time that the appellant has
    been in the UK.  On his own account he arrived in 2007. There is no  10
    years' residence therefore and was not  at  the  time  of  the  hearing
    before the FtJ.  That is the case without even taking into account  the
    length of time that the appellant has  spent  in  prison  which  itself
    involves  consideration  of  the  extent  to  which  that   period   of
    imprisonment qualifies towards the 10 years' residence.

19. I am also satisfied that he  erred  in  law  in  his  consideration  of
    Article 8 of  the  ECHR  in  the  failure  to  take  into  account  the
    provisions of s.117 of the 2002 Act.  He did refer to s.117 but not  in
    a self-contained way under the Article 8 assessment.

20. However, the fact of the matter is that there is an unequivocal finding
    that  the  appellant  represents  a  low  risk  of  reoffending.   That
    assessment is consistent with what is  in  the  OASys  report.  I  have
    considered the OASys report in detail for myself and  it  is  clear  in
    this respect. The FtJ was entitled to come to the conclusion  that  the
    appellant does represent a low risk of reoffending notwithstanding  the
    matters that are argued in the decision letter.

21. It seems to me that the argument on  behalf  of  the  respondent  would
    perhaps have been a  sustainable  one,  subject  to  argument,  if  the
    grounds upon which permission to appeal  was  sought  and  granted  had
    raised the issue of the risk of reoffending but they do not.  It is not
    sufficient   simply   to   attack   the   FtJ's   decision    on    the
    imperative/serious grounds issue without making the  distinct  argument
    in relation to the risk of reoffending.  The FtJ made an assessment  of
    the risk of reoffending which in my judgement was open to  him  on  the
    evidence.

22. In those circumstances, notwithstanding the error of law on the part of
    the FtJ, it is not an error of law that requires the decision to be set
    aside because it is not material to the outcome.

23. Similarly, having concluded that the appellant met the requirements  of
    the EEA Regulations in terms of resisting deportation because  he  does
    not represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society,  it  was  not
    necessary for him to go on to consider Article 8 of the ECHR.

24. Accordingly, again notwithstanding the error in  his  assessment  under
    Article 8, that is not an error that is material to the outcome of  the
    appeal and does not therefore require the decision to be set aside.

25. I should point out also that at [13] of the decision the FtJ said  that
    the appellant could only be deported on imperative  grounds  of  public
    security and then said that "What this means is that he must present  a
    'genuine and present threat to the fundamental interests of society  or
    of the member state concerned'".  That seems to me to be  a  conflation
    of the two separate issues of the level of protection to be afforded to
    the appellant and the consideration of whether he represents a genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat. Nevertheless, again that error
    is not material to the outcome of the appeal and is not a  matter  that
    was relied on in argument on behalf of the respondent.

26. In all these circumstances, the respondent's appeal  is  dismissed  and
    the decision of the First-tier Judge is to stand.

    Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law, but its decision is not  set  aside,  and  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal is to stand.
