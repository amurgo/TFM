                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction

    1. The appellant is now 25 years old.  She is a citizen  of  Bangladesh,
       born there in November 1993.  Her mother, Humayra  Nargis,  was  also
       born in Bangladesh and has retained her Bangladeshi citizenship,  but
       she is also now an Italian citizen and she is living and  working  in
       London.

    2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against  a  refusal
       in December 2016 of her application for a residence card.  The  basis
       of the application was that the appellant, as she  claimed,  was  the
       dependent  child  aged  over  21  of  her  mother,  an  EEA  national
       exercising Treaty rights by working in the UK.

    3. The only contentious issue in the appeal was  whether  the  appellant
       was dependent on her mother.  Following a hearing on 26  March  2018,
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Widdup held  that  the  appellant  had  not
       discharged the burden of proof  of  her  claimed  dependency  on  her
       mother.  The judge said, at [37] in the Decision, that  "There  is  a
       lack of clear evidence as to what the  Appellant's  essential  living
       costs are and a lack of evidence about her spending.  Her  income  is
       about �40pw more than that of her mother.  Taking all  these  factors
       into account I am not satisfied that  the  Appellant  is  financially
       dependent on her mother."

    4. The First-tier Tribunal Decision states that it was promulgated on 29
       March 2018, but the appellant says she did not receive it until after
       becoming alerted to its existence in November 2018 when a Certificate
       of Application granted in May 2018 that  enabled  her  to  work  here
       while her appeal was pending was not renewed.  Her application to the
       First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal was then made in January
       2019.  The First-tier Tribunal  refused  permission  to  appeal,  but
       permission was granted on the  papers  on  12  March  2019  by  Upper
       Tribunal Judge Grubb, who concluded  that  since  the  appellant  was
       accepted as truthful in her evidence, "it is arguable that the  judge
       has reached [an] irrational or inadequately reasoned finding that she
       is not dependent on her mother for at least  some  of  her  essential
       needs and so is dependent."

    5. The grant of permission involves the grant of any extension  of  time
       the appellant required, albeit UTJ Grubb did not address  that  issue
       separately in the permission decision.  The matter thus  came  before
       us to determine whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

  Context - Dependency

    6. FtTJ Widdup was correct to understand that the  burden  of  proof  of
       dependency was  on  the  appellant.   As  the  respondent's  Guidance
       confirms for Home Office decision-makers considering such  cases,  so
       far as material:

        i. "A child aged 21 or over ... must prove they  are  dependent  on
           the EEA national sponsor ... ."

       ii. "Where dependency is necessary, the family member does not  need
           to be living or have  lived  in  an  EEA  state  where  the  EEA
           national sponsor also lives or has lived.  Their  dependency  on
           the EEA national sponsor does not need to  have  existed  before
           they came to the UK."

      iii. "... if the applicant cannot meet their essential  living  needs
           without the financial support of the EEA national, they must  be
           considered dependent even if they also receive financial support
           of income somewhere else.
           You do not need to consider the reasons why the applicant  needs
           the financial support  or  whether  they  are  able  to  support
           themselves by working.
           Essential  needs  include  accommodation,  utilities  and  food.
           Dependency will normally be shown by  financial  documents  that
           show money being sent by the sponsor to the applicant.
           If the applicant is receiving support from the EEA  national  as
           well as others, they must show that the  support  from  the  EEA
           national is supporting their essential needs.
           The applicant does not need to be dependent on the EEA  national
           to meet all or most of their essential needs.  For  example,  an
           applicant can still be considered dependent if  they  receive  a
           pension to cover half of their essential needs  and  money  from
           the relevant EEA national to cover the other half."

    7. The Judge made the following basic findings:

         - at [12], that the appellant's mother had net earnings  of  about
           �750 per month (�175 per week - although later, at [34], he said
           they were only �165 per week),  and  received  housing  benefit,
           child benefit and child tax credits;

         - at [18]-[19], that the appellant's father, who it seems is still
           married to her mother, was living in Rome, not as  part  of  the
           household in London, although he visited from time to  time  and
           sent money to support his family  (some  �2,000  had  been  sent
           during Q1 2018, for example);

         - at [30]-[31], that the appellant was earning �156 per week, net,
           from an employment with ISS, plus  c.�50  per  week  gross  from
           private tuition;

         - at [13] and [20], that the appellant was living with her  mother
           rent free, her mother paying  rent  of  �2,100  per  month  plus
           utilities bills and doing the shopping (which we  take  to  mean
           paying for food and household essentials).

    8. The Judge was correct, therefore, to find that the appellant's earned
       income was a little higher than her mother's, although  he  may  have
       overstated the difference slightly at c.�40 per week, as that did not
       involve any adjustment of the private tuition fees to  net  earnings,
       and in any event if �175 rather than �165 was the correct figure  for
       her mother's net weekly earnings.  (We assume the Judge's calculation
       was:  �156 + �50 - �165 = �41.)

  Submissions - Error of Law

    9. Points of detail were raised in the Grounds  of  Appeal,  as  to  the
       possible error by the Judge  in  mixing  gross  and  net  figures  in
       considering the appellant's earnings, as to the cost of utilities and
       council tax for the household, and as to what evidence there  was  of
       direct financial support being given to the appellant by her mother.

   10. But as Mr Slatter accepted, appearing for the  appellant  before  us,
       the key issue is how the provision of accommodation to the  appellant
       by her mother, rent free, was treated in  the  Decision  below.   The
       other points, whether individually or  in  combination,  could  never
       take the appellant far enough to overturn the conclusion that she had
       not established dependency.  As the Judge noted, at  [14]  and  [33],
       the appellant's own evidence was  that,  in  general,  she  used  her
       earnings for clothes, make  up,  travel  (Oyster  card)  and  'pocket
       money' and, in addition, she had paid her own legal fees.   All  that
       "suggests that she has surplus income because she is  not  having  to
       pay rent and other household expenses".

   11. The Judge reasoned, at [34], that "That does not  mean  that  she  is
       dependent on her mother."; and at [35], that if one sixth of the rent
       was 'attributed' to the appellant (c.�80 per week), as  suggested  on
       behalf of the respondent (because it was a household of six), then on
       her own evidence as to her earnings she could afford that  and  still
       have enough to cover her other essential needs.  In  the  appellant's
       Grounds, it was  argued  that  the  Judge  should  have  treated  the
       appellant as responsible for 50% of  the  rent,  since  she  and  her
       mother were the only adults in the household, the  others  being  her
       mother's minor children.  No detailed calculation is  needed  to  see
       that the appellant could not afford �1,050 per  month  in  rent,  let
       alone that amount  in  rent  plus  utilities  and  other  essentials.
       Therefore, the conclusion that  the  appellant  had  not  proved  her
       dependency was flawed by  an  incorrect  treatment  of  accommodation
       costs.  In oral argument,  Mr  Slatter  focused  not  so  much  on  a
       notional 'split' of the rent, but on whether the  appellant  depended
       on her mother for the provision of accommodation.  The  Judge  failed
       to ask that question, resting instead on a finding (in  effect)  that
       the appellant could afford a modest contribution to her mother's rent
       if her mother asked for one.

   12. For the respondent, Mr Jarvis fairly  did  not  seek  to  defend  the
       Judge's use of  a  notional  one  sixth  rental  responsibility.   He
       contended, however, that the Judge was  entitled,  overall,  to  find
       that no real dependency had been  established,  given  that  (as  the
       Judge said at [35]) in truth "The accommodation is largely  paid  for
       out of housing benefit".

  Conclusions - Error of Law

   13. We agree with Mr Slatter that, in  substance,  the  Judge  asked  and
       answered  the  wrong  question,  namely  whether  the  appellant,  if
       required, could afford a modest  contribution  towards  her  mother's
       rental costs.  Finding that she could do  so,  and  cover  her  other
       essential needs, from her earned income, was erroneously  treated  as
       negativing dependency.

   14. In reality, the appellant's  evidence,  and  that  of  her  mother's,
       accepted as truthful by the Judge,  corroborated  by  the  supporting
       evidence  of  her  earnings  and  the  household   outgoings,   amply
       demonstrated that the appellant did in fact depend on her mother for,
       at least, providing a roof over her head  and  was  in  no  position,
       financially, to set up on her own.  That should have been accepted as
       proving  dependency,  subject  to  the  point  raised  by  Mr  Jarvis
       (paragraph 12 above).

   15. As to that point, however,  it  does  not  negative  the  appellant's
       dependency on her mother.  Rather, it suggests a  dependency  of  the
       appellant's mother on benefits to which she is entitled, and  support
       from her husband, because  of  her  very  modest  earnings,  for  the
       maintaining of the household she maintains here, one aspect of  which
       is continuing to provide a home for the appellant beyond the  age  of
       21.  Mr Jarvis was disposed to accept  that  if  the  entitlement  to
       benefits supporting the family were seen  as  'flowing  through'  the
       appellant's mother, then it was not possible to resist the conclusion
       that the Decision is flawed.  In our judgment, that  is  the  correct
       way to view the availability of  benefits  enabling  the  appellant's
       mother to maintain the  family  home;  and  the  Decision  is  indeed
       flawed.

  Re-Making

   16. It will be clear already, from paragraphs 14-15 above,  that  in  our
       judgment, the question that needed to be asked in this case permitted
       of only one answer, on the evidence submitted by the appellant, given
       that no credibility concern arose.  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the
       First-tier Tribunal was well-founded and should  have  been  allowed.
       We therefore now re-make the Decision, substituting for it a decision
       allowing that appeal.

    Decision:

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the  appellant's
         appeal on the basis  that  she  had  not  established  her  claimed
         dependency on her mother involved an error on a point of law.

      2. We therefore set aside that decision.

      3. This appeal is therefore allowed and we re-make the decision of the
         First-tier Tribunal, substituting for it a  decision  allowing  the
         appellant's appeal.
