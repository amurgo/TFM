Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Pinder, instructed by Ty Arian Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


The notion that funds only need to be "available" to an applicant is, on
the true construction of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules, applicable
only to student applications.





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. "Do you have a copy of Hamlet that I could borrow?"
    "I don't have Hamlet, but I can easily get one for you"
    "You don't have it?"
    "No."
    "Then do you have a copy of Macbeth I could borrow?"
    "I have Macbeth, but I'm afraid you can't borrow it."
    "Oh.  Why not?"
    "Because I have lent it to Mary."


        This conversation, between two users of ordinary English,  contains
    no contradictions.  It draws attention to the difference between having
    something and something being available.  The second speaker  does  not
    have Hamlet, but it is available;  she  has  Macbeth,  but  it  is  not
    available.  The two concepts are not mutually  exclusive:  if  she  had
    been able to meet the first speaker's  requests,  it  would  have  been
    because it was true to say both that she had the work and that  it  was
    available.  Conversely, it may be that not only does she not  have  The
    Comedy of Errors: it is not  available  to  her  either.   In  ordinary
    English there is a world of difference between having  something,  with
    its implications of present ownership, and something's being available,
    that is to say there for the asking.  The question said to be raised by
    this appeal is whether the same distinction is present in  the  English
    used by the draftsman of the Immigration Rules, specifically Appendix C
    of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 as amended, in
    its application to Tier 1 of the Points-Based Scheme.

The Facts

 2. The appellant is a national of Nepal.  He entered the United Kingdom in
    September 2003 as a student.  On application, his leave  as  a  student
    was extended, and was due to expire on 31 October 2010.  On 26  October
    2010 he applied for further leave, not this  time  as  a  student,  but
    under the Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant category.   His  application
    was refused on 17 December 2010.  The reason for the refusal  was  that
    the appellant had failed to obtain sufficient points in the Maintenance
    category.  He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, and his  appeal  was
    dismissed by Immigration Judge Y J Jones.  He  now  has  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal.

 3. In order to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
    appellant would need to show that, on the date of his  application,  he
    was entitled to the points he claimed.  It is convenient to begin  with
    the relevant section of his application  form.   As  completed  by  the
    appellant, that section is as follows:



             "

























 4. The reference to "a three month period" is a reference to a requirement
    that, in order to show the ability to maintain himself  in  future,  an
    applicant demonstrate that the relevant funds have been in place in the
    past.

 5. The financial documents were examined by the Immigration Judge.  Before
    her it was accepted that, whether or not one also  looked  at  a  joint
    account held by the appellant and his girlfriend, there were not enough
    funds held in his or their names to meet the requirements of the Rules.
     Ms Pinder did her best to minimise this problem, but the truth of  the
    matter is that for substantial parts  of  the  three-month  period  the
    accounts were well below �800: sometimes they were  overdrawn.   On  27
    July 2010, so far from  being  �800  in  credit,  the  appellant's  own
    account was �780 in debt: there was a further �120 indebtedness on  the
    joint account.  It is absolutely clear that, by a  substantial  margin,
    the appellant's own funds were not sufficient to meet the  requirements
    of the Rules.

 6. The appellant seeks to rely on evidence showing  that  he  had  further
    funds available to him from his parents.  There  were  letters  showing
    that they are persons of substance, and, as we understand  the  matter,
    the "letter from a bank or building society" said to be  enclosed  with
    the form relates to evidence (which is not contested) of their  assets.
    There was also a letter from the appellant's parents, signed by both of
    them and dated 2 October 2010, reading as follows:

        "To whom it may concern


        We, the undersigned are the parents of Mr Shailesh Rajbhandari  who
        has been studying in Wales, UK since September 2003.   The  purpose
        of this letter is to notify all  the  concern  that  we  have  been
        funding Shailesh  his  commencement  of  studies  in  Wales  United
        Kingdom.  We have been sending money between �400.00 and �750.00 in
        an approximate interval of every four or five months and this  will
        be continued until he finishes his studies in the United Kingdom."

 7. So far as we are aware, there is no doubt about  the  accuracy  of  the
    evidence relating to the appellant's parents' financial  position:  the
    question is whether the appellant is entitled to rely on  his  parents'
    resources for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the Rules.

The Law

 8. The starting-point must be the Immigration Rules themselves.  The Rules
    relevant to the Points-Based Scheme change so  frequently  that  it  is
    always difficult to know what rules were in force at a  given  time  in
    the past.  It appears that, at the date of the appellant's application,
    the relevant rules were as follows.

 9. Paragraph 245AA (which lies between para 245 and para 245A) contained a
    general requirement that

        "Where part 6A or appendices A to C or E of these rules state  that
        specified  documents  must  be  provided,  that   means   documents
        specified by the Secretary of  State  in  the  Points-Based  Scheme
        Policy Guidance as being specified documents for  the  route  under
        which the applicant is applying.  If the  specified  documents  are
        not provided, the applicant will not meet the requirement for which
        the specified documents are required as evidence".

10. Paragraph 245Z requires that, in order to qualify for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant, an applicant must, amongst other
    things, "have a minimum of 10 points under paras 1 to 2 of Appendix C".
     Appendix C begins with paras numbered 1A, 1 and 2 in that  order.   It
    might therefore appear that the reference in para 245Z does not include
    para 1A of Appendix C.  The latter paragraph is, however,  a  paragraph
    governing the  interpretation  of  all  the  other  paragraphs  of  the
    appendix.  The relevant passages are as follows:-

        "Appendix C - maintenance (funds)


        1A. In all cases where an applicant is required  to  obtain  points
        under Appendix C, the applicant must meet the  requirements  listed
        below:


           (a) the applicant must have the funds specified in the  relevant
              part of Appendix C     at the date of the application;
           (b) if the applicant is applying for ... leave to  remain  as  a
              Tier 1 Migrant (other than a Tier 1 (Investor)  Migrant)  ...
              the applicant must have had the  funds  referred  to  in  (a)
              above for a consecutive 90-day  period  of  time,  ending  no
              earlier  than  one  calendar  month  before   the   date   of
              application;
           c)  if the applicant is applying for entry clearance or leave to
              remain as a Tier 4 Migrant  [that  is,  as  a  student],  the
              applicant must have had the funds referred to  in  (a)  above
              for a consecutive 28-day period of time,  ending  no  earlier
              than one calendar month before the date of the application;
           ...
           (e) the applicant must provide the specified documents


        Tier 1 Migrants


        1.  An applicant applying for ... leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
        Migrant (other than as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant) must  score  10
        points for funds.
        2.  10 points will only be awarded if an applicant:
        ...
           (b) applying for leave to remain, has the level of  funds  shown
              in the table below and provides the specified documents


           |Level of Funds              |Points                        |
|�800                        |10                            |



                                                                           "


11. The requirements for  Tier  4  applicants,  to  which  Ms  Pinder  made
    reference, are in para 10 and following:

        "Tier 4 (General) Students


        10. A Tier 4 (General) Student must score 10 points for funds.
        11. 10 points will only be awarded if the funds shown in the  table
           below are available to the applicant and the applicant  provides
           the specified documents to show this.  Notes  to  accompany  the
           table appear below the table."

12. We do not need to set out the table.  One of the notes is para 13.   As
    originally drafted, that read as follows:

        "Guidance published by the United Kingdom Border  Agency  will  set
        out when funds will be considered to be available to an  applicant,
        including the circumstances in which the money must be that of  the
        applicant, and the extent to which a sponsorship  arrangement  that
        provides the required funds will suffice."

13. Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pankina v SSHD  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 719, para 13 has been expanded and now contains  the  relevant
    provision specifying when funds are considered to be "available" to  an
    applicant, and how an applicant has to prove the matter.

14. The Tier 4 requirement was the subject of the decision of the  Tribunal
    in CDS v SSHD [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC), heard in the  immediate  aftermath
    of Pankina.  The  Tribunal  there  decided  that,  in  the  absence  of
    specific provision in the Rules, funds must be regarded as  "available"
    to an applicant at the material time if they belong to  a  third  party
    and the third party was shown to be willing to deploy them  to  support
    the applicant for the purpose contemplated.

15. We must make reference finally to the Tier 1 (Post Study  Work)  Policy
    Guidance,  publicly  available  on  the   date   of   the   appellant's
    application.   This  provides,  at  para  51  that   for   maintenance,
    "applicants for leave to remain in the United Kingdom must have �800 of
    available funds".

Discussion

16. Ms Pinder drew our attention specifically to what she submitted  was  a
    mismatch between para 1A(c) and paras 10 and 13  of  Appendix  C.   The
    former says that in all cases the applicant must "have had" the  funds;
    the latter says that in the case of Tier 4 it  suffices  if  the  funds
    have been "available".  Further, the word "available" is  used  in  the
    guidance for Tier 1.  In these circumstances, she submitted,  it  could
    not be that an applicant under Tier 1 was required to  "have  had"  the
    funds in the ordinary English sense.  Looked at as a whole, Appendix  C
    and the Guidance showed  that  the  draftsman  of  the  Rules  drew  no
    distinction between a person's having funds and funds  being  available
    to a person.  When we pointed out the terms of the form (which we  have
    set out above) she submitted that the phrase used there,  "have  access
    to �800 available  funds"  confirmed  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position could not be one that depended upon the  ordinary  meaning  of
    the word "have".

17. Nobody could credibly suggest that the Rules relating  to  the  Points-
    Based Scheme are clear, simple or consistently drafted.  They are  made
    more difficult to understand by the fact that some of the  requirements
    of the Rules appear to have no logical  basis.   How  can  it  be,  for
    example, that evidence of �800  (which  may  have  been  borrowed  from
    another individual, or even from a credit  card  company)  held  in  an
    account for three months in the  past,  is  in  some  way  relevant  to
    demonstrating that a person has adequate maintenance for a much  longer
    period in the future?  We must, however, try and interpret the Rules as
    they are; and, in doing so, we need to take what ever assistance we can
    from all the relevant provisions.

18. Despite Ms Pinder's submissions, we are not persuaded that the concepts
    of "having" and "having available" are chaotically confused in Appendix
    C.  As we read them, it is clear that the provisions  requiring  merely
    that funds be "available" are a feature of the maintenance requirements
    for students.   Not  only  is  that  the  head  under  which  the  word
    "available" appears to be chiefly used;  there  is  also  the  specific
    provision in paragraph 13, to which we have referred, and there is  the
    obvious fact that where the applicant  for  a  visa  is  a  child,  the
    expectation would be that the necessary  funds  are  available  to  him
    rather than necessarily held in his name.

19. Despite the general terms of para 1A of Appendix C, it  cannot  in  our
    judgment have been  intended  to  erase  the  distinction  between  the
    requirement of availability in the student rules  and  the  requirement
    that other applicants "have" the funds in  question.   The  wording  of
    para 1A is unfortunate; but in our judgement its purpose was to  impose
    the requirement as to time rather than  to  change  any  of  the  other
    requirements of the Appendix.

20. Without attempting to apply a purposive construction to the  Rules,  we
    may observe  that,  as  a  student  may  be  a  child,  the  notion  of
    availability is particularly appropriate.  A student may  be  dependent
    for maintenance on relatives or funding bodies.  On the other hand,  it
    is reasonable to expect that a person who seeks  leave  to  be  in  the
    United Kingdom in order to work will be able to derive a basic level of
    maintenance from his  work.   A  difference  in  the  arrangements  and
    requirement for maintenance between Tier 1 and Tier 4  is  thus  to  be
    expected, and it is what, in our judgement, is indeed to  be  found  in
    Appendix C.

21. So far as concerns the Tier 1 Guidance, para 51 requires  an  applicant
    to "have �800 of available funds".  It seems to us that "available"  in
    that requirement is not intended as an alternative to "have", but as an
    additional requirement.  That is to say, the �800 must not be  for  any
    reason unavailable.  As an additional  requirement  contained  only  in
    guidance it may be subject to criticism on the  lines  mounted  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Alvi v SSHD [2012] UKSC 33.  The guidance does  not,
    in our judgement, undermine the requirement that the  applicant  "have"
    the funds.

22. There remains the question of the form.  The form of which we have  set
    out an extract above is prescribed under the provisions of  the  Rules,
    and is in essence part of them.   It asks  whether  the  applicant  has
    "access to �800 available funds".  The phrase "has access  to"  is,  in
    its ordinary meaning, nearer to "have available" than  to  "have".   If
    that question stood on its  own,  it  might  provide  thought  for  the
    appellant's claim that merely having the funds available was sufficient
    to meet the requirements of the Tier 1 Rules.  But, as  we  have  seen,
    the form also specifies that the applicant "must have a  minimum  level
    of funds", and  specifically  directs  applicants  to  the  Immigration
    Rules.  In the circumstances, we do not think that the wording used  on
    the form (which is not itself found in the Rules) can  be  regarded  as
    amounting to a relaxation of them.

23. On the question raised by the grounds,  therefore,  we  have  concluded
    that the Rules require a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) applicant to have the
    funds specified in Appendix C: it  is  not  sufficient  that  they  are
    available to him.

The evidence of availability

24. Even if we were wrong about that, however,  we  should  have  dismissed
    this appeal.  Although it is said on the appellant's  behalf  that  his
    parents have always been willing to support him, it is  very  far  from
    clear that the evidence before the Secretary of  State  or  before  the
    Immigration Judge would have been sufficient to meet  the  requirements
    of the Rules.  There are two problems.  The first is  that  the  letter
    from the appellant's parents  specifically  indicates  that  they  will
    continue to pay him while he remains a student, not that they will  pay
    him at a time when he is engaged in post-study  work.   The  second  is
    that the letter indicates the level which  has  been  paid  during  his
    studies, and the financial history shows that the appellant's  parents'
    contributions have not been sufficient to enable him to maintain in his
    bank account the amount that the Rules require for  an  application  of
    this sort.  If the appellant's parents' letter were to  be  taken  into
    account it could only be evidence of the terms set out in it.  And,  in
    any event, it is very difficult to see why  an  indication  that  funds
    were being paid at a certain level while the appellant  was  a  student
    should be taken as an indication that they would be paid  at  a  higher
    level after he has ceased to be a student.  It therefore appears to  us
    that even on the interpretation of the Immigration Rules sought by  the
    appellant, he would have failed to make his case.

25. We turn briefly to Article 8.  Under this head,  the  appellant  claims
    that he is entitled to leave to remain, apparently as a Tier  1  (Post-
    Study Work) Migrant who does not meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.
    His history is that  he  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  for  temporary
    purposes, and has been here for temporary purposes ever since.  He has,
    so far as we are aware, obtained the  qualifications  he  sought.   The
    girlfriend to whom we referred earlier  is  no  longer  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He has not been able to show that, if he remained,  he  would
    be adequately maintained.  There seems to us to be no conceivable basis
    upon which it could said that he has any right  to  be  in  the  United
    Kingdom other than under the Rules, or that any Convention right of his
    would be infringed by a requirement that  he  depart  from  the  United
    Kingdom on the expiry of his leave.

26. For the foregoing reasons this appeal is dismissed.
