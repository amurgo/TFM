                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the appellant:  Paul Richardson (counsel instructed by Chauhan)
For the respondent: Miss Alexandra Everett

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Anita Coaster), sitting at Newport on 26 June 2018,  to
    a human rights appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born 1983.

 2. The appellant arrived as a student in 2007, and had  further  leave  to
    remain as a tier 1  migrant till 2016. Before that ran out, he  applied
    for indefinite  leave  to  remain,  which  in  2017  he  varied  to  an
    application for the same on a long residence basis. On 27 January  2018
    that was treated as a human rights application, but refused, because of
    what had happened in 2010 - 11. For  that  year,  he  had  declared  an
    income of �19, 962 to HM Revenue and Customs [HMRC],  which  would  not
    have been enough for him to get further leave to  remain;  but  to  the
    Home Office he had claimed no less than �35,508.59.



 3. The appellant  blamed  his  former  accountant  for  what  had  been  a
    discrepancy of nearly 50%. In 2012 he had gone to another firm, who had
    advised him he was �671 in arrears on the previous year, and should ask
    HMRC for his 'paperwork'; but he did not do so. He had  also  paid  the
    first accountant �3,000 in cash, without a receipt, on the  basis  that
    it would be used to settle his tax bill, and another  �300  by  way  of
    fees; but, when he went to his office to look for him, he was no longer
    there. The appellant neither sought the help of  the  police,  nor  any
    regulatory agency. However in May 2016 he did file  an  amended  return
    for 2010 - 11, and paid the �4,000  required  by  HMRC  to  settle  the
    arrears, without being required to pay a penalty.

 4. The judge took a great deal of trouble  with  her  decision,  and  made
    detailed findings of fact at paragraphs 37 - 46, in which she  rejected
    the explanation put forward by the appellant. The reason permission  to
    appeal was given was on her approach to particular points, set  out  in
    the grounds of  appeal  (very  clearly  and  concisely  drafted  by  Mr
    Richardson) which may as well be taken in order.

 5. Grounds 1 and 2 go together: here  the  judge  is  criticized  for  not
    making a finding as to whether the appellant had misled  HMRC,  or  the
    Home Office, as to his income for  2010  -  11.  This  is  said  to  be
    important in reaching a decision (which the judge  is  also  criticized
    for not doing) as to whether any misconduct involved justified refusing
    the application under paragraph 322 (5), rather  than  on  its  merits.
    That part of paragraph 322 is headed 'Grounds on which leave to  remain
    and variation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom  should
    normally be refused', implying a discretion under the Rules, which  was
    for the judge to review and, if necessary, reconsider for herself.

 6. The rule itself, so far as relevant,  requires  consideration  of  'the
    undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom in the light of his conduct ...'. There is a very useful
    decision, on judicial review, discussed before me, by Martin Spencer  J
    in Khan (Shahbaz) (Dishonesty, tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))  [2018]
    UKUT 384 (IAC), and it is worth  setting  out  the  judicial  head-note
    here.

       (i) Where there has been a significant difference between the  income
       claimed in a previous application for leave to remain and the  income
       declared to HMRC, the Secretary of  State  is  entitled  to  draw  an
       inference that the Applicant has  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and
       therefore he should be refused ILR within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       Immigration Rules. Such an inference could be expected where there is
       no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.

       (ii) Where an Applicant has presented evidence to show that,  despite
       the prima facie inference, he was not  in  fact  dishonest  but  only
       careless, then  the  Secretary  of  State  must  decide  whether  the
       explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace  the
       prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.

 7. That decision includes further useful guidance on the  approach  to  be
    adopted (by the Secretary of State, but of course also  for  judges  on
    appeal) at paragraph 37: sub-paragraphs (i)  and  (ii)  represent  what
    appears in the head-note.

       (iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary  of  State
       should remind herself that, although the standard  of  proof  is  the
       "balance of probability", a finding that a person has been  deceitful
       and dishonest in relation to his tax  affairs  with  the  consequence
       that he is denied settlement  in  this  country  is  a  very  serious
       finding with serious consequences.

       (iv) However, for an applicant simply to blame his or her  accountant
       for an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be
       the end of the matter: far from it. Thus, the Secretary of  State  is
       entitled to take into account that, even where an accountant has made
       an error, the accountant will or should have asked the tax  payer  to
       confirm that the return was accurate  and  to  have  signed  the  tax
       return, and furthermore the Applicant will have known of his  or  her
       earnings and will have expected to pay  tax  thereon.  If,  realising
       this (or wilfully shutting his eyes to the situation), the  Applicant
       has not taken steps within a reasonable time to remedy the situation,
       the Secretary of State may be entitled to conclude  either  that  the
       error was not simply the fault of the accountant  or,  alternatively,
       the Applicant's failure to remedy the situation  itself  justifies  a
       conclusion that he has been  has  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and
       therefore he should be refused ILR within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
       Immigration Rules.

 8. Sub-paragraph (v) requires factors on  both  sides  to  be  considered,
    while (vi) directs attention to the following questions:

       i. Whether the  explanation  for  the  error  by  the  accountant  is
       plausible;

       ii. Whether the documentation which can  be  assumed  to  exist  (for
       example, correspondence between the Applicant and his  accountant  at
       the time of the  tax  return)  has  been  disclosed  or  there  is  a
       plausible explanation for why it is missing;

       iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error  had  been  made
       because his liability to  pay  tax  was  less  than  he  should  have
       expected;

       iv. Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to  remedy
       the situation and, if  so,  when  those  steps  were  taken  and  the
       explanation for any significant delay.

 9. Entirely realistically, the grounds of  appeal  do  not  criticize  the
    judge for failing to note the principle set out by Martin Spencer J  at
    (iii): she was clearly very well aware  of  the  consequences  for  the
    appellant of his  appeal  being  dismissed  on  322  (5)  grounds.  The
    remaining principles fully bear out the approach taken by the judge  in
    rejecting the appellant's explanation, and so I return to grounds 1 and
    2.

10. Clearly, on the judge's findings of  fact,  either  HMRC  or  the  Home
    Office had been grossly deceived about the appellant's income in 2010 -
    11. As Mr Richardson accepted, it was of course  in  his  interests  to
    minimize his income for tax, and to maximize it, at least to the  level
    required by the Rules, for immigration  purposes.  The  way  the  judge
    dealt with this point appears at her paragraphs 46 - 48:

    46.       ... I find that the Appellant has  failed  to  discharge  the
         standard of proof to rebut  the  initial  allegation  made  by  the
         Respondent that the Appellant had been dishonest  in  his  dealings
         with the  Revenue  and/or  the  Home  Office.  The  Respondent  had
         sufficient grounds to justify raising the allegation. The burden of
         proof was then on the Appellant to give  a  reasonable  explanation
         for his conduct. He failed to do so. His account was not credible.




    47.       I find that due to the lack of a  plausible  explanation  for
         the  Appellant's  conduct  which  could  show  on  the  balance  of
         probabilities  that  he  was  honest  in  his  dealings  with   the
         Respondent and/or the Revenue at the relevant time, the  Respondent
         was entitled to reach a conclusion on the balance of  probabilities
         that the Appellant had perpetrated a deceit to either pay less  tax
         for 2010/11 or to obtain immigration status he was not entitled to.
         Both statutory bodies were misled  by  the  Appellant.  There  were
         reasonable grounds  therefore  for  the  Respondent  to  refuse  to
         exercise its discretion in the Appellant's favour  under  paragraph
         322 (5).

    48.       ... I do not find it necessary for the Respondent to reach  a
         conclusion on whom the Appellant intended to deceive  as  obviously
         both statutory bodies were deceived at different times and I do not
         accept that the deceptions were innocent and inadvertent.

11. Further criticisms are made on that passage under grounds 3 and  4,  to
    which I shall turn in due course. However, subject to those,  it  seems
    to me that grounds 1 and 2 do not show any material error of law on her
    part. The appellant had, as she also pointed out at 48, not  chosen  to
    admit  which  office  he  had  deceived;  instead  he  had   given   an
    explanation, which she  was  fully  justified  in  rejecting,  for  the
    detailed reasons she gave. This was, as is usually the case,  the  main
    function of a first-instance judge: to consider the facts  impartially,
    and to reach reasoned findings on them.

12. It is hard, if not impossible, to imagine any reasonable decision-maker
    not taking the view that a dishonest discrepancy  of  this  proportion,
    even some years before, made it undesirable in the public interest that
    the perpetrator should be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom. This
    must be equally so, whether the victim of the deceit had been  HMRC  or
    the Home Office.

13. In the light of this conclusion, I shall now turn to grounds 3  and  4,
    which also go together. Ground 3 criticizes the judge for  taking  what
    may be called a judicial review approach, rather than  considering  the
    case for herself, as required on  a  statutory  appeal.  On  a  literal
    reading, the words she used at 47 - 48 ("the Respondent was entitled to
    reach a conclusion ...") do support this criticism. However,  when  the
    judge's decision is read as a whole, it is clear  that  she  was  doing
    what she was required to do for herself, which was  to  reach  her  own
    reasoned findings of  fact  on  the  explanation  put  forward  by  the
    appellant. In reality, there is nothing in this ground.

14. Ground 4 blames the judge for her approach to the burden of proof.  The
    correct approach is set out in a number of decisions  referred  to,  of
    which the most recent  is  Shen  (Paper  appeals;  proving  dishonesty)
    [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC). Taking it from the judicial head-note:



       (2) Where an application form etc is false in a  material  way,  this
       may be relied on by the Secretary of State as  prima  facie  evidence
       establishing dishonesty. ... But it is always open to an appellant to
       proffer an innocent explanation and if that explanation meets a basic
       level of plausibility, the burden switches back to the  Secretary  of
       State to answer that evidence. At the end of the day the Secretary of
       State bears the burden of proving dishonesty.

15. In this case, the judge concluded that the appellant's explanation  did
    not reach that level of  plausibility:  she  gave  detailed  and  valid
    reasons of her own for this. Mr Richardson  fairly  acknowledged  that,
    though the judge's generic self-direction at 25 put the burden of proof
    on the appellant, on the balance of probabilities throughout, what  she
    said at 46 came closer to the right test. While the  judge  could  have
    expressed herself more accurately in terms of the authorities, she  had
    considered the appellant's explanation for herself, and found it wholly
    implausible. There was in reality  nothing  the  respondent  needed  to
    answer or rebut.
