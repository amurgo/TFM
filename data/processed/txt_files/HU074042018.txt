Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs Zahoor, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on April 22, 2015 as a  spouse
    with leave to remain until December 10, 2017.  On December 4, 2017  she
    applied for further leave to remain but  the  respondent  refused  this
    application  on  March  12,  2018  as  he  was  not   satisfied   their
    relationship was genuine and  subsisting  or  that  they  had  met  the
    requirements  of  Appendix  FM  for  the  purposes  of  the   financial
    requirements.

 2. Grounds of appeal were lodged by the appellant under Section  82(1)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on March 22, 2018.

 3. Her appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lloyd-Smith  on
    October 2, 2018 and in a decision promulgated on October 12,  2018  she
    refused the appeal.  Permission to appeal was  sought  on  October  27,
    2018 on the basis the Judge had failed to properly assess the  evidence
    in support of her claim that the marriage was subsisting and had  erred
    when assessing the financial documents and in carrying out an Article 8
    ECHR assessment.

 4. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane granted permission to appeal  on
    November 9, 2018 finding it was arguable the Judge had  approached  the
    appellant's evidence with a premature  and  preconceived  view  of  the
    evidence.

 5. No anonymity direction is made.

    SUBMISSIONS

 6. Mrs Zahoor adopted the grounds of  appeal.   She  submitted  there  was
    ample  evidence  before  the  Judge  of  their  relationship,  and  she
    submitted that the Judge's findings were both  biased  and  unfair  and
    contradicted the evidence before her.  There was evidence that they had
    been in a relationship since 2011 and that the marriage was  subsisting
    but this evidence was given insufficient weight.   Instead,  the  Judge
    placed too much weight on a police report  that  had  been  adduced  as
    evidence in circumstances where those complaints were  never  proceeded
    with.  The comments contained in the report were the personal  comments
    of a police officer and the Judge should have placed more weight on the
    evidence provided by both the appellant and  the  sponsor.   There  was
    evidence that they had been going for IVF treatment and taking all that
    evidence together she submitted the Judge erred in rejecting the  claim
    that they were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.

 7. Mrs Zahoor accepted that at the date of  application  the  sponsor  had
    only been earning �9,000 but pointed to the fact that the  sponsor  had
    been ill and had been unable to work as normal.  She argued  that  they
    satisfied the financial requirements of the Immigration  Rules  at  the
    date of hearing and referred to the second  bundle  of  documents  that
    included the sponsor's SA100 form, which is a tax return document  sent
    to the sponsor to complete, and he had  completed  it  identifying  the
    fact that he had earned �28,471.  She accepted that the requirements of
    Appendix FM-SE had not been complied with because there  were  no  bank
    statements or accounts contained in either of the  bundles  adduced  in
    evidence.  However, she submitted that on the balance of  probabilities
    there was evidence that they satisfied the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules.

 8. Mr Bates responded to  the  application  and  submitted  there  was  no
    material error in law.  It was a  serious  accusation  to  suggest  the
    Judge was biased and he submitted that the arguments advanced took  the
    decision out of context.  At paragraph 7 of the decision the Judge made
    it clear that before reaching any findings of fact she  had  considered
    all the evidence.  He then submitted that the Judge set out why she did
    not believe the witnesses and did this in some considerable detail.

 9. With regard to the finances he referred to paragraphs 8(a) to  8(f)  of
    the Judge's decision.  The Judge noted that  insufficient  evidence  to
    support the claimed income had been provided  and  when  assessing  the
    shortfall, at the date of application, the Judge  noted  that  the  two
    health issues relied on did not fall within the period  of  assessment.
    The Judge also made adverse findings regarding the sponsor's employment
    with Uber and ultimately rejected the claim that he had earned �18,823.
     All the findings made were open to the Judge and there was no material
    error in her approach to that evidence.

10. Mr Bates addressed the issue of genuine and subsisting relationship and
    referred to paragraphs 9 and 10 of the decision.  The Judge had already
    made adverse findings about the sponsor and for a  relationship  to  be
    genuine and subsisting it needed both  parties  to  want  to  be  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.  The Judge did not place weight on
    the fact the sponsor had been arrested but made findings that were open
    to  her  about  the  sponsor's  visits  to  his  ex-wife.   Whilst  the
    respondent had originally accepted there was a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship when the appellant entered the United Kingdom he submitted
    both the respondent and thereafter the Judge were entitled to find that
    when  this  current  application  was  submitted  the   situation   had
    materially changed because within three months of the  appellant  being
    admitted the sponsor had had an extramarital affair  with  his  ex-wife
    which had led to the birth of another child.  The Judge  addressed  the
    issue of IVF in paragraph 9 of her decision and the Judge gave  reasons
    why she was not happy with the documents and evidence given.

11. With regard to Article 8 the starting point would have  been  that  the
    relationship was not genuine and in such  circumstances  the  appellant
    could not demonstrate family life and the financial requirements  still
    remained outstanding.  He invited me to dismiss the appeal.

12. Mrs Zahoor in response reiterated her earlier submissions and  referred
    to the photographs and witness statements and the fact that  until  the
    marriage ended in divorce their marriage  continued  and  it  would  be
    unduly harsh to require the appellant to leave in  circumstances  where
    it was her husband who had the affair rather than her.

    FINDINGS

13. This is an appeal brought by the appellant against the Judge's decision
    to refuse her application for  further  leave  to  remain.   In  giving
    permission to appeal, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane was robust
    in his language when granting permission suggesting that the Judge  had
    approached the appeal with preconceived ideas of the  evidence  and  he
    referred to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the Judge's decision.

14. Allegations of bias are serious and in considering this appeal  I  have
    noted what the grounds of appeal alleged and the  observations  of  the
    Judge who granted permission.

15. I am satisfied that the FTT Judge was not bias in her approach to these
    proceedings.  At paragraph 7 she made it clear  that  in  reaching  her
    findings of fact she had considered all  the  evidence  notwithstanding
    the order in which the issues were  addressed.   Mrs  Zahoor  submitted
    that this was probably a standard paragraph and it may well be that  it
    is, but it is necessary to examine the Judge's decision as a whole.

16. The Judge commenced her  assessment  of  the  evidence  by  making  the
    statement that she did  not  find  the  witnesses  to  be  credible  or
    consistent.  If the Judge had left it there, then there would have been
    a material error in law. However, she proceeded  over  three  pages  to
    give detailed reasons for rejecting various aspects of the claim.

17. Turning therefore to the specific complaints  regarding  the  decision,
    namely the Judge's approach to the relationship and  finances,  I  make
    the following findings.

18. Mrs Zahoor conceded that the appellant did  not  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules when the application was put in.  She stated that the  respondent
    had been asked to exercise  his  discretion  on  the  finances  due  to
    illness.  At paragraph 8(b) the Judge addressed the  issue  of  illness
    and bearing in mind the application was submitted in December 2017  she
    noted the heart problem (February 2014) pre-dated the application by  a
    substantial period and the knee injury (May 2018)  post-dated  it.   It
    was therefore incorrect to say the Judge had not considered the overall
    financial situation.

19. I raised with Mrs Zahoor why she believed the appellant and the sponsor
    met the financial requirement at the date of hearing and  she  referred
    to bundle "A2" pages 32 and 33.   I  pointed  out  to  her  that  under
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules it was required to provide more
    evidence and a simple tax return did not satisfy the Immigration Rules.
     I referred her to section 7 of A1 which set out  what  documents  were
    required for someone who was self-employed.  It was apparent  that  the
    sponsor had not provided personal bank statements showing  his  claimed
    income and had not produced either audited or unaudited  accounts  from
    an accountant.  In those circumstances the Judge was entitled  to  find
    that the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules had  not  been
    met either at the date of application or the date of hearing.

20. The Judge, in paragraphs 8(c) and (d), referred to discrepancies in the
    evidence between the sponsor and a witness.  I therefore find that  the
    Judge was entitled to make those findings on financial issues and there
    is no material error in law on that point.

21.  The  Judge  did  not  accept  there  was  a  genuine  and   subsisting
    relationship.  Whilst the respondent had accepted the  relationship  at
    the date of entry, subsequent  evidence  raised  significant  questions
    about that relationship.

22. The Judge addressed this relationship in paragraphs 9  and  10  of  her
    decision.  The Judge was aware both the appellant and  sponsor  claimed
    they were in a genuine relationship  but  at  paragraph  9,  the  Judge
    addressed the issue of IVF treatment and pointed to inconsistencies and
    an absence of other documents.

23. The Judge can only  assess  evidence  placed  before  her  and  if  the
    appellant and sponsor had felt more evidence should have  been  adduced
    then it was incumbent on them to submit it.

24. In considering their accounts relating to the IVF treatment  the  Judge
    took into  account  other  adverse  credibility  findings  as  she  was
    entitled to do.  It was significant that within  three  months  of  the
    appellant being given leave to enter the sponsor  had  an  extramarital
    affair with his former wife.  He could not deny the  affair  because  a
    child had been the result.

25. The sponsor maintained this was in the past and that his  only  contact
    with her now was in relation to the  children.   The  Judge  took  into
    account a police  report  that  had  been  adduced  in  evidence  which
    referred to the fact that the sponsor attended  at  the  former  wife's
    home address on a regular basis to see the children  and  according  to
    the report he had pestered  his  former  wife  into  having  sex.   The
    sponsor did not deny having sex but simply said  he  was  weak  and  in
    effect blamed the former wife for the relationship.

26. It was argued before the FTT Judge that the ex-wife was not vulnerable,
    but the Judge rejected that submission.  She also  rejected  his  claim
    that the sponsor was lured into  a  trap  in  an  attempt  to  end  his
    marriage and she made a finding that it was more likely than  not  that
    the sponsor was intending to continue having sex with his  former  wife
    and this only stopped following a police complaint.  That  finding  was
    open to the Judge and she was then entitled to  consider  whether  that
    impacted on the genuineness and subsisting nature of the  relationship.
    The Judge accepted there were photographs of the sponsor and  appellant
    together and that they  were  still  married  but  concluded  that  the
    relationship was not genuine.

27. The grounds of appeal, that were advanced  before  me  on  this  issue,
    amounted to a disagreement with the Judge's decision.  Mrs  Zahoor  was
    attempting to reargue the issues that had been argued originally before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

28. Having made those findings, the Judge then  went  on  to  consider  the
    matter outside of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  at  paragraph  15  she
    addressed Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 and gave adequate reasons for rejecting the claim.

29. Mrs Zahoor argued that  the  appellant  was  being  penalised  for  her
    husband's extramarital affair but ultimately the Judge did  not  accept
    the relationship as genuine and as her leave was of  a  limited  nature
    she was only entitled to remain here as long as  the  relationship  was
    genuine and subsisting.

30. As the Judge concluded their relationship was not genuine or subsisting
    she Judge was  entitled  to  make  a  finding  that  it  would  not  be
    disproportionate to refuse the appellant further leave to remain.

31. I therefore find there is no error of law on the ground adduced.

    NOTICE OF DECISION

32. I dismiss the grounds of appeal and I uphold the original decision.
