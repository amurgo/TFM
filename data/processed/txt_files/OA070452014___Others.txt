Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Malcolm dated the 23rd April 2015, following a  hearing
      at Hatton Cross, London on the 25th March 2015 in which  he  dismissed
      the Appellants' appeal under the Immigration Rules and  under  Article
      8.

      Background

   2. By means of an application  dated  the  13th  March  2014,  the  First
      Appellant Mrs Ponrose Anton Gunaratnam applied for entry clearance  as
      a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, in order to join
      her husband Mr Pakkiyanathan Anton Gunaratnam. He had been in  the  UK
      since 2001 and had been granted indefinite leave to remain  under  the
      Legacy Scheme in January 2011. The Second, Third and Fourth Appellants
      are the children of Mrs Ponrose  Anton  Gunaratnam  and  her  husband,
      Rajkumar having been born on the 28th March 1996,  Mary  having  being
      born on the 19th March 1998 and Tharsika having been born on the  20th
      June 2000. They applied for entry clearance as children under Appendix
      FM of the Immigration Rules. All four of the Appellants'  applications
      were refused on the 12th May 2014, and  they  sought  to  appeal  that
      decision to the First-Tier Tribunal, which the  appeal  was  heard  by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Malcolm on the 25th March  2015.  He  having
      dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and on  Human  Rights
      grounds, they appealed that decision to the Upper Tribunal.


   3. Within the original Grounds of Appeal, it was further argued  that  in
      relation to the evidential requirements of Appendix  FM,  the  sponsor
      was only unable to satisfy the evidential criteria in respect of three
      salary payments, one payment of �1083.87, a further salary payment  of
      �1080.87 and a salary payment of �743.74 totalling �2911.48, but  that
      there  has  been  sufficient  evidence  and  documents  to  prove  the
      remainder of his income and that the documentary evidence showed  that
      he had an income over of �27,321.74, out of his total gross income  of
      �30,233.22, which it was argued was in excess of the requisite �27,200
      necessary under the Immigration Rules. It is further argued that First-
      tier  Judge  erred  in   requiring   exceptional   and/or   compelling
      circumstances to be proved within the proportionality  assessment.  It
      is further argued that the First-Tier Tribunal Judge erred in  failing
      to take account of the best interests of the Second, Third and  Fourth
      Appellants, given that three of the Appellants were under the  age  of
      18 as at the date of the application.


   4. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is argued that the First-Tier Tribunal
      Judge erred at paragraph 55 of the decision when he found that it  was
      open to all four  Appellants  to  simply  reapply  under  Appendix  FM
      producing the correct evidence under Appendix FMSE.  However,  it  was
      argued that the Second Appellant, Rajkumar, had already turned  18  by
      the date of the hearing and was therefore ineligible  to  make  a  new
      application under Appendix FM as a dependent of  the  sponsor.  It  is
      argued that the dismissal of his appeal under Article  8  removed  any
      prospect of the family being reunited in the United Kingdom, since the
      Second Appellant would not be able to accompany his mother and sisters
      to join the sponsor in the UK and that in circumstances  where  family
      life extant between all four Appellants and the sponsor, this was  the
      factual  nexus  against  which  the  severity  and   consequences   or
      interference with family life should have been measured. It is further
      argued that the First-Tier Tribunal  did  not  adequately  explore  or
      assess the nature and strengthen of the family bond, nor consider  the
      genuineness of the sponsor's and Appellants' evidence  in  respect  of
      their family life and the problems that  the  sponsor  would  have  in
      returning to Sri Lanka and obtaining a job there  and  the  depression
      and anxiety that the First Appellant suffered from.


   5. Permission  to  appeal  has  been  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Kopieczek on the 14th September 2015, in which he  extended  time  for
      making the application for permission to appeal to the date of receipt
      and went on to state that "whilst the First-tier Judge found that  the
      Appellants are not able to meet the  Immigration  Rules  in  terms  of
      specified evidence, I consider it arguable the Judge erred in  law  in
      the Article 8 assessment in taking into account  that  the  Appellants
      would be able to make a fresh application for  entry  clearance,  when
      the Second Appellant was already over the age of 18  when  the  appeal
      was heard by First-Tier Tribunal. I also consider that the  First-tier
      Judge arguably erred in failing to have regard to the  best  interests
      of the minor Appellants. I do not rule out the other grounds".
   6. In his oral submissions on behalf of the  Appellants,  Mr  Rai  relied
      upon the Skeleton argument. However he stated that he was only relying
      upon grounds B, C and D of the new grounds of appeal drafted by him on
      the 17th August 2015, and was therefore not relying upon the  argument
      that the Appellants had  produced  sufficient  evidential  documentary
      proof to satisfy the evidential requirements of  Appendix  FM  of  the
      Immigration Rules in respect of the sponsor's income. He  argued  that
      the First-Tier Tribunal Judge had materially misdirected himself  when
      looking at the case under Article 8 outside of the  Immigration  Rules
      at [54] and [55] of the determination and had failed to  consider  the
      fact that the Second Appellant was over the age of 18 as at  the  date
      of the decision before the First-Tier Tribunal Judge and had failed to
      take into account the best interests of the minor children.  He  asked
      me to find that there was a material error of law in this  regard  and
      to remit the case back to the First-Tier Tribunal for remaking.


   7. Miss Willocks-Briscoe, on behalf of the Respondent,  argued  that  the
      Judge had properly considered the  case  outside  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. She argued that the Second Appellant may not be able  to  apply
      as a child, but could  have  applied  under  the  Rules  as  an  adult
      dependent relative under Appendix  FM  and  that  the  Judge  properly
      stated that the decision was not disproportionate as  the  status  was
      simply being maintained. She argued that there was no  material  error
      of law, but that if despite  her  submissions  a  material  error  was
      found, that she agreed that the case should be remitted  back  to  the
      First-Tier Tribunal for remaking.



      My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality



   8.  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Malcolm,  when  considering   the   case
      originally under  the  Immigration  Rules,  properly  found  that  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules were not  met,  given  that  the
      specified evidence in respect of the sponsor's employment  in  respect
      of both of his employments had not been submitted and that  there  had
      been a failure to meet the evidential requirements of  Appendix  FMSE,
      as the Appellants had failed to provide bank statements in respect  of
      the sponsor's  bank  account  showing  all  salary  payments  for  the
      required period of 6 months prior to the date of the application.


   9. However, on this footing, the First-Tier Tribunal Judge  at  [55],  in
      considering whether or not the decisions taken was  proportionate  for
      the purpose of Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules, appears  to
      have considered it to be a relevant factor that "in this  case  it  is
      open for the Appellants to apply for entry clearance under Appendix FM
      and produce the  required  evidence".  However,  in  this  regard,  it
      appears that the Judge has failed to  take  into  account  a  relevant
      consideration in that Rajkumar, who was born on the 28th  March  1996,
      was over the age of 18 as at the date  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Malcolm's decision. Rajkumar would therefore have to apply as an adult
      dependent relative, rather than as a  child,  and  yet  there  was  no
      consideration of this given by First-Tier Tribunal  Judge  Malcolm  at
      [55] of his decision. Clearly,  different  criteria  apply  for  entry
      clearance as children and as adult dependent relatives  and  it  would
      not therefore be simply  a  case  of  the  Appellants'  reapplying  on
      exactly the same basis as they had previously applied,  together  with
      the requisite evidence. There is no consideration given by  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Malcolm of the fact that the  application  by  Rajkumar
      would have to  be  on  a  different  basis,  with  different  criteria
      applying as to whether or not this had any effect on the  question  as
      to whether or not the decision taken, in  circumstances  when  he  had
      originally applied as a child, but was then an adult as at the date of
      the decision before the First-Tier Tribunal Judge,  was  proportionate
      or not. The Judge's  reasoning  in  this  regard  is  inadequate,  and
      clearly  appears  to  have  failed  to  take  account  of  a  relevant
      consideration in this regard. There is therefore a material  error  of
      law in this regard.


  10. Further, the First-Tier Tribunal Judge has erred in  not  considering,
      as he is required to do, the best  interests  of  the  minor  children
      Tharsika and Mary,  in  his  consideration  of  proportionality  under
      Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules. The Court of  Appeal  case
      of the Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  SS  (Congo)  and
      Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387, made it clear that Article  8  had  to  be
      interpreted and applied in light of the UN Convention on the Rights of
      the Child and although the best  interests  of  the  children  do  not
      provide a trump card, they are nevertheless a  primary  consideration,
      in terms of being an important matter, even though  not  the  "primary
      consideration" and that the rights of the  children  were  a  relevant
      factor to the fair balance between  the  individual  and  the  general
      community, which goes some way towards tempering  the  otherwise  wide
      margin of appreciation available to the state authorities in  deciding
      what to do. It was stated in that case that the age of the child,  the
      closeness of their relationship with other members of  the  family  in
      the  United  Kingdom  and  whether  the  family  could  live  together
      elsewhere would likely to be important factors which should  be  borne
      in mind. However, the First-Tier Tribunal Judge Malcolm has not turned
      his mind to the best interests of the children in considering the case
      outside of the Immigration Rules, and clearly there is also a material
      error of law in this regard.


  11. I therefore set  aside  the  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Malcolm in respect of his consideration of the appeal outside  of  the
      Immigration Rules, and remit the case back to the First-Tier  Tribunal
      from rehearing on this issue.


      Notice of Decision

      The  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Malcolm  containing  a
      material error of law in  respect  of  his  assessment  of  Article  8
      outside of the Immigration Rules, I set aside his decision in  respect
      of his consideration of Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules;


      I remit the case back to the First-tier Tribunal  for  reconsideration
      of the appeal on  this  point,  to  be  heard  before  any  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge, except First-Tier Tribunal judge Malcolm;


      No application  was  made  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  any
      anonymity order  and  no  such  application  was  made  before  me.  I
      therefore do not make an anonymity order.


      Signed                                                           Dated
      30th January 2016
