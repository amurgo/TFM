For the Appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Schwenk, Counsel instructed by WTB Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  The  Respondent  is  a  national  of  Iraq  born  in  1990  who  seeks
    international (humanitarian) protection.

 2. The Respondent's appeal was allowed by the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    VA Cox) on the 31st August 2017. The Secretary  of  State  was  granted
    permission to appeal by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Dineen)  on  the
    8th November 2017 and on the 9th October 2018 the  matter  came  before
    me. Having heard from the respective representatives (the Respondent HA
    was that day represented by his solicitor Mr H. Pratt) I found that the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for error of law  and  I
    set it aside. My reasons for so doing are  explained  below.    At  the
    resumed hearing on the 1st March 2019 I heard oral evidence from HA and
    submissions from the parties. I reserved my decision which I now give.




    The Basis of Claim

 3. HA claims to have left Iraq in December 2015 because his home  area  in
    Kirkuk governate had been taken over by ISIS.  He states that  he  came
    under pressure from terrorists in Kirkuk and so he left.  He  travelled
    to Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdish Region (IKR) and from there he came on to
    Europe. He fears return to that area because the conflict there remains
    such that Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive is  engaged.  He
    claims that his identity papers were left behind and that he  has  lost
    contact with his family. HA is Kurdish and practises  Sunni  Islam.  He
    speaks Sorani and no Arabic.   He avers that he has no  connections  in
    the IKR.




    The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 4. The First-tier Tribunal allowed  the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds,  and
    dismissed it on humanitarian protection and human rights  grounds.  Its
    key findings were:

       . HA's account of events before he left  Kirkuk  were  a  fabrication
         [FTT at �50-53, 56]

       . He is no longer in possession of a passport [�54]

       . It is not credible that he has lost contact with his family  [�55].
         There is no evidence to demonstrate that  they  are  not  still  in
         Kirkuk [�60]

       . HA is from Kirkuk, an area outside of  the  IKR,  and  AA  (Article
         15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 544 (IAC) continues to apply

       . His family might be able to assist him financially or in  obtaining
         a CSID but this would take time,  "which  is  potentially  a  risk"
         [�61]. By the time that they could get a copy of his CSID/get money
         to him he might be destitute [�63]

       . Although he has some work experience he does not speak Arabic,  and
         has no connections with Baghdad [�62]

       . He could not afford to travel to Erbil from Baghdad [�64]




    The Secretary of State's Appeal

 5. Ground 1 is that the Tribunal materially misdirected itself in allowing
    the appeal on protection grounds. By its own findings the account given
    in the asylum claim was a fabrication. Insofar as the Tribunal may have
    understood the risk of destitution to qualify HA for refugee status  it
    was, as a matter of law, mistaken.

 6. Ground 2 is that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  take  material
    evidence into account in reaching its findings  on  the  risk  that  HA
    faced destitution.   The 'reasons for  refusal'  letter  had  expressly
    stated  that  returnees  can  be  given  money  to  assist   in   their
    resettlement, and the Tribunal appears to have ignored its own findings
    that HA's family had given him substantial financial assistance in  the
    past.




    Findings on 'Error of Law'

 7. For HA Mr Pratt had to concede that ground 1 was made out. The Tribunal
    clearly rejected the narrative of persecution and there was no basis in
    law for allowing the appeal on refugee grounds for the reasons he gave.
    I agree.

 8. Mr Pratt submitted however that it was clearly open to the Tribunal  to
    allow the appeal on humanitarian protection grounds, and this  was  the
    relevance of the findings on destitution.  HA  is  from  Kirkuk,  which
    applying the country guidance in AA is a  'contested  area'  where  the
    level of violence is such that Article 15(c) is engaged. This  was  the
    Tribunal's finding at paragraph 58.  There is no  suggestion  that  the
    Secretary of State had asked the First-tier Tribunal to depart from the
    guidance in AA.  Having found that the risk pertained in Kirkuk it  was
    the  Tribunal's  task  to  proceed  to  consider  internal  flight.  It
    conducted that enquiry in light of its own negative assessment  of  the
    Appellant's credibility, but properly found  that  the  obstacles  were
    such to  him  resettling  elsewhere  in  Iraq  that  he  would  end  up
    destitute. The Respondent's own guidance acknowledges that  this  would
    not be a 'reasonable' situation for him to find himself in.

 9. I accept Mr Pratt's submission that the Tribunal was  obliged  to  find
    that HA faced a real risk of harm in Kirkuk,  given  that  the  country
    guidance in AA was agreed to apply.  That  finding  is  preserved.  The
    only question left was whether it would be reasonable to expect  HA  to
    internally relocate

10. Having read the determination with care I am unable to accept that  the
    Tribunal took all relevant information into account when  it  made  its
    assessment of internal flight, or that it made  intelligible  findings.



11. It is not clear from the determination or the evidence why the Tribunal
    found it would take the unidentified  family  members  an  unacceptably
    long time to get to Baghdad to help HA: flight time from the  north  is
    only 45 minutes.  Further the Secretary of  State  is  correct  in  his
    complaint about the flight to Baghdad. The flight costs  only  $80  and
    this is money that HA could easily have available to him: he needs only
    apply for the resettlement grant mentioned by the Secretary of State in
    the refusal letter.  If  his  family  can  bring  him  the  appropriate
    documentation he can board one  of  the  many  weekly  flights  without
    difficulty.  These are all issues with the reasoning that the Secretary
    of State is legitimately entitled to complain about.

12. Conversely the determination also contains unsustainable findings which
    HA would like set aside.  At its paragraph 61 the  First-tier  Tribunal
    finds that HA's family "might" be able to help him obtain a CSID. It is
    not clear what standard of proof the Tribunal  here  applied,  or  what
    factors it took into account. There is, for instance,  no  analysis  of
    which family members HA is still in touch with (are they male, or  from
    his father's side?), whether those relatives have in  their  possession
    the documentation to assist him, or  whether  the  family  registry  in
    Kirkuk is in fact operational. Nor is there any  consideration  of  the
    country background material on events in the Kirkuk  area  since  2015,
    that being key information in any assessment of whether HA has  managed
    to retain contacts there. I am further concerned about the findings  in
    respect of the situation in the IKR. The finding  that  HA  could  rent
    accommodation is wholly dependent upon whether he manages to re-acquire
    a  CSID.   There  appears  to  be  no  evidential  foundation  for  the
    Tribunal's finding that HA is from a "minority" and  so  would  receive
    assistance in the IKR. HA is a Kurd, relocating  to  an  area  that  is
    majority Kurdish.  Although that decision was not of  course  available
    to the Tribunal, this finding is inconsistent with the findings of  the
    Upper Tribunal in AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq CG  UKUT
    00212 (IAC).

13. For those reasons I concluded,  in  my  written  decision  of  the  6th
    January 2019, that the Tribunal's reasoning on 'internal flight'  would
    have to be set aside to be remade.  The resumed hearing  would  proceed
    on the basis that the parties  agreed  that  AA  (Iraq)  remained  good
    country guidance.




    The Re-Made Decision on Internal Flight to the IKR

14. The parties agreed at the outset that my framework for  the  applicable
    law and country background facts in this case is the  country  guidance
    decision in AAH (Iraq).

15. Some  facts  relevant  to  my  enquiry  are  agreed.  HA  is  of  Iraqi
    nationality, and of Kurdish ethnicity.  These matters were accepted  by
    the Secretary of State in his letter of the 23rd September 2016.  HA is
    from Kirkuk.  Although that is not a matter expressly accepted  in  the
    refusal letter, there does not appear to have ever been any doubt about
    that.  In his 2016 screening interview  HA  gives  his  last  place  of
    residence as 'Iskan', a  neighbourhood  of  Kirkuk  [B2],  and  he  has
    consistently maintained that to be the case ever since.

16. In his oral evidence before me HA stated that he had never lived in the
    IKR, and that he knows no-one who lives there.  He confirmed that after
    he had left his home he had travelled  to  Erbil  where  an  agent  had
    supplied him with false papers in order to leave Iraq. That was what he
    was referring to in his screening interview when he said  that  he  had
    been given a 'passport'. He was in Erbil only a couple of  hours.  From
    there he proceeded directly to the Turkish  border.   His  passage  had
    been arranged by an uncle, who also lived in Kirkuk.   Once he  arrived
    in Turkey he managed to speak to his family to let them  know  that  he
    had got out of Iraq safely.

17. HA said that when he left home he had a large number  of  relatives  in
    Kirkuk. As well as the uncle who helped him he  also  had  his  mum,  2
    sisters and a brother-in-law. They were spread across three households.
     HA explained that after that conversation with them  when  he  was  in
    Turkey he lost contact with his family. He obviously  had  numbers  for
    them but when he called it just rang. He called and called  but  no-one
    ever answered. Once he was in the United Kingdom he tried to find  them
    through friends and acquaintances travelling back to  the  Kirkuk  area
    but no-one was able to locate them.  He had  not  tried  to  find  them
    using the Red Cross. If he tries those numbers today, the line is dead.

18. As to official Iraqi documentation, it is HA's case that he has none.

19. Mr Schwenk accepted that I must evaluate HA's evidence  on  the  issues
    canvassed in this appeal in light of the evidence as a  whole,  and  he
    accepted that as part of that assessment I would be  entitled  to  take
    into account the First-tier Tribunal's view that he was not a  credible
    witness.

20. For his part Mr McVeety conceded that I also had to have regard to  the
    country background evidence about events in Kirkuk at the time that  HA
    left, and since.

21. HA arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  the  14th  April  2016.  At  his
    screening  interview  he  stated  that  he  had  been  travelling   for
    approximately 5 months.  Asked to explain why he had made this journey,
    HA said:

         "The situation  in  IRQ  is  unstable.  The  terrorist  groups  are
         fighting each other - and then addition to this  ISIS  is  fighting
         and killing"

         [Q4.1 screening interview]

22. The country background evidence about the Kirkuk  region  in  2015-2016
    confirms that the situation was indeed unstable, and that fighting  and
    killing were  taking  place.  That  this  is  so  is  uncontested:  the
    Respondent agreed that to be the case during the May 2015 hearing of AA
    (Iraq) in May 2015, and that was found to remain the  position  in  the
    August 2016 hearing of BA (Returns to  Baghdad)  Iraq  CG  [2017]  UKUT
    00018 (IAC) (the decision promulgated on the 23rd January 2017).

23. In September 2017 the situation for Kurds in the Kirkuk area became yet
    more precarious, following the independence referendum in the IKR.   At
    the date of the referendum the city and most of the governate had  been
    under the control of Peshmerga forces under the command  of  the  Erbil
    government. Within  weeks  the  Government  of  Iraq  had  launched  an
    offensive to drive them  back  across  the  IKR  border,  supported  by
    Iranian-backed   Shi'ite    militias.      The    Danish    Immigration
    Service/Landinfo put the figure of civilians fleeing the affected areas
    as approximately 150,000; online news channel  Kurdistan24  put  it  at
    180,000.  All sources agree that the  majority  of  those  fleeing  the
    Iraqi advance were Kurdish civilians.

24. In the months that followed there were  numerous  credible  reports  of
    systematic human rights violations against the remaining population. An
    article by Al-Jazeera (cited in the 14th  December  2018  EASO  report)
    quotes a Kurdish man who fled the city: "at night  they  came  out  and
    beat the youth. They have burned houses. That's why  we  got  scared  -
    because of our families, that's why we left".   Amnesty  International,
    in a report focusing on the nearby town of  Tuz  Khurmatu,  found  that
    heavy machine guns, RPGs, mortars and Kalashnikovs had all  been  used;
    between 300-400 Kurdish  houses  had  been  blown  up  by  the  use  of
    explosives or burned down.  Crowds of civilians trying  to  leave  were
    subjected to gunfire.   Kurdish news agency  Basnews  reported  similar
    abuses occurring elsewhere in Kirkuk, perpetrated  by  Hashd  al-Shaabi
    militiamen who sexually assaulted women, looted and burned  bodies  and
    reportedly 'disrespected' the bodies of murdered civilians.

25. Following this initial wave of violence it would appear  that  some  of
    the civilians displaced from Kirkuk have  now  returned  to  the  city.
    There is a significant disparity in the evidence about how many. The US
    Consulate in Erbil reported that 'most' of those who fled the city  had
    subsequently returned; local NGOs interviewed by the Danish Immigration
    Service/Landinfo believed that at least 148,000 had not returned.

26. The various sources cited by EASO demonstrate that the  area  continues
    to be plagued by violence. Voice of America reported  in  October  2018
    that ISIL remain active in pockets of resistance in the governate.  The
    Center for Strategic and International Studies estimate that attacks in
    Kirkuk doubled from 2017 to  2018,  there  being  197  documented  ISIL
    attacks during that year.   The  Middle  Eastern  Research  Center  for
    Reporting and Analysis (MERCA) reported in April 2018 that the security
    situation in Kirkuk deteriorates at night and that  ISIL  set  up  fake
    checkpoints on the outskirts of the city.  Landinfo reported in October
    2018 that these attacks are leading to further population displacement.



27. This then is the factual matrix. We know that HA is from  a  suburb  of
    Erbil and that he left there sometime towards the end of 2015 when  the
    area was subject to such heavy fighting that  the  Secretary  of  State
    accepted Article 15(c) to be engaged.  We know that he  had  family  in
    the area when he left, who assisted him with the money to get an  agent
    in Erbil.  We know that the area has continued to be the  epicentre  of
    the  war  in  northern  Iraq,  and  that  there  have  been  successive
    population displacements as civilians try to avoid  ISIL,  shelling  by
    the Iraqi  government  forces,  and  human  rights  abuses  perpetrated
    against them by Shi'ite militias.   We know that when HA arrived in the
    United Kingdom he was not in  possession  of  any  identity  documents.
    That much is uncontentious.

28. The question for me is whether it is reasonably likely that HA has lost
    contact with his family as he claims, and that he is without the  means
    to obtain fresh Iraqi documentation.

29. I bear in mind that HA's account of having come under pressure by  ISIL
    in Kirkuk (to conduct what appears  to  have  been  a  suicide  mission
    against a Peshmerga position) was rejected by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    as being a fabrication.   I am further satisfied that HA  continued  to
    tell untruths at the hearing before  me,  specifically  in  respect  of
    whether he ever had his own Iraqi passport.   He gave evidence that  he
    has never had such a document, and that he left Iraq using false papers
    given to him by the agent in  Erbil,  which  he  subsequently  lost  in
    Turkey.   This is quite at odds  with  the  evidence  he  gave  in  his
    screening interview.  At 1.8 of the screening interview he said "I have
    lost my ppt in Turkey 5 months ago". At 3.3 he said "I left IRQ 5 mnths
    ago and I used my ppt only to go from IRQ to TUR" (emphasis added).  Mr
    McVeety is entirely justified in  asking  me  to  weigh  those  matters
    against HA in my deliberations.

30. That said I must also bear in mind that one lie, or even two, does  not
    mean that the entire account is a fabrication.  As Sir John  Dyson  put
    it in MA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2010]
    UKSC 49:

         "21.     For appellants who appeal to the AIT in Refugee Convention
         or Article 3 cases,  the  stakes  are  often  extremely  high.  The
         consequences of failure for  those  whose  cases  are  genuine  are
         usually grave. It is not,  therefore,  surprising  that  appellants
         frequently give fabricated  evidence  in  order  to  bolster  their
         cases".

    In this case those 'grave' consequences are known: HA  has  fled  from,
    and fears return to, a city where Article 15(c) conditions persist.  To
    that extent the core of his claim his based in truth, and his  untruths
    must be viewed in that context.

31. Having considered all  of  those  matters  in  the  round,  and  having
    reminded myself that the standard of proof is low, I am satisfied  that
    it is reasonably likely that HA has lost contact with his family as  he
    claims.   Mr McVeety is right to say that we could expect a  young  man
    setting off across Europe to want to stay in touch with his family, and
    to tell them he is alright, and to let them know when he reached Dover.
    That is all true.  What I must however bear in mind is the  intervening
    five years of civil war, unrest and population movement.  These  events
    are likely to have caused damage  to  the  infrastructure  and  I  find
    nothing implausible in HA's evidence that previously operational  phone
    lines suddenly went dead.   His evidence is that  he  did  not  have  a
    phone himself and so there was no way  for  relatives  -  remaining  in
    Kirkuk or otherwise - to stay in touch with him.

32. Nor am I satisfied that it  is  reasonably  likely  that  without  such
    family members (either still in possession of the original documents or
    able to assist HA in obtaining new ones) HA will be able  to  obtain  a
    CSID himself.   In AAH Dr Fatah explained  the  difficulties  returning
    Iraqis are facing in re-acquiring documents [�30]:

         "... Iraq is presently facing significant challenges in maintaining
         the system in the north of the country, however. Under ISIL control
         all recording  of  official  events  was  banned,  and  some  civil
         register offices, such as that in Mosul, were damaged or destroyed.
         The effect is that there is now a huge backlog for the  bureaucrats
         to catch up on. Between 2014  and  2017  no  marriages,  births  or
         deaths were recorded. Catching up will be a mammoth task. In  Mosul
         alone there are 1.5 million Iraqis  who  will  need  their  records
         updated. In addition to recording the names of those who have  died
         in the conflict there will be tens of thousands of  children  whose
         births have not been registered, or who were not entered  into  the
         record before ISIL took power. Their families are now desperate  to
         have their existence recorded, because without  that,  they  cannot
         obtain CSID cards; without CSID cards the children are not entitled
         to PDS cards; without PDS cards they cannot receive  food  rations.
         In addition many people lost their documents  during  the  conflict
         when homes were destroyed or 15 when fighting  broke  out,  causing
         people to flee at short notice without them. In light of this,  the
         problems of one individual returnee are likely to  be  given  short
         shrift. No procedures have  been  implemented  to  assist  the  re-
         documentation of returnees and in the view  of  Dr  Fatah  this  is
         because their issues are considered to be trivial compared  to  the
         position of IDPs already on  the  ground.  These  returnees  are  a
         "totally insignificant problem" for the authorities, whose  efforts
         are further hampered by the fact that many of the more  experienced
         civil servants, whose skills could be helpful at this  point,  were
         sacked in the "de-Ba'athification"  programme.  The  likelihood  of
         persuading an official to spend precious time  trying  to  find  an
         individual's records are even further diminished".

33. HA's civil registration office is in Kirkuk. HA cannot return to Kirkuk
    because it  remains  contested.  The  only  way  he  could  obtain  new
    documentation would be if he had someone in Kirkuk to help him get  it.
    Having had regard to the country background  evidence  I  am  satisfied
    that it is reasonably likely that he is telling the truth when he  says
    that he does not.

34. Applying the guidance in AAH I therefore find as follows.

35. HA would not likely be sent directly from the United Kingdom  to  Erbil
    because he is not a  resident  of  the  IKR,  but  supposing  that  the
    Secretary of State managed to effect removal that way, I assess whether
    it would be unduly harsh to expect HA to remain in Erbil, or  elsewhere
    in Kurdish territory. There is no evidence to indicate that he has  any
    connections there, excepting the agent who arranged his passage 5 years
    ago. I am not satisfied that this is an individual  to  whom  HA  could
    turn for assistance. As a Kurd he would have no difficulty in  entering
    the territory, and would face no legal impediment  to  doing  so.  Once
    there, however, HA  is  likely  to  face  significant  difficulties  in
    establishing himself in the absence of any external support or a  CSID.
    Without support from friends or family (either in Iraq  or  abroad)  HA
    would have to fend for himself. As a young man with no  connections  he
    is unlikely to be able to enter an IDP camp.   He  would  therefore  be
    left to secure accommodation, and work, himself.   Without  a  CSID  he
    would not be able to book into a hotel, or rent accommodation. He would
    therefore likely end up in what are described by the  aid  agencies  as
    'critical shelter arrangements' [at �127 of AAH]:

         "Approximately 26% of IDPs in the IKR are living  in  abandoned  or
         unfinished buildings, makeshift shelters erected on  spare  ground,
         or  are  squatting  in  government  or  religious  buildings.   The
         conditions in such shelters vary. You may be  living  in  a  mosque
         where you have access to clean water and sanitation facilities  and
         are fed at least one hot meal every day; on the other hand, you may
         be living in a makeshift tent on the verge of a busy road  and  not
         know where your next meal is coming from. In the  middle  of  those
         extremes there will be buildings in various stages of  dilapidation
         or development, some with roofs,  some  with  access  to  water  or
         heating, and some without. Some of these living  arrangements  will
         be of a comparable standard to  those  widely  found  elsewhere  in
         Iraq, where basic standards of sanitation and protection  from  the
         elements  are  provided;  some  fall   substantially   below   such
         standards".

36. Referring to the Secretary of State's policy not to return those Iraqis
    facing destitution we concluded in AAH that the litmus test of  whether
    life in such accommodation  would  be  'unduly  harsh'  would  be  food
    security:

         "128.    If  the  Respondent  accepts  that  an  individual  facing
         destitution - by which we understand to mean living on  the  street
         and having no food security - cannot be returned to Iraq because to
         do so could violate the United Kingdom's obligations under  Article
         3 ECHR, it must logically be the case that living conditions coming
         close to, or occasionally touching, such depths could be  described
         as 'unduly harsh'. It seems to us that the key determinant of where
         a returnee is likely to fall on that spectrum is whether he or  she
         is reasonably likely to find regular employment, or receive  income
         from another source.

         129.     The unemployment rate for Iraqi  IDPs  is  startling.  The
         materials before us uniformly state that  up  to  70%  of  the  IDP
         population is  unemployed.  That  is  to  be  contrasted  with  the
         national average of approximately 15%, a figure that rises  to  20%
         in the IKR, for both the host population and  the  other  group  of
         statistical significance, Syrian refugees.  Whether  an  individual
         returnee is likely to be able to get some employment - even  if  it
         is only a few  days  per  month  -  is  likely  to  depend  on  the
         confluence of the following factors:

             i)  Gender. Women with male guardians face  discrimination  in
             obtaining and keeping work, but women on their  own  are  very
             unlikely to be able to secure  legitimate  employment.  Social
             stigma and prejudice would present very significant  obstacles
             for prospective employers.  Lone  women  may  be  forced  into
             prostitution or situations of sex trafficking.

             ii)  Any  returnee  seeking  lawful  employment  must  be   in
             possession of a  CSID.  As  Dr  Fatah  makes  clear,  and  the
             Respondent accepts, this  document  is  vital.  Employers  are
             legally obliged to inform the Asayish of the identity of their
             employees, and they cannot be confident  of  that  information
             unless they have seen the individual's CSID.

             iii)      As we note above, family or other connections are of
             substantial  assistance  in  getting  work:  DFAT  find   that
             "patronage and  nepotism  significantly  influence  employment
             opportunities, making it difficult to internally  relocate  to
             the Kurdish region without existing networks".

             iv) Skills and experience. It is perhaps self-evident that  in
             a stagnating economy it will be  of  particular  advantage  to
             have proficiency in a core sector, such as food production  or
             education. The evidence  before  us  indicates  that  the  oil
             industry has been severely impacted and that the  construction
             boom of the past decade has come to an abrupt halt.  Those  at
             the greatest disadvantage  are  the  unskilled,  who  are  now
             competing for fewer and fewer opportunities in roles  such  as
             labouring.

             v)  Where they are 'from'. Although we think it unlikely  that
             this factor would on its own be determinative, we recognise Dr
             Fatah's  evidence  that  some  potential  employers   may   be
             suspicious of IDPs who are from areas of intense ISIL activity
             such as Diyala or Ninewa.

37. Having regard to those factors I find that HA would have some advantage
    in that he is an able bodied young man.  He claims  to  have  had  some
    experience in working as a labourer, and  states  that  he  had  a  job
    delivering food for a restaurant. He is therefore unskilled  and  would
    face what Dr Fatah regards as the  "greatest  disadvantage".  He  would
    also be distinctly disadvantaged by the  lack  of  connections  to  the
    area, and that fact that he has no CSID. It is the confluence of  these
    two latter factors which make it very likely, in my view, that he  will
    face prolonged periods where is unable  to  obtain  work  in  order  to
    provide himself with basic  necessities  such  as  clean  water,  food,
    clothing and heating.  That would be unduly harsh and it  follows  that
    his appeal must be allowed.




    Anonymity Order

38. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

39. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set  aside  to  the  limited
    extent identified above.

40. I re-make the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  on  humanitarian
    protection and human rights grounds. The appeal is dismissed on refugee
    grounds.

41. There is an order for anonymity.

                                                                9th May 2019
