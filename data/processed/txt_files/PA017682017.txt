                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Iraq born [ ] 1960 who arrived  in
    the UK illegally on 8th August 2016 and claimed asylum.  She claimed to
    have a well-founded fear of persecution in Iraq on  the  basis  of  her
    imputed political opinion, religion, and  membership  of  a  particular
    social group.  She explained that she wished to come to the UK to  look
    after her husband who had settled status in this country.

 2. The asylum and human rights claim was refused on 6th February 2017  and
    the Appellant's subsequent appeal heard by the FtT on 20th  March  2017
    and dismissed.  The FtT  found  that  the  Appellant  had  admitted  in
    interview that she had no problems in Iraq.  The  FtT  found  that  the
    Appellant's claim did not engage the Refugee Convention in any  way  at
    all.  The Appellant  has  her  daughters  living  in  Iraq  with  their
    families to whom she could return.  The FtT found  that  the  Appellant
    would not be at risk if returned  to  Iraq,  and  then  considered  her
    appeal with reference to Article 8.

 3. The FtT found that the Appellant could  not  succeed  by  relying  upon
    Appendix FM in relation to her family life.   Paragraph  276ADE(1)  was
    considered with reference to her private life, the FtT finding that she
    could not  satisfy  any  of  the  requirements  contained  within  that
    paragraph.

 4. The FtT considered Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules.   The  FtT
    found that the Appellant had not been able to show that she is  validly
    married because she could not produce her marriage certificate  but  it
    was accepted that the Appellant and her husband FR,  to  whom  I  shall
    refer as the Sponsor, are in a genuine and subsisting relationship  and
    that they have four children.

 5. The FtT found that the Appellant's removal would be  proportionate  and
    would not breach Article  8,  and  the  appeal  was  dismissed  on  all
    grounds.

 6. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    There was no challenge to the finding by the FtT that the Appellant was
    not entitled to asylum, and  no  challenge  to  the  finding  that  the
    Appellant would not be at risk if returned to Iraq.  It  was  contended
    that the FtT had materially erred in law at paragraph 34  by  making  a
    finding that the Appellant could  not  succeed  under  Appendix  FM  in
    relation to her family life with her husband, who it was  accepted  has
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK.  It was also  accepted  that  the
    Appellant had come to the UK in order to care for her sick husband.

 7. The grounds seeking permission to appeal contend that the FtT erred  by
    not making any examination of the  Appellant's  family  life  with  her
    husband pursuant to Appendix FM, and no  reasons  had  been  given  for
    concluding that the requirements of Appendix FM could not be satisfied.
     In particular section EX.1 of Appendix FM had not been considered.  It
    was contended that the FtT had erred in law by failing to consider,  in
    particular EX.1(b) and the FtT  should   have  found  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Lambert of the FtT.

Error of Law

 9. On 7th August 2017 I heard submissions from both parties in relation to
    error of law.  Full details of  the  application  for  permission,  the
    grant of permission, and the  submissions  made  by  both  parties  are
    contained in my error  of  law  decision  dated  8th  August  2017.   I
    concluded that the FtT decision must be set aside  and  set  out  below
    paragraphs 15-28 of my decision, giving reasons for setting  aside  the
    decision of the FtT;

         "15. There has been no challenge to the FtT findings in relation to
             the asylum and humanitarian protection claim, and no challenge
             to the finding that the Appellant would  not  be  at  risk  if
             returned to Iraq.

         16.  The complaint is that the FtT  did  not  consider  EX.1(b)  of
             Appendix FM and did not explain why not.

         17.  The FtT in paragraph 34 concludes that the  Appellant  "cannot
             succeed under Appendix FM on the basis of  her  family  life".
             The FtT then goes on to consider private life under  paragraph
             276ADE, and Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.  There is
             no explanation in paragraph 34 as to why the Appellant  cannot
             succeed under Appendix FM.  In paragraph 33 the FtT finds that
             the Appellant is cohabiting with her husband, but "cannot show
             that she is validly married because  she  cannot  produce  her
             marriage certificate".  That finding was not challenged in the
             grounds seeking permission to appeal.

         18.  Other  than  that  finding,  I  do  not  find  any  reason  or
             explanation given as to why the Appellant  could  not  succeed
             with reference to Appendix FM, and why  Appendix  FM,  and  in
             particular EX.1(b) was not considered.

         19.  In order for EX.1(b) to be considered the Appellant's  husband
             must satisfy the definition of a partner, which  is  contained
             within GEN.1.2 which is set out below;

                  For the purposes of this appendix "partner" means -

                  (i)  the applicant's spouse;

                  (ii) the applicant's civil partner;

                  (iii)     the  applicant's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
                      partner; or

                  (iv) a person  who  has  been  living  together  with  the
                      applicant in a relationship akin  to  a  marriage  or
                      civil partnership for at least two years prior to the
                      date of application.

         20.  Ms McCarthy suggested that if it was not accepted by  the  FtT
             that there was a valid marriage, the  FtT  should  have  found
             that the Appellant and her husband are fianc�(e)s.  I  do  not
             see any basis for the FtT to make such a  conclusion.   I  can
             ascertain no evidence placed before the FtT that the Appellant
             and her husband indicated that  there  was  any  intention  to
             marry.  Their case was that they were already married but they
             were unable to produce their marriage certificate.

         21.  It is clear that the couple could not  be  regarded  as  civil
             partners or proposed civil partners.

         22.  That leaves the question  of  whether  they  had  been  living
             together in a relationship akin to a marriage for at least two
             years prior to the date of application.  No finding is made on
             this.

         23.  It could be argued that there is no provision  that  a  couple
             must live together continuously for  a  period  of  two  years
             immediately prior to the date of application.  In this case it
             is clear that the Appellant and her husband  were  not  living
             together continuously for a two year period immediately  prior
             to the date of application.  The evidence was that they had in
             fact been separated between  2007  and  2016.   The  Appellant
             arrived in the UK in August 2016, and  they  commenced  living
             together in February 2017.

         24.  However the FtT made a finding that they have  adult  children
             and that they are in a genuine and subsisting relationship and
             that previously they had been  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship.

         25.  What is missing is any conclusion as to whether  they  satisfy
             the definition in GEN.1.2(iv).  They could  have  been  living
             together in a relationship akin to marriage prior to 2007.

         26.  I therefore conclude that the FtT erred in  law,  and  did  so
             materially, in failing to explain why the Appellant could  not
             succeed under EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM,  and  why  it  was  not
             considered.  I therefore must set aside the  decision  of  the
             FtT.  Some findings can be preserved as they have not been the
             subject  of  any  challenge.   Those  findings  are  that  the
             Appellant and her husband are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship.  There is DNA evidence that they have a son  who
             was born in 1987, and he has an older and two younger sisters.
              The Appellant and her husband are currently cohabiting.   The
             Appellant is looking after her husband who has  suffered  from
             cancer and depression.  The Appellant  and  her  husband  have
             family life which engages Article 8.

         27.  It is not appropriate to remit this appeal back to the FtT.  I
             find that it is not appropriate to decide this appeal  without
             a further hearing.  This is because findings need to  be  made
             as to whether the Appellant's husband satisfies the definition
             of a "partner" in GEN.1.2.  If he does then  it  would  appear
             that EX.1(b) of Appendix FM should be considered as part of an
             overall Article 8 assessment.

         28.  There will therefore be a further  hearing  before  the  Upper
             Tribunal.  The purpose of the  hearing  will  be  to  consider
             Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
             which may include consideration of EX.1(b) of Appendix FM."

10. The hearing was adjourned for further evidence to be given.

Re-making the Decision

Preliminary Issue

11. At the commencement of the hearing I made the representatives aware  of
    the documentation held on the Tribunal  file.   The  Tribunal  had  the
    Respondent's bundle that had been before the FtT which has Annexes  A-C
    and a skeleton argument from Mr Mohzan.  There  was  reference  to  the
    Tribunal having  received  a  consolidated  bundle  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant comprising 350 pages, but unfortunately this bundle  was  not
    on the Tribunal file.  Mrs Aboni  confirmed  that  the  Respondent  had
    received that bundle.

12. It was agreed that the hearing could proceed  as  Mr  Mohzan  confirmed
    that the Tribunal could take  his  bundle  at  the  conclusion  of  the
    hearing.

13. Mrs Aboni indicated that it was  conceded  that  the  definition  of  a
    "partner" is satisfied in this case in  that  the  Respondent  accepted
    that GEN.1.2(iv) was satisfied as the Appellant and  Sponsor  had  been
    living together in a relationship akin to a marriage for at  least  two
    years prior to the date of application.  The date  of  application  was
    the date of the asylum claim, that being 8th August 2016.

14. The representatives indicated that they were ready to proceed and there
    was no application for an adjournment.

The Oral Evidence

15. The Appellant gave oral evidence with the assistance of an  interpreter
    in Kurdish Sorani.  There was  no  difficulty  in  communication.   The
    Appellant adopted as her evidence  her  witness  statements  dated  6th
    March 2017 and 19th September 2017.

16. The Sponsor then gave evidence with the assistance of  the  interpreter
    in Kurdish Sorani.  There were no difficulties in  communication.   The
    Sponsor adopted as his evidence his witness statements dated 6th  March
    2017 and 19th September 2017.

17.  The  Appellant  and  Sponsor  were  cross-examined.   I  recorded  all
    questions and answers in  my  Record  of  Proceedings  and  it  is  not
    necessary to reiterate them in full here.  If relevant I will refer  to
    the oral evidence when I set out my conclusions and reasons.

The Oral Submissions

18. I heard oral submissions from both representatives which are set out in
    full in my Record of Proceedings and briefly summarised below.

19. On behalf of the Respondent reliance was placed upon  the  reasons  for
    refusal decision dated 6th February 2017.  It was accepted that EX.1(b)
    should be considered, but it was not accepted that  there  existed  any
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  between  the  Sponsor  and
    Appellant continuing outside the UK.  It was submitted that it had  not
    been demonstrated that any medical or care needs of the  Sponsor  could
    not be met in Iraq.

20. I was asked to consider the public  interest,  in  that  the  Appellant
    entered the UK illegally and made an  asylum  claim,  her  sole  motive
    being to gain entry to the UK and join her husband.  She had fabricated
    her asylum claim.

21. I was referred to section 117B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 and asked to note that the  Appellant  does  not  speak
    English, and is not financially independent.   The  evidence  indicated
    that the Appellant and Sponsor had family in Iraq, and I was  asked  to
    find that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  to  outweigh  the
    public interest  in  maintaining  effective  immigration  control,  and
    therefore the appeal should be dismissed.

22. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Mohzan relied upon his skeleton argument.
     I was asked to find that insurmountable obstacles  existed  to  family
    life continuing outside the UK.  The Sponsor has been in the  UK  since
    2002 and has medical needs.  He has previously  suffered  from  cancer.
    The Appellant provides him with intimate care on a  daily  basis.   The
    Sponsor would not be able to  access  the  medical  treatment  that  he
    requires in Iraq.

23. I was asked to find that there would  be  no  public  interest  in  the
    Appellant returning to Iraq to  make  an  entry  clearance  application
    through the correct channels.  It is accepted that  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor have a genuine and subsisting relationship.  With reference  to
    finance, if an entry clearance  application  needed  to  be  made,  the
    Sponsor would not have to show he had a specified gross  annual  income
    of at least �18,600 because he receives personal independence payments,
    and therefore all that need be shown is adequate maintenance.   It  was
    however accepted that the Appellant has not passed the required English
    language test.  Notwithstanding this, Mr Mohzan  submitted  that  there
    would be no public interest in the Appellant's  removal  and  therefore
    the appeal should be allowed with reference to Article 8.

24. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

25. The only issue before the Upper Tribunal related to Article  8  on  the
    basis of family life.  There was no challenge to the FtT findings  that
    the Appellant was not entitled to asylum  or  humanitarian  protection,
    and her removal from the UK would not breach Articles 2  or  3  of  the
    1950 European Convention on Human Rights.  As those findings  were  not
    challenged they are preserved.

26. There was also no challenge  to  the  findings  of  the  FtT  that  the
    Appellant could not succeed by relying upon paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  as
    she had not proved that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to
    her integration into Iraq.  The FtT  finding  on  this  point  is  also
    preserved.

27. As it was conceded at the outset of the hearing, that the definition of
    a "partner" was satisfied, it was also  conceded  that  section  EX  of
    Appendix FM should be considered and I set out below EX.1 and EX.2;

         'EX.1.   This paragraph applies if

              (a) (i)      the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
                      parental relationship with a child who -

                      (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was  under  the
                           age of 18 years  when  the  applicant  was  first
                           granted leave on the basis  that  this  paragraph
                           applied;

                      (bb)     is in the UK;

                      (cc)     is a British citizen or has lived in the  UK
                           continuously  for  at  least  the   seven   years
                           immediately preceding the  date  of  application;
                           and

                  (ii)     it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                      leave the UK; or

             (b)  the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                  with a partner who is in the UK and is a British  citizen,
                  settled in the UK or in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
                  humanitarian  protection,  and  there  are  insurmountable
                  obstacles to family  life  with  that  partner  continuing
                  outside the UK.

         EX.2.    For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
              obstacles" means  the  very  significant  difficulties  which
              would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner   in
              continuing their family life  together  outside  the  UK  and
              which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
              hardship for the applicant or their partner.'

28. It is common ground that the Appellant and Sponsor have a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.  They have an  adult  son  who  is  an  asylum
    seeker in the UK.  They have three daughters who live  in  Sulaymaniyah
    in the Iraqi Kurdish Region  (the  IKR).   Two  of  the  daughters  are
    married with their own families, and the youngest daughter was born  on
    5th February 2000.

29. The Appellant and Sponsor originate from Sulaymaniyah  and  moved  with
    their family  to  Baghdad  in  1989.   The  Sponsor  left  Baghdad  and
    travelled to the UK arriving in July 2002.  He claimed asylum, but  was
    not granted asylum, but was granted exceptional leave  to  remain,  and
    was granted indefinite leave to remain on 2nd March 2007.

30. In 2007 the Appellant and her children applied for entry  clearance  to
    join the Sponsor in the UK but the application was refused.  Thereafter
    the Sponsor did not remain in contact with his family until in February
    2016 his son arrived in the UK from Iraq.   After  that  the  Appellant
    made contact with the Sponsor again and made arrangements to enter  the
    UK.  The couple started living together  in  February  2017  and  still
    cohabit.

31. It is contended  that  the  Sponsor  could  not  return  to  Iraq,  and
    therefore the couple could not continue family  life  together  outside
    the UK.  The reason given for the Sponsor being  unable  to  return  to
    Iraq is his medical condition.

32. The  most  recent  medical  evidence  on  the  Sponsor's  condition  is
    contained in letters from his general practitioners  dated  20th  April
    2017 and 17th July  2017.   The  medical  history  shows  that  he  has
    suffered from depression, and he had an operation  for  cancer  of  the
    bladder.  He suffers with back pain and osteoarthritis of his knee.  In
    late 2016 he was referred to a memory clinic, but the clinic felt  that
    referral was not appropriate and he was referred to the  mental  health
    team.  There was no record that he was seen, and it appears that he did
    not attend the initial appointment and so  was  discharged.   He  takes
    medication for incontinence  following  the  cancer  operation  on  his
    bladder.

33. The Sponsor has also been seen by the spinal team  for  his  back  pain
    which causes numbness in his thigh  and  examination  showed  decreased
    sensation but good power.  He received a spinal injection and there are
    plans to follow up.  He receives painkillers  for  his  osteoarthritis.
    His current medication is Fenbid 5% Gel,  Fultium  D3,  Zapain  30/500,
    Tolterodine, as well as catheters and sheaths to aid continence.

34. I do not find that the medical evidence demonstrates that  the  Sponsor
    needs a carer.  It does not demonstrate that he  needs  24  hour  care.
    While I accept that the Sponsor wishes the  Appellant  to  act  as  his
    carer,  the  evidence  does  not  indicate  that  there  is  a  medical
    requirement for him to have a carer.  Although there has  in  the  past
    been a referral to the mental health team, the Sponsor did not keep the
    appointment and is not currently having any counselling or treatment in
    relation to depression.

35. There is a considerable amount of  background  evidence  about  medical
    treatment in  Iraq  contained  within  the  Appellant's  bundle.   That
    evidence does not indicate the medication  currently  received  by  the
    Sponsor and  listed  above,  would  not  be  available  in  Iraq.   The
    Appellant and Sponsor originate from Sulaymaniyah within the  IKR,  and
    therefore it would be open for  them  to  return  direct  to  the  IKR.
    Alternatively they could return to Baghdad, where they resided together
    between 1989 and 2002.  The Appellant has only been  absent  from  Iraq
    since August 2016, and while I accept that because the Sponsor has been
    absent since 2002, there would be an upheaval for him, I  do  not  find
    that the evidence  demonstrates  that  there  would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles to the couple living together in the country  of  which  they
    are citizens.

36. I therefore conclude that there  are  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life continuing outside the UK, and therefore  the  requirements
    of EX.1(b) are not satisfied.

37. I move on to consider  Article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    relation to family and private life.  I have  taken  into  account  the
    guidance in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 at paragraph  48,  in  which  it  is
    confirmed that if the test of insurmountable obstacles is not met,  but
    refusal  of  the  application  would  result  in  unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences, such that refusal would not be proportionate, then  leave
    will be granted outside the Immigration Rules on the basis  that  there
    are exceptional circumstances.

38. I do not find that it has been demonstrated  that  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences would follow from refusal of the  Appellant's  application
    under Article 8.  The couple could return to Iraq  and  continue  their
    family life, or alternatively the Appellant could return  to  Iraq  and
    make an application for entry clearance through  the  proper  channels.
    The Sponsor could remain in the UK  and  support  the  entry  clearance
    application.  I do not accept that it is essential  for  the  Sponsor's
    wellbeing that the Appellant remain in the UK to look  after  him.   As
    previously stated, there is no medical evidence to  indicate  that  the
    Sponsor requires  a  carer.   The  Sponsor  had  no  contact  with  the
    Appellant from 2007 until 2016 and was able in that  period  to  manage
    without  her  assistance.   I  do  not  accept  that  his  health   has
    deteriorated to such an extent that he requires a carer either full  or
    part-time.

39. I also take into account the guidance in paragraph 51 of Agyarko  which
    indicates that if an individual, even if residing in the UK unlawfully,
    was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter  if  an  application
    was made from outside the UK, then there might be no public interest in
    their removal, as was  illustrated  by  the  decision  in  Chikwamba  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department.

40. I do not find that the Chikwamba principle  assists  the  Appellant  in
    this case.  I do not find that it can be said that she would be certain
    to be granted leave to enter the UK if she  made  an  application  from
    Iraq.  She has not at present taken an English language test  so  would
    not  be  granted  entry  clearance  on  that  basis.    The   financial
    circumstances of the Sponsor would need to be examined.  It might  well
    be that the Sponsor would be granted entry clearance, but in my view it
    cannot be said that she is certain to be granted entry  clearance,  and
    for that reason I do not find that the Chikwamba principle assists.

41. I have regard to the considerations of section 117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Subsection  (1)  confirms  that  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control is in the public interest.
     Subsection (2) confirms that it is  in  the  public  interest  that  a
    person seeking leave to  remain  can  speak  English  to  the  required
    standard.  The Appellant has not demonstrated that  she  can  speak  or
    understand English to the required standard.  Subsection  (3)  confirms
    that it is in the public interest that a person seeking leave to remain
    is  financially  independent.   The  Appellant   is   not   financially
    independent.  She is dependent upon the Sponsor.

42. Subsections (4) and (5) confirm that little reliance should  be  placed
    upon a private life established by a person  when  in  the  UK  with  a
    precarious immigration status  or  unlawfully.   This  applies  to  the
    Appellant as she entered the UK illegally and  she  has  remained  here
    without leave.  I therefore must attach little weight  to  the  private
    life that she has established.

43. Therefore, with reference to Article 8, the  Appellant  cannot  satisfy
    paragraph 276ADE(1) with reference to her private life, cannot  satisfy
    Appendix FM in relation to her family life, and  has  not  demonstrated
    that  removal  from  the  UK  would  result  in   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences  so  as  to  amount  to  exceptional  circumstances.   The
    Appellant  entered  the  UK  illegally  in  a  deliberate  attempt   to
    circumvent the Immigration Rules, knowing that a  previous  application
    made for entry clearance in 2007 had been refused.

44. I have, when conducting the balancing exercise, taken into account  the
    wishes of the Appellant and Sponsor that the Appellant  be  allowed  to
    remain in the UK, and I have taken fully  into  account  the  Sponsor's
    medical condition.  However,  for  the  reasons  given  above,  I  must
    conclude that the weight that should be given to the need  to  maintain
    effective  immigration  control,  which  is  in  the  public  interest,
    outweighs the weight to be given to the wishes  of  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor to continue family life in the UK,  and  I  conclude  that  the
    Respondent's decision is proportionate and does not breach Article 8 of
    the 1950 Convention.
