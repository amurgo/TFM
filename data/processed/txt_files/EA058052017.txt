                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Poland. He  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 5 June 2017
    refusing to issue to him a permanent  residence  card.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed his appeal on the papers. The appellant now  appeals
    to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. I am grateful to Mr McVeety, who appeared before the Upper Tribunal  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State, who acknowledged that  the  appellant
    had provided  evidence  sufficient  to  prove  that  he  satisfied  the
    provisions of Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016.
    The judge had considered the appeal without a hearing  and  Mr  McVeety
    agreed that the full documentary evidence provided by the appellant had
    not been put before him. Had it been, there is no doubt that the  judge
    would have allowed the appeal.

Notice of Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated  on  20  September
    2017 is set aside. I have remade the decision. The  appellant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  5  June  2017  is
    allowed.
