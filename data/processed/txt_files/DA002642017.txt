Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P. Haywood, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASSONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me after a hearing on  27  November  2017
    whereby I set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error  of
    law. The resumed hearing was for the re-making of the decision. I  have
    included the error of law decision (entitled Decision  and  Directions)
    as an annex to this decision and to which reference should be made  for
    the full background to the  appeal,  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge ("the FtJ") and my  reasons  for  setting  the  decision
    aside.

 2. For immediate context, I repeat some paragraphs of what I said  in  the
    error of law decision.

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania, born in 1990.  He  arrived  in
    the UK in 1998 as a dependant on a claim for asylum made by his mother.
     That asylum claim was  refused  but  the  appellant  was  nevertheless
    granted indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") on 11 November 2004.

 4. A decision was made by the respondent  on  18  April  2017  to  make  a
    deportation order against him pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA  Regulations"),  prompted  by
    his criminal offending.  His last conviction was on 22 December 2016 at
    West London Magistrates' Court for an offence  of  burglary  and  theft
    (non-dwelling), and was an offence committed whilst a  community  order
    was in force.  He received a sentence of 26 weeks' imprisonment, with a
    victim surcharge of ï¿½115.

 5. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal came before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge C. J. Woolley at a hearing on  15  June  2017
    which resulted in Judge Woolley allowing the appeal with  reference  to
    the EEA Regulations.  It was that decision that I set aside.

 6. At the re-making hearing, oral evidence was called from  the  appellant
    and the appellant's partner/girlfriend whom I shall identify as NS. The
    following is a summary of their oral evidence.

    The oral evidence

 7. In examination-in-chief the appellant adopted his most  recent  witness
    statement dated 12 April 2018.

 8. In cross-examination he said that he was released from detention at the
    end of September 2017. He lives with  his  mother  and  five  year  old
    stepsister. However, he does not stay there all the time, but  most  of
    the time. His grandmother lives elsewhere.

 9. He is taking medication, prescribed by his GP: Olanzapine for  "voices"
    and Venlafaxine. It was over a month ago that he went  to  his  GP  and
    then he went to the Claybrook Centre in Hammersmith where he stayed for
    a month, because he wanted to commit suicide.  As to whether he had any
    documentary evidence in relation to those matters, he produced a letter
    from West London NHS Mental Health  Trust  stating  that  he  had  been
    referred by his GP, and asking the appellant to contact them. As to the
    date of his stay in the hospital, he said  that  his  memory  has  been
    quite bad because he has been quite depressed. He does not know why his
    girlfriend's witness statement does not refer to his hospital admission
    but she knew that he was in a bad state.

10. He met his girlfriend in a park, through a  friend.  That  was  roughly
    five or six months ago, about a month  or  so  after  he  came  out  of
    detention. It was  definitely  October  or  before  that.  He  and  his
    girlfriend spent Christmas together.

11. She is a mother and looking for  part-time  work.  Her  child  is  aged
    three. Her home in Chesham is the last stop on the  Metropolitan  line.
    He lives in Northolt and it takes him about an hour or an  hour  and  a
    half to get there.  She  is  on  housing  and  child  benefit.  She  is
    Hungarian but speaks English.

12. He does not live with her. That is partly because she  is  on  benefits
    but also because he does not want to intrude in her life too  much  and
    be a bother. However, they do want to start a  family.  They  had  lost
    twins over two months ago, in February, although he is not sure of  the
    date. The birth was complicated.

13. He has not had any difficulty with drugs since  he  was  released  from
    detention in September. He does not attend anywhere  for  drug  testing
    and does not take any drug substitutes, such as methadone.

14. As to why neither his mother nor grandmother had  provided  any  letter
    (or statement) for the court, his mother  did  not  understand  how  it
    works. She thought that she could just come to court.  In  relation  to
    the last hearing, he was living in Walthamstow and he excluded  himself
    from his family a bit. As to why there is  no  statement  from  her  in
    relation to this hearing, he has not been staying with her for nearly a
    month. Although he had said earlier that he was living with his  mother
    and stepdaughter, he was not staying there all the time. He stays  with
    his girlfriend and friends sometimes.

15. Although that did not prevent him from asking them for a statement,  he
    repeated his earlier evidence and added that his mother  was  also  not
    sure if she would be able to attend as she has a child who has to go to
    school. Also, she does not write English very well.

16. In re-examination, asked why he maintained that  he  would  not  commit
    more offences, he said that previously he was very vulnerable  and  was
    homeless. He had no hope, no girlfriend and had mental health problems.
    Now he has looked at his thoughts and understands himself  and  how  to
    live a good life. He has everything he needs. He is  a  changed  person
    and will never go back to that. Drugs took five or  six  years  of  his
    life but it is not too late to start (again) now.

17. NS adopted her undated witness statement  in  examination-in-chief.  In
    cross-examination she said that she and the appellant had been together
    for about six or seven months. They first met in Northolt when she  was
    visiting his mother who was/is her friend. They were just  sitting  and
    talking when they first met. They then went out to the park.  They  did
    not meet in the park for the first time but at his mother's house,  and
    they then went to the park where they talked properly.

18. She has a three-year old child. At the moment she is being supported by
    social services. The council have put her in  temporary  accommodation.
    She does not live with the appellant although sometimes he stays  over.
    She would say that he normally lives at his mother's, his grandmother's
    or with friends, and sometimes at her place.

19. He takes medication. She knows that he went to the  hospital  and  they
    gave him medication but she does not know what it is called. She  knows
    that he had depression. He was in  a  hospital  in  Hammersmith  during
    their relationship and she visited him there. She thinks he  was  there
    roughly two or three months ago. She does not remember exactly  because
    that was the time that she lost the baby. It was a rough time for  her.
    She is really in a relationship with him.

    Submissions

20.  I  am  grateful  to  both  parties  for  their  very  helpful  written
    submissions.

21. Mr Melvin relied on the decision letter and his written submissions. It
    was argued that the evidence given by the appellant and his  girlfriend
    needed to be treated with caution. There was  little  evidence  of  any
    mental health problems and the  letter  from  the  NHS  Trust  was  not
    medical evidence that he was suffering from depression  or  that  there
    was any risk of suicide. There was no evidence  from  the  hospital  or
    from his GP.

22. Conflicting evidence had been given by the appellant and his girlfriend
    in relation to what  was  said  to  have  been  a  hospital  admission,
    notwithstanding the fact that that is said to have taken place only one
    or two months ago. It was submitted that the claim  of  a  relationship
    was nothing more than a ruse to give the appearance  of  some  form  of
    family life.

23. Further, there was little evidence of  the  appellant  abstaining  from
    taking illicit drugs. That drug taking was the cause of  his  offences,
    and the reoffending after the 2015 appeal hearing. Although  there  was
    no evidence that he had committed any  offences  since  September  2017
    (when he was released from detention) there was nevertheless a  serious
    risk of reoffending.

24. He is not in any better position than he was at the time of the hearing
    before Judge Woolley. He is flitting from place to place,  living  with
    his mother, grandmother, girlfriend or friends.  He  does  not  have  a
    proper residence from where he would be able  to  find  employment,  or
    charity work or to show that he was properly integrated.

25. He had previously done drug rehabilitation courses in prison  but  went
    on to commit further offences and take drugs again. There is no genuine
    relationship or anything like genuine family support. He had not  shown
    that he had turned his life around as claimed.

26. He is aged 27 years, is in relatively good health, and has language and
    cultural links to Lithuania. His family members in the UK could  assist
    him with integration in Lithuania.

27. Mr Haywood relied on his skeleton  argument.  He  referred  to  various
    aspects of it in terms of the relevant legal framework and authorities.
    I need not summarise those submissions which,  it  seems  to  me,  were
    uncontroversial in terms of the legal principles to be applied.

28. As regards the oral evidence, it was accepted that the relationship was
    of short duration but there was no question  of  it  being  a  ruse  to
    secure the appellant's stay in the  UK.  NS  knew  about  his  hospital
    admission, and referred to their speaking to each other in the park  on
    their first meeting. Both gave evidence about her miscarriage a  couple
    of months ago.

29. The key issues are the previous findings and the types of offences that
    he had been  convicted  of;  theft  by  shoplifting  and  opportunistic
    burglary. The appellant had said that he was no longer taking drugs and
    had been clean for a year. That coincides with his time in custody  and
    his release. The only question in cross-examination  which  touched  on
    this  issue  was  in  terms  of  whether  he  was  receiving  any  drug
    substitutes. There was no evidence that he had reoffended.

30. The question also was whether in any event the nature of the  offending
    was such as to establish the necessary  serious  grounds.  Even  if  it
    does, the evidence does not establish that  he  represents  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental  interests  of  society.  There  needs  to  be  a   current
    propensity to offend and in terms of a risk to society.

31. Mr Haywood contrasted the appellant's offending with offences  of,  for
    example, serious violence. Given that  he  has  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, the offending would have to be more  serious.  Even  if  the
    required level of threat was established, in the balancing exercise one
    would then have to consider integration and factors such  as  his  long
    residence.

    Assessment and Conclusions

32. The most relevant aspects of the applicable legal framework within  the
    EEA Regulations are reg 27 and Schedule 1.

33. Reg 27 provides as follows:

         Decisions taken on grounds of public policy,  public  security  and
         public health


         27.-     (1)  In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an
             EEA decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.

             (2) A relevant decision may not be  taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.

             (3) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except  on  serious  grounds  of  public  policy  and   public
             security.

             (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of  at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is in the best  interests  of  the  person  concerned,  as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on
                  20th November 1989.

             (5) The public policy and public security requirements of  the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.

             (6) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public
             policy and public security in relation to a person  ("P")  who
             is resident in the United Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must
             take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,  state  of
             health, family and economic situation  of  P,  P's  length  of
             residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and  cultural
             integration into the United Kingdom  and  the  extent  of  P's
             links with P's country of origin.

             ...

             (8) A court or tribunal considering whether  the  requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society etc.).

34. Schedule 1 to the EEA Regulations states as follows:

         SCHEDULE 1CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PUBLIC SECURITY AND THE
         FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.


         Considerations of public policy and public security


         1. The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public policy
         or public security values: member States enjoy considerable
         discretion, acting within the parameters set by the EU Treaties,
         applied where relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own
         standards of public policy and public security, for purposes
         tailored to their individual contexts, from time to time.

         Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom


         2. An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national having
         extensive familial and societal links with persons of the same
         nationality or language does not amount to integration in the
         United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
         integration must be present before a person may be regarded as
         integrated in the United Kingdom.

         3. Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA national
         has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
         longer the sentence, or the more numerous the convictions, the
         greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence in
         the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.

         4. Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an EEA
         national or the family member of an EEA national within the United
         Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at or around
         the same time as-

             (a) the commission of a criminal offence;

             (b) an act otherwise affecting the fundamental interests of
             society;

             (c) the EEA national or family member of an EEA national was
             in custody.

         5. The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of not demonstrating a threat (for example, through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate.

         6. It is consistent with public policy and public security
         requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions may be taken
         in order to refuse, terminate or withdraw any right otherwise
         conferred by these Regulations in the case of abuse of rights or
         fraud, including-

             (a) entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person
             to enter or to attempt to enter, a marriage, civil partnership
             or durable partnership of convenience; or

             (b) fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain, or
             assisting another to obtain or to attempt to obtain, a right
             to reside under these Regulations.

         The fundamental interests of society


         7. For the purposes of these Regulations, the fundamental interests
         of society in the United Kingdom include-

             (a) preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the
             immigration laws, and maintaining the integrity and
             effectiveness of the immigration control system (including
             under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

             (b) maintaining public order;

             (c) preventing social harm;

             (d) preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

             (e) protecting public services;

             (f) excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of
             an EEA national with a conviction (including where the conduct
             of that person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,
             public offence) and maintaining public confidence in the
             ability of the relevant authorities to take such action;

             (g) tackling offences likely to cause harm to society where an
             immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify but
             where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related
             to the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension
             as mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning
             of the European Union);

             (h) combating the effects of persistent offending
             (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in
             isolation, may otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements
             of regulation 27);

             (i) protecting the rights and freedoms of others, particularly
             from exploitation and trafficking;

             (j) protecting the public;

             (k) acting in the best interests of a child (including where
             doing so entails refusing a child admission to the United
             Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);



             (l) countering terrorism and extremism and protecting shared
             values.

35. In assessing the appellant's evidence I bear in mind that his  evidence
    was that he had mental health problems  and  was  receiving  treatment.
    However, it was not suggested on his behalf, either  before  or  during
    the hearing, in his witness  statement  or  in  the  skeleton  argument
    provided on his behalf, that he would have  any  particular  difficulty
    answering questions or that his evidence may be unreliable  because  of
    his mental health condition. Nothing was said  in  submissions  on  his
    behalf in that regard either. It is nevertheless a matter that  I  have
    borne in mind in considering his evidence.

36. At the hearing I discussed with the parties the issue of what  findings
    of fact made by the Judge Woolley could be preserved.  Those  preserved
    findings are as follows:

           .     The appellant has acquired a permanent right of residence.

           .     He arrived in the UK aged 7 years.

           .     He spoke English and had been educated in the UK.

           .     He had been of good character until the age of 24 years.

           .     He has few, if any, ties to Lithuania.

37. Mr Melvin contended in opening submissions, and indeed in  his  written
    submissions, that the appellant had  not  established  that  he  has  a
    permanent right of residence. However, Judge Woolley concluded at  [14]
    that the appellant had acquired a permanent  right  of  residence,  the
    matter having been conceded by the Presenting Officer at that  hearing.
    Furthermore, Judge Rodger, who heard an  appeal  by  the  appellant  in
    2015, had previously  concluded  that  the  appellant  had  acquired  a
    permanent right of  residence  on  the  basis  of  being  a  worker  or
    jobseeker. Further, this was not  an  aspect  of  the  Judge  Woolley's
    decision that was challenged in the grounds seeking permission.

38. The acquisition of a  permanent  right  of  residence  is  a  preserved
    finding and I consider the appeal on that basis.

39. There is no specific order in which the relevant  legal  considerations
    need to be approached, but clearly if it is  possible  to  identify  or
    isolate what seems immediately apparent as a, or the, central issue  in
    the assessment, it is reasonable to  consider  that  or  those  matters
    first. Thus, in this case such issues are the extent to which it  could
    be said that there are serious grounds  of  public  policy  and  public
    security, and whether the appellant represents a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society. I deal with the latter first.

40. That question involves deciding whether  the  appellant  is  likely  to
    reoffend. The appellant says no, the respondent says yes.  In  my  view
    the answer is yes, he is likely to reoffend.

41. I take into account that he has not  been  convicted  of  any  criminal
    offences since his  release  from  detention  in  September  2017,  and
    (almost) necessarily whilst detained. I also bear in mind  his  written
    and oral evidence as to his commitment not to reoffend, as well as  the
    evidence of his girlfriend.  However,  the  appellant  has  given  that
    assurance before, during his appeal in 2015 before Judge Rodger, but he
    committed further offences after his appeal was allowed. This is what I
    said in my error of law decision at [29]:

         "In addition, I consider that it  was  irrational  of  the  FtJ  to
         conclude that the appellant does not have a propensity to re-offend
         and that he does not represent "an unacceptably high  risk  of  re-
         offending".  The appellant  has  been  convicted  of  a  number  of
         offences, starting in October 2014.   His  appeal  was  allowed  by
         Judge Rodger who was optimistic as to the appellant's prospects  of
         not re-offending.  The appellant re-offended within about a year of
         his  successful  appeal,  and  committed  a  more  serious  offence
         (burglary) than he had committed in the past.  The evidence did not
         support Judge Woolley's conclusion that the  appellant  would  have
         the support of his family, who  are  unaware  of  his  most  recent
         offending.   Thus,  the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  did  not
         represent a risk of re-offending was flawed."

42. I do not see that anything, or anything much, has changed since I  came
    to the conclusion that Judge Woolley's decision  in  this  respect  was
    irrational. I have already referred to the fact that the appellant  has
    not in fact reoffended since his release from  detention,  but  in  the
    scheme of the appellant's offending  history  it  is  relatively  early
    days.

43. I do not consider that there is much to be  said  for  the  proposition
    that he would have family support or the support of his  girlfriend  or
    that the relationship with his girlfriend would provide  a  significant
    protective factor in terms of the risk of reoffending.

44. I agree with the sentiment  behind  Mr  Melvin's  contention  that  the
    appellant was "flitting from place to place",  thus  implying  to  some
    extent a lack of stability. The appellant's evidence was not altogether
    consistent on the issue of where he was staying. He said at first  that
    he lived with his mother and stepsister, and that he stayed there  most
    of the time but not all the time. When asked questions about why  there
    was no written evidence from his mother or  grandmother,  his  evidence
    was then that for the past month he  had  not  been  staying  with  his
    mother, then repeating what he had earlier said about staying with  his
    girlfriend and friends.

45. What the appellant said about where he was living may not on  the  face
    of it seem to be very inconsistent but as  I  heard  the  evidence  the
    impression I formed was one of some tailoring of the answer to suit the
    question. I do not wish to overemphasise that impression; that is why I
    said in the previous paragraph that his evidence  was  not  "altogether
    consistent".

46. The main point about this aspect of the evidence however,  is  that  it
    may reveal the appellant still to be vulnerable because of  a  lack  of
    consistent  or  stable  positive   influences   in   his   life.   That
    vulnerability and lack of stability as a  matter  of  common  sense  is
    relevant to whether he is likely to resort again to the use of  illicit
    drugs which is said to be, and I accept is, the cause of his offending.

47. On the same topic, I was wholly unconvinced by the appellant's evidence
    about why there was no written evidence from his mother or grandmother.
    Both of them attended the hearing  before  me  but  neither  gave  oral
    evidence. No point was made on behalf of the respondent about their not
    having given evidence and therefore nor do I, without  the  opportunity
    for any response on behalf of  the  appellant.  However,  none  of  the
    reasons given by the appellant, either alone or  cumulatively,  for  no
    written evidence being available from either of them was  credible.  He
    has had legal representation  during  the  course  of  the  proceedings
    before the Upper Tribunal, so  the  reason  could  not  be  a  lack  of
    knowledge or guidance on the matter. It is not as if he  does  not  see
    his mother at all. On the face of it, it would have been  a  relatively
    simple exercise to obtain something at least in writing from  her,  and
    from his grandmother for  that  matter.  A  lack  of  English  language
    ability could be overcome by a translation.

48. As regards his relationship with NS, I do not agree with the suggestion
    that the claim of a relationship was nothing more than a ruse  to  give
    the appearance of some form of family life. Likewise, I  do  not  think
    that there is much to  be  said  for  the  contention  that  there  was
    significant inconsistency between the appellant's  evidence  and  hers.
    For example, she was aware that the  appellant  had  had  a  relatively
    recent hospital admission. She explained why she was unable to remember
    exactly when that was, in the context of her having had  a  miscarriage
    at about that time and the effect that that had on her. There was  some
    arguable inconsistency in relation to  their  first  meeting  (park  or
    house) but their accounts were consistent enough such  that  I  do  not
    consider that the inconsistency is significant.

49. The evidence was that they  want  to  start  a  family.  I  accept  the
    evidence that NS suffered a miscarriage.  The  implication  from  their
    evidence is that the appellant was the father.  I  have  no  reason  to
    doubt that evidence. It is not for me to say whether what is said to be
    a plan to start a family is realistic, because relationships  exist  in
    many different forms and in many different circumstances.  However,  it
    is for me to  come  to  a  view  about  whether  there  is  in  fact  a
    considered, concrete or actual plan to start  a  family  and  to  be  a
    family, as opposed to that being something that is simply  an  idea  of
    something that may be possible in the future.

50. I am of the view that it is the latter; namely just an idea and  not  a
    concrete plan. It seems to me that the evidence points clearly  in  the
    direction of that conclusion. In the first place, the evidence is  that
    the  relationship  has  only  existed  for  a  matter  of  months.  The
    appellant's evidence was that they met five or six months  ago  and  NS
    said that  they  had  been  together  for  six  or  seven  months.  The
    relationship appears to have started from more or less when they  first
    met. What that means is that this is not a relationship between  people
    who had known each other before for any period of time at all.

51. Secondly, they do not live together. That alone does not mean  much  in
    terms of any assessment of  their  relationship.  What  is  significant
    however,  is  the  appellant's  explanation  for  that.  He   gave   an
    explanation about NS living on state benefits but  also  said  that  he
    does not want to intrude in her life too much and be a bother. That  is
    hardly consistent with what he next said about their wanting to start a
    family, or consistent with the contention that they are in a stable and
    committed relationship.

52. I am not satisfied that the evidence establishes that  the  appellant's
    relationship with NS forms much of a  protective  factor  in  terms  of
    reducing or eliminating the risk of his reoffending. My  assessment  of
    his relationships in the UK leads me to conclude  that  none  of  those
    relationships are such as would help much in reducing the risk  of  his
    reoffending.

53. I do accept that the appellant  has,  and  continues  to  suffer  from,
    mental health problems. I also accept that he had a short admission  to
    hospital relatively recently. He  and  NS  both  referred  to  it.  The
    appellant named the hospital. His evidence was  that  he  is  receiving
    treatment for his mental health condition(s) and he was  able  to  name
    the medication that he  is  receiving  and  explain  what  one  of  the
    medications was for. However, there was no medical evidence  before  me
    and therefore it is not possible  on  the  evidence  to  conclude  that
    because he is receiving treatment now and he was not before, he is less
    likely to reoffend. There is little, if anything,  to  support  such  a
    contention in terms of such medical treatment that he is receiving.

54. The appellant's offending and the risk in relation to future offending,
    is likely to be in terms of offences of dishonesty. This has  to  date,
    almost exclusively, involved stealing from shops, since October 2014 up
    to his last conviction on 22 December 2016 which  was  a  burglary  and
    theft in relation to non-residential premises. He has had  eight  court
    appearances in relation to 12 offences. Apart from  the  burglary,  the
    other exception from  the  general  pattern  of  his  offending,  is  a
    conviction in April 2015 for failing to provide a sample  to  ascertain
    whether he had a class A drug in his system.

55. In the assessment of whether the appellant's conduct  affects  one  the
    fundamental interests of society, paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 of the  EEA
    Regulations states that the fundamental interests  of  society  include
    under subparagraph (h), "combating the effects of persistent  offending
    (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in isolation, may
    otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements of regulation 27)".

56. It seems to me that the appellant's offending is persistent. However, I
    am also of the  view  that  his  offending  is  unlikely  to  meet  the
    requirements of reg 27, that is  to  say  being  justified  on  serious
    grounds of public policy and public security, which is what is required
    given that he has a permanent right of residence. The offences are not,
    or even approaching, those at the most serious end of the  spectrum  of
    offending. Offences of dishonesty of the type that  the  appellant  has
    been involved in, and which represents the future risk in terms of type
    of offence, can achieve the level of seriousness required, for  example
    where it is organised or involving high value goods, which is  not  the
    case with this appellant's offences.

57. However, combating the effects of persistent offending is described  in
    Schedule 1 as a matter that affects one of the fundamental interests of
    society. Nevertheless, that is not the same  thing  as  saying  that  a
    persistent offender is, by definition, a person whose  conduct  affects
    the fundamental interests of  society.  The  nature  of  the  offending
    plainly must  be  taken  into  account.  In  addition,  the  degree  of
    persistence is relevant. It is clearly possible to conceive of types of
    persistent offending at a low level and at a  frequency  that  is  more
    serious than others.

58. I have carefully considered all  those  factors  in  relation  to  this
    appellant. I do not regard reference to other cases in terms  of  their
    facts to be of much assistance in circumstances where each  case  needs
    to be decided on its  own  facts  once  the  issues  of  principle  are
    established. I am not satisfied that the appellant's offending,  "taken
    in isolation" (Schedule 1, para 7(h)), could be  said  to  justify  his
    removal on serious grounds of public policy or public security. That is
    not to minimise his offending, but simply to recognise it for  what  it
    is in terms of seriousness relative to  the  public  policy  or  public
    security interests at stake.

59. Nor do I consider that the persistence of his offending 'converts'  it,
    as it were, to offending that comes within reg 27. Between October 2014
    and April 2015 was the period within which  the  appellant's  offending
    was most frequent. After the sentence of  nine  weeks  imprisonment  in
    April 2015 his next conviction was on 11 November 2016 and then  on  22
    December 2016, the last and most serious conviction (and sentence).

60. Since his release in September 2017 there is no evidence  that  he  has
    committed any further offences. That is not the longest period that  he
    has been free of offending but it is a period  which  reflects  on  the
    degree of persistence in his offending.

61. I bear in  mind  that  Schedule  1(3)  provides  that  the  longer  the
    sentence, or  the  more  numerous  the  convictions,  the  greater  the
    likelihood that the  individual's  continued  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom represents a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting of the fundamental interests of society.

62. I have said that in my view  Schedule  1  does  not  equate  persistent
    offending with offending that comes within reg 27. It is  a  matter  of
    fact and degree. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that  the
    appellant's removal is justified on serious grounds of public policy or
    public security. Nor do consider that his personal conduct represents a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society. In this  I  bear  in  mind  that  reg
    27(5)(c) does not require that the threat must be imminent.

63. In the light of those conclusions, it is not necessary for me to go  on
    to consider the other aspects of reg 27 which require consideration  in
    cases  of  removal  of  EEA  nationals,  such  as  the   principle   of
    proportionality or the several matters set out at reg 27(6) in terms of
    the  appellant's  particular  circumstances  such  as  age,  length  of
    residence and so forth.

64. The appeal is allowed with reference to the EEA Regulations. Article  8
    of the ECHR needs no separate consideration in the circumstances.




    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. Its decision having been set aside,  I  re-make  the
    decision by allowing the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Khan, Counsel instructed by Thompson & Co
Solicitors


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. Although the appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,
    I continue to refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania, born in 1990.  He  arrived  in
    the UK in 1998 as a dependant on a claim for asylum made by his mother.
     That asylum claim was  refused  but  the  appellant  was  nevertheless
    granted indefinite leave to remain on ("ILR") 11 November 2004.

 3. A decision was made by the respondent  on  18  April  2017  to  make  a
    deportation order against him pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016, prompted by  his  criminal  offending.
    His last conviction was on 22 December 2016 at West London Magistrates'
    Court for an offence of burglary and theft (non-dwelling), and  was  an
    offence committed whilst a community order was in force.  He received a
    sentence of 26 weeks' imprisonment, with a victim surcharge of ï¿½115.

 4. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal came before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge C. J. Woolley at a hearing on  15  June  2017
    which resulted in the FtJ allowing the appeal with reference to the EEA
    Regulations.

    The grounds of appeal and submissions

 5. The  respondent's  grounds  point  out  that  the  appellant  has  been
    convicted of offences between 7 October 2014  and  22  April  2015  for
    various offences which resulted in deportation  proceedings  which  the
    appellant appealed.  His appeal was successful after a  hearing  before
    the FtT on 23 October 2015.  However, since that hearing the  appellant
    had continued to commit offences and had been convicted on 11  November
    2016 for two offences of theft (shoplifting) for which  he  received  a
    community order, and on 22 December 2016 for  burglary  and  theft  for
    which he received  a  sentence  of  26  weeks'  imprisonment,  offences
    committed whilst a community order was in force, for which he  received
    four weeks' imprisonment concurrent.

 6. It is argued that the appeal was allowed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Rodger after the hearing in 2015 to  a  large  extent  because  of  the
    belief that the appellant had overcome the reasons for offending,  such
    that he no longer posed a risk.  Extracts from Judge Rodger's  decision
    are set out in the grounds.  However, the FtJ  in  the  instant  appeal
    concluded that the most recent offending did  not  represent  a  marked
    escalation over previous offending, but that conclusion failed to  take
    into account that the latest conviction for burglary resulted in a  26-
    week custodial sentence, and represented a  "significant  step  up"  in
    seriousness  from  the  previous  longest  sentence  of   nine   weeks'
    imprisonment.

 7. Although the FtJ  had  concluded  that  the  family  support  that  the
    appellant  received  in  the   UK   would   help   his   prospects   of
    rehabilitation, even if that was a sustainable conclusion in  2015  the
    evidence points against that conclusion now.   The  appellant  had  not
    said why he cannot live with his mother or the grandmother he  is  also
    said to be close to in the UK.  None of the family attended the hearing
    because the appellant did not tell them about his recent offending, his
    26-week sentence or the deportation proceedings,  because  he  said  it
    would depress them.  If the family were close  to  the  appellant  they
    would have noticed his absence and further, if the  appellant  hid  his
    offending from his family, how could  it  be  said  that  they  can  be
    expected to help him.  The evidence suggested that his family  have  no
    influence over his rehabilitation and that they  do  not  have  a  very
    close relationship.

 8. At [30] Judge Woolley had acknowledged that on release from prison  the
    appellant had returned to drug  abuse  despite  completion  of  a  drug
    awareness course.  However, the appellant did not undertake any courses
    during his latest stay in prison, and  thus  had  not  dealt  with  the
    causes of his offending.  This is  a  matter  not  addressed  by  Judge
    Woolley, it is argued.

 9. Furthermore, the judge was wrong to state that he  had  stayed  out  of
    trouble for a year, thus concluding that he did not have  a  propensity
    to reoffend. The appellant was detained under immigration control  from
    his earlier release date of May 2015 until at least  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

10. It is argued that the appellant had continued to show a  disregard  for
    the law by reoffending whilst a  community  order  was  in  force,  and
    whilst in prison misbehaved by downloading pornography,  as  the  judge
    had noted at [25].

11. The judge had "preserved" findings (from the previous appeal  decision)
    but those findings have been "invalidated" by  subsequent  events,  and
    the FtJ had made inadequately reasoned fresh findings.

12. In submissions on behalf of the respondent, Mr Wilding  relied  on  the
    grounds  of  appeal.   It  was  suggested  that  the  judge's  decision
    indicated a flawed structural approach to the issues to be  determined,
    judging by what he said at [19] about the order of consideration of the
    various issues.  The judge was wrong, it was submitted, to approach the
    appeal in terms of any prescribed order of the  assessment  of  issues.
    The point was illustrated with reference  to  various  aspects  of  the
    decision.  For example, it was submitted that it was wrong to  consider
    proportionality without  reference  to  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

13. It was submitted that it was not clear as to why it was concluded  that
    the appellant's conduct did not represent an  escalation  of  offending
    given the length of sentence imposed for the most recent offence  which
    was much longer than the previous sentence of nine weeks' imprisonment.
     The conclusion in this respect  appeared  to  represent  a  mitigating
    approach to the appellant's behaviour and failed to take account of the
    criminal court's view of his offending.

14. Likewise,  the  conclusions  at  [29]-[30]  about  the  risk  that  the
    appellant represented failed to take into account  the  fact  that  the
    appellant undoubtedly got into more trouble after 2015 when his  appeal
    was allowed.  Judge Rodger said at [48] that he was satisfied that  the
    appellant had successfully addressed his behaviour and drug misuse  and
    did not represent a present threat; but the appellant had re-offended.

15. Judge Woolley had concluded that the appellant's family would have been
    in a position to help him, and to assist with rehabilitation,  but  the
    family did not attend the hearing before him and on the appellant's own
    evidence he had not told them  about  his  latest  convictions.   Judge
    Woolley was not entitled to make the finding  that  he  did  therefore.
    The decision at [24] that he should continue to follow the  conclusions
    of Judge Rodger in holding that he has close  family  ties  in  the  UK
    could not be sustained.  The support his family could give was, on  the
    facts, highly questionable.  None  of  that  was  considered  by  Judge
    Woolley.  He had, in effect, simply adopted Judger Rodger's reasoning.

16. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Khan did not refer  to  the  appellant's
    'rule 24' response, but I have taken it into account. Mr Khan submitted
    that Judge Woolley was entitled to make the findings that he  did.   He
    had started with the findings of Judge Rodger.  He pointed out at  [17]
    that the respondent's decision is remarkably brief.   He  had  resolved
    the 'serious grounds' issue in favour of the appellant and cemented his
    findings with reference to his consideration of proportionality.

17. The grounds were wrong to suggest that the judge had made an  error  at
    [31] in terms of the appellant having been out of trouble for  a  year.
    He looked at the relevant period and what offences had been  committed.
    Whilst he was in prison  he  was  a  good  prisoner,  although  he  had
    downloaded pornography whilst serving his sentence.

18. It was true that minor offences could be  serious  but  the  judge  had
    resolved the issues in relation to his offending in  his  favour.   The
    respondent's criticisms are no more than a suggestion that there  could
    have been an alternative conclusion.

    Assessment

19. At the conclusion of the hearing I announced that I was satisfied  that
    Judge Woolley's decision did involve the making of an error on a  point
    of law, requiring his decision to be set aside.  I now briefly set  out
    my reasons.

20.  At  the  hearing  before  Judge  Rodger  (in  2015)  he  recorded  the
    appellant's evidence that his grandmother and aunt had  called  him  to
    say that they  could  not  attend  the  hearing.   He  found  that  the
    appellant was truthful in his evidence about having a  grandmother,  an
    aunt and cousins in the UK, as  well  as  his  mother.   The  appellant
    apparently told Judge Rodger that his family had told him that they had
    been informed by the Tribunal that the hearing was a  "closed  hearing"
    and that they could not attend or see him, and  Judge  Rodger  accepted
    the appellant's evidence about that and drew no adverse inferences from
    the fact that there were no family members at the hearing.  He  further
    concluded that the appellant  does  not  have  any  family  members  in
    Lithuania and that all  his  family  are  in  the  UK.   He  found  the
    appellant's evidence credible that his family in the UK  would  try  to
    assist him in any way that they could if he returned to Lithuania.

21. At [48] Judge Rodger said that he was not satisfied that the  appellant
    represented a present threat, that his offending was clearly linked  to
    his use of drugs, and he had appropriately addressed his drug abuse and
    was awarded a completion certificate of a drugs awareness course whilst
    detained at HMP Thameside.  The appellant did not represent a threat as
    he would no longer need to feed a drug habit, he said.   There  was  no
    mention of any ongoing risks in the Serco Release Plan.  He  said  that
    he accepted the appellant's evidence that he was rehabilitated and  was
    likely to have support from his family which would be an important part
    of his ongoing future rehabilitation.

22. He went on to say in the next paragraph that he was satisfied that  his
    close family ties and integration in UK cultural ways and society,  and
    his  work  history  in  the  UK  was  such  that   his   prospects   of
    rehabilitation were greater in the UK than in Lithuania  where  he  did
    not have family support, experience of  working  there  or  educational
    qualifications obtained there.  He concluded that future rehabilitation
    prospects in the UK were a weighty factor in the balance. He found that
    he had now addressed his behaviour and he was not satisfied that he had
    an ongoing propensity to re-offend.

23. That decision was promulgated on 9 November 2015 after a hearing on  23
    October 2015.

24. The Magistrates' Court register (in the respondent's bundle) shows  the
    following. On 11 November 2016 the appellant  was  convicted  of  theft
    from a shop, of goods to the value of ï¿½79, that offence having occurred
    on 5 November 2016 in West London.  That resulted in a community order.
     Then, on 20 December 2016 he was convicted of the burglary  for  which
    he received a sentence of 26 weeks' imprisonment.   The  value  of  the
    goods stolen was ï¿½1,000.  The appellant committed the offences  a  year
    after his appeal was allowed by Judge Rodger.

25. Judge Woolley said at [31] that the appellant had remained trouble free
    for a year since his release from his first sentence  of  imprisonment.
    In fact, as can be seen from [12] of Judge Rodger's  decision,  on  his
    release from HMP Thameside in May 2015, which was his first sentence of
    imprisonment,  the  appellant  had  been  detained  under   immigration
    control, at least up until the date of the hearing (and probably up  to
    the date of promulgation)  before  Judge  Rodger.   Judge  Woolley  was
    correct about his having been out of trouble for a year since the  date
    of Judge Rodger's decision until the most recent offending

26. In my judgement there is merit  in  the  respondent's  contention  that
    Judge Woolley's decision represented an over reliance on Judge Rodger's
    decision.  At [20] Judge Woolley said that in the appeal before him  he
    was "presented with much the same matrix  of  offending  as  was  Judge
    Rodger".  He noted the  further  offence  of  theft  (shoplifting)  and
    burglary and  said  that  the  burglary  was  more  in  the  nature  of
    opportunistic theft rather than  a  "breaking  and  entering"  type  of
    burglary.  He concluded that the two further offences were "in  essence
    low level crimes punished with relatively short  sentences".   In  that
    paragraph, and elsewhere, he referred to the fact  that  the  appellant
    had never committed an offence of violence, or a  sexual  offence,  and
    that all his offending had been of "theft-type" offences.  He noted  at
    [22]  that  the  magistrates  considered  that  it  was  within   their
    sentencing powers to deal with him for the offence of burglary.

27. However, as was pointed out to me on  behalf  of  the  respondent,  the
    appellant's previous sentence of imprisonment  had  been  one  of  nine
    weeks.  The sentence for  the  burglary  was  26  weeks'  imprisonment.
    Furthermore, the value of the goods taken was  ï¿½1,000.   The  appellant
    had never previously been convicted of burglary.  In my  judgement,  it
    was irrational to conclude that this offence of burglary,  albeit  that
    it related to non-residential premises,  did  not  represent  a  marked
    escalation in his offending.

28. Furthermore, whilst the FtJ noted that no family  member  had  attended
    the hearing before Judge Rodger, and none had attended before  him,  he
    nevertheless concluded that he should find, as Judge Rodger  did,  that
    he has close family ties in the UK and that  those  family  ties  would
    assist in  his  rehabilitation.   However,  it  is  difficult,  if  not
    impossible, to see how that conclusion can be sustained in the  absence
    of any evidence  from  his  family  in  relation  to  the  most  recent
    offences,  and  how  they  would  assist  the  appellant  in   becoming
    rehabilitated, and in circumstances where their efforts, whatever  they
    were, had not been successful after the appeal  was  allowed  by  Judge
    Rodger.  Furthermore, the fact of the matter is the appellant  had  not
    disclosed his most recent offending or his incarceration to his family.
     In those circumstances, there is little if anything to  support  Judge
    Woolley's conclusion that his family would be able  to  assist  in  his
    rehabilitation.

29. In addition, I consider that it was irrational of the FtJ  to  conclude
    that the appellant does not have a propensity to re-offend and that  he
    does not represent "an unacceptably high risk  of  re-offending".   The
    appellant has been convicted of  a  number  of  offences,  starting  in
    October  2014.   His  appeal  was  allowed  by  Judge  Rodger  who  was
    optimistic as to the appellant's prospects of  not  re-offending.   The
    appellant re-offended within about a year of his successful appeal, and
    committed a more serious offence (burglary) than he  had  committed  in
    the past.  The evidence did not support Judge Woolley's conclusion that
    the appellant would have the support of his family, who are unaware  of
    his most recent offending.  Thus, the conclusion that the appellant did
    not represent a risk of re-offending was flawed.

30. In the light of the matters I have set out above, I am  satisfied  that
    Judge Woolley's decision must be set aside for error of law.   However,
    certain findings of fact can be preserved and in  those  circumstances,
    and given the limited extent of the  further  fact  finding  necessary,
    this is a matter which ought to be retained in the Upper  Tribunal  for
    the re-making of the decision.

31. Accordingly, there will be a further hearing in the Upper Tribunal  and
    in respect of which  the  parties  must  have  careful  regard  to  the
    directions set out below.

                                 DIRECTIONS

 1. In relation to any further evidence relied on by  either  party,  there
    must be a paginated and indexed bundle of documents, filed  and  served
    no later than seven days before the next hearing.

 2. In relation to any person  whom  is  proposed  to  call  to  give  oral
    evidence on behalf of the appellant, there must be a witness  statement
    drawn in sufficient detail to stand  as  evidence-in-chief,  such  that
    there is no need for any further  examination-in-chief.   That  witness
    statement must be filed and served no later than seven days before  the
    next hearing.

 3. At the next  hearing  the  parties  must  be  in  a  position  to  make
    submissions as to what findings of fact made by Judge  Woolley  can  be
    preserved.
