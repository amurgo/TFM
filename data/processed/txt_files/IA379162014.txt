Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Saini, counsel
For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference, I maintain the descriptions of  the  parties  as
    they were in the First-tier Tribunal; thus the Secretary  of  State  is
    described as the respondent.

Background

 2. The appellant was served with notice  of  liability  to  detention  and
    removal. He made a human rights claim  and  this  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on  10  September  2014  who  also  decided  to  remove  the
    appellant.

 3. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal  was  heard
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg (the FTTJ) on  21  October  2015.  She
    allowed his appeal in a decision promulgated on 6 November 2015.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal on the ground that the  FTTJ
    had made a material misdirection in law and had failed to give adequate
    reasons. Permission was granted in the following terms:

           "... It is arguable that where the  parties  were  in  agreement
           that the new Immigration  Rules  applied  in  this  matter  (see
           [19]), the First-tier Tribunal did not apply them  correctly  as
           regards the earnings of the applicant's spouse at  the  date  of
           application rather than at the date of hearing and also took  an
           incorrect approach to  the  applicant's  relationship  with  his
           biological British child with whom he has no direct access."

 5. Thus the appeal came before me.

Submissions

 6. Mr Saini, for the appellant, accepted that it had been appropriate  for
    the FTTJ to decide the appeal in accordance with the Immigration Rules,
    insofar as Article 8 was concerned.

 7. For the respondent, Mr  Avery  submitted  that  the  FTTJ  should  have
    considered the  financial  evidence  with  regard  to  the  appellant's
    position at the  date  of  application.   The  evidence  was  that  the
    appellant's wife could not meet the requirements at the time.  The FTTJ
    should have made that finding and  moved  on  to  address  EX.1.   With
    regard to the appellant's contact with his British child,  he  did  not
    have face-to-face contact with that child. He  accepted  there  was  no
    reference in the Rules to any requirement for "direct access"  but  the
    evidence did not support a finding  that  the  appellant  was  actively
    involved in his son's upbringing.

 8. Mr Saini submitted that the principal focus of the reasons for  refusal
    was  the  respondent's  contention  that  there  was  no  genuine   and
    subsisting relationship between the parties.  There was no challenge by
    the respondent to the FTTJ's  positive  finding  in  that  regard.  The
    respondent had raised no concerns in the  reasons  for  refusal  letter
    with regard to the ability of the appellant  to  fulfil  the  financial
    requirements in the Rules. The  FTTJ  had  taken  it  upon  herself  to
    consider those requirements and it was not clear why she  had  done  so
    because it had not been raised as an issue at  the  appeal.  Any  error
    with regard to that assessment was immaterial  because  it  was  not  a
    matter of concern to the refusal author.

 9. With regard to the appellant's relationship with his child, the  phrase
    "direct contact" did not exist in the Rules; nor was  it  used  in  the
    reasons for refusal.  The appellant had access rights as  evidenced  by
    the order of Dartford County court. Oral evidence  had  been  given  as
    regards the appellant's involvement with his child's  upbringing.  This
    had not, it was accepted, been the main focus of the appeal, which  was
    the nature of  the  couple's  relationship.  Nonetheless  it  had  been
    addressed in evidence-in-chief. This was not  a  perversity  challenge,
    but a reasons challenge. It was merely a disagreement with the outcome.

10. In reply, Mr Avery accepted there was no requirement in the Immigration
    Rules for the appellant to have direct access/contact with his  British
    child. He submitted that "context is  the  key  thing".   It  was  also
    accepted that there was no challenge to the  FTTJ's  finding  that  the
    appellant takes an active role in the  child's  upbringing.   Mr  Avery
    submitted that the issue of access should be considered in the  context
    in  which  paragraph  ELTR-PT  was  set,  i.e.  to  reflect  Article  8
    considerations. He submitted this was an unusual set of  circumstances;
    the appellant was not required to remain in the UK to  continue  access
    to his child, as ordered by the court.  There was no immediate prospect
    that order would change. This was a removal case; the  appellant  could
    apply for entry clearance from abroad.

11. Both Mr Avery and Mr Saini agreed that if I found there was no material
    error of law  in  relation  to  the  FTTJ's  findings  as  regards  the
    appellant's status as a parent, any error in relation to  her  findings
    with regard to his status as a parent would be immaterial.

Discussion

12. The respondent notes in the refusal letter that the appellant  met  the
    suitability requirements for consideration of limited leave  to  remain
    in the UK as a partner or parent [10].   It  was  considered  that  the
    appellant did not meet the  eligibility  requirements  because  he  had
    failed to provide evidence that his relationship with the  sponsor  was
    genuine and subsisting; he did not therefore meet the  criteria  in  E-
    LTRP.1.7.  The respondent  then  turned,  in  the  refusal  letter,  to
    considering whether the appellant met the criteria in Appendix FM as  a
    parent and found that he did not do so either in relation  to  his  own
    child or his wife's children.  The respondent then  considered  whether
    the appellant qualified under EX.1 and decided that  he  did  not.  The
    application was refused under  D-LTRP.1.1-1.2  and  D-LTRPT.1.1-1.2  of
    Appendix FM.  There is no reference in the letter to a  decision  being
    taken by reference to the financial  requirements  in  the  Immigration
    Rules.

13. The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  identify
    and address the three reasons for the refusal, as I have set  them  out
    above. Paragraph 8 of the decision refers.  Mr Saini's submissions  for
    the appellant (which are recorded at length at paragraphs 7-28  of  the
    decision) focussed on those issues which had been raised in the reasons
    for refusal. To state the obvious, this did not therefore  include  the
    appellant's ability to  meet  the  financial  requirements.   There  is
    reference in his submissions to the production, by the appellant to the
    respondent,  of  his  wife's  wage  slips,  rent  statements  and  bank
    statements, but this is in the context  of  demonstrating  they  had  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.  There is reference to Mr  Saini's
    submission that the existence of such  documentary  evidence  supported
    the appellant's claim that he had been supported by his wife so that he
    did not have to work illegally, until he had  regularised  his  status.
    There was no reference  at  all  in  the  appellant's  submissions  (as
    recorded by the FTTJ) to demonstrating the appellant was able  to  meet
    the financial  requirements,  presumably  because  there  had  been  no
    challenge to this in the reasons for refusal.

14. Nor is there any suggestion  in  the  decision  that  the  respondent's
    representative had identified as a new issue the appellant's  inability
    to meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules.  There  is  a  brief
    reference (paragraph 9) to the appellant stating that he  is  supported
    financially  by  his  wife.   The  appellant's  evidence  under  cross-
    examination is noted as being that his wife  has  two  jobs,  he  looks
    after the children while she provides food and other necessities to the
    family; she pays for everything with her bank card. This  evidence  has
    the  appearance  of  being  given  in  the  context  of   the   claimed
    relationship.

15. The FTTJ asked the appellant some questions and his evidence  is  noted
    at paragraph 11.  No questions were asked relating to  his  ability  to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

16. The appellant's wife gave oral evidence about her employment since 2008
    and currently. According  to  the  decision,  she  did  not  give  oral
    evidence about how much she earned. She said she had two  jobs  at  the
    date of hearing and supported her husband financially. She had her  own
    bank account, allowing the appellant to use her bank card  to  pay  for
    items.  There is no suggestion that she gave this evidence  other  than
    in order to demonstrate a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.  For
    example, she said the appellant was "not  using  her  to  stay  in  the
    country".   The FTTJ does not refer to asking questions of this witness
    about her income from employment.

17. The FTTJ finds that the appellant and  his  wife  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage. She also finds that the parties intended  to  live
    together as husband and wife.  These findings are not challenged by the
    respondent.

18. The FTTJ then goes on to say (paragraph 22):

         "The respondent did not consider whether the appellant and  sponsor
         meet [sic] the financial requirements under the Immigration  Rules.
         [The appellant's wife]'s P60 with Tesco's Stores Ltd  for  the  tax
         year 5 April 2015 shows that her total  earnings  were  �18,851.50.
         The appellant's bundles contain her payslips for 2014. Her P60  for
         the tax year 5 April 2014 relating to  Bespoke  Hotels  Goldie  Ltd
         shows  earnings  of  �13,367.22.   I  find  on   the   balance   of
         probabilities that [the appellant]'s  wife's  earnings  were  above
         �18,600 as required under the Immigration Rules."

19. It is not clear why the FTTJ made findings on this issue  when  it  was
    not one which had been raised in the reasons for refusal letter or  the
    respondent's submissions.  Not  surprisingly,  the  appellant  had  not
    addressed it in the grounds  of  appeal.  Nor  did  his  representative
    address it in his oral submissions at the hearing.

20. The respondent submits that the FTTJ's findings amount to an  error  of
    law because she should have considered the appellant's wife's  earnings
    at the date of application, either the first application in 2012 or the
    second application in 2014.

21. Given the complete absence of any reference to the appellant's  ability
    or otherwise to comply with the financial requirements  of  the  Rules,
    either in the reasons for refusal or at the hearing  itself,  it  would
    have been procedurally unfair for the FTTJ to make an  adverse  finding
    in the absence of giving the appellant the opportunity to  address  her
    on the issue.  I am unable to find  therefore  that  the  FTTJ  made  a
    material error of law in her consideration of the  appellant's  ability
    to meet the financial requirements of the Rules. Even if she has failed
    to assess the evidence in accordance with  the  Immigration  Rules,  to
    have made an adverse finding  on  the  issue  would  have  amounted  to
    procedural unfairness in the absence of notice and any opportunity  for
    the appellant to address her on the issue.

22. For this reason  I  do  not  accept  that  the  FTTJ  made  a  material
    misdirection in law in her findings  with  regard  to  the  appellant's
    wife's earnings.

23. It follows from the above that the FTTJ's findings with regard  to  the
    appellant's ability to fulfil the criteria in Appendix FM as  a  parent
    must stand. As agreed by the parties' representatives before me, such a
    finding means that any error of law in relation to the FTTJ's  findings
    on the appellant's  relationship  with  his  son  are  immaterial:  the
    appellant  qualifies  for  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis   of   his
    relationship with his wife, irrespective of his relationship  with  his
    son.

24. I find there is no material error of law in the FTTJ's decision.

25. Given my references to the appellant's relationship with his  wife  and
    son, he is entitled to an anonymity order and I make one accordingly.

Decision

26. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

27. I do not set aside the decision.
