                                  DECISION

INTRODUCTION

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer of Delhi,  India  (hereinafter  the  "ECO")
    appeals, with permission, against the determination of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (the "FtT").  The family unit involved in this appeal consists
    of father (the sponsor), mother, son (aged 19 years) and daughter (aged
    17 years).  All family members are nationals of Tibet. The  father  has
    been present in the United Kingdom since 2005 and was granted so-called
    "legacy" indefinite leave to remain in 2010.  The  other  three  family
    members fled  Tibet  in  February  2011  and  have  resided  in  India,
    undocumented and without authorisation, ever since.

 2. By three linked decisions dated 25  July  2013,  the  ECO  refused  the
    applications of the mother and the two  children  (the  Respondents  to
    this appeal) for entry clearance under Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules. In the case of the mother, the ECO pronounced five  reasons  for
    the  refusal:   the  absence  of  a   "free   from   active   pulmonary
    tuberculosis" [TB] certificate; an assessment that there is no  genuine
    and subsisting relationship between the mother and the sponsor and that
    they did not intend to live together permanently in the United Kingdom,
    based mainly on the absence of a marriage  certificate;  a  failure  to
    satisfy the  minimum  income  requirement;  the  non-possession  of  an
    English language competence certificate; and the  absence  of  a  valid
    travel document. The two reasons for refusal provided in the  cases  of
    the  two  children  were  non-compliance  with   the   minimum   income
    requirement and the lack of a valid travel document.

 3. The Respondents appealed, successfully, to  the   FtT.   Their  appeals
    were allowed under Article 8 ECHR.  In allowing the  appeals,  the  FtT
    identified the central issue as that of proportionality  and  expressed
    its conclusion in the following terms, in [31]:

         "Having  considered  this  case  carefully,   I   find   that   the
         circumstances taken together have the cumulative effect of making a
         decision to refuse  entry  clearance  disproportionate  ...........
         because of the very difficult situation that  the  Appellants  face
         collectively.   Separation  of  this  family  has  already   caused
         significant hardship.  The first Appellant is  separated  from  the
         second and third Appellants and they are  all  separated  from  the
         sponsor who has been recovering from significant  injuries  without
         the assistance of his family.  In light of the fact that the  first
         Appellant has no settled status  in  India  and  is  illiterate,  I
         accept that her situation is exceptional.  There  is  no  realistic
         chance that she will meet the English language  requirements  which
         are too onerous for someone in  her  situation.  I  make  the  same
         finding for different reasons in relation to the sponsor's  ability
         to reach the financial threshold.  In my view the need  for  family
         reunification in the circumstances of this case places  the  United
         Kingdom in breach of her obligations under Article 8  of  the  ECHR
         because of the serious and compelling circumstances  which  I  have
         set out in detail above."

    While the  appeals  were  allowed  under  Article  8  ECHR,  they  were
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.  There is no cross appeal by the
    Respondents against the latter aspect of the FtT's decision.

 4.  The Secretary of State's grounds of appeal raise four issues. I  shall
    address these seriatim.  First, it is contended that an  error  of  law
    was  committed  by  reason  of  the  FtT's  failure  to  consider   the
    possibility that the sponsor could relocate to India where family  life
    could be re-established.  True it is that there is no  express  mention
    of this issue in the determination.  However, I am satisfied that  this
    does not constitute an error of law. It has at all  times  been  common
    case that the Respondents have no formal status in the alien country in
    which they have been residing during recent years and their description
    as "stateless" is uncontested.  It is also undisputed that the sponsor,
    a national of Tibet, has no legal entitlement to reside  in  India  and
    there was no evidence whatsoever about either his prospects of securing
    entry authorisation  or  the  prospects  of  all  four  family  members
    remaining together there thereafter.  Furthermore, there  was  explicit
    written evidence before the FtT about  the  very  difficult  conditions
    endured by refugees and stateless persons in  India.  I  consider  that
    this ground of appeal has no merit accordingly.

 5. The second ground of appeal contends that the impugned decisions of the
    ECO do not entail an interference with the right to respect for  family
    life enjoyed by  the  four  persons  concerned  given  their  de  facto
    separation during the past nine years.  The reason given by  the  Judge
    for finding  an  interference  is  that  the  impugned  decisions  have
    "prevented reunification of the family as a unit": see [28].   This  is
    an  entirely  valid  reason,  consonant  with  the   Article   8   ECHR
    jurisprudence.   The  second  ground  of  appeal  has   no   merit   in
    consequence.

 6. The third ground of appeal focuses on the  Judge's  assessment  of  the
    sponsor's capacity to work and his  ability  to  satisfy  the  relevant
    financial requirements or to qualify for one  of  the  exceptions.  The
    Judge stated, in [30]:

         "I have gone  on  to  consider  the  financial  circumstances.  The
         Respondent chose not to do a thorough examination of the  sponsor's
         finances.  However, the sponsor .... is unable to work  because  of
         injuries sustained in a road traffic accident ...


         There was a significant body of evidence setting out the effects of
         the road traffic accident ...  the  sponsor  was  referred  to  the
         brain  injury  rehabilitation  service  in  September  2011.    The
         solicitors acting for him have recovered ï¿½30,000  in  compensation.
         The sponsor continues to suffer memory loss  and  headaches.   This
         brings the sponsor within one of the exceptions  to  the  financial
         requirements as he has sustained a serious  injury  during  a  road
         traffic accident, which has affected his ability to work.  In  this
         case the burden on the State will be reduced  because  there  is  a
         financial cushion in place which will mean that the family are  not
         wholly dependent on the state."

    I have highlighted the  key  passage  which,  duly  analysed,  has  two
    elements.  I would further highlight an earlier statement in  the  same
    paragraph that the sponsor:


         "..... is unable to work because of injuries sustained in  a  road
    traffic accident."

    It was argued on behalf of the ECO that the Judge, in  these  passages,
    has committed the error of making an  unsustainable  finding  that  the
    sponsor is permanently unable to  work  and  failing  to  measure  such
    incapacity.  I consider this contention to have  no  substance.  Having
    examined the medical evidence, I am satisfied that the  Judge  made  no
    error in the assessment that the sponsor's injuries, which were on  any
    showing serious, rendered him incapable of working.  However, the Judge
    has stated nowhere that this incapacity will endure permanently.  This,
    in my view, is clear when the paragraph is considered as  a  whole,  in
    conjunction with the medical evidence and  particularly  in  the  words
    "has affected his ability to work".  Accordingly, I find  no  error  of
    law in the respect advanced.

 7. The second criticism of the Judge's treatment of  this  discrete  issue
    was that the sponsor  qualified  for  one  of  the  exemptions  to  the
    financial requirements  specified  in  the  Immigration  Rules.  It  is
    probable that,  in  this  discrete  respect,  the  Judge  had  in  mind
    paragraph E-ECP3.3 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules which,  read
    in  conjunction  with  paragraph  E-ECP2.10(c),  contains  a  list   of
    exemptions to the need to satisfy the specified financial requirements.
     These exemptions arise where the sponsor is in receipt of, inter alia,
    disability living allowance.  The complaint about this  aspect  of  the
    FtT's determination is that there is no evidence that the  sponsor  has
    been in receipt of this benefit at any time. The riposte on  behalf  of
    the Respondents is that the sponsor does not qualify for  this  benefit
    on account of the capital available to him from his compensation.

 8. The net result is that the Judge did indeed err in law on this discrete
    issue. I shall consider this issue further infra.

 9. The fourth, and final, ground of appeal contends that the FtT erred  in
    law  in  its  treatment  of  the  ability  of  the  mother  (the  first
    Respondent)  to  satisfy  the  English  language  requirement  and  the
    assessment that she qualified for an exemption.  Paragraph E-ECP4.2  of
    Appendix Rule provides in material part:

         "The applicant is exempt from the English language  requirement  if
         at the date of application .............


         (c)   there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which   prevent   the
             applicant from being able to meet  the  requirement  prior  to
             entry to the UK."

    The Judge, having received evidence from the sponsor that his wife  was
    never educated and is illiterate, made the following findings in [30]:


         "The first Appellant will not be able to meet the English  language
         requirements. She is illiterate and has no  status  in  India.  She
         survives  by  working  for  her  keep  .......   I  consider  [her]
         situation to be on all fours with that of a refugee or of  an  IDP.
         In my view her circumstances are exceptional."

    In the same passage the Judge  rehearsed,  correctly,  the  exceptional
    circumstances dispensation in the Rules.

10.  The argument advanced on behalf of the ECO is that the Judge  erred  in
    law by virtue of the decision in R (Chapti) - v -  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2011] EWHC  3370  (Admin).   I  am  unable  to
    accept this argument.  In Chapti the Applicants challenged the  amended
    paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules on the  ground  that  the  newly
    introduced English language competence requirement which it  enshrined,
    as amended,  was  incompatible  with  Articles  8  and  12  ECHR.   The
    challenge  was  dismissed  by  the  Administrative  Court.   The  ECO's
    argument rested on [111] of the judgment, where Beatson J stated:


         "An applicant who is illiterate or semi-literate is clearly  likely
         to need more time to achieve the required standard. If  he  or  she
         cannot do so, the question will be  whether  he  or  she  qualifies
         under the 'exceptional compassionate circumstances exception'.   If
         the Defendant does not show flexibility in such cases, she may find
         that an individual decision requiring such a  person  to  take  the
         test is, on the particular facts, incompatible with the  Article  8
         rights of that person or his or her spouse."

    This assessment is repeated in  the  Judge's  omnibus  conclusions,  in
    [148](d).  In [114] the Judge added:


         "It is neither possible nor necessary for  an  exception  based  on
         exceptional compassionate circumstances to seek to predict and  set
         out  with  any   precision  when  it  might  apply,   because   the
         circumstances of individual  cases  vary  widely  and  a  range  of
         circumstances may need to be considered together."

    I refer also to [115].  I am satisfied that there  is  nothing  in  the
    decision in Chapti which warrants the assessment that the FtT fell into
    error in finding that the first Respondent will be  unable  to  satisfy
    the English language competence requirement of the Rules and  qualifies
    for the "exceptional circumstances" dispensation in consequence.  There
    was sufficient evidence  to  rationally  justify  this  assessment  and
    conclusion and it was not based on any material error of  fact  or  the
    intrusion of any improper consideration or any misconstruction  of  the
    Rule. I dismiss this ground of appeal accordingly.

10. The remaining issue which requires  to  be  addressed  is  whether  the
    single error which I have found in the decision  of  the  FtT,  in  [8]
    above, is  material.  This  error  was  made  in  the  context  of  the
    Tribunal's identification of a series of factors  which,  cumulatively,
    gave rise to the conclusion that the  impugned  decisions  of  the  ECO
    constituted a disproportionate interference with the Article  8  family
    life rights of  all  four  persons  concerned.   I  have  reviewed  the
    documentary  evidence  presented  to  the  Judge,  in  the  form  of  a
    considerable bundle, together with those aspects of the evidence  which
    are highlighted in the  determination.   I  have  also  considered  the
    series of unimpeachable findings made by the Judge.  These relate to  a
    substantial number of factors giving  rise  to  her  disproportionality
    conclusion:  the  subsisting  nature  of  the  marriage;  the  enduring
    relationship between sponsor and first Respondent;  the  separation  of
    the children (the second and third Respondents) from their mother  (the
    first Respondent) to further their education; the mother's inability to
    provide for the children; the separation of the children from  both  of
    their parents; the stateless  status  of  the  three  Respondents;  the
    mother's illiteracy; her survival by working for her keep; the  analogy
    with that of a refugee or an IDP; the good education in  English  which
    the children have received during the past  two  years;  the  sponsor's
    financial  resources;  his  injuries  and  consequent  disability;  his
    separation from his family when recovering  from  serious  injury;  the
    availability of the TB certificates; and, finally,  the  pressing  need
    for family reunification.  In  my  judgment,  considering  the  written
    evidence and the  determination  as  a  whole,  the  Judge's  erroneous
    statement that the sponsor qualified for one of the exceptions  to  the
    financial requirements prescribed  by  the  Immigration  Rules  is  not
    material.  The equation impelling the Judge to  make  a  conclusion  of
    disproportionality contained a  large  number  of  facts  and  factors.
    Furthermore, this factor  did  not  feature  vin  the  Judge's  omnibus
    assessment in [30]. Following a careful review, I am satisfied that  if
    the error in question had been avoided the outcome would have  been  no
    different.  The Judge, in my view, would have found a  disproportionate
    interference with the Convention right engaged in any event. Thus  this
    error is not material..

ORDER

11. For the reasons elaborated above, I conclude that  three  of  the  four
    grounds of  appeal  have  no  substance,  while  the  remaining  ground
    demonstrates an error which I consider to be immaterial. Thus I dismiss
    the appeal and affirm the decision of the FtT.
