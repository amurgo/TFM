Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss N Manyarara, instructed by Jein Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss L Ong, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of India born 22 February 1982.  She arrived
    in the United Kingdom in October 2010 as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant with leave which was subsequently extended until 17 June  2012.
    On 3 April 2012 she applied for further leave to remain, this time as a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant.

 2. On 11 October 2012 the respondent refused this application pursuant  to
    paragraphs 245FD(c) and (d) of the Immigration Rules, with reference to
    Appendix A and Appendix B of those  Rules.   It  was  also  decided  to
    remove the appellant from the United Kingdom pursuant to Section 47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. Under the heading Appendix A in her decision letter of 11 October  2012
    the  Secretary  of  State  awarded  the   appellant   20   points   for
    'qualifications', 20 points for 'institution of study', and  20  points
    for 'immigration status in the United  Kingdom  during  the  period  of
    study'; but awarded her zero of the 15 points sought under the  heading
    'date of obtaining the eligible award...was within twelve months of the
    application.'

 4.  In coming to this conclusion the Secretary of State found as follows:

         "You made your application under Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)  on  3
         April 2012.  However from the evidence provided from the University
         of Wales, the date of award of your eligible  qualification  is  27
         June 2012.

         As the Immigration Rules state that  the  date  of  award  must  be
         within twelve months directly - prior to the  date  of  application
         and your date of award is after this date, in line with Appendix  A
         of the Immigration Rules, we have been unable to award points."

 5. The Secretary of State also awarded the  appellant  zero  points  under
    Appendix B of  the  Rules,  the  English  language  requirement.  This,
    however, was entirely on the basis that the  appellant  had  failed  to
    meet the requirements of Appendix A of the Rules.

 6. The appellant appealed the Secretary of State's decisions to the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott
    on 29 November 2012.

 7.  In  a  determination  of  26  December  2012  the  judge  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal against the decision to remove the  appellant,  this
    being as a consequence  of  the  decision  in  Adamally  (S.47  removal
    decision: Tribunal Procedures) [2012] UKUT 00414.  This finding has not
    been challenged before the Upper Tribunal.

 8. However, the judge dismissed the appeal brought against the decision of
    the Secretary of State to refuse to vary the appellant's leave i.e. the
    decision made pursuant to paragraph 245FD  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The judge came to such conclusion on the basis that  the  date  of  the
    appellant's application was to be treated as being  the  3  April  2012
    i.e. the date on which the appellant first sent her application form to
    the Secretary of State.  The judge concluded that, given that the award
    of the relevant qualification had been made in 27 June 2012,  it  could
    not be said that such award had been  made  within  the  twelve  months
    prior to 3 April 2012.

 9. The appellant appeals to the Upper  Tribunal  with  the  permission  of
    Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt, granted  on  20  February  2013.   Thus  the
    appeal came before me.

10. On 28 January 2013 the Upper Tribunal (comprising of the President  and
    Upper Tribunal Judge Coker) reported the decision in Khatel and  Others
    (s85A; effect of continuing application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044   In  its
    decision the Tribunal concluded as follows [taken from the headnote]:


        "(1)  An application for further leave to remain is to  be  treated
        as a continuing application, starting with the  date  when  it  was
        first submitted and ending on the  date  when  it  is  decided:  AQ
        (Pakistan) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 833.


        (2)  It follows that an appellant is not precluded by section 85(5)
        of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  (as  amended)
        from relying in an appeal upon evidence that was  notified  to  the
        Secretary of State before the date of her decision.


        (3)  Where, in an  application  for  leave  as  a  Post-Study  Work
        Migrant, the obtaining of the academic award  needed  to  gain  the
        requisite points is notified to the Secretary of  State  after  the
        date when the application was first submitted but before a decision
        is made on the application, the requirement of Table 10,  that  the
        qualification  is  obtained  within  12  months   of   making   the
        application, is satisfied because the application is  a  continuing
        one until a decision upon it has been made."

11. At the outset of  the  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  Miss  Ong
    requested an adjournment on the basis that the Secretary of  State  had
    been granted permission to  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the
    decision of Khatel.

12. Having carefully considered the provisions of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and in particular rule 2 of those Rules,  I
    concluded it was not appropriate to adjourn the hearing  to  await  the
    outcome of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Khatel.  The decision
    in Khatel is a reported decision and not a  starred  decision.   It  is
    therefore  only  persuasive  authority  to  be  considered   by   other
    constitutions of the Upper Tribunal including  this  one.   It  is  not
    binding on other constitutions of the Upper Tribunal.  Consequently, it
    is open to the Secretary  of  State  to  produce  evidence  or  provide
    submissions to the effect that the decision in  Khatel  should  not  be
    followed.  If such submissions were made if would be for me to consider
    them and come to a conclusion on the issue at hand. I was not  provided
    with any information as to when the appeal in Khatel is  likely  to  be
    heard by the Court of Appeal, or as to when they  are  likely  to  make
    their  decision.   Further,  the  I  note  that  appellant   made   the
    application for an extension of her leave over 12 months ago.  She  has
    effectively had to put her life on hold for this period of time.

13. In all of the circumstances  I  considered  that  it  would  not  serve
    justice to adjourn the hearing of this appeal and that  the  overriding
    objective set out in the 2008 Rules is  better  served  by  the  appeal
    proceeding.

14. I have detailed above the reasons given by the Secretary of State,  and
    the First-tier Tribunal, for not awarding the appellant 15  points  for
    the date of the award of  her  qualification  from  the  University  of
    Wales.  In her refusal letter the Secretary of State accepts  that  the
    appellant was awarded a relevant qualification on 27 June 2012.

15. In support of her contention that both the Secretary of State  and  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  were  correct  in  its  approach  Ms  Ong  simply
    submitted that Khatel was wrong and that  it  was  persuasive  and  not
    binding authority, and in the alternative that it should not be applied
    retrospectively.  She did not provide any reasons as to  why  this  was
    said to be so and did not provide a copy of either the grounds, or  the
    grant of permission, in Khatel.   In  the  absence  of  any  meaningful
    submissions supporting the contention that Khatel was wrongly  decided,
    and given the detailed and clear reasoning of  the  President  in  that
    case, I am minded to follow it and apply its principles to the  appeal
    before me. It is not a question, in this case, of applying the approach
    set out in Khatel retrospectively, but rather applying the  law  as  it
    always should have been applied; the decision in Khatel doing  no  more
    than setting out what the correct approach in law should be,  and  what
    it should always have been.

16. Consequently I must set  aside  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the judge therein misdirecting himself as to the date  to  be
    treated as the date of the appellant's application.

17. Upon re-making the decision I allow  the  appellant's  appeal  for  the
    following reasons.

18. The appellant is  required  to  demonstrate  that  she  was  awarded  a
    relevant qualification within the twelve months  immediately  prior  to
    the date of her application.  The Secretary of State submits  that  the
    relevant date is the date on which the appellant  originally  sent  her
    application form to the Secretary of State i.e. 3 April 2012.  However,
    applying  the  decision  in  Khatel,  I  must  treat  the   appellant's
    application as continuing until such time as it had been considered  by
    the Secretary of State i.e. 11 October 2012.

19. It is plain, therefore, that the  relevant  qualification  having  been
    awarded by the University of Wales on 27 June 2012, that such award was
    made within the twelve month period directly prior to the  date  to  be
    treated as the date of application i.e. 11 October 2012.  The appellant
    is therefore entitled to 15 points  for  'the  date  of  obtaining  the
    eligible award'.  She is consequently entitled to 75 points pursuant to
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and 10 points pursuant to  Appendix
    B of the Immigration Rules.

20.  The  appellant  clearly  therefore  satisfies  the  entirety  of   the
    requirements of paragraph 245FD of the Rules. Consequently  her  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse to vary  her  leave
    is accordingly allowed on the basis  that  such  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules.

21. The appellant's appeal against the decision to remove her also falls to
    be allowed following the rationale of the decision of this Tribunal  in
    Adamally and  Another  (S.47  removal  decision:  Tribunal  Procedures)
    [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC).

Decision

For the reasons  given  above,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
involved the making of an error on a point of law and is set aside.

Upon remaking the decision on appeal I allow the appellant's appeal  against
the Secretary of State's decision to refuse to vary her leave on  the  basis
that such decision  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules.
I further allow the appellant's appeal against the decision to  remove  her
on the basis that such decision was not in accordance with the law.

Fees Award

Having allowed the appellant's appeal on all grounds, and having taken  into
account all the circumstances of this case, I direct that the  fee  of  �140
paid by the appellant to lodge of her appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  be
repaid to her.
