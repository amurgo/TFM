Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Eaton (for Duncan Lewis Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha (Specialist Appeals Team)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Haider [H], a citizen  of  Afghanistan  born  1
       January  1989,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing his appeal of 1 March 2019,  itself  brought  against  the
       Secretary of State's decision (of 3 April 2018) to refuse his  asylum
       application.

    2. The Appellant originally entered the UK  on  1  April  2008,  claimed
       asylum, based on his difficulties due to his activities with  Hezb-e-
       Islami,  his  appeal  being  dismissed.  Judge  Mace   rejected   the
       Appellant's account of six months of personal involvement with Hezb-e-
       Islami, but accepted that it was possible that the Appellant's father
       was involved  with  Hezb-e-Islami  and  may  even  have  been  killed
       fighting for them. Nevertheless, the Appellant had not established he
       was not at risk of persecution, having regard  to  the  lack  of  any
       evidence of difficulties with the authorities and the finding  in  PM
       Afghanistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00089  that  there  was  no  satisfactory
       evidence that a person who has been associated in the past with Hizb-
       i-Islami will always be regarded as such.

    3. Once his appeal rights were exhausted, the Appellant was  removed  to
       Afghanistan on 19 February 2013. He returned to  Europe  and  claimed
       asylum in Sweden on 6 November 2015; Sweden returned him to the UK on
       10 May 2016, where he lodged further submissions on arrival.

    4. His claim on his return to the UK as summarised in the refusal letter
       is that he was kidnapped and interrogated by the Taliban  because  of
       his westernised mannerisms, and  accused  of  being  a  spy.  He  was
       detained for four nights. He  was  then  released  with  the  village
       elders acting as his guarantors, as a result of which he  was  unable
       to leave the village. In 2015 he was taken by from the mosque by  the
       Taliban and required to fight against ISIS. He was allowed to  return
       home after the fighting, but the Taliban returned to require  him  to
       fight again. His brother told the Taliban that he was  not  at  home,
       and reported back to the Appellant that they required him  to  be  at
       home the next day. His brother subsequently told the Taliban that the
       Appellant would not fight for them again, and was beaten by them. The
       Appellant decided to take revenge, following them to a  stream  where
       he shot one of them in the shoulder with an AK47 gun.  The  Appellant
       then fled to Tawai on foot, remaining there  for  three  days  before
       travelling to Saroubi, where he met with an agent who took him on  to
       Sweden.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept the  Appellant's  evidence  as
       credible, because

        a) It was implausible that he would be viewed as westernised if  he
           had previously helped his father with  Hezb-e-Islami  (and  thus
           anti-government) activities such as distributing  leaflets,  and
           had lived in a house where ammunition was  stored,  and  in  any
           event any such suspicions must have been very short-lived  given
           that he was quickly persuaded to fight on the Taliban's behalf;

        b) There was a discrepancy between the Appellant's evidence and the
           summary of his case apparently provided to the  psychiatrist  by
           his representative, and between the witness  statement  and  the
           account he gave to the psychiatrist as to the  circumstances  in
           which he came to the Taliban's attention prior to his  detention
           by them;

        c) It was implausible that  he  would  take  up  arms  against  the
           Taliban themselves having refused to accept the dangers involved
           in fighting the police;

        d)  His  account  had  "no  factual  support"  and  his  record  on
           credibility was not good.

    6. Accordingly the Tribunal concluded  that  the  Appellant  had  either
       fabricated his claim in its entirety, or exaggerated the real events.



    7. The First-tier Tribunal noted that AS  Afghanistan  established  that
       Kabul was generally safe for a healthy young  adult,  which  was  the
       Appellant's situation subject to the psychiatric report.  There  were
       factual  issues  regarding  that  report  as  addressed  above.   The
       Appellant had raised no psychiatric issues when he came to the UK  in
       2008 and whatever  he  had  suffered  in  2007  did  not  necessitate
       psychiatric treatment thereafter. His depression could be due to  his
       unsettled immigration status. There was no "reliable  evidence"  that
       he suffered from PTSD; he had presented himself to  the  psychiatrist
       with a view to "bolster his claim and to persuade, successfully, that
       his symptoms show that he suffers from PTSD and depression".

    8. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law because it had  overlooked  material  evidence  relevant  to  the
       Appellant's credibility:

        a) Credibility findings had been made in a vacuum without regard to
           the evidence of Dr Burman-Roy (the psychiatrist) and Tim  Foxley
           (the country expert) without regard  to  the  former's  evidence
           that the Appellant's mental capacity was such that  his  ability
           "to give an account of his experiences is  likely  to  fluctuate
           depending on his circumstances and mental state";

        b) The  evidence  from  Mr  Foxley  regarding  the  use  of  forced
           recruitment by the Taliban, risks  due  to  being  perceived  as
           westernised,  intervention  of  elders  and  the  prevalence  of
           weaponry  in  Afghanistan,  all  relevant  to  the   Appellant's
           account's plausibility;

        c) The psychiatric  report  from  Dr  Burman-Roy  referred  to  the
           likelihood that the Appellant's ability to give  an  account  of
           his experiences might fluctuate depending on his  circumstances,
           and would be likely to deteriorate if he was acutely distressed,
           and required attention to be given to  his  vulnerability  as  a
           witness generally.

    9. Furthermore, the First-tier Tribunal was said to have erred in law in
       assessing the risks the Appellant would face on a return  because  it
       overlooked

        a) The Appellant's PTSD symptoms when assessing the  reasonableness
           of Kabul as an internal relocation alternative, bearing in  mind
           the passages in the Country Guidelines decision (AS Afghanistan)
           that made clear that mental health was a material consideration;



        b) The fact that  UNHCR's  eligibility  guidelines  had  materially
           changed since the decision of the Upper Tribunal in AS  and  now
           stated  that  there  was  no  internal  relocation   alternative
           generally available in Kabul;

        c) The risks to the  Appellant  arising  from  the  internal  armed
           conflict, which was particularly relevant  given  he  came  from
           Hesarak district, Nangahar Province.

   10. On 2 April 2019 the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal,
       on the basis that the grounds were arguable; the  Mibanga  point  was
       thought the strongest one.

   11. Ms Cunha accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had committed at least
       one significant error of law  by  failing  to  evaluate  the  medical
       evidence before making credibility findings. However, she  maintained
       that this was not a material error of law as the Appellant could  not
       make good his case applying the relevant  country  guidance,  as  the
       psychiatric evidence had not been  accepted  below,  given  that  the
       First-tier Tribunal effectively found that the psychiatrist had  been
       fooled by the Appellant,  who  accordingly  fell  to  be  treated  as
       essentially a healthy young man who could thus relocate internally to
       Kabul.

   12. Mr Eaton submitted that the Judge's findings on the medical  evidence
       were unreliable, given that they were predicated on  a  rejection  of
       the Appellant's credibility that was itself  unsafe.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal appeared to have made its own finding on the  likelihood  of
       the  Appellant  having  PTSD  without  properly  engaging  with   the
       carefully reasoned approach of the medical report.  The  psychiatrist
       had found that the Appellant suffered from depression and  PTSD  such
       that his evidence should be assessed in the light of  the  Vulnerable
       Witnesses Guidance. There were repeated references to  mental  health
       in AS Afghanistan as relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness
       of internal relocation.

Decision and reasons

   13. I accept that there was an error of law committed by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal by leaving the expert  evidence  out  of  account  prior  to
       making credibility findings.

   14. Dr Burman-Roy's  report  stated,  materially,  that  the  Appellant's
       ability to take stock of his position and to integrate in Afghanistan
       would be affected  by  increased  levels  of  anxiety,  avoidance  of
       challenging situations, and memory and concentration problems; indeed
       social isolation and self-neglect were common consequences  of  PTSD;
       he also stated that

           "I did not feel  that  there  was  any  indication  Mr  [H]  was
           feigning or exaggerating symptoms ...

           Increased levels of anxiety, avoidance of challenging situations
           and difficulties in  memory  and  concentration  are  recognised
           symptoms of  PTSD  ...  It  was  particularly  notable  that  he
           struggled to maintain focus during the interview and  found  the
           process cognitively challenging. I would recommend that [he]  be
           treated as a vulnerable witness ..."

   15. It was essential for detailed material of this kind to be  considered
       as part of the global  assessment  of  the  Appellant's  credibility.
       Failing so to do was essentially the  same  error  as  identified  in
       Mibanga, or as summarised in Virjon B [2002] EWHC  1469  �21,  making
       "adverse findings of credibility with regard to the claimant  ...  as
       the means whereby to reject the important  and  significant  evidence
       [from other sources]. That was putting the cart  before  the  horse."
       And as stated in HE [2004] UKIAT 00321 at �22:

           "Where the report is specifically relied on as a factor relevant
           to credibility, the  adjudicator  should  deal  with  it  as  an
           integral part of the findings on credibility rather than just as
           an add-on, which does not undermine the conclusion to  which  he
           would otherwise come."

   16. I also consider that the error was a material one. I cannot accept Ms
       Cunha's submission that the First-tier Tribunal's  treatment  of  the
       psychiatric evidence was  lawful.  There  was  no  reference  to  the
       Presidential Guidance  note  on  Vulnerable  Witnesses.  Indeed,  the
       content of the psychiatric report  was  relied  on  as  a  source  of
       discrepancies which were  then  said  to  undermine  the  Appellant's
       evidence overall.

   17. It was essential that the Appellant's evidence  be  assessed  in  the
       light of that  medical  evidence,  having  regard  to  his  potential
       vulnerability and any effect this might have on the manner  in  which
       his  evidence  presented  itself.   Dr   Burman-Roy   had   expressly
       considered, and discounted, the possibility of simulation, and it was
       essential that express regard be had to that aspect  of  his  account
       before the Judge came to their own view on the matter.

   18. The assessment of  the  Appellant's  mental  health  was  accordingly
       unlawful. Were he to be accepted as having  mental  health  problems,
       then these would have to be assessed in the light of  the  Guidelines
       in AS Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT  118  (IAC)  which  cited  the  EASO
       Report:  "Afghanistan  -   Key   socio-economic   indicators,   state
       protection, and mobility in Kabul  City,  Mazar-e  Sharif  and  Herat
       City" (August 2017).

           "142. In terms of mental  health  care,  the  same  EASO  Report
           recorded  very  high  levels  of  mental  health   problems   in
           Afghanistan (particularly depression, anxiety and PTSD) creating
           significant  needs  but  that  there  was  a  lack  of   trained
           professionals (psychiatrists, social workers, psychologists) and
           an  inadequate  infrastructure.   Although  the  Public   Health
           Minister reported that psychological services were available  at
           some 1,500 health centres around the country with 300  dedicated
           mental health clinics;  there  was  only  one  dedicated  mental
           health hospital  in  Kabul  and  Samual  Hall's  study  in  2016
           referred to there being only three trained psychiatrists and ten
           psychologists in the whole of Afghanistan.

           143.   In  Kabul  specifically,  there  is  better   access   to
           healthcare than in the provinces and the  most  qualified  staff
           work there with specialist clinics and hospitals;  albeit  there
           is still significant room  for  improvement.   There  remains  a
           shortage of equipment and demand which outstrips supply.  Nearly
           half of Kabul residents can not  afford  medical  treatment  (as
           patients need to buy their own  medicines  and,  in  any  event,
           pharmacies are poorly equipped).  There are  also  instances  of
           health facilities being targeted by armed grounds, including  in
           Kabul."

   19. The Upper Tribunal stated in AS Afghanistan:

           "234. In our conclusions, we refer throughout to a  single  male
           in good health as this is the  primary  group  of  people  under
           consideration in this appeal and reflects the position  of  this
           particular Appellant.  It is uncontroversial that a  person  who
           is in good health or fit and  able  is  likely  to  have  better
           employment prospects, particularly given the availability of low
           or unskilled jobs involving manual labour in Kabul.  We were not
           provided with any specific evidence of the likely impact of poor
           physical or mental health on the  safety  or  reasonableness  of
           internal relocation to Kabul but consider it reasonable to infer
           that this could be  relevant  to  the  issue  and  the  specific
           situation  of  the  individual  would  need  to   be   carefully
           considered.

           ...

           241.  ... (iii) However,  the  particular  circumstances  of  an
           individual applicant must be taken into account in  the  context
           of conditions in the place of relocation, including  a  person's
           age, nature and  quality  of  support  network/connections  with
           Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental health,  and  their
           language,  education  and  vocational  skills  when  determining
           whether a person falls  within  the  general  position  set  out
           above."

   20. A further material error of law arose in the  light  of  the  UNHCR's
       Eligibility Guidelines of 30 August 2018, which state:

           "Against a background of general concerns about  rising  poverty
           levels in Afghanistan, with the  proportion  of  the  population
           living  below  the  national  poverty  line  reportedly   having
           increased from 34 per cent in 2007-2008 to 55 per cent in  2016-
           2017, the Asia Foundation's 2017 Survey  of  the  Afghan  People
           found that perceptions of a worsening  financial  situation  was
           most common in the Central/Kabul region, at 43.9  per  cent.  In
           January 2017 it was reported that 55 per cent of  households  in
           Kabul informal settlements were severely food insecure.

           OCHA's 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview ranks Kabul among the 10
           provinces (out of a total of 34 provinces) that  are  "the  most
           conflict-affected". In addition, the Humanitarian Needs Overview
           notes that "needs are particularly  pronounced  in  large  urban
           centres, including Kabul and Jalalabad City, where both IDP  and
           returnee populations have congregated in search  of  income  and
           livelihoods  opportunities  as  well  as  access  to  basic  and
           essential services. Humanitarian needs in  these  two  provinces
           comprise  42  percent  of  all  those   relating   to   internal
           displacement and cross-border influxes."

           Against the background of the  considerations  relating  to  the
           relevance and reasonableness analysis for Kabul  as  a  proposed
           area of IFA/IRA, and taking into account the  overall  situation
           of conflict and human rights violations, as well as the  adverse
           impact this has on the  broader  socio-economic  context,  UNHCR
           considers that an IFA/IRA is generally not available in Kabul. "



   21. UNHCR occupy an important  place  in  the  international  community's
       approach  to  refugee  status  determination.  Their  views  are  not
       determinative, but carry significant weight. The First Tier  Tribunal
       had no regard to the very significant shift in  their  assessment  of
       the viability of internal relocation to Kabul generally. This  was  a
       material error of law.

   22. Unfortunately the errors set out  above  are  fundamental  one  which
       undermine the entirety  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusions.
       Accordingly the matter requires re-hearing, and given  the  scale  of
       the necessary fact-finding, remittal is appropriate.

   23. The Appellant's problems in his home area  will  require  lawful  re-
       assessment in the light of whatever future credibility  findings  are
       made on his account. So too will his claim to fear  the  consequences
       for civilians of the internal armed conflict in his  home  area.  The
       First-tier Tribunal will then need to consider whether the  Appellant
       could  be  reasonably  expected  to  relocate  to  Kabul,  given  the
       psychiatric evidence and the material cited above, and in  the  light
       of AS (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA Civ 873.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law and its decision is set aside.

The appeal is remitted for re-hearing afresh.
