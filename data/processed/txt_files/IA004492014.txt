For the Respondent:    Mr M Hasan, instructed by Kalam Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Respondent's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Scott
    made following a hearing at Taylor House on 21st August 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on  10th  December  1985.
    He arrived in the UK on 16 January  2010  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student until 31 December 2011. On 29  December  2011  he  applied  for
    further leave to remain, also as a  student,  but  was  refused  on  25
    February 2012.  On 29 September 2012 he made an application  for  leave
    to remain as a Tier  4  (general)  student  which  was  "voided  as  an
    inappropriate application". He became appeal  rights  exhausted  on  25
    October 2012.

 3. The Appellant then made a further application for leave to remain on 19
    December 2012.  He was refused under Paragraph 245ZX(m) of  the  Rules,
    which states that the applicant will be refused if he is in the  UK  in
    breach of immigration laws except that any period of overstaying for  a
    period of 28 days or less will be disregarded.

 4. He appealed against the decision. His appeal was allowed by Judge Scott
    on the basis that the Appellant had not been informed by the  Secretary
    of State that a previous application had been rejected as invalid.

 5. Under Section 82(2)(e) of the Nationality Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 Act there is a right of appeal to the Tribunal against a  decision
    to refuse to vary a person's leave to enter or remain in the UK if when
    the variation takes effect, the person has no leave to enter or remain.



 6. At the time of the application on the 19 December  2012  the  Appellant
    had no leave to vary.

 7.  The  difficulty  for  the  Appellant,  as  Mr  Hasan   very   properly
    acknowledged, is that the judge had no jurisdiction to hear the  appeal
    since there was no immigration decision before him under Section  82(1)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He is not assisted
    by a potential continuation of leave under 3C of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971 because, under Section 3C(4), a person may not make an application
    for variation of his leave to enter or remain  in  the  UK  while  that
    leave is extended by virtue of that Section.

 8. Since the judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal is decision
    has to be set  aside.   It  is  re-made  as  follows.   The  appeal  is
    dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
