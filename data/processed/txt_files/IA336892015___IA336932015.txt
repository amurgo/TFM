Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Clark Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr Muquit Counsel



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by  the  SSHD  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Abebrese promulgated on the 11th  October  2018  whereby
    the judge allowed the respondents' appeal against the decision  of  the
    SSHD to refuse the respondents' claims based on the  Immigration  Rules
    and Article 8 of the ECHR.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. As the decisions impact upon the  rights  and  status  of  a
    child, I consider it appropriate to make an anonymity direction.

 3. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Gill on 6th November 2018. Thus the case appeared  before  me  to
    determine whether or not there was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

 4. In the first instance the position of the second respondent has  to  be
    considered. The second respondent applied as the  child  of  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant. The father of the family has leave as a Tier  1
    migrant. His status is unaffected by the issues in the present  appeal.
    Whilst issues arise in  the  case  of  the  first  respondent  and  the
    validity  of  an  English   language   test   Certificate,   the   same
    considerations do not  apply  to  the  second  respondent.  Her  appeal
    dependent upon the status of the father of the family is unaffected  by
    the issues raised. Her appeal stands as allowed  and  nothing  in  this
    decision alters that. There is  no  error  in  respect  of  the  second
    respondent.

 5. The issues in the appeal relate to the first respondent and whether she
    has submitted an English Language test certificate that was obtained by
    fraud or dishonesty. The TOEIC certificate has  been  identified  as  a
    certificate issued at college where there was  widespread  practice  of
    proxy test takers and other malpractices such that certificates  issued
    after test at the college have been invalidated.

 6. Guidance has been given in the cases of SM & Qadir v SSHD  [2016]  UKUT
    229 and SSHD v Shehzad [2016] EWCA Civ 615 as to how the issues  should
    be approached in such cases. The SSHD bears an evidential burden in the
    first instance sufficient  to  raise  a  prima  facie  case.  Once  the
    evidence establishes that prima  facie  case,  the  applicant  has  the
    burden of adducing evidence raising an innocent  explanation.  Provided
    the applicant can raise such an explanation, the SSHD bears the  burden
    of proving that the certificate  is  false  or  has  been  obtained  by
    dishonest means or fraud.

 7. In examining the  decision  by  Judge  Abebrese  there  is  clearly  an
    argument for saying that he has not followed  the  structured  approach
    advocated in the caselaw. He does in paragraph 18 set out the  approach
    to be followed but then refers to the evidence submitted being  generic
    without finding that the evidential burden has in  the  first  instance
    been discharged by the SSHD. However that  may  matter  little  as  the
    caselaw  identifies  that  the  "generic"  evidence  is  sufficient  to
    discharge the evidential burden.

 8. The judge thereafter considers the evidence presented by the respondent
    and then allows the appeal. The problem with regard to  that  approach,
    is  that  what  has  been  considered  to  be  generic   evidence   has
    specifically dealt with the college in question  and  has  specifically
    identified the practices  that  have  led  to  the  certificates  being
    obtained dishonestly or by fraud. The judge was required to look at the
    evidence and make findings on that evidence as to whether in  light  of
    that evidence the SSHD had proved that the certificate submitted by the
    respondent had been obtained by dishonest means or fraud.

 9. The evidence submitted included the generic evidence from Mr Millington
    and  Ms  Collins  as  well  as  evidence  from  a  senior  home  office
    administrator tying the evidence together. There are also reports by Dr
    French, the Criminal Investigation Report Faï¿½ade and  the  spreadsheet.
    The spreadsheet specifically identified the level  of  false  positives
    and was supported by the report of Dr French. Part of the  respondent's
    case must be that false positives have been produced in  the  evidence.
    Careful consideration needed to be given to those  reports  and  reason
    given for not accepting the evidence and conclusions set  out  therein.
    It may be that the respondent's evidence is such that  the  reports  do
    not discharge the burden but consideration  has  to  be  given  to  the
    evidence and reasons for discounting the  evidence.  In  light  of  the
    judge's failure to give reasons for not  accepting  the  evidence,  the
    judge has failed to approach the cases in accordance with the  guidance
    given.

10. In the circumstances there is a material error of law. The only  course
    is for the appeal of the first respondent to be remitted to the  First-
    tier for rehearing.

11. As indicated there is no error with regard to the second respondent and
    the decision to allow her appeal stands.

    Notice of Decision

12. I dismiss the appeal of the SSHD in respect of the second respondent.

13. I allow the appeal of the SSHD in respect of the decision of the  first
    respondent.

14. I set the decision of Judge Abebrese in respect of the first respondent
    aside.

15. I remit the case of the first respondent to the First-tier Tribunal for
    hearing afresh.
