Representation:

For the appellants:    Ms D Revill, instructed by Peer & Co (Watford)
For the respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, all citizens of Nepal, are team Tier 1 applicants,  the
    first and second appellants, and their dependant  husbands,  the  third
    and fourth appellants.

 2. These are their linked appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pacey, who dismissed their appeals against the decisions
    of the respondent, various dated between 19-24 March  2014,  to  refuse
    their applications for further leave to remain in the UK as team Tier 1
    applicants with dependants husbands, and to remove  them  from  the  UK
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 1.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin granted permission to appeal on a  date
    unknown.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Pacey should be set aside.

 6. The Secretary of State, and on appeal Judge Pacey, were  not  satisfied
    that the appellants genuinely intended and were able to establish, take
    over or become a director of one or more businesses in  the  UK  within
    the next six months, or that they genuinely intends to invest the money
    referred to in table 4 of Appendix A in the business, or that the money
    was genuinely available  to  the  appellants.  The  appeals  were  thus
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In essence, the grounds of appeal take issue with the judge's  findings
    and argue that she  failed  to  correctly  apply  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245DD(h).

 8. Ground 1 asserts that the judge erred in finding that the funds held by
    the appellants were not available to their company.  Ground  2  asserts
    that the judge found that the appellants had submitted a false contract
    document, but ignored the burden of proof. Ground 3 points out that the
    appellants do not have to demonstrate that their business is likely  to
    be successful, only that they genuinely intend  to  pursue  it.  It  is
    submitted that the judge applied an overly critical approach to the way
    in which the business is to be run and confused viability with  genuine
    intent

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Levin found that, "The  judge's
    failure to identify at para 38 of her determination why she found  that
    the Appellants had  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  with
    reference to the specified requirements of the Immigration Rules and to
    make clear findings thereupon arguably amounts to an error of  law.  In
    such circumstances both the  grounds  and  the  determination  disclose
    arguable errors of law."

10. The Secretary of State's Rule 24 response  noted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge raised various concerns as  to  whether  the  appellants
    were genuine entrepreneurs, the requirement of  paragraph  245DD(h)  of
    the Immigration Rules. "The concerns appear valid. The fact  that  they
    were inconsistent regarding the enquiries made, regarding the number of
    client  required  to  obtain  projected  profits,  the  concerns   over
    advertising and also  their  general  lack  of  experience,  which  was
    inconsistent with the claims to  have  years  of  experience."   As  to
    ground 3, the response is, "that appears to be a disagreement with  the
    findings of the Judge, who appears for all the reasons given  above  to
    have  been  entitled  to  conclude  that   they   were   not   "genuine
    entrepreneurs."

11. There is merit in ground 1. The judge did not address the  respondent's
    concern that the funds were not genuinely available to  the  appellants
    for the purpose of the business, except in the narrow sense set out  at
    �33 of the determination. There, the judge found that as the funds were
    held in an account in the  names  of  both  of  the  first  and  second
    appellants, they were not held by the company they had  set  up,  which
    was an independent legal entity. Whilst the judge was correct about the
    legal status of a business, the  judge  appears  to  have  ignored  the
    meaning of 'available' in paragraph 245DD(h), which includes that funds
    are held in the own possession of the applicant, or  in  the  financial
    accounts of an incorporated business of which he is the  direction,  or
    available from a third party. There is no requirement  that  the  funds
    must be held in the name or account of the business set up.  The  judge
    has made an error of law in the making of the decision. However, in the
    light of my findings regarding grounds 2 and 3, this error  of  law  is
    not material.

12. I do not accept the premise of ground 2, which is that the judge made a
    finding that the appellants had submitted a false document. At �34  the
    judge considered the contract submitted with Rainna  Clothing  Ltd  and
    stated that she did not find it to be a genuine contract. Something has
    gone awry with the wording of �34, as  it  appears  incomplete  in  the
    reasons given for finding the contract not genuine. Nevertheless, I  do
    not accept that the judge made a finding that the document was false or
    that this discrete finding adversely affected the  credibility  of  the
    appellants or adversely affected the other factual findings. It is  for
    the appellants to demonstrate that a document submitted can  be  relied
    on. The judge was not making a finding of forgery.

13. In any event, as this document came into existence after  the  date  of
    application, it is excluded by the operation of section 85A(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as it was  not  submitted
    in support of, and at the time of making the application to  which  the
    immigration decision relates. However,  this  only  relates  to  points
    based decisions. It is  arguable  that  as  the  refusal  decision  was
    divided between points based system and non-points based system reasons
    for refusal and that the production of the contract document, which was
    considered by the Secretary of State, is not caught by section  85A(4).
    However, in Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT
    00365 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal panel found that where a  provision  of
    the Rules provides that points will not be  awarded  if  the  decision-
    maker is not satisfied as to another (non-points-scoring) aspect of the
    Rule, the non-points-scoring aspect and the requirement for points  are
    inextricably linked and as a result the prohibition on new evidence  in
    section 85A(4) applies to the non-points-scoring aspect  of  the  rule:
    the prohibition is in relation to new evidence that goes to the scoring
    of points. In the circumstances, the Secretary of State and the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  judge  should  have   excluded   this   contract   from
    consideration.

14. I see no inter-relation between  this  finding  and  the  rest  of  the
    decision. In the circumstances, I find no material error  of  law  with
    regard to ground 2.

15. I agree with the submission of Ms Isherwood that ground 3  is  no  more
    than a disagreement with the findings of the judge. I do not accept  Ms
    Revill's argument that the judge has confused  viability  with  genuine
    intent. It is clear from �7  of  the  determination  that  Judge  Pacey
    recognised that the Rules require the intention to run a business to be
    genuine and that "There is no specific evidence that it be  realistic."
    I find nothing improper about the judge's following statement that, "in
    order for an intention to be genuine the team  members  must  establish
    that they consider that the business  has,  to  borrow  a  phrase  from
    another context, a "realistic prospect of success" and that it  is  not
    purely rooted in the realms of fantasy. However,  I  am  not  satisfied
    that the judge chose an appropriate example, in relation to  a  singing
    business, as if a person can sing, it requires no other  qualifications
    to do so as a business.

16. Considering the determination as a whole, I am satisfied that the judge
    has, at some length, given anxious  consideration  as  to  whether  the
    appellants' intentions are genuine. That must  necessarily  involve  an
    assessment of the circumstances of the proposed business, the  business
    plan, the plans for marketing  and  advertising,  and  the  appellants'
    qualifications and experience. I am satisfied  that  whilst  the  judge
    makes some criticisms of the viability of the proposed business, in the
    end the judge's conclusion that their intentions are not  genuine,  the
    judge has given cogent reasons for reaching such a conclusion, and that
    the conclusion was one open to the judge to make on  the  facts  before
    her. I do not find the decision in this regard perverse or  irrational,
    or otherwise flawed. In essence, the grounds in this regard are no more
    than a disagreement with and an attempt to reargue the judge's findings
    of fact. I thus find no error of law in respect of ground 3.

17. In all the circumstances, whilst there is an error of  law,  as  stated
    above  in  relation  to  ground  1,  the  appellants  have  failed   to
    demonstrate that the decision would or could have been  any  different.
    Even if one excludes ground 1 entirely, the appeals would fail  on  the
    credibility  assessment.  Thus  the  decision  does  not  disclose  any
    material error of law.

18. It is obvious that the appeals of the third and fourth appellants stand
    or fall with those of the first and second appellants and that  on  the
    facts of this case the appeal of the first and second  appellants  also
    stand or fall together.

Conclusion & Decision:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each appellant remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed.
