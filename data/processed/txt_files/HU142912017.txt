For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure or publication  of  any
    matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  respondent
    or his children. Breach of this order can be punished as a contempt  of
    court. I make this order because the decision impacts on the welfare of
    children who could be harmed by publicity.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    "the claimant", against the decision of the Secretary of State refusing
    him leave to remain on human rights grounds.  An error  of  law  in  an
    earlier decision was identified by Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson who  set
    aside the decision and directed that the case be decided again  in  the
    Upper Tribunal and the case was transferred to me to achieve that end.

 3. The claimant is a citizen of St Vincent and the Grenadines who was born
    in July 1977.  He chose to serve in Her Majesty's Forces and has been a
    Royal Marine Commando.  He finished his  military  service  in  October
    2016.

 4. He has also committed a serious criminal offence and  in  October  2016
    was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for an offence of  dishonesty.
    The precise circumstances for the offence are not entirely clear but he
    tricked a person to allow him access to her bank account and emptied it
    of sums in the region of �20,000 to �30,000 for his own use.  It  seems
    that he was funding a gambling habit.

 5. Evidence was called before me.

 6. I begin by considering the evidence of the claimant. In  his  statement
    he outlined his personal circumstances  and  commented  on  his  strict
    upbringing and the challenges of life as a Royal Marine.   There  is  a
    testimonial from the Royal Marines outlining his  service.   He  was  a
    Royal Marine for some fifteen years or thereabouts and  was  successful
    in his career being commended on  various  occasions  for  particularly
    useful service which included spells of duty in dangerous circumstances
    in Afghanistan.

 7. His statement also refers to his personal  life  and  particularly  his
    sons.  He has two boys from different relationships.  The oldest, who I
    identify as "R", was born in November 2005 and so is now 13 years  old.
    The second, who I identify as "D", was born in March 2011 and is now  7
    years and 8 months old.  The claimant does not  say  much  about  these
    children in the statement although he makes it plain that he  wants  to
    keep contact with them.  In answer to supplementary questions before me
    he was quite clear that he has little or no contact with the older boy.
     He has not seen R since April 2016.  He would like to  see  the  child
    more.  I regard that as a genuine intention but not one to which he can
    give effect.  Presently theirs is a non-existent relationship and there
    is little prospect of it being rekindled.

 8. The younger boy, D, he sees from time to time.  When  he  was  released
    from custody in February 2018 he resumed cohabitation with  D's  mother
    and that lasted for a few months.  Clearly there was daily  contact  in
    that time.  Since then contact has become  occasional  but  D's  mother
    supports the idea of contact and my impression is that if the  claimant
    were allowed to remain in the United Kingdom they would try and  ensure
    that the claimant was a significant part in D's life.  Certainly I  did
    not get the impression from D's  mother  that  she  would  set  out  to
    frustrate  contact.   She  clearly  regards  the  claimant  as  a  good
    influence in her son's life.

 9. As already indicated, D's mother gave evidence.  She spoke well of  the
    claimant's work ethic and told me that D  does  not  wish  to  see  his
    father but wishes to be kept in touch. She said that the time will come
    where he will want to see his father.   I  did  not  see  this  as  the
    evidence of a mother allowing a small boy to have  too  big  a  say  in
    these things but rather as a mother who listened to the child  but  who
    continues to present his natural father in a positive  way.  She  would
    encourage  him  to  resume  contact  and  certainly   has   facilitated
    occasional contact.  She told how on one occasion she made an unplanned
    visit so that the claimant could see D but that D slept throughout  the
    visit.

10. The claimant's present partner, CDW, gave evidence.  She confirmed that
    the claimant was trying to find funds to help him maintain contact with
    his older son and she had concerns about his returning to  his  country
    of nationality.

11. Some of the evidence in written form was addressing  the  Secretary  of
    State's idea that the claimant could go to St Vincent with  his  family
    but Mr Mills made it plain that he did not pursue  that  as  a  serious
    suggestion.

12. There was also evidence from Mr C Ch who has employed the claimant.  He
    clearly thought highly of him describing him as a "very  competent  and
    proficient man".  He said at paragraph 9:

         "I do not understand why the Home Office want  to  deport  him,  or
         what they think that will achieve.  I have said that I will support
         him and will not see him struggle.  I see him regularly in  person,
         and whilst I may not have known him for very long, I have seen  him
         be professional and law abiding and  accepting  of  the  situation,
         which cannot have been easy, given  his  background.   Eddie  is  a
         proud man but he readily accepts help from  others.   Currently,  I
         make sure that he has somewhere to live, and he  is  surviving.   I
         will support him through to the end, if needs be."

13. He then commented on  the  claimant's  military  record  and  described
    deportation  as  "very  Draconian"  and  then  offered  the  view  that
    deportation "in this case is a disgrace".

14. The evidence before me was truthful in the sense that  the  people  who
    gave their evidence gave it honestly without candour and  were  subject
    to little cross-examination.  The difficulty that I face in acquiescing
    to their wishes is that Parliament has decided that the public interest
    lies in deporting people who are foreign criminals and the claimant  is
    a foreign criminal.  He is not in the most serious category and  he  is
    not at the higher end of the less serious category but he is a  foreign
    criminal and deportation is required by  the  public  interest  because
    Parliament says that it is and my opinions and Mr CC's opinions are  of
    no concern to that point.

15. I begin  my  analysis  by  considering  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.  Under  the  Act  the  only  relevant
    consideration is whether it would be unduly harsh on the boys  for  the
    claimant to be deported.  As far as the  elder  boy  is  concerned  the
    answer is very straightforward.  He has no contact with his father  and
    has not had any contact for  some  time.   The  claimant's  deportation
    brings to an end any prospect of anything being  re-established  except
    possible occasional written or similar "long distance" contact but that
    will be more than exists at the moment.  There is no basis  for  saying
    that the effect on the older boy would be unduly harsh.

16. The younger boy is in  a  different  position.   He  has  suffered  the
    uncertainties of being a military child and of having his father coming
    back into his life and then going away again after a short time.  It is
    unsurprising he is rather  raw  presently.   On  the  limited  material
    before me I find that it would  be  very  much  in  that  child's  best
    interests to continue to have a relationship with his father  and  that
    theirs  is  a  relationship  that  would  settle  down  into   fruitful
    occasional contact if that were permissible.  Removing  him  will  mean
    there is little prospect for a meaningful close relationship although I
    suspect that the claimant, supported by the  child's  mother,  will  do
    what they can.

17. However there is no basis for saying the  removing  the  claimant  will
    have unduly harsh consequences for  the  child.   Disruption  of  close
    relationships is the natural  consequence  of  deportation.   There  is
    nothing  here  that  aggravates  the  harm  or  makes  it  particularly
    difficult.

18. Mr Karnik had much to say  about  the  Military  Covenant  and  I  have
    considered his submissions carefully.  As he reminds me, rightly,  that
    the Military Covenant extends to  the  families  of  those  who  serve.
    Although there is no direct evidence on the point I incline to the view
    (I cannot go any further on the evidence) that the gambling habit  that
    appears to behind the criminal behaviour was connected in some way with
    the unpleasant experiences that the  claimant  has  had  in  the  Armed
    Forces.  However Parliament has not made any  statutory  exception  for
    members or former members of the Armed Forces involved  in  deportation
    proceedings.  There is nothing in the Act that says that their families
    are entitled  to  special  consideration.   Clearly  the  respect  that
    everyone  wants  to  have  for  members  of  Her  Majesty's  Forces  is
    diminished if that person commits a serious criminal offence  and  this
    man has.

19. I have reflected on the submissions and I have read the papers.   I  am
    aware,  for  example,  of  the  favourable  probation  report  and  the
    favourable military material as well as supporting letters  which  show
    clearly that the criminal behaviour that got the claimant into  trouble
    is by no means the extent of this man's personality and character.

20. I cannot agree that  the  military  connections  amount  to  compelling
    compassionate circumstances.  I am confident  that  the  judge  in  the
    Crown Court would have thought  very  carefully  about  the  claimant's
    military service, and possible reasons for offending, before sentencing
    him.  Clearly he was told about it and commented on it.  The  "Military
    Covenant" was no less relevant then than it is now. By  reason  of  the
    sentence he is subject to  "automatic  deportation"  and  his  military
    service is not a weighty factor.

21. This is a case of a man with no meaningful contact with his older child
    and in an estranged relationship with his younger child who  is  not  a
    member of a nuclear family being unable to show that the effect of  his
    deportation is unduly harsh on his close relatives.

22. The other factors in the case, despite Mr Karnik's determined  efforts,
    do not save the day.  Although I am entitled to and should look at  all
    the matters in the round, and it is difficult to say that  anything  is
    irrelevant for the purposes of an Article 8 balancing  exercise  guided
    by statute or not, the statutory criteria dominate my analysis.

23. Putting everything together  I  must  and  do  dismiss  the  claimant's
    appeal.

    Notice of Decision

24. An error of law has already been established and the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal set aside. I dismiss the claimant's appeal  against
    the Secretary of State's decision.
