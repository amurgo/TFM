Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms K McCarthy, instructed by Everest Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. These are the approved record of the decision and reasons  which  I
         gave orally at the end of the hearing on 26th May 2021.

      2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing  via  Teams,  while
         the hearing was also open to attend at Field  House.   The  parties
         did not object to attending via Teams and I was satisfied that  the
         representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

      3. This is the remaking of the  decision  in  the  appellants'  appeal
         against the respondent's refusal of their  applications  for  entry
         clearance to settle as adult dependent relatives of  their  mother,
         the widow of a former Gurkha soldier, Ms Padam  Kumari  Rana  Magar
         (the 'sponsor').  The background to the appeals and the  First-tier
         Tribunal's  decision,  which  I  set  aside  subject  to  preserved
         findings, is set out in my error of  law  decision  promulgated  on
         29th March 2021, a copy of which is in the annex to this  decision,
         and I do not repeat the background.  I had preserved the First-tier
         Tribunal's findings at �30 of Judge Hussain's decision that:

             "Before coming to this country in 2002,  the  appellants  were
             members of their sponsor's household.  Since coming here,  she
             has regularly returned to Nepal to reunite  with  her  family,
             including the  appellants.   I  am  also  satisfied  that  the
             sponsor has financially  supported  the  appellants  from  the
             benefits she receives in this country,  and  the  pension  she
             gets in Nepal.  She has also remained in  close  contact  with
             them.   There  is,  in  the  appellant's  bundle,   sufficient
             evidence from which to infer these facts."

The contested legal issues in this appeal

      4. The parties agreed that there was a  single  legal  issue  in  this
         appeal: whether the appellants have family life with  the  sponsor.
         As per the authority of R (Gurung & Ors) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ  8,
         the historic injustice faced by Gurkhas who were not able to settle
         in the UK until 2009  should  be  taken  into  account  during  the
         article  8  ECHR   consideration  and   while   it   may   not   be
         determinative,

             "if a Gurkha can show that, but for the historic injustice, he
             would have settled in the UK at  a  time  when  his  dependant
             (now) adult child would have been able to accompany him  as  a
             dependent child under the age of 18, that is a  strong  reason
             for holding that it is proportionate to permit the adult child
             to join his family now." (�42)

      5. The representatives accepted that there  were  no  public  interest
         considerations  to  counter  the  applications  (none  having  been
         raised), and were I to find that family life has been  established,
         on these particular facts, refusal  of  entry  clearance  would  be
         disproportionate.

      6. The representatives  also  agreed  that  when  considering  whether
         family life existed, there was no requirement of exceptionality  or
         necessity of need for adult dependent children.  Instead, the  test
         was whether there was real, effective or committed support (see Rai
         v The Entry Clearance Officer (New Delhi) [2017] EWCA Civ 320).



Documents

      7.  The  respondent  provided  a  bundle  containing  the  appellants'
         applications and previous decisions refusing entry clearance.   The
         appellants produced their own paginated and indexed bundles,  which
         included a supplemental witness statement of the sponsor.

The sponsor's evidence

      8. Having agreed the issues  with  the  representatives,  the  sponsor
         adopted her three witness statements. The first statement  which  I
         was asked to consider was dated 27th  January  2021,  which  I  now
         summarise.  The sponsor had entered the UK in 2012, by  which  time
         Arjun was already 30, whilst Rekha was  27.   Prior  to  that,  the
         sponsor had been living with them  and  her  youngest  daughter  in
         Nepal, who has since been granted entry clearance for settlement in
         the UK.  The sponsor had returned to Nepal to  live  with  them  as
         much as she was allowed.  None of the children were able to make  a
         living on their own and she had to send them money from the UK  for
         their expenses.  She spoke  to  them  every  day  using  electronic
         communication and  because  of  her  limited  education,  found  it
         difficult to use new messaging software.   She  continued  to  send
         money to her children both separately and collectively, around �200
         in some months.  The only reason that the sponsor had come  to  the
         UK was to provide better financial  support  for  her  children  in
         Nepal.

      9. The sponsor's second, more recent  statement  was  contained  in  a
         supplemental  bundle,  at  pages  [8]  to  [9].   In  summary,  she
         addressed the issue I had previously identified in my error of  law
         decision, namely a reference in an earlier determination  of  Judge
         Moore, promulgated on 24th May 2017, whereby he recorded  that  the
         sponsor had  given  evidence  that  three  older  siblings  of  her
         youngest daughter (later granted entry clearance) were married  and
         lived with their own  families.   The  sponsor  confirmed  in  this
         statement that she had six children, the oldest three of whom  were
         married whilst the  three  youngest  siblings  (including  the  two
         appellants) remained unmarried and this was the  evidence  she  had
         given to Judge  Moore  in  the  third  statement,  which  she  also
         adopted.

     10. Ms Cunha cross-examined the sponsor on  her  witness  evidence.   I
         make the  general  observation  that  I  regarded  the  sponsor  as
         credible.  She  was  candid  to  confirm  points  which  might  not
         necessarily be in her favour such as  contributions  to  the  older
         married children but was also consistent about how she treated  the
         married and unmarried siblings differently.  She gave her  evidence
         in a straightforward manner and her  credibility  has  not,  in  my
         view, been substantially challenged in the hearing before me.   She
         confirmed that the youngest  of  the  daughters,  Kabita,  was  now
         living and working in the  UK  and  contributing  to  the  UK  home
         finances but the sponsor continued to provide financial support  to
         her children in Nepal.  She was asked why she continued to do so in
         circumstances when  Kabita  was  making  contributions  to  the  UK
         household.  She said that this was for the UK household expenses as
         Kabita now had a job in the UK, whereas the appellants continued to
         struggle to pay for  food,  so  the  appellant  continued  to  send
         remittances.  The  sponsor  candidly  accepted  that  she  did,  on
         occasions, pay to the three eldest married children remittances but
         she added that they were separate remittances, and I  was  referred
         to page [22]  of  the  appellants'  bundle  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal, which was consistent with the different, lesser and  less
         frequent amounts paid to the married  children  and  also,  in  the
         supplemental bundle, evidence of remittances between December  2020
         and May 2021 by reference to specific children.  The  sponsor  gave
         evidence,  which  I  find  was  consistent  with   the   documented
         remittances, that the occasional remittances to the eldest  married
         children were when they were occasionally out of work.  The sponsor
         also gave evidence, unchallenged, that she spoke to the  appellants
         on a daily basis, whereas she spoke to the older  married  siblings
         far less frequently.  She had arranged all  the  marriages  of  the
         eldest children but had been unable to arrange  marriages  for  the
         youngest three because of the family lacked money.   The  unmarried
         children in Nepal lived separately from their married siblings.

The respondent's closing submissions

     11. Ms Cunha indicated that the respondent continued to  dispute  real,
         effective or committed support because, in essence,  the  level  of
         support to the two appellants was no different  qualitatively  from
         the level of support to the three married children.  The suggestion
         that she was unable  to  arrange  marriages  for  the  two  younger
         children  was  undermined  by  the  fact  that  she  was  able   to
         financially support them and there was a lack of evidence that  the
         appellants were unmarried.  Also, because the sponsor  was  getting
         financial support from Kabita, in reality, Kabita  was  paying  the
         financial support to the two appellants.  Whilst there  undoubtedly
         existed family life in a general, non-legal sense,  there  was  not
         such distinguishing support for the purposes of article 8 ECHR.

The appellant's closing submissions

     12. Ms McCarthy relied on her skeleton argument and added that  it  was
         simply not correct that there was no  differential  treatment.   In
         particular, the sponsor indicated that  she  had  sent  money  more
         frequently and the need to send remittances for the other  children
         was only on particular occasions such as their lack  of  work.   In
         addition, there  was  a  greater  level  of  contact  and  the  two
         appellants continued to live unmarried in the family home in Nepal,
         where they had lived with the sponsor before she came  to  the  UK.
         In that context, their family life clearly engaged article 8.   The
         suggestion they were not married,  and  there  was  an  absence  of
         evidence for this, for example some sort of letter from  the  local
         municipal authority which sometimes can be adduced in  such  cases,
         was an unfair criticism where the respondent had not disputed  that
         the two appellants remained unmarried.  In  the  circumstances,  no
         adverse inference could be drawn from the lack of production  of  a
         document and instead the appellants have produced the remainder  of
         the documents one might normally expect, such as  the  family  roll
         and the sponsor's witness evidence. Finally,  the  suggestion  that
         Kabita was in fact providing support to the appellants and not  the
         sponsor was unsustainable.  The sponsor had  never  suggested  that
         she was financially dependent on her daughter in the UK and  indeed
         she had the benefit of a UK pension.  All she  had  said  was  that
         Kabita, who was now working, made contributions to the UK household
         finances, which was  an  entirely  different  matter  from  somehow
         indirectly sponsoring and paying for the two appellants.

Findings of fact and conclusions

     13. I find, without hesitation, that the appellants enjoy  family  life
         with the sponsor so as to engage article 8 ECHR.  I  do  so  for  a
         number of reasons.  The first is the clear and straightforward oral
         evidence given by the sponsor, who was cross-examined by Ms  Cunha,
         which  was  consistent  with  the  documentary  evidence,  of   the
         difference in treatment between the two appellants and their  older
         married siblings, in terms of financial remittances and  regularity
         of contact.  Second, the sponsor's evidence has to be  set  in  the
         context of the preserved findings which were of cohabitation  prior
         to the sponsor coming to the UK; regular remittances by the sponsor
         to the appellants; regular and frequent contact; and also visits by
         the sponsor to the appellants when she is able to  do  so.   Third,
         the continuing payments, on occasion, to the married siblings,  was
         explicable where it was because of a particular  need,  such  as  a
         loss of a job.  In  contrast,  the  sponsor's  evidence  about  the
         reasons for her remittances to the  appellants  were  because  they
         relied on her entirely for their  accommodation  and  basic  living
         needs.  I also accept the force of Ms  McCarthy's  submission  that
         the  fact  that  the  younger  sibling,  Kabita  may  be  making  a
         contribution to the UK household is  not  the  same  thing  as  the
         sponsor accepting that she was somehow dependent on  Kabita,  which
         would then  in  turn  mean  that  the  appellants  were  indirectly
         dependent on Kabita.  Indeed, it is common sense that  upon  Kabita
         entering the UK and working and  living  in  the  UK  home  of  the
         sponsor, she  makes  a  contribution  to  the  household  finances.
         However, the remittances sent by the sponsor to the appellants  are
         of a long-term nature and the recent additional contributions  made
         by Kabita to her mother do not begin to support a  contention  that
         somehow it  is  Kabita  on  whom  the  appellants  are  financially
         dependent.    Finally, the sponsor  was  never  challenged  on  her
         evidence that the appellants remain unmarried.

     14.  The  representatives  had  agreed   that   in   these   particular
         circumstances, were I to find that family life did exist, there was
         no countervailing public interest reason which would mean that  the
         refusal of entry clearance  remained  proportionate  and  that  the
         respondent's  decisions  to  refuse  entry   clearance   would   be
         disproportionate.   As a consequence, the respondent's decisions to
         refuse entry clearance breach the appellants' article 8 rights  and
         are not upheld. The appellants' appeals succeed.



Decision

     15. The respondent's decisions to refuse the  appellants'  applications
         for  entry  clearance  are  not  upheld.  The  appellants'  appeals
         succeed.

                            DECISION AND REASONS





Introduction

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and reasons which I  gave
    orally at the end of the hearing on 25th March 2021.

 2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also open to attend at Field House.  The  parties  did  not
    object  to  attending  via  Skype  and  I  was   satisfied   that   the
    representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is an appeal by the appellants against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge M B Hussain (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 14th April 2020,
    by which he dismissed the appellants' appeals against the  respondent's
    decisions  dated  20th   February  2019  to  refuse   the   appellants'
    applications for entry clearance to settle as adult dependent relatives
    of their mother, the widow of a former Gurkha soldier.  The  appellants
    are  siblings,  born  on  27th  April  1981  and  13th  December   1984
    respectively. The respondent refused the applications on the basis that
    both were over 30 years' old at the date of the application so did  not
    meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  or  the  relevant
    discretionary policy; and the respondent did not accept that there  was
    family life between the appellants and the sponsor for the purposes  of
    article 8 ECHR, noting the authorities of Kugathas v SSHD  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31 and Ghising and others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic  wrong;  weight)
    [2013] UKUT 00567  (IAC).    The  refusals  were  maintained  on  Entry
    Clearance Manager review on 8th September 2019.

The FtT's decision

 4.  The FtT identified at �28 that were he to find that  family  life  did
    exist  between  the  appellants  and  the  sponsor,   this   would   be
    determinative of the article 8 claims,  given  the  historic  injustice
    reflected in the applicable case law. Whilst noting  at  �30  that  the
    appellants had been members of the sponsor's  household  prior  to  her
    coming to the UK in 2002, and that she had regularly returned to  Nepal
    to visit them, had maintained close contact, as well as providing  them
    with financial support, at �31, the FtT  took  into  account  that  any
    dependency on the sponsor was by choice and there was no reason why the
    appellants could not seek independent lives, as  their  older  siblings
    had done. At �32, the FtT concluded that  there  must  "surely  come  a
    point" when adult children would have independent lives themselves  and
    there was no reason why the appellants should not seek such independent
    lives. The FtT rejected as relevant,  the  fact  that  the  appellants'
    younger sibling had been granted entry clearance, because she  met  the
    age requirements of Annex K of the Immigration Rules. That was not true
    of the appellants because of their ages (the younger sibling was  under
    the age of 30).

 5. Having considered the evidence  as  a  whole,  the  FtT  dismissed  the
    appellants' appeals.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal which are essentially:

      1. ground (1) - the FtT had impermissibly applied test of necessity in
         relation to  dependency  as  opposed  to  a  requirement  of  real,
         effective or committed support  (see  Rai  v  The  Entry  clearance
         Officer (New Delhi) [2017] EWCA Civ 320).  The FtT  had  apparently
         accepted at �31 that there  was  dependency,  but  then  sought  an
         additional requirement of necessity;

      2. ground (2) - the FtT had impermissibly applied  a  higher  standard
         for adults aged over 30 when comparing the  appellants  with  their
         younger sibling;

      3. ground (3) - the FtT's conclusion that there was no family life was
         irrational, with unchallenged evidence of  cohabitation  until  the
         sponsor's move to the UK, and after that,  regular  visits  by  the
         sponsor to the appellants;  the appellants'   financial  dependency
         on the sponsor, and their lack of work; their reliance upon her for
         accommodation in  her  family  home  in  Nepal;  and  the  accepted
         emotional ties between all three.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted permission on 17th June  2020.
    The grant of permission was not limited in its scope.

The hearing before me

 8. I identified and agreed with the representatives the issues and at  the
    very beginning, Mr Whitwell conceded (in my  view  realistically)  that
    there were material errors in relation to grounds (1) and (3).  He  did
    not make a concession in respect of ground  (2),  as  Annex  K  made  a
    permission distinction on grounds of age but accepted  that  the  other
    two errors made the FtT's finding that that there was  no  family  life
    between the appellants and the sponsor unsafe, and the  FtT's  decision
    should be set aside.

 9. In setting aside the FtT's decision, the representatives agreed that  I
    should preserve the FtT's findings at �30, which are as follows:

         "Before coming to this country in 2002, the appellants were members
         of their sponsor's household.  Since coming here, she has regularly
         returned to  Nepal  to  reunite  with  her  family,  including  the
         appellants.  I am also satisfied that the sponsor  has  financially
         supported the appellants from the benefits  she  receives  in  this
         country, and the pension she gets in Nepal.  She has also  remained
         in close contact with them.  There is, in the  appellant's  bundle,
         sufficient evidence from which to infer these facts."

Disposal and remaking

10. By reference to the paragraph 7.2 of the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement, given the narrowness of  the  issues,  both  representatives
    agreed that it was appropriate that I retain the remaking of the appeal
    in the Upper Tribunal.  Both were initially content that I did so  this
    afternoon based on submissions.  However, an issue arose in consequence
    of a document in the appellant's bundle which was provided to the First-
    tier Tribunal but also provided to me for the purposes of this  appeal.
    That document was  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Moore,
    promulgated on 24th May 2017 in  respect  of  the  appellants'  younger
    sibling Ms Kabita Rana Magar.  At �12 of the decision, at page [137] of
    the appellants' bundle, Judge Moore recorded:

         "The mother gave evidence  that  the  appellant  was  her  youngest
         daughter and the child that she was closest to.  Whilst there  were
         three older children than the appellant, they were all married  and
         lived with their own families.  The appellant was totally dependent
         on the mother ..."

11. In the circumstances, Ms McCarthy indicated to me that she was not in a
    position to address the  issue  of  whether  the  appellants  might  be
    married with their own families, not  least because she  did  not  have
    before her kindred records which would indicate the marital  status  of
    the two appellants, nor did we have before us  the  witness  statements
    that were before Judge Moore.  In the circumstances, she invited me  to
    adjourn the remaking hearing and there was no objection by Mr Whitwell.
     Accordingly and not going beyond the preserved findings, I regarded it
    as appropriate to adjourn the remaking hearing.  I therefore  gave  the
    following directions for remaking:

Directions for Resumed Hearing

12. The remaking hearing will be listed for a hearing to be held via  Skype
    for Business at  Field  House,  lasting  two  hours,  with  a  Nepalese
    interpreter, on the first available date, to enable the Upper  Tribunal
    to substitute a decision to either allow or dismiss the appeals.

13. The appellants shall no later than 4pm,  fourteen  days  prior  to  the
    resumed hearing,  file  with  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
    respondent's  representative  a  consolidated,  indexed  and  paginated
    bundle containing all the documentary evidence on which they intend  to
    rely.  Witness statements in the  bundle  must  be  signed,  dated  and
    contain a declaration of truth which will  stand  as  the  evidence-in-
    chief of the maker who shall be made  available  for  the  purposes  of
    cross-examination and re-examination only.

14. The respondent shall have leave, if so advised,  to  file  any  further
    documentation she intends to rely on and in response to the appellant's
    evidence, provided the same is filed  no  later  than  4pm  seven  days
    before the resumed hearing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside, subject to the preserved findings at �30 of  the  First-tier
Tribunal's decision. The remaking of the appeal  will  be  retained  in  the
Upper Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
