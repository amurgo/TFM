The Ankara Agreement does not entitle Turkish nationals to breach
conditions of their leave.  A Turkish national is not therefore entitled to
base a claimed entitlement to remain in the United Kingdom on acts
amounting to such breaches.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Turkey, appealed to  the  Tribunal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State on 21 August  2007  refusing  to
    vary her leave in order to allow her to remain in the United Kingdom as
    a self-employed business person.  The Immigration Judge  dismissed  the
    appeal.    The   appellant   sought   and   obtained   an   order   for
    reconsideration.  Thus the matter comes before us.

 2.  The  appellant's  claim  is  based  on  the  terms  of  the  EC-Turkey
    Association agreement of  September  12  1963,  usually  known  as  the
    "Ankara Agreement".  The terms of the Agreement have been  the  subject
    of a number of recent decisions of the courts,  including  R  (Tum  and
    Dari) v SSHD, reference C-16/05 in the European Court of Justice and SS
    and others [2006] UKAIT 00074 in this Tribunal.  For  present  purposes
    it is sufficient to say that the purpose of the Ankara Agreement was to
    promote a move towards the abolition  of  restrictions  on  freedom  of
    establishment and freedom to provide services by those  who  wished  to
    move between Turkey and the European community as it was at the date of
    the  agreement.   Article  41.1  of  the  Additional  Protocol  to  the
    Agreement prohibits the introduction of new national restrictions  less
    favourable than those in force at the relevant date.  In  the  case  of
    the United Kingdom, the  relevant  date  is  the  date  of  the  United
    Kingdom's accession to the European community, that is to say 1 January
    1973.  Thus, in a case  to  which  the  Ankara  Agreement  applies,  an
    applicant is entitled to have his claim assessed on the basis of  rules
    which are no more restrictive than those in effect on that  date.   The
    Immigration Rules in effect on that date were HC  509  for  control  on
    entry and HC 510 for control after entry, both of  1972.   Those  rules
    permit "switching", that is to say securing an extension of leave for a
    purpose different from that for which leave to enter the United Kingdom
    was obtained, in a wider range of cases than under the  present  Rules,
    HC 395.  In this respect the present Rules are  more  restrictive  than
    the Rules enforced on 1 January 1973, and it is common  ground  between
    the parties that the appellant is  entitled  to  rely  on  the  earlier
    Rules.

 3. On 13 January 2007 the appellant was admitted  to  the  United  Kingdom
    with leave until 10 July 2007.  The present application was made  under
    cover of a letter dated 11  June  2007,  that  is  to  say  within  the
    currency of her leave.  It was an application for an extension of leave
    as a self-employed person, under the provisions of para 21 of  HC  510,
    of which we set out the relevant  parts  below.   The  application  was
    accompanied by documentation relating to the appellant's business as  a
    cleaner.  The application was refused because the  Secretary  of  State
    was not satisfied that the appellant  would  really  be  self-employed,
    rather than working at the behest of others.  The  Secretary  of  State
    was also not satisfied that the appellant would genuinely  be  devoting
    assets of her own to the business and regarded  other  aspects  of  the
    application as  lacking  in  credibility.   Thus  the  application  was
    refused.

 4. Before the Immigration Judge the appellant attempted to prove that  her
    business was one which entitled her to the benefits of para  21  of  HC
    510.  We need to set out in some detail the  evidence  upon  which  she
    relied.

 5.  The  most  substantial  document  is  a  business  plan  prepared   by
    accountants.  It shows a cash flow forecast for  the  period  of  April
    2007 to March 2008 and projected income of �10,671 for the same period.
     It is fair to say that it is calculated, no doubt with an eye  to  tax
    liability, after deduction of �100 per week for the "overhead  expense"
    of the use of her home as an office.  This is a projection,  therefore,
    of a real income not far short of �300 per week.  There are  bills  for
    advertising,  dated  April  2007,  and  a  letter   relating   to   the
    arrangements of a telephone line for the business,  dated  12  February
    2007.  On 27 March 2007 HM Revenue and Customs wrote to  the  appellant
    indicating that from material available to them they believed that  the
    appellant should be completing tax returns each year.  There is a  form
    submitted to HM Revenue  and  Customs  indicating  that  the  appellant
    started working for herself on 6 April 2007.    On  17  April  2007  HM
    Revenue and Customs wrote to the appellant to  thank  her  for  telling
    them that she had begun self-employment.  On 2 May 2007  the  appellant
    took  out  business  insurance  under  the  name   of   her   business.
    Advertising material issued  in  that  name  shows  that  there  was  a
    subscription to a number which perspective customers could call without
    charge.  There was also  a  certain  amount  of  financial  information
    relating to the currency of the business, including a receipt  for  the
    purchase of cleaning materials on 20 April 2007, the total amount being
    �198.20.  The appellant said  in  oral  evidence  that  she  had  begun
    trading in June 2007 and indicated that her income was, by the date  of
    the hearing, about �180 per week.

 6. The Immigration Judge's conclusion was that the appellant  had  dressed
    up what was really employment as a cleaner to make it look as though it
    were a cleaning business.  In reaching that  conclusion  he  took  into
    account the minimal level of the appellant's expenditure, and the  fact
    that she had been somewhat disingenuous in claiming that her work  came
    mostly from advertisements.  He said:

      "It is right to say that there is nothing in HC 510 which  prevents  a
        very small scale business from coming within the rule but  applying
        the rule as best I can it seems to me that this kind  of  operation
        with its absence of assets and liabilities does not fall within the
        exemption granted for business people."

 7. He therefore dismissed the appeal.

 8. The grounds for reconsideration argue that para 21 of HC 510  does  not
    impose any restriction on the size of the  business.   The  Immigration
    Judge had made certain findings to the effect that  the  appellant  was
    self-employed; he ought to have followed those  through  and  concluded
    that she was entitled to the  benefits  of  para  21.   The  order  for
    reconsideration was on the basis that "there is an issue as to  whether
    the Immigration Judge was permitted to  define  the  type  of  business
    covered by the agreement in such [a way] as to exclude the  appellant's
    activities."

 9. Thus the matter stood when it came before us for  reconsideration.   At
    the beginning of the reconsideration hearing, having noted the  history
    of the case and grounds for reconsideration,  we  pointed  out  to  Mr.
    Morris that there was some doubt whether we ought  to  hear  him.   The
    reason for that question was that,  as  was  evident,  he  proposed  to
    demonstrate  that,  contrary  to  the  Immigration  Judge's  view,  the
    appellant was the proprietor of a real business.  In  other  words,  he
    proposed to rely on her business activities  to  date,  in  combination
    with her proposal, to show the nature of the enterprise  in  which  she
    was engaged.  The appellant had, however, been admitted on  a  visitors
    visa.  That was the visa for which she had apparently applied; she  had
    apparently accepted it in her  passport  and  had  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on the strength of it.   The  visa  is  endorsed  "NO  WORK  OR
    RECOURSE TO PUBLIC FUNDS".  The appellant's case relies to a very great
    extent on a breach on that condition.  On her  own  oral  evidence  she
    began work during the currency  of  her  visitor's  leave;  documentary
    evidence deriving from the appellant shows that for  some  purposes  at
    least her case is that she began earlier than June 2007 indeed, she was
    in contact with the tax authorities in the United Kingdom  relating  to
    her self-employment within a few weeks after her arrival as a  visitor.
    To work in breach of her leave was an offence, and it followed that  in
    seeking to overturn the Immigration Judge's decision Mr.  Morris  would
    be relying upon the appellant's  criminal  acts;  and  would  be  doing
    essentially the same in asserting that  she  could  derive  substantive
    rights under para 21 of HC 510 by working in breach of  the  conditions
    of her leave to enter.

10. To our great surprise, neither party appeared to have  considered  this
    aspect of the case before.  That may be understandable in view  of  the
    fact that the appellant's application was, in terms, for the setting up
    a business in the future and the Secretary of State's  response  to  it
    also looked to the future.  As we have  noted,  however,  the  evidence
    supporting the application and the appeal was not evidence  devoted  to
    the period after the expiry on the  appellant's  leave  as  a  visitor.
    Both parties accepted that the issue needed to be dealt with,  and  the
    reconsideration was adjourned to allow them time to do so.

11. The principal ex turpi causa non oritur actio is well known and was not
    the subject of any specific submission to us.   A  recent  and  helpful
    statement  of  it  is  to  be  found  in  the  Polanski  v  Cond�  Nast
    Publications Ltd [2005] UKHL 10.  The action was a  defamation  action,
    in which  the  claimant  sought  an  order,  which  the  court  in  its
    discretion could make, that he be allowed to give his evidence by video
    link from France.  The intention behind that application  was  that  by
    doing so he would avoid having to come  to  the  United  Kingdom,  from
    where he would be extradited to the United  States  of  America  to  be
    sentenced for unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13 year  old  girl  in
    1977.  If he remained in France, he would not, as a French citizen,  be
    subject to extradition.  The trial judge made the  order  sought.   The
    Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by  the  defendants.   The  House  of
    Lords restored the judge's order.  Lord Nicholls, with whom  Lord  Hope
    and Baroness Hale agreed, noted there were issues of public  policy  as
    well as issues relating to justice between the parties.  He  said  this
    at [16]-[19]:

      "[16] ...Public policy is  based  on  wider  considerations  than  the
             interests of the parties themselves. But this does not mean the
             consequences for the parties are  irrelevant  when  considering
             wider questions of public policy. On the contrary they  may  be
             of relevance and importance...

      [17]  This approach accords with the contemporary trend in  this  area
             of the law. The trend on  matters  of  this  kind  is  to  look
             broadly at the requirements of justice. Whether the use of  the
             court's  procedures  in  a  particular  way  would  bring   the
             administration of justice into disrepute or, as it is sometimes
             put, would be an affront to the public conscience, calls for an
             overall balanced view. This does not mean the courts now  apply
             lower standards in the administration of justice  or  that  the
             public conscience is now  less  easily  affronted.  Rather,  it
             means  the  courts  increasingly   recognise   the   need   for
             proportionality. The sanction must be appropriate having regard
             to all the circumstances. Indeed, an over-rigid  interpretation
             of the requirements of public  policy  in  this  field  may  be
             counter-productive. A legal principle based  on  public  policy
             which ignores the consequences for the parties can itself bring
             the administration of the  law  into  disrepute.  It  may  also
             involve a breach of the parties' rights under article 6 of  the
             European Convention on Human Rights.

      [18]  A similar approach  is  now  adopted  in  cases  where  a  party
             seeking to be heard by the court is in contempt of court.  That
             fact is not of itself a bar to the contemnor being heard....

      [19]  The same type of problem  arises  from  time  to  time  where  a
             claimant, in order to pursue his claim, is forced  to  rely  on
             his own illegal conduct. Then, on grounds of public policy, the
             court may refuse to aid him. This principle was affirmed, in  a
             somewhat rigid form, in Tinsley v Milligan  [1994]  1  AC  340.
             Whether this is the last word  on  this  controversial  subject
             remains to be seen."

12. The reservation implied in the last two sentences of that  passage  may
    possibly derive from  the  fact  that  in  Tinsley  v  Milligan  itself
    Nicholls LJ (as he then was) had proposed  a  more  flexible  approach,
    based always on public conscience, which had not found  favour  in  the
    House of Lords.  That concerned a property claim in which the  claimant
    sought relief in equity.  Lord  Browne-Wilkinson,  giving  the  leading
    speech for the majority, said (at p 153):

      "In my judgement the time has come to decide clearly that the rule  is
        the same whether a plaintiff founds himself on a legal or equitable
        title: he is entitled to recover if he is not forced  to  plead  or
        rely on the illegality: even if it emerges that the title on  which
        he relied was acquired in the course of carrying through an illegal
        transaction" [emphasis added].

13. Lord Jauncey in the course of his speech  agreeing  with  Lord  Browne-
    Wilkinson, at p 143, said:

      "It is well established that a party is not entitled to  rely  on  his
        own fraud or illegality in order to  assist  a  claim  or  rebut  a
        presumption".

14. Lord Goff, in his dissenting speech, with which Lord  Keith  of  Kinkel
    agreed, took a stricter view:  after  a  wide  ranging  review  of  the
    authorities he endorsed in essence the basic  principal  as  stated  by
    Lord Mansfield CJ in Holborn v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp. 341, 343:

      "The principle of public policy is  this;  ex  dolo  malo  non  oritur
        actio.  No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of
        action upon an immoral or illegal act.  If,  from  the  plaintiff's
        own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to  arise  ex
        turpi causa, or  the  transgression  of  a  positive  law  of  this
        country, there the court says he has no right to be  assisted.   It
        is upon that ground the  court  goes;  not  for  the  sake  of  the
        defendant, but because they will not  lend  their  aid  to  such  a
        plaintiff."

15. Thus, although in Tinsley v Milligan the  claimant  succeeded,  because
    the majority of the House of Lords allowed her to base  the  claim  she
    was making on matters other than the illegality,  all  members  of  the
    House endorsed the rule that a claimant cannot erect a claim (in law or
    in equity) on his own wrong.

16. Polanski v Cond� Nast and Tinsley v Milligan are obviously binding upon
    us.  We should, however, even if a more relaxed view were to be  taken,
    have concluded that the rule ought to apply  to  a  case  such  as  the
    present.  First, as between the parties, this is not (unlike the  cases
    to which we have referred) a case in which the  respondent  receives  a
    windfall if the claimant is not allowed to bring her case in a way  she
    chooses.  In the arena of public law, an application of  the  ex  turpi
    causa  principle  to  the  claimant  will   typically   secure   merely
    enforcement of  the  legal  rules  that  have  been  breached,  with  a
    corresponding  intangible  benefit  to  the  public  interest,  but  no
    perceptible financial or other  benefit   to  the  respondent  himself.
    Secondly, as a matter of proportionality, we doubt whether it could  be
    convincingly argued that it was disproportionate to refuse to  allow  a
    person to rely  on  immigration  offences  in  order  to  establish  an
    ordinary immigration benefit, whether the latter is presented under the
    auspices of EU law or otherwise.  Illegality may have  to  be  condoned
    where a claimant relies on human rights or on rights under the  Refugee
    Convention; but the European Court of Justice  has  consistently  ruled
    that rights under EU law cannot be based on illegal conduct, and  there
    is nothing in EU law requiring any general inroads into the  principles
    of English law that we have set out above.   Further,  in  LF  (Turkey)
    [2007] EWCA Civ 1441, the Court of Appeal  refused  to  grant  judicial
    review of a decision refusing leave to enter under the Ankara Agreement
    where the applicant, a failed asylum seeker, had worked  in  breach  of
    the conditions of his temporary admission.

17. Mr. Morris sought to avoid the  consequences  of  the  ex  turpi  causa
    principle  in  three  separate  ways.   First,  he  argued   that   the
    prohibition on the appellant's working,  contained  in  her  visa,  was
    itself unlawful and hence of no effect.  That argument he derived  from
    an examination of HC 509, the Immigration Rules relating to control  on
    entry as they were in force on 1 January 1973 and hence as  they  apply
    to this appeal.  We do not accept his argument.  It is true  that  para
    16 of HC 509 indicates that,  in  granting  a  visa  for  a  visitor  a
    condition prohibiting "employment" may be imposed, but  that  is  given
    merely as an example, and we see no basis for saying that  a  condition
    prohibiting all forms of work was not permitted on 1 January 1973.   In
    any event, the position was that the appellant accepted  and  used  the
    visa, knowing it had a restriction on its face.  There is no suggestion
    that she said to the immigration officer that she  did  not  intend  to
    comply with the condition because in her view it did not apply to  her.
    Nor is there any suggestion that in making her application for  a  visa
    she sought to be considered under HC 509 rather than under the  present
    Immigration Rules.  She applied for and was granted entry clarance as a
    visitor under the rules applicable to visits.  The appellant's case  is
    therefore substantially weaker than in LF, where the conditions imposed
    were not the result of an elective application.

18. Mr Morris' second principal argument was that any breach of  conditions
    by the appellant either had been condoned by the  respondent  or  would
    routinely be condoned; or that the respondent was  obliged  to  condone
    the breach in accordance with EU  law,  or  that  the  breach  was  not
    relevant in the context of HC 510.

19. So far actual condonation of the breach is concerned, Mr. Morris relied
    on the fact that no point was taken on it in  the  letter  of  refusal,
    that the application form for applicants  under  the  Ankara  Agreement
    appears to allow applicants to indicate that  they  have  already  been
    working, and that the IDIs appear to make no  provision  against  those
    who have breached the terms of their leave.  We examine each  of  these
    arguments in turn.  So far as concerns  the  terms  of  the  notice  of
    refusal, as we have  observed,  it  was  addressed  to  an  application
    looking  to  the  future.   It  is  true  to  say  that  some  of   the
    documentation then produced indicated that the  appellant  had  already
    been working in breach of the terms of her  leave,  but  the  decision-
    maker  thought  that  he  had  sufficient  grounds  for  refusing   the
    application in the terms in which it was made.  He had no obligation to
    add other reasons, as the notice of the refusal is not equivalent to  a
    pleading: see RM (Kwok On Tong: HC395  para  320)  India  [2006]  UKAIT
    00039 the parties have clearly had a full opportunity to deal with  the
    issue now.  In any event, in terms of what we make of the  dynamics  of
    litigation, this is not essentially an inter partes point: the question
    is whether we ought to hear an argument in the  form  proposed  on  the
    appellant's behalf, rather than precisely whether it ought to succeed.

20. So far as concerns the application form, it is right to say that  there
    are spaces available for indicating that the applicant's present  leave
    is as  a  visitor,  and  for  present  or  past  employment.   But  the
    application form covers a multitude of different possibilities and  the
    fact that that combination of entries  could  be  made  cannot  in  our
    judgement be regarded indicating a condonation of work  by  those  with
    leave preventing them from working.

21. The issue relating to the IDIs  is  a  little  more  complex.   In  the
    relevant passage of a published policy "In Country Guidance for Persons
    Intending to Establish  themselves  in  Business  under  Turkish  -  EC
    Association Agreement" (undated but after  January  2005)  there  is  a
    lengthy treatment of the "fraud exception" identified in Tum  and  Dari
    and applicable to those who are shown to  have  used  fraud  to  obtain
    entry to the EU state in  which  they  now  propose  to  set  up  their
    business.  We shall have a little more to say about this  exception  in
    due course: but in the present  case  it  is  not  suggested  that  the
    appellant's leave to enter was  obtained  by  fraud.   The  distinction
    between those who did obtain entry by fraud and those who did not do so
    pervades the treatment of the issue in the IDIs.   After  dealing  with
    cases  subject  to  the  fraud  exception,  there  is  a  heading  "non
    fraudulent in-country cases", which indicates  simply  that  those  who
    have lawful  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  ("for  example  as  a
    visitor") without the use of fraud,  and  who  apply  to  remain,  "are
    entitled to have their application considered in  accordance  with  the
    standstill clause". The IDIs continue as follows:

      "Those who have overstayed their leave but  who  have  not  previously
        used fraud to obtain leave also benefit from consideration of their
        case under the  standstill  clause.   All  these  cases  should  be
        considered on the basis of paragraphs 21 and 4 of  the  1973  Rules
        HC510.

      Those applicants who do not meet the requirements of paragraph 21  and
        4 of HC 510 of the 1973  rules  should  be  refused.   The  refusal
        notice should include the reasons why the applicant did not satisfy
        the decision maker that they have been able to establish themselves
        as a self employed business person."

22. There is no overt reference to failure to comply with the conditions of
    leave.  The treatment of overstayers is not such a reference,  for  the
    period for which leave is granted is not one of its conditions:  see  s
    3(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1971).  As we shall see, however, para 4
    of HC 510 does incorporate such reference, and if little else is  clear
    from the IDIs, it would be difficult to assert that they  suggest  that
    decisions should be made  without  reference  to  para  4  of  HC  510.
    Nothing in the IDIs as we read them indicates that a person who  enters
    the United Kingdom without fraud,  but  who  subsequently  breaches  to
    terms of her leave, is entitled  to  have  the  breach  condoned  in  a
    consideration of an application under the Ankara Agreement.

23. Mr. Morris then referred us to the decision of the  European  Court  of
    Justice in Case C-37/98 Savas [2000] ECR I-2927.  He pointed  out  that
    in that case it does not appear to have been regarded as material  that
    the claimant was an overstayer.  With the greatest respect, we  do  not
    think it would be right to build very much on  that.   By  overstaying,
    the appellant in Savas was not failing to comply with  a  condition  of
    his leave.  We do not know whether the point was raised at all, and  if
    so in what context it may have been  raised.   Certainly  there  is  no
    clear passage in the judgement in Savas requiring  a  Member  State  to
    condone immigration offences by a claimant to benefits under the Ankara
    Agreement.

24. Finally in this part of his submissions, Mr. Morris relied on the terms
    of HC 510 itself.  He submitted that a person admitted  to  the  United
    Kingdom as a visitor under the regime of HC 509 and HC 510 was entitled
    to switch to self-employment and that a refusal to allow the  appellant
    to do so amounted to a restriction which post-dated 1 January 1973  and
    was thus unlawful.

25. We need to set out the relevant paragraphs of  HC  510.   They  are  as
    follows:

      "Introductory
      1.     Under  sections  3  and  4  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  an
           Immigration Officer, when admitting  to  the  United  Kingdom  a
           person subject to control under that  Act,  may  give  leave  to
           enter  for  a  limited  period  and,  if  he  does,  may  impose
           conditions restricting employment or occupation  in  the  United
           Kingdom or requiring the person to  register  with  the  police.
           Under section 24 of the Act it is an offence  to  remain  beyond
           the time limit or to fail to comply with such a condition.

      General Considerations
      4.    The succeeding paragraphs set out the main categories of  people
           who may be given limited leave to enter and may  seek  variation
           of their leave, and the principles to  be  followed  in  dealing
           with their applications, or in initiating any variation of their
           leave.  In deciding these matters account is to be taken of  all
           the relevant facts; the fact that the  applicant  satisfies  the
           formal requirements of these rules for stay, or further stay, in
           the proposed capacity is not conclusive in his favour.  It will,
           for example, be relevant whether the  person  has  observed  the
           time limit and conditions subject  to  which  he  was  admitted;
           whether in the light of his character, conduct  or  associations
           it is undesirable to permit him to remain; whether he represents
           a danger to national security; or whether, if allowed to  remain
           for the period for wishes to stay he might not be returnable  to
           another country.

      Businessmen and self-employed persons
      21. People admitted as visitors may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
           Secretary of State to their establishing themselves here for the
           purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own  account
           or  as  partners  in  a  new  or  existing  business.  Any  such
           application is to  be  considered  on  merits.  Permission  will
           depend on a number  of  factors,  including  evidence  that  the
           applicant will be devoting assets of his own  to  the  business,
           proportional to his interest in it, that he will be able to bear
           his share of any liabilities the business may  incur,  and  that
           his share of its profits will be sufficient to support  him  and
           any dependants. The applicant's part in the  business  must  not
           amount to disguised employment, and it must  be  clear  that  he
           will  not  have  to  supplement  his  business   activities   by
           employment for which  a  work  permit  is  required.  Where  the
           applicant intends to join an existing business, audited accounts
           should be produced to establish its financial position, together
           with a written statement of the terms on which he  is  to  enter
           into it; evidence should be sought  that  he  will  be  actively
           concerned with its running and that there is a genuine need  for
           his services and investment. Where the  application  is  granted
           the applicant's stay may be extended for a period of  up  to  12
           months,  on  a  condition  restricting  his  freedom   to   take
           employment. A person admitted as  a  businessman  in  the  first
           instance may be granted an appropriate extension of stay if  the
           conditions set out above are still satisfied at the end  of  the
           period for which he was admitted initially."

26. Certain things are clear.  Paragraph 21 gives no right  to  enter  upon
    self-employment.  It gives a right merely to make an application to the
    Secretary of State in advance of any such activity.  A  visitor  coming
    to the United Kingdom under the regime of HC 509 and HC 510  needs  the
    permission of the Secretary of State before  setting  up  in  business.
    Secondly, in deciding whether such permission is to  be  given,  regard
    will be had to a number of factors, including compliance with the terms
    of existing leave.  Thirdly, it is clear that the rules themselves  are
    constructed with reference to the offences under s 24 of the  1971  Act
    (as it was on 1 January 1973).  So far as the merits of this  case  are
    concerned, the position under HC 510 is that para 1  reminds  her  that
    working in breach of her conditions of leave  is  a  criminal  offence;
    para 4 points out that any breach of the conditions of her  leave  will
    be taken into account against her in  deciding  whether  to  grant  any
    application for any further leave  that  she  may  make;  and  para  21
    indicates that she needs permission before entering into  business  and
    that she has no right to that permission.  So far as concerns  the  way
    in which the issue presents itself to us, however, the position  simply
    is that nothing in HC 510 allows the appellant to rely on  her  setting
    up a business in breach of conditions for the purposes of  establishing
    any right under HC 510 or the Ankara Agreement.

27. Mr. Morris' third principal submission was that the issue we had raised
    was equivalent to the "fraud exception" which, as the decision  of  the
    European Court of Justice in Tum and Dari indicates, has a very limited
    scope.  It was there held that the fact that the claimants had  entered
    the United Kingdom without formality and that their  subsequent  asylum
    claims had been refused did not show that their presence in the  United
    Kingdom was obtained by fraud.  That may be so: but there is a world of
    difference between fraud on the one hand  and  simple  disobedience  to
    rules or breach of conditions on the other.  Further, in Tum  and  Dari
    the appellants' presence in the United Kingdom was  the  background  to
    the claim they made, whereas in the present proceedings the appellant's
    activities in breach of the terms of her leave are the  centrepiece  of
    the argument she seeks to put on reconsideration.   We  do  not  accept
    that the application of the principle ex turpis causa non oritur  actio
    to the present appeal  is  affected  by  any  analogy  with  the  fraud
    exception in Tum and Dari.

28. It follows that we reject all Mr. Morris' arguments on this issue.   In
    attacking the Immigration Judge's conclusion the appellant has to  rely
    on facts which show her to have breached terms of her leave to  remain,
    lawfully imposed upon her and accepted by her.  She cannot  succeed  on
    such a basis.  We are therefore  not  persuaded  that  the  Immigration
    Judge materially erred in law.  His determination dismissing her appeal
    must therefore stand.
