For the Appellant:     Mr R Claire instructed by Moorhouse Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. In a decision promulgated on 6 February 2018 the Upper Tribunal found
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in failing to properly apply
       the 'unduly harsh' test when assessing  the  proportionality  of  the
       appellants removal from the United Kingdom.

    2. Directions were given to enable the  Upper  Tribunal  to  rehear  the
       appeal with a view  to  considering  whether  the  appeal  should  be
       allowed or dismissed.

    3.  The  findings  relating  to  Mr  [G]'s  immigration   history,   his
       conviction, contact with [LL] and  current  family  composition  were
       found to be preserved findings.

Background


    4. Mr [G] was born on the [ ] 1977 and  is  a  citizen  of  Liberia.  He
       arrived in the United Kingdom on 16 April  2002  and  claimed  asylum
       although his application was refused. Mr [G] was granted  exceptional
       leave to remain as a result of circumstances in Liberia at that  time
       and in December 2006 was granted indefinite leave to remain.

    5. On 1 December 2014 Mr [G] was convicted on two counts  of  conspiracy
       to  defraud  and  conceal/disguise/convert/transfer/remove   criminal
       property for which he was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Mr [G]
       was issued with notice of intention to make a deportation  order  and
       on 16 June 2015 a decision was made to refuse his human rights  claim
       which was certified pursuant to section 94B Nationality,  Immigration
       and  Asylum  Act  2002.  The  certification  was  challenged  by   an
       application for  judicial  review  and  in  August  2016  a  referral
       received under the National Referral Mechanism for potential  victims
       of human  trafficking;  although  it  was  not  found  the  appellant
       satisfied the definition of a victim of  human  trafficking.  Further
       representations were made and refused and a further  application  for
       judicial review lodged, although permission to bring judicial  review
       was refused.  The earlier decision was then withdrawn  following  the
       judgment of the Supreme Court in R (on the application  of  Kairie  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42 and a fresh
       decision made which is the subject of this appeal.

    6. The sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge Manley,  dated  9  January
       2015, at the Crown Court in Manchester are in the following terms:

           "JUDGE MANLEY: [OL] and Abraham [G], stand  please.  I  have  to
           sentence you in relation to counts 1, 2 and 5 on this indictment
           to which you pleaded guilty on the day of the trial, albeit I am
           told that those guilty pleas certainly in the case of Mr [G] and
           possibly in the case of Mr [L]  were  indicated  shortly  before
           then and also that there was no  prospect  of  the  trial  being
           reached. For that reason I proposed to allow both  of  you  more
           credit than the usual ten percent that would be afforded to you.

           This case involves the use of compromised cards, credit cards to
           obtain cash in a fairly complex way which did  involve  quite  a
           bit of planning. It was over a period of 13 months. In  relation
           to count 1 it became apparent that a card had been  compromised.
           In all �33,000 in the region of that figure was  taken,  address
           and phone number was changed unknown to the  card  holder  there
           was an attempt to obtain  another  card  in  the  card  holder's
           wife's name. Both of you defendants certainly were in possession
           of those cards shortly after this was done, although there is no
           proof that  you  actually,  either  of  you  took  part  in  the
           compromising  of  the  cards  as  such.  However  I  find   from
           everything I have read and heard that you, Mr [G], were involved
           to a considerable extent and you, Mr [L], to  a  lesser  extent.
           This was a sophisticated and planned fraud by you, Mr [G] over a
           significant period of time and Mr [L], you were seen involved on
           CCTV on occasions involved in fraudulent transactions.

           In relation to count 2, a Nat West account was compromised in  a
           similar way and the total loss to the respective banks  and  the
           relevant banks is just short of �60,000.

           A search of your house, Mr [G], revealed hand written  lists  of
           Co-op  stores  which  is  where  many  of  these   frauds   were
           perpetrated, searches online  for  more  Co-op  stores,  scanned
           identification documents, evidence of different names being used
           by you and I have seen in  the  photographs  clear  evidence  of
           lavish lifestyle and consumer goods within your house, no  doubt
           funded by fraudulent activity.

           Mr [L], when your house was searched some cash was found in your
           car and a small amount of luxury clothing. In interviews each of
           you effectively denied your involvement one way or  another.  In
           relation to count 5 that reflects  the  converting  of  criminal
           property and it has  been  submitted  to  me  that  sentence  in
           relation to that should be concurrent and I agree  and  it  will
           be.

           I have set a timetable for a Proceeds of Crime hearing.  I  have
           considered carefully the guidelines for fraud  which  came  into
           force on 1st October of last year.

           Mr [G], in your case I consider that this is a category 3A case,
           the culpability was high, the vast majority of the money I  find
           whet to you rather than Mr [L], a modest amount went to him  and
           there is no evidence of a lavish lifestyle such as there is  for
           you, Mr [G]. I do  not  find  significant  aggravating  features
           beyond this though.

           Mr [L], I find in your case within the guidelines that this is a
           category 3B, medium culpability with a lower starting point  and
           a lower sentencing range. You are not a prime mover and I do not
           find any significant aggravating features beyond that. You  have
           a previous conviction and you are technically  in  breach  of  a
           conditional discharge but I do not propose that  any  action  is
           taken about that.

           As I have said already I give you both credit  for  your  guilty
           pleas higher than that of 10 percent. Mr [G], you are clearly an
           educated man who has lived and worked legitimately in the  past,
           you have no significant previous  convictions  recorded  against
           you and Mr [L], that is the case really for you as  well  and  I
           have seen and observed this morning that no doubt you both  have
           found and are finding this experience distressing and shameful.

           Mr [G], in all the circumstances I find this case involving your
           part in it is so serious in all the circumstances  that  only  a
           sentence of immediate custody  can  be  justified.  The  correct
           starting point in my view taking into account  all  matters  and
           the amount of money that the starting  point  refers  to  within
           that category is one of 30 months imprisonment.  I  reduce  that
           for your guilty plea to one of two  years  imprisonment  but  it
           must  be  immediate.  In  relation  to  count   2,   two   years
           imprisonment concurrent. In  relation  to  count  5,  two  years
           imprisonment concurrent. I total of two years imprisonment."

    7. The Judge accepts  later  on  in  the  sentencing  exercise  that  in
       relation to count 5 12 months was  the  correct  starting  point  and
       reduced that sentence to 10 months concurrent; although this  had  no
       impact upon the overall length of sentence of two years imprisonment.



    8. The appellant has provided for the purposes of the resumed hearing an
       up-to-date bundle  containing  updated  witness  statements  for  the
       appellant, [FB], [AB], and letters from [LL] and  [CL]  (who  is  the
       mother of [LL]), and a  letter  to  Mr  [G]  from  HMRC  regarding  a
       Confiscation Order.

    9. Although this evidence was filed in breach of specific directions  of
       the Upper Tribunal relating to when such evidence  should  have  been
       filed and served Mr Bates was  happy  for  the  new  bundle  and  two
       additional statements to be admitted.

   10. Mr Claire also advised the Upper Tribunal that the  written  evidence
       of [CL] was no longer being relied upon as she  was  not  willing  to
       support the appellant in his appeal. Those  witness  statements  were
       therefore withdrawn.

   11. In his statement, the appellant refers to his immigration history and
       the fact that he is married with a child but also is the father of  a
       child from a previous relationship, [LL].  Mr  [G]  married  [FB]  in
       October 2012 having previously cohabited since 2009.  They  have  one
       child, a boy, born on [ ] 2014 and live together as  a  family  unit.
       The child is a British citizen.

   12. The child [LL], born on [ ] 2004, is also a British citizen.  At  [6]
       of his witness statement the appellant states that [LL]'s mother  has
       been diagnosed with cancer.

   13. Since coming to the United Kingdom Mr [G] has worked and studied  and
       attended courses in the UK including Accountancy and Finance  at  the
       Manchester Metropolitan University.

   14. In relation to his offending for which he was  convicted  above,  and
       other offences committed since arriving in the United Kingdom, Mr [G]
       states he is sorry and accepts  full  responsibility  for  committing
       those offences. He claims that  he  will  never  commit  any  further
       offences in the UK.

   15. Mr [G] refers to a number of courses undertaken whilst in  prison  to
       address his offending and to acquire skills to assist in enabling him
       to secure work in the future.

   16. Mr [G] claims he is not a danger to the  public  as  claimed  by  the
       respondent. Mr [G] states he has strong family ties in the  UK  which
       will support him in his dealings in the future. Mr [G] refers to  the
       fact he has been married for several years, that his wife is British,
       and that both his children are also British.

   17. Mr [G] submits that if deported his children  will  miss  growing  up
       with their father and his wife will miss the support he is  currently
       giving her as her husband, meaning she will be left to bring up their
       son as a single parent.

   18. Mr [G] submits his wife and children have never been to  Liberia  and
       do not speak the language and that if deported to Liberia he will not
       be able to come back to the United Kingdom; meaning the  family  life
       he has will break up.

   19. Mr  [G]  states  he  enjoys  several  activities  with  his  children
       including taking them to the park, GP appointments, school,  birthday
       parties and other children's activities. Mr [G] claims  the  children
       will miss those activities if  he  is  deported  which  will  have  a
       serious negative impact upon them.

   20. Mr [G] claims that if deported to Liberia he will have no family home
       to return to or close relatives and will be destitute as he could not
       cope financially. Liberia has no benefit system like the UK to enable
       support to be provided through benefits which he claims will mean  he
       will be living in the street and exposed to immense  danger.  Mr  [G]
       claims he has lost all ties to Liberia as he has been living  in  the
       UK for over 15 years and that all his close family  and  friends  are
       settled in the UK.

   21. Mr [G] submits deporting him to Liberia will be unduly harsh  on  his
       wife, his two sons, his father-in-law, mother-in-law, and his  wife's
       extended family. His wife was born and raised in  Manchester  as  are
       his sons and have lived in the UK all their lives. Mr [G]'s  wife  is
       in full-time employment which means he is the one  that  takes  their
       son to school and brings him home.

   22. Mr [G] states that [LL]'s mother has currently finished  one  session
       of chemotherapy and was scheduled to go  for  further  treatment  and
       that her condition is affecting [LL] who is constantly  worried  that
       something may happen to his mother.

   23. In cross-examination, Mr [G] was asked why there was  no  documentary
       evidence provided in relation to [LL]'s mother's  medical  condition.
       He claimed papers had been emailed to his solicitor in January 2018.

   24. Mr [G] was asked what family [LL]'s mother has in the United  Kingdom
       to which he  stated  her  mother  and  father  and  brother.  Mr  [G]
       confirmed that she receives assistance from the  family.  When  asked
       whether there were concerns as to whether [LL] was being well  looked
       after by his mother Mr [G] stated that he could look after himself as
       his mother was ill and that she would pass out and needed help.

   25. Mr [G] stated [LL] did finding things difficult due to  his  mother's
       condition but received no counselling to assist and managed to do his
       schoolwork. Mr [G] confirmed both children are reasonably healthy. Mr
       [G] confirmed the information in his wife's  witness  statement  that
       all her family are in the United Kingdom and confirmed they supported
       her when he was in prison; although as soon as he came out  he  would
       help. Mr [G] submitted his wife needed help to look after their child
       as she works. He now does every single day. Mr [G] claimed his wife's
       father is too ill to provide the care required.

   26. Mr [G] was asked,  as  his  wife's  father  had  provided  a  witness
       statement, why there was no evidence of any medical condition from  a
       hospital. It  appeared  that  no  such  evidence  had  been  provided
       although a letter was handed up at the hearing that should have  been
       previously disclosed. Mr Bates did not object to the same  coming  in
       which referred to Mr [G]s  father-in-law  having  suffered  a  stroke
       previously.

   27. The evidence from Mr [G]'s father-in-law states he suffered a  stroke
       in September 2017 for which he was  initially  hospitalised  although
       has now returned home  but  is  unable  to  drive,  having  failed  a
       cognitive driving screening test, as a result of which  Mr  [G]'s  is
       said to have been key in helping him get to his medical  appointments
       etc.

   28. Mr [G] confirmed his father-in-law has six other  family  members  in
       the United Kingdom making  that  seven  children  in  total.  Mr  [G]
       claimed that the other family members hardly came to see his  father-
       in-law in hospital and that his wife works and helps her father.

   29. Mr [G]'s wife works Monday to Friday. Mr [G] confirmed in  answer  to
       questions put in re-examination that he is able to help his father-in-
       law on a daily basis.

   30. There was no further cross examination by Mr Bates in relation to the
       other written evidence provided, enabling the tribunal to proceed  to
       receive submissions from the advocates.

Submissions


   31. On behalf the Secretary's State Mr Bates relied on  the  reasons  for
       deportation  letter  and  the  preserved  findings  identified,   and
       accepted that the sole issue was whether the appellant's removal from
       the United Kingdom would breach the 'unduly harsh' test.

   32. Mr Bates accepted that the children are British and  submitted  there
       was no evidence the children would not be adequately cared for in the
       absence of the appellant.

   33. The appellant, as recognised by the First-tier Tribunal  at  [33]  of
       that earlier decision, is a well-educated individual  with  a  degree
       and qualification in accountancy. Prior to his  imprisonment  Mr  [G]
       worked  as  a  self-employed  assistant  accountant  earning  between
       �25,000 and �30,000 per year and that although, undoubtedly, he would
       face difficulties re-establishing himself in Liberia he is  a  highly
       educated individual who would have reasonable prospects of being able
       to do so especially in view of  his  professional  qualification  and
       experience. It was pleaded by Mr Bates this indicates that Mr [G]  is
       well placed with good employment prospects.

   34. It was further submitted that Mr [G]'s wife works full-time  and  has
       done so despite the need to provide care for her own father. Mr [G]'s
       wife also says that she hopes to obtain an accountancy  qualification
       and refers in her evidence to his absence when he was in  prison  and
       the consequences of that imprisonment.

   35. No independent social workers report has been produced regarding  the
       impact of the  appellants  removal  on  the  children  and  Mr  Bates
       submitted it was pure speculation on the appellant's  behalf  of  the
       impact upon [LL] should the concerns regarding his mother  [CL]  come
       to pass.

   36. Mr Bates submitted the appellant's wife has significant ties  in  the
       United Kingdom and  refers  to  the  witness  statements  and  family
       support she received when the appellant was in prison, which  remains
       available.

   37. It was submitted there was no evidence of serious harm  being  caused
       to the children.

   38. The appellant's wife is a well-educated individual.

   39. Mr Bates submitted that the appellant was  directly  responsible  for
       the offences, as recorded in the sentencing remarks, and there  is  a
       clear basis for his deportation, especially to deter offences by  the
       appellant and other individuals.

   40. Mr Bates noted the fact that since the date of offending there was no
       evidence of the appellant reoffending and the appellant's claim  this
       reduced the justification for his deportation.

   41. Mr Bates sought to rely upon the decision of  the  Supreme  Court  in
       Hesham Ali in which there is reference to section  32(4)  of  the  UK
       Borders Act 2007 which states  that  the  deportation  of  a  foreign
       criminal is conducive to the public good. It was also submitted  that
       the Supreme Court recognised the  deportation  of  foreign  offenders
       sends out a strong message to other offenders. In this  case  it  was
       submitted the length of sentence  gives  rise  to  the  liability  to
       deportation and the public interest in Mr [G]'s removal.

   42. In relation to the question of whether  Mr  [G]'s  removal  from  the
       United Kingdom would be 'unduly harsh'; Mr Bates submitted there  was
       no suggestion supported by evidence that his wife could not adapt  if
       her husband is removed. Mr Bates accepted this  would  not  be  their
       choice but submitted this is a consequence of Mr [G]'s offending  and
       would not lead to unduly harsh consequences.

   43. It was submitted there was no evidence  from  an  independent  source
       such as a school to show unduly harsh consequences for the children

   44. In relation to [LL], it is a preserved finding that his mother [CL]'s
       prognosis is not known. There is no witness statement from her making
       the only available information that in the written documents and from
       the appellant's own evidence. [CL] has family in the  United  Kingdom
       and there was no evidence that [LL] is not being adequately cared for
       now or would not be in the future. Mr Bates referred to  a  reference
       in the evidence to [CL] having a boyfriend. It was submitted Mr [G]'s
       evidence regarding available support is  pure  speculation  and  that
       [CL], like Mr [G]'s wife, has had to manage her own life and  provide
       care in the past including when  Mr  [G]  was  in  prison.  Mr  Bates
       submitted there is nothing to  show  that  the  impact  of  Mr  [G]'s
       removal upon [LL] would be unduly harsh.

   45. Mr Bates accepted Mr [G]'s family will be split as a  consequence  of
       the deportation. Reference was made to sections 117 B and  C  of  the
       2002 Act.

   46. It was submitted Mr [G] must have been aware of the consequences  for
       him of undertaking serious  criminal  offending  upon  not  only  his
       position but also the lives of others in the United Kingdom.

   47. Mr Bates submitted the impact upon the family  of  removal  had  been
       shown to be proportionate taking  into  account  the  nature  of  the
       criminal conviction.

   48. Mr Bates accepted Mr [G] wanted to stay in  the  United  Kingdom  but
       submitted there is a high burden in  light  of  his  criminality  and
       automatic deportation provisions. It was submitted  Mr  [G]  had  not
       provided  enough   evidence   to   show   that   the   decision   was
       disproportionate.

   49. In relation to Mr [G]'s father-in-law, the evidence  showed  that  he
       had recovered after having had  a  stroke  and  he  receives  ongoing
       physiotherapy and help from the  NHS.   It  was  submitted  that  his
       condition was not sufficient to raise the  family  and  private  life
       aspects of this appeal above the required threshold  for  Mr  [G]  to
       succeed.

   50. On behalf Mr [G]; Mr Claire referred to  the  preserved  findings  in
       relation to relationships and the issue of help within the family.

   51. Mr Claire argued the public interest was not as strong in  this  case
       as in other cases and referred to the Proceeds of Crime hearing which
       referred to the recovery of a sum less than that referred to  in  the
       sentencing remarks; although it was accepted  that  such  proceedings
       would not necessarily mean the recovery of all the monies secured  by
       Mr [G] through his acts of deception. It was  submitted  the  Judge's
       sentencing remarks are an important element.

   52. Mr Claire referred to Mr [G]'s length  of  residence  in  the  United
       Kingdom and other relevant family matters and submitted it  was  just
       as  relevant  to  consider  whether  the  public  interest   required
       deportation in a situation where this was not a violent offence or an
       offence of a sexual nature.

   53. It was submitted Mr [G] pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and has served
       the same.

   54. Mr Claire submitted separating a mother and father from  a  child  is
       unduly harsh, but accepted that more  was  required  as  otherwise  a
       parent with a child could never be deported. Mr Claire  submitted  in
       this case that additional element relates to  [LL]  whose  mother  is
       unwell. It is a preserved finding that  [CL]  is  unwell.  Mr  Claire
       refers to a letter from [LL] submitted in the evidence which  is  set
       out in full below. Mr Claire submits it will be unduly harsh for  the
       child to be separated from  his  father  in  light  of  his  mother's
       condition.

   55. Mr Claire submitted that [CL] requires daily support from her  mother
       and partner and that the quality of this means that  [LL]  should  be
       entitled to remain with his father in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  was
       submitted that there will be adverse consequences  for  [LL]  if  his
       father is removed.  It was submitted  that  the  situation  for  [LL]
       could get worse on  a  daily  basis  as  a  result  of  his  mother's
       condition.

   56. Mr Claire submitted the Mr [G] had been with his partner  since  2009
       and that Mr [G] has a strong relationship with his  partner.  It  was
       submitted the evidence from the partner is important especially  that
       relating to help  available  within  her  own  family  which  it  was
       submitted was relevant to the assessment of  whether  deportation  is
       unduly harsh.

   57. Mr Claire did not accept Mr Bates submission that Mr [G]'s status  is
       precarious due to his committing criminal  offences  as  the  fact  a
       person has committed criminal  offences  is  not  enough  to  make  a
       person's status precarious if it was not already such.

   58. It was submitted Mr [G] presents no risk to the public, that  he  has
       not committed violent or sexual offence, and that  although  this  is
       not a victimless offence a victim would be more greatly  affected  if
       this was an offence of violence or of  a  sexual  nature.  Mr  Claire
       submitted the decision to deport is unduly harsh.

Discussion


   59. In MM (Uganda) and [2016] EWCA Civ 450 it was held  that  the  phrase
       'unduly harsh' plainly meant the same in section 117C(5) of the  2002
       Act as it did in paragraph 399 of the Immigration Rules.  It  was  an
       ordinary English expression coloured  by  its  context.  The  context
       invited emphasis on two factors: first, the public  interest  in  the
       removal  of  foreign  criminals  and,  secondly,  the  need   for   a
       proportionate assessment of any interference with Article  8  rights.
       The public interest factor was expressly  vouched  by  Parliament  in
       section 117C(1). Section 117C(2) provided that the more  serious  the
       offence committed, the greater the public  interest  in  deportation.
       That steered the tribunals and  the  court  towards  a  proportionate
       assessment  of  the  criminal's  deportation  in  any   given   case.
       Accordingly, the more pressing the public interest  in  his  removal,
       the harder it would be to show  that  the  effect  on  his  child  or
       partner would be unduly harsh. Any other approach would dislocate the
       'unduly harsh' provisions from their context such that  the  question
       of undue hardship would be decided wholly without regard to the force
       of the public interest in deportation. In such a case 'unduly'  would
       be mistaken for 'excessive', which imported a  different  idea.  What
       was due or undue depended on all the circumstances,  not  merely  the
       impact on the child or partner in  the  given  case.  The  expression
       'unduly harsh' in  section  117C(5)  and  paragraph  399(a)  and  (b)
       required  consideration  of  all  the  circumstances,  including  the
       criminal's immigration and criminal history. MAB was wrongly  decided
       (paras 22 - 26).

   60. The submissions made by Mr Claire  relating  to  the  nature  of  the
       appellant's offending and current lack  of  reoffending  are  factors
       that are taken into account in any proceedings  of  this  nature  but
       must be considered in light of existing jurisprudence in relation  to
       which no submissions were made. In Gurung v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  62
       the Court of Appeal,  when  overturning  a  Presidential  Upper  Tier
       panel, said that the absence of a risk of reoffending, though plainly
       important, is not the "ultimate aim" of the  deportation  regime.  We
       are troubled, too, by the proposition  in  paragraph  40(iii)  (cited
       above) that the nature and seriousness  of  the  offence  do  not  by
       themselves justify interference with family and private life  without
       prospective regard to the public interest. Although  Mr  Bourne  does
       not seek to characterise this as an error of law, he is right, in our
       view, to suggest that it misplaces the emphasis. The Borders  Act  by
       s.32 decides that the nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence,  as
       measured by the sentence, do by themselves justify deportation unless
       an exception recognised by the Act itself applies.

   61. In Suckoo [2016] EWCA Civ 39 it  was  held  that  the  Judge  wrongly
       embarked on an analysis of the Claimant's  offending  which  was  not
       open to him. In general, the facts of  the  conviction  and  sentence
       would be sufficient.  Matters  of  mitigation  would  be  taken  into
       account at the sentencing hearing.

   62. In GO (Nigeria) v SSHD 2007 EWCA Civ 1163 the Court  of  Appeal  said
       that the Immigration Judge was wrong in a conducive deport appeal  to
       base her decision on a distinction between offences of violence,  sex
       etc "which strike at the heart  of  the  community"  and  "antisocial
       offences causing inconvenience and financial loss".  The  Court  said
       that offences of dishonesty and loss of property range in seriousness
       and the length of sentence is an indicator.  Here,  the  sentence  of
       three  and  a  half  years  (on  a  conducive  deport   pre-automatic
       deportation) should have indicated to the  judge  that  the  offences
       were at the upper end of the range.

   63. In NE-A (Nigeria) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 239 it was held  that  there
       was no inconsistency between the analysis in Rhuppiah  and  what  was
       said in Hesham Ali.  The focus in Hesham Ali was on the rules and  it
       had not been necessary to consider the provisions of s117.   Part  5A
       of the 2002 Act was primary legislation  directed  to  tribunals  and
       governing their decision making.  Sections 117A to D were intended to
       provide for a structured approach to the  application  of  Article  8
       which produced in all cases a final result compatible with Article 8.
        Section 117B(6) was more than a statement of policy to which  regard
       was to be had as a relevant consideration.   Parliament's  assessment
       that "the public interest requires deportation unless there are  very
       compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above   those   described   in
       Exceptions 1 and 2" was one to which the tribunal was bound by law to
       give effect.  There was no room for any  additional  element  in  the
       proportionality balance under Article 8.   Observations  in  Akinyemi
       were not to the contrary.

   64. Section 117C(5) provides that Exception 2 applies where a person  has
       a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a
       genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,
       and the effect of that person's deportation on the partner  or  child
       would be unduly harsh. This is the accepted test in this appeal.

   65. It is not disputed that the appellant has family and private life and
       is in a genuine relationship with his wife in the United Kingdom  and
       in a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his  son  with
       whom he lives and has a strong relationship with [LL]  with  whom  he
       does not live but with whom he has contact.

   66. It is not disputed that  the  effect  of  deportation  would  be  the
       appellant's wife remaining in the United Kingdom with their  son.  It
       is accepted that removing Mr [G] from the United Kingdom would result
       in upset and distress to  this  family  unit  and  also  a  need  for
       substantial reassessment of their day-to-day arrangements.  Mr  [G]'s
       wife works and is the main breadwinner for the family. It is not made
       out that Mr [G]'s wife would not be able to  continue  working  as  a
       single parent as indeed a considerable number of single mothers do in
       the United Kingdom. It is not made out that there will be no help  or
       assistance from other family members in the United Kingdom  for  this
       family.

   67. In relation to Mr [G]'s  wife's  father,  his  father-in-law,  it  is
       accepted this individual suffered a stroke but the  evidence  clearly
       shows that he is in the stages of recovery albeit not fully recovered
       as he is not yet able to resume driving. It is not disputed  that  Mr
       [G] provide some assistance to his father-in-law as he is able to, in
       light of his current situation. It is not made out, however, that  if
       Mr [G] was removed from the United Kingdom there would not  be  other
       available support for his  father-in-law  either  from  other  family
       members or within  the  NHS.  It  is  accepted  that  the  burden  of
       providing part of such care may fall upon Mr [G]'s wife but it is not
       established that the impact of the same, even cumulatively with other
       responsibilities, is such to make the impact unduly harsh. Mr [G] was
       imprisoned and this is clearly an extended and resilient  family  who
       were able to cope in his absence previously.

   68. In relation to Mr [G]'s  own  connections  and  contacts  within  the
       United Kingdom; these appear to focus upon this  existing  family  as
       referred to in the evidence and submissions above  and  private  life
       outside the family.

   69. Looking at the best interests of the children, it  is  not  made  out
       there  will  be  any  change  to  the  practical   arrangements   for
       maintaining the care of both Mr [G]'s son and [LL]. Both will  remain
       in their current households. It is accepted  there  may  be  distress
       with Mr [G]'s removed  but,  as  Mr  Bates  submitted,  there  is  no
       evidence available in relation to the impact of Mr [G]'s removal upon
       the children sufficient to establish that the  same  will  be  unduly
       harsh. It is accepted the best interests of the children will  be  to
       remain  with  both  parents,  if  possible,  but  that  is  not   the
       determinative factor.

   70. It is accepted that contact will have to change from  direct  contact
       to indirect contact which will have an impact upon Mr [G]'s son,  who
       Mr [G] currently takes to school and lives with, and [LL] who  enjoys
       contact with his father.

   71. With the exception of  the  position  of  [LL]'s  mother,  this  case
       mirrors many other deportation cases where family units are broken up
       and arrangements have to be changed as a  result  of  a  decision  to
       deport.

   72. It is accepted that [LL]'s mother, [CL], is ill. It is accepted  that
       [CL] had good reasons for not supporting Mr [G]  in  his  appeal  and
       withdrawing the evidence previously given.

   73. There is reference in the submissions from  Mr  Claire  to  a  letter
       written by [LL] which is in the following terms:

           "Dear Judge

           My name is [LL] and I am writing this letter because of  my  dad
           Abraham [G]

           my dad has changed and is a good person  and  comes  to  see  me
           every week and helps me with my homework.

           And he has also realised his mistakes and  I  believe  that  you
           will get him stay with me because my mom  is  not  well  at  the
           minute. My mom has just finished her chemotherapy treatment  and
           she has bad news that she has got to go through  it  again.  She
           has lost her hair and is in a lot of pain. I am praying  for  my
           mum to get better, and if something should happen to my mum  and
           my dad is not here then I have got no one and I think that would
           be bad on me when it is not my  fault,  please  give  my  dad  a
           second chance.

           Yours sincerely

           Etc"

   74. There are some aspects of the letter that one questions whether  [LL]
       fully understands or is  qualified  to  assess  whether  Mr  [G]  has
       changed and is a good person, but  it  is  accepted  this  letter  is
       written by [LL] expressing what he genuinely  feels  namely  that  he
       would like his dad to stay in the  United  Kingdom  and  that  he  is
       concerned about his mum's position.

   75. The fact [CL] has undergone chemotherapy, which appears initially not
       to have been successful, and that she requires a  further  course  of
       chemotherapy is a relevant factor but not one that indicates that the
       prognosis for [CL] is only bleak. Many cancer sufferers  may  require
       one or more courses of chemotherapy  or  a  change  of  treatment  if
       initial courses of chemotherapy do not prove to  be  successful.  The
       hope from everybody in this appeal is that the medical services  will
       be able to successfully treat [CL]. If the situation changes for  the
       worst and [CL] does not survive, and Mr [G] has grounds for doing so,
       he will be able to apply for the revocation of the deportation order.

   76.  There  was  no  evidence   to   show   that,   notwithstanding   the
       understandable concerns and worries of [LL],  the  standard  of  care
       being afforded to him is insufficient to meet his needs. There is  no
       detailed medical evidence regarding [CL]'s condition or  ability  and
       the evidence clearly shows there is a very strong network of  support
       around [CL]; no doubt meeting not  only  her  requirements  but  also
       those of [LL]. Although Mr [G] referred to [CL]  passing  out  it  is
       also the case that [CL] has a boyfriend and other support.

   77. It is known that cancer sufferers have extensive support from the NHS
       and other cancer support groups such as Macmillan and it is not known
       whether approaches have been made to such organisations who work  not
       only with cancer sufferers but also family members and who,  in  this
       situation, will be able to provide extensive support for  [LL].   The
       reality, upon the basis of  the  evidence  made  available,  is  that
       [CL]'s future is no more than  speculation  at  this  time.  Survival
       rates published by Cancer UK show the considerable progress that  has
       been made in relation to the survival rates for individual cancers.

   78. Whilst [LL] expresses what is accepted as  a  genuine  wish  for  his
       father to remain in the United Kingdom it is not  made  out  at  this
       stage of [CL]'s treatment that however reassuring Mr  [G]'s  presence
       may be, the impact of his removal on the overall situation is such to
       elevate the consequences  of  the  same  to  a  sufficient  level  to
       establish that for this reason the removal of Mr [G]  would  have  an
       unduly harsh effect upon [LL]. It is accepted that the effect will be
       harsh. There was no evidence that support could not  be  provided  to
       [LL] in such circumstances to  enable  him  to  understand  what  has
       occurred and why.

   79. I do not find it made out that there is any reason why Mr [G]  should
       be destitute  on  return  to  Liberia.  As  noted,  he  is  a  bright
       individual with  qualifications.  It  is  accepted  that  it  may  be
       difficult for him to re-establish himself in  Liberia  after  such  a
       period of absence but it was not made out that any  problems  he  may
       face could not be overcome or that he could not re-establish  himself
       back in his home state which is not now facing  the  same  conditions
       previously faced by Mr [G] when he left  Liberia  to  travel  to  the
       United Kingdom.

   80. As noted, in the case law above the question of whether harshness  is
       "undue" requires an assessment of all aspects of this case  including
       the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals.  Mr  [G]
       has been  convicted  of  being  the  mastermind  in  a  sophisticated
       financial fraud involving a considerable sum of money,  approximately
       �60,000, been defrauded from credit card companies by the use  of  an
       identity belonging to a 3rd party for which Mr [G] had no permission.
       The reality of such acts is that losses suffered  by  card  providers
       has a direct impact on profit which results in increased charges  for
       those not engaged in fraud who wish to use such facilities. Estimates
       of the cost of financial fraud to the United Kingdom can be  as  high
       as �193 billion per  annum.  Whilst  it  is  accepted  this  includes
       corporate  fraud  this  shows  the  extent  of  the  impact  of  such
       criminality and highlights  the  very  strong  deterrent  element  in
       deporting  those  from  the  United  Kingdom  who  engage   in   such
       activities.

   81. In relation to the disagreement between the advocates  concerning  Mr
       [G]'s status and whether it is 'precarious ',  the  reference  by  Mr
       Bates was to the fact that Mr [G] by committing criminal offences has
       made his right to remain in the  United  Kingdom  precarious  as  the
       Secretary of State is required by statute to make an  order  for  his
       deportation from the  United  Kingdom  as  a  result  of  the  prison
       sentence he received.

   82. In relation to the strength to be given to the  public  interest,  in
       Hesham Ali (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 Lord Reed noted  that  "cases
       falling within the scope of section 32 of the 2007 Act in  which  the
       public interest  in  deportation  is  outweighed,  other  than  those
       specified in the new rules themselves, are likely to be a very  small
       minority  (particularly  in  non-settled  cases).   They   need   not
       necessarily involve any circumstance  which  is  exceptional  in  the
       sense of being extraordinary (as counsel for the Secretary  of  State
       accepted, consistently with Huang [2007] 2 AC 167, para 20), but they
       can be said to involve "exceptional circumstances" in the sense  that
       they involve a departure from the general rule".

   83. Mr [G] fails to make out that this is a case in which it can be found
       that the facts warrant departure  from  the  general  rule  that  his
       deportation from the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the harsh impact
       upon some family members of the same, is  warranted.  The  impact  of
       deportation has not been shown to be unduly harsh.

Decision

   84. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.

   Anonymity.

   85. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson

Dated the 9 May 2018
