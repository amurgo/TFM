Representation:

For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr M Smart (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Freer promulgated on 12th February 2014, following a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 7th February 2014.  In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal of Mrs  Baljit  Kaur,  and  her  dependent
    husband, Mr Manuj Kumar.  The Respondent Secretary  of  State,  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are wife and husband.  Both are citizens of India.   The
    first Appellant (who is  the  principal  Appellant,  and  who  will  be
    referred to as "the Appellant" hereafter) was born on 6th January 1986.
     Her husband was born  on  23rd  September  1984.   The  Appellant  was
    granted leave to enter as a student on 19th July 2012 until  23rd  June
    2013, with conditions.  On 7th June 2013, she applied for  a  variation
    of leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the points-based  system.   Her  application,  and  that  of  her
    dependent  husband,  were  both  refused  on  19th  July  2013  by  the
    Respondent  Secretary  of  State.   The  basis  was  that  there   were
    insufficient levels of funds as required over the specified consecutive
    28 day period for  a  Tier  4  Migrant.   The  Appellant  had  to  show
    available funds of at least �2,500, excluding the  course  fees,  which
    were fully paid.  The Respondent Secretary of State took the view  that
    at the closing date of the bank statements, which were 10th  May  2013,
    she needed to show evidence of having the specified sum of  �2,500  for
    28 days from 13th April to 10th May.  However, her balance between 13th
    to 17th April was no more than �2,115 and her balance between 18th  and
    19th April was no more than �2,301.  Accordingly she could not succeed.

 3. It was the Appellant's case, however, that she  could  succeed  because
    she had provided evidence of two separate bank accounts up to 29th  May
    2013 and she maintains that she did have the requisite �2,500 in them.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge applied Section  85A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 which states at subparagraph 3 that evidence under  the
    Immigration Rules is restricted to the evidence that was  submitted  in
    support of the application (see determination at  paragraph  11).   The
    judge made a finding of fact that,

         "what is omitted from those papers [which  were  submitted  at  the
         time of the application] is the crucial  statement,  now  supplied,
         with the appeal bundle, for the joint bank statement, which I  find
         shows no changes in the balance of �1,895 from 10th May 2013  until
         19th August, as there were no further  transactions  between  those
         two dates.  This proves that she had �1,895 in her account for  the
         rest of May 2013 ..." (paragraph 24).

 5. The judge also held  that  there  was  no  scope  for  the  "evidential
    flexibility rule" to be applied in her case (paragraph 34).

 6. However, the judge then went on to hold that, given that the Respondent
    had been supplied at the outset with two accounts of two different  but
    overlapping periods,

         "there is no fair or rational reason shown, ... why the  Respondent
         should simply assume that this good balance figure on  the  earlier
         statement had fallen or  indeed  changed  at  all.   Arguably,  the
         Respondent under the relevant version of the evidential flexibility
         policy, should have contacted the Appellant for a statement  taking
         the financial evidence up to the end of May  so  as  to  match  the
         other statements presented at the time" (paragraph 36).

    The appeal was therefore allowed on the basis  that  the  post-decision
    bank  statements  could  now  be  admitted  (paragraph  38).   In   the
    alternative, the judge also held that  on  the  basis  of  "common  law
    fairness" the appeal could succeed (paragraph 40).

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge had misdirected himself
    because it was well-established that there  is  no  general  dispensing
    power in Article 8 where a person could not benefit from the Rules,  so
    that such a person could not benefit then on Article 8  grounds.   This
    is clear from the case of Patel in the Supreme Court (see Patel  [2013]
    UKSC 72) where the court had held that,

         "such considerations do not by themselves provide Grounds of Appeal
         under Article 8, which is concerned with private  or  family  life,
         not education as such. The opportunity for a promising  student  to
         complete his course in this country, however desirable  in  general
         terms, is not in itself a right protected under Article 8".

 8. The Patel judgements had been followed by the Tribunal in Nasim  [2014]
    UKUT 00025 where the Tribunal had held that "a  person's  human  rights
    are not enhanced by ... not relying on public funds.

 9. The only significance of such matters in cases concerning  proposed  or
    hypothetical removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  is  to  preclude  the
    Secretary of State from pointing  to  any  public  interest  justifying
    removal ...".

10. On 3rd March 2014 permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal  on
    the basis that Article 8 had been used as a "general dispensing  power,
    contrary to the Supreme Court judgments in Patel, by the judge".

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me, there was no appearance by anyone  on  behalf
    of the Appellant.  Previously, I also note, there was no appearance, as
    at appeal before the judge  below  was  also  determined  as  a  "paper
    hearing" with no-one in attendance.  Mr Smart, appearing on  behalf  of
    the Respondent Secretary of State, placed reliance  upon  the  case  of
    Alam [2011] UKUT 00421 (although this  had  not  been  pleaded  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal) to demonstrate that Section 85A has a  very  limited
    application when it comes to the admission of  evidence  that  had  not
    been adduced at the time of the making of the application.

12. Mr Smart submitted that there  was  no  "near  miss"  principle  to  be
    applied.  Patel was decisive in terms of the way in which Article 8 was
    to be used.  The judge had not been able to demonstrate in any way  why
    it was said that the Appellant could not exercise her Article 8 rights,
    if she could not succeed under the Immigration  Rules,  as  indeed  the
    judge had found she could not.

13. Furthermore, the judge had not been able to demonstrate why there was a
    good reason, the Rules not having been  satisfied,  for  the  judge  to
    consider the position outside the Immigration  Rules  in  circumstances
    where those Rules were compliant with Article  8,  so  as  to  look  at
    freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.

14. But most of all, the judge had not been able  to  demonstrate  why  the
    proportionality consideration was compelling under freestanding Article
    8 jurisprudence, when that was  not  the  case  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  that  decision  and  remake  the
    decision (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as  follows.



16. First, Section 85A of the 2002 Act governs.  The case  of  Alam  [2011]
    UKUT 00421, which Mr Smart handed up is clearly applicable.

17. Second, the judge had made a clear finding that the Appellant could not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.  She could not succeed because the
    evidence which she had submitted at the  time  of  the  making  of  her
    application did not include the evidence that she was now relying  upon
    before the judge.  This is clear from the judge's findings that,  "what
    is omitted from those papers is the  crucial  statement,  now  supplied
    with the appeal bundle, for the joint bank account, which I find  shows
    no changes in the balance of �1,895 ..." (paragraph 24).

18. Third, in these  circumstances  there  was  no  requirement  under  the
    "evidential flexibility" policy for the  Secretary  of  State  to  make
    enquiries of the Appellant's situation.  The appeal could not  succeed.
    Finally, the appeal could not succeed under Article 8 either because of
    the judgment in Patel by the  Supreme  Court  (at  paragraph  57)  that
    "Article 8 is not a general dispensing  power",  a  decision  that  has
    subsequently been applied by the Tribunal  in  Nasim.   For  all  these
    reasons, this appeal could not have succeeded.

Remaking the Decision

19. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  For the reasons I have given above, I remake  the  decision  by
    dismissing the appeal of the Appellant and her husband.





Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the
    decision of the original judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as  follows.
    This appeal is dismissed.

21. No anonymity order is made.
