                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judges  Morris  and  Chambers
    promulgated on 12 February 2015 which allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

Background

 3. The Appellant was born on 13 June 1984 and is a national of Pakistan.

 4. On 7 April 2014 the Appellant applied for entry clearance to the United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM as the fianc� of Ms  Sara  Jabeen  a  British
    Citizen.

 5. On 24 April  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave only one reason that the Appellant
    did not meet the relationship requirements of Appendix FM in that there
    was insufficient evidence of a genuine and subsisting  relationship  or
    that they intended to live together permanently (E-ECP 2.6 and 2.10)

The Judges Decision

 6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chambers and Morris ("the Judges") allowed the appeal against the
    Respondent's decision on the basis of the documentary evidence and  the
    oral evidence of Ms Jabeen. The Judges found :

      a) The parties were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.

      b) Theirs was an arranged marriage in that  it  was  proposed  to  the
         sponsor who visited Pakistan in April 2011  to  meet  her  proposed
         husband for the first time and they agreed to marry.

      c)  Cultural  and  religious  reasons  explained  why  they  were  not
         photographed next to  each  other.Cultural  and  religious  reasons
         meant that their contact, including  telephone  contact,  would  be
         limited until their marriage had  been  performed  and  registered:
         their relationship would only begin when they married.

      d) They accepted that the sponsor had not visited Pakistan since  2011
         because she was completing her degree and working.

      e) Their  intention  to  marry  was  reflected  in  their  booking  of
         Chadderton Town Hall for the marriage ceremony.

 7. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that the  Judges  had  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for their  findings  at  paragraph  16  that  the
    parties were in a genuine and subsisting relationship and  on  9  April
    2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes gave permission to appeal.

 8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms Johnson  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that :

      a) She relied on the grounds of appeal.

      b) The Judges found that there was limited contact between the parties
         and the relationship only began when they married  therefore  their
         relationship could not be genuine and subsisting.

      c) There was a lack of visits.

 9. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Gill submitted that :

      a) The sponsor gave evidence and confirmed that their relationship was
         genuine and subsisting and the Judges found her to  be  a  credible
         witness.

      b) The Judges made their decision in  the  context  of  this  being  a
         fianc� application.

      c) The basis of their assessment was whether they intended to go ahead
         with  the  marriage.  They  recognised  that  the  quality  of  the
         relationship would be different after they married.

      d) She gave explanations for the  lack  of  visits  in  that  she  was
         studying and working to meet the financial requirements.

      e) The lack of contact did  not  mean  this  was  not  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship.

Finding on Material Error

10. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no errors of law.

11. It was said in Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside)  [2013]  UKUT
    85 (IAC) there is a legal duty to  give  a  brief  explanation  of  the
    conclusions on the central issue on  which  an  appeal  is  determined,
    those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole  makes
    sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge.

12. The Judges in this case had the benefit of hearing  evidence  from  the
    sponsor in this case Ms Jabeen  and  on  the  basis  of  that  and  the
    documentary evidence reached conclusions as to whether the relationship
    of Ms Jabeen and her fianc� was genuine and subsisting and whether they
    intended to proceed with their marriage.

13. They made clear that they found her to be a credible witness as to this
    central issue that this was a genuine and subsisting engagement leading
    to marriage within a particular cultural environment.  I  am  satisfied
    that they were entitled to do this given that the  word  'relationship'
    bears more than one meaning and thus while it may mean  a  romantic  or
    sexual involvement it may also be a connection via kinship or marriage.
    The Judges accepted that their relationship as a man  and  woman  would
    begin after marriage but that did not preclude them being in a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship before marriage.

14. The Judges set out at paragraph 16(i)-(vi) in detail why they  accepted
    that this was a genuine and subsisting  marriage  that  would  lead  to
    marriage. They heard and found credible the  reasons  for  the  limited
    contact, the photographic  evidence  being  limited  and  the  lack  of
    visits. I am satisfied that as Mr Gill submitted they were entitled  to
    accept that religiously and culturally the  different  nature  of  that
    relationship before and after marriage. These  were  findings  open  to
    them.

15. I was therefore satisfied that the determination when read as  a  whole
    set out findings that were sustainable and  sufficiently  detailed  and
    based on cogent reasoning.





CONCLUSION

16. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

17. The appeal is dismissed.
