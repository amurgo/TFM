                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Background to these Proceedings

 1. On 2 June 2014 the respondent was refused leave to remain in the United
    Kingdom.  The respondent appealed that decision and her appeal and  the
    linked appeals of her children  came  before  FTTJ  Lloyd-Smith  on  30
    September 2014.  In a decision promulgated on 8 October 2014 FTTJ Lloyd-
    Smith made findings in the following terms:

         "11. When considering the main appellant under FM it was  suggested
             during submissions that given the  passage  of  time  and  the
             apparent acceptance by the respondent that the  children  have
             now been in the UK for 7 years the main appellant can meet the
             requirements of R-LTRPT.  Whilst 7 years have now  elapsed  E-
             LTRPT 2.2 makes it clear that the child of the applicant  must
             have lived in  the  UK  continuously  for  at  least  7  years
             immediately preceding the date of  the  application.   Clearly
             this is not the case however, the  length  of  time  that  the
             children have lived here is a  matter  for  my  consideration.
             Having  decided  that  the  appellant  cannot  succeed   under
             appendix FM and she  cannot  succeed  under  paragraph  276ADE
             because she has not lived here continuously for  20  years;  I
             have to consider whether it is appropriate to consider Article
             8 outside the Immigration  Rules.   The  Court  of  Appeal  in
             Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 indicated in paragraph 44 that
             'at least in this court, in light of the  authorities,  it  is
             necessary to find compelling circumstances for  going  outside
             the Rules'.  Looking at the best interests of the children and
             the time that they have  spent  in  this  country  I  find  it
             appropriate to conduct such a test outside  the  Rules.   This
             involves following the step by step approach advocated in  the
             House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

         12.  Given the length of time that the family have been in the UK I
             find that the appellant has established a private  life  since
             her arrival here.  The threshold for engaging Article 8 is not
             especially high, and I therefore conclude that  Article  8  is
             engaged on the basis of the  appellant's  private  life.   The
             proposed interference with that private life, by the appellant
             having to leave the country would be in  accordance  with  the
             law because  she  cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  in
             relation to remaining in the United Kingdom.  However, I  also
             have to consider whether the  interference  is  necessary  and
             proportionate.

         13.  The appellant has 4 children whose best interests have  to  be
             my paramount concern.  I have  considered  the  relevant  case
             law.  In Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 the court held  that  a
             decision maker must evaluate the child's best interests and in
             some cases these may point only marginally in one, rather than
             another, direction.  At paragraph 35 of EV  (Philippines)  and
             Others [2014] EWCA  Civ  874  it  was  stated  that  the  best
             interests of children will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors
             including their age, the length of time that they have been in
             the United Kingdom, how long they have been in education,  the
             stage that their education has reached, to  what  extent  they
             have been distanced from the country to which they are  to  be
             returned, how renewable their connection with it may  be,  the
             extent that  they  will  have  linguistic,  medical  or  other
             difficulties in adapting to life there and the extent to which
             the course proposed will interfere with their family  life  or
             other rights in this country.  The longer the child  had  been
             in the UK, the more advanced or  critical  the  stage  of  his
             education, the looser his ties with the country  in  question,
             and the more deleterious the consequences of his  return,  the
             greater the weight that fell into one side of the scales.   If
             it was overwhelmingly in the child's best  interests  that  he
             should not return, the need to  maintain  immigration  control
             may well not tip the  balance.   In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others
             (decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 197
             (IAC) (Blake J) the Tribunal held that it is generally in  the
             interests of children to have both stability and continuity of
             social and educational provision and the benefit of growing up
             in the cultural norms of the society  to  which  they  belong.
             Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of  origin
             can lead to development of  social  cultural  and  educational
             ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in the absence
             of compelling reason to the contrary.  What amounts to lengthy
             residence is not clear cut but past and present policies  have
             identified seven years as a  relevant  period.   It  was  also
             noted that seven years from age four  is  likely  to  be  more
             significant to a child than the first  seven  years  of  life.
             Very young children are focussed on their parents rather  than
             their peers and are adaptable.

         14.  Applying the case law to the facts of this case a  distinction
             can be made with the case of EV.  The children involved in  EV
             were born in 2008 and 2011, their education and age would mean
             that their formative years were not  the  same  as  the  older
             children I am considering.  The two  oldest  children  in  the
             instant  appeal  have  spent  a  significant  part  of   their
             education experience at school in the UK and are at a  crucial
             stage in finalising their qualifications.  They are of an  age
             where they will have  become  integrated  into  life  in  this
             country, have developed strong ties and the older two are at a
             crucial stage of their education.  As a consequence to require
             them to leave the UK at this stage of their lives would not be
             proportionate.  The younger children have spent  most  if  not
             all of their lives in this country and reintegration into life
             in Nigeria would be difficult.  It is also apparent  from  the
             case  law  that  children  should  ideally  remain  with  both
             parents.  Whilst their father is in Nigeria it was clear  from
             the evidence that they do not have regular  contact  with  him
             and it appears that the marriage is over.  The main  appellant
             is their primary carer.  It follows therefore that finding  as
             I do that the older children's private life will be interfered
             with if removal occurs, the cases of  the  appellants  are  so
             intrinsically linked that they should remain  as  a  unit  and
             therefore  they  all  should  be  allowed   to   remain.    In
             considering this I have taken into consideration the fact that
             the main appellant has always  respected  and  abided  by  the
             immigration  laws  of  this  country  always   obtaining   the
             appropriate visa to  enable  them  to  remain.   Whilst  their
             continued residence and education in this  country  has  never
             been guaranteed and should not have  been  expected,  for  the
             reasons set out above, given the  passage  of  time,  age  and
             stage of their education removal would not be proportionate."

 2. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  and  the  grounds  of  that
    application are as follows:-

         "1.  'Best interests of the child'

             a)   The FTJ states; 'The appellant has 4 children whose  best
                  interests have to be my  paramount  concern'  (�13).   The
                  SSHD submits that this is wrong in law: the best interests
                  of the children are a  primary  consideration  but  not  a
                  paramount one.

             b)   This misdirection is material as it clearly  infects  the
                  FTJ's approach to the instant appeal and  turns  the  best
                  interests of the children into a trump card, which is also
                  wrong in law.

         2.   'Right to education'

             a)   The FTJ considers that the two oldest children have spent
                  a significant part of their education experience at school
                  in the UK and are at a crucial stage in  finalising  their
                  qualifications and that requiring them to leave would  not
                  be proportionate (�14). Whilst it may be that the children
                  are currently being educated in the UK, the  SSHD  submits
                  that the As could have no 'future' right, or  expectation,
                  to continue that education in the UK.  The ability of  the
                  children to  remain  in  the  UK  is  dependent  upon  the
                  compliance  of  A1  with  the  provisions  of  immigration
                  control.

             b)   In Zoumbas v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  74  the  Supreme  Court
                  distinguished between the  'future  right'  of  a  British
                  child  to  expect  to  enjoy  healthcare  and  educational
                  services in the UK and a non-EEA national child, who could
                  hold no such expectation;

                       'There is no irrationality in the conclusion that  it
                      was in the children's best interests to go with their
                      parents to the Republic of Congo.  No doubt it  would
                      have been possible to have stated that, other  things
                      being equal, it was in  the  best  interests  of  the
                      children that they and their parents  stayed  in  the
                      United  Kingdom  so  that  they  could  obtain   such
                      benefits as  health  care  and  education  which  the
                      decision-maker  recognised  might  be  of  a   higher
                      standard than would be available in the  Congo.   But
                      other things were not equal.  They were  not  British
                      citizens.  They had no right to future education  and
                      health care in this country.  They  were  part  of  a
                      close-knit family with highly  educated  parents  and
                      were of an age when their emotional needs could  only
                      be fully met within the immediate family unit.   Such
                      integration  as  had  occurred  into  United  Kingdom
                      society would have been predominantly in the  context
                      of  that  family  unit.   Most   significantly,   the
                      decision-maker concluded that they could  be  removed
                      to the Republic of Congo in the care of their parents
                      without serious detriment to  their  well-being.   We
                      agree with Lady Dorrian's  succinct  summary  of  the
                      position in para 18 of the  Inner  House's  opinion.'
                      [�24]

             c)   In EV (Philippines) & Ors v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874  the
                  Court of Appeal expressed a  similar  view  as  to  future
                  entitlement to life in the UK;

                      'On the facts of ZH it was not reasonable  to  expect
                      the children to follow their mother to Tanzania,  not
                      least because the family would be separated  and  the
                      children would be deprived of the right to grow up in
                      the country of which they were citizens.' [� 59]

                      'That is a long way from the facts of our  case.   In
                      our case none of the family  is  a  British  citizen.
                      None has the right to remain in this country.  If the
                      mother is removed,  the  father  has  no  independent
                      right to remain.  If the parents are removed, then it
                      is entirely reasonable to expect the children  to  go
                      with them.  As the  immigration  judge  found  it  is
                      obviously in their  best  interests  to  remain  with
                      their parents.  Although it is, of course a  question
                      of fact for the  tribunal,  I  cannot  see  that  the
                      desirability of being educated at public  expense  in
                      the UK can outweigh the benefit to  the  children  of
                      remaining with their  parents.   Just  as  we  cannot
                      provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot
                      educate the world; [�60] [emphasis added]

             d)   The SSHD submits, for the reasons set out above, that the
                  FTJ has erred in  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the
                  decision to refuse the A's application: this represents  a
                  fundamental flaw in the  overall  decision  to  allow  the
                  appeal.

         3.   'Section 117'

             a)   The FTJ's findings and reasons  do  not  disclose  proper
                  engagement  with  the  provisions  of  Part  5A   of   the
                  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002   (i.e.:
                  Section 117).  The FTJ concludes that  the  children  have
                  private life, which would be interfered with and that  the
                  whole family should allowed to remain in the UK (�14), but
                  does not acknowledge that only limited  weight  should  be
                  afforded to the private life of the As, as per  S.117B(5).
                  The family have, at all times, been  precariously  present
                  in the UK  (i.e.:  their  leave  discloses  an  expiration
                  date):  they  could  hold  no  legitimate  expectation  of
                  remaining in the UK.

             b)   Furthermore, the  maintenance  of  a  firm  and  coherent
                  system of immigration control is in  the  public  interest
                  (S.117B(1) and it was incumbent upon the FTJ to  have  due
                  regard to that public interest in assessing the rights  of
                  the individual As against the  wider  rights  of  society.
                  The FTJ's lack of engagement with the provision  of  S.117
                  is wrong in law, and renders the  decision  to  allow  the
                  appeal as materially unsound.

         For the reasons set out above the FTJ was wrong, in law,  to  allow
         the appeal on human rights grounds."

 3. A decision on the permission to appeal application  was  made  by  FTTJ
    Grant-Hutchison on 24 November 2014 whereby she found:-

         "It is an arguable error of law for the Judge  to  (a)  assess  the
         best interests of the children as her paramount concern as  opposed
         to a primary consideration; (b) fail to  consider  that  a  non-EEA
         national child has no expectations to continue his/her education in
         the UK and (c)  fail  to  consider  part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002."

 4. Thus the matter came before me at an error of law hearing.

 5. Mr Shilliday relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in Singh v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74 and EV (Philippines) and Others v  SSHD  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874.  Two Lord Justices gave judgments that were complimentary
    to each other which hand together and form the ratio of the  case.   At
    paragraphs 33 and 34 Clarke LJ identifies the  best  interests  of  the
    children as best practice then he deals with the countervailing factors
    which were numerous.  At paragraphs 45 and 46  he  found  the  need  to
    maintain immigration control did outweigh the  best  interests  of  the
    children.  What Lewison LJ says about that  at  paragraph  55  is  that
    there is a requirement to undertake a real world  assessment  and  what
    that real world assessment must be was identified at paragraph 44  -  a
    rounded assessment of all the circumstances of the  case  of  the  best
    interests of the children are at the forefront of the judge's mind, but
    with a real world idea of what will be the situation on return and  the
    importance of effective immigration control.

 6. Mr Shilliday submitted that the FTTJ in this case failed to make a real
    world assessment and found EV could be distinguished on the facts which
    is a remarkable thing to say.  It could not  be  distinguished  on  the
    facts and certainly not in this case because the principle set  out  is
    almost universal.  It cannot be right that the FTTJ went on to say that
    reintegration into life in Nigeria would be difficult because  that  is
    not the test applied in Article 8 law and  Sedley  LJ  said  so  in  VW
    (Uganda) in 2009.  The children have one primary carer who has no right
    to be in the United Kingdom  and  would  have  no  right  but  for  her
    children and that is not a real world assessment.  The errors of law in
    the decision are material and the decision cannot stand.

 7. Mr Orubibi in response said whilst there is case law confirming the use
    of the word paramount rather than primary this is not tantamount to  an
    error of law because the  words  paramount  and  primary  can  be  used
    interchangeably and the judge used the word paramount which  forms  the
    crux of the first ground of  appeal.   The  FTTJ  carried  out  anxious
    scrutiny of the appellant and her children and came to  her  conclusion
    at paragraph 13 that the children's best  interests  applied  and  were
    paramount and the FTTJ was entitled to reach that decision.  Even if it
    is accepted that the judge made an error by using  the  word  paramount
    the FTTJ's reasons in coming to that conclusion outweigh the linguistic
    difficulty or the word used.  By applying for permission to appeal  the
    Secretary of State's action negates the best interests of the children.
     With regard to the second ground which is related to a  non-EEA  child
    having no expectation to continue education in the United  Kingdom  the
    respondent and her children came in 2007 and legally  remained  in  the
    United Kingdom until 21 January 2014.  Her  previous  applications  had
    always been approved and granted and paragraph 276ADE  applies  because
    the children have lived continuously in the United  Kingdom  for  seven
    years they can apply to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Mr  Orubibi
    submitted the FTTJ rightly distinguished EV (Philippines) and this  was
    not an error  of  law.   She  also  considered  Zoumbas  and  correctly
    distinguished both cases.  Mr Orubibi submitted  that  his  hands  were
    tied in relation to ground 3 and  that  he  was  in  difficulties  with
    ground 3.

 8. Having heard the submissions from both parties  and  having  considered
    very carefully the determination I found that the judge  had  erred  in
    law for the reasons set out by the appellant in the grounds  of  appeal
    and in the correct application of case law.   In  EV  (Philippines)  at
    paragraphs 58 to 62 Jackson LJ found:

         "58.  In  my  judgment,  therefore,  the  assessment  of  the  best
             interests of the children must be made on the basis  that  the
             facts are as they are in the real world.  If one parent has no
             right to remain, but  the  other  parent  does,  that  is  the
             background against which  the  assessment  is  conducted.   If
             neither parent has the right  to  remain,  then  that  is  the
             background against which the assessment  is  conducted.   Thus
             the ultimate question will be: is it reasonable to expect  the
             child to follow the parent with no  right  to  remain  to  the
             country of origin?


         59.  On the facts of  ZH  it  was  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
             children to follow their mother to Tanzania, not least because
             the family would  be  separated  and  the  children  would  be
             deprived of the right to grow up in the country of which  they
             were citizens.


         60.  That is a long way from the facts of our  case.  In  our  case
             none of the family is a British citizen. None has the right to
             remain in this country.  If the mother is removed, the  father
             has no independent  right  to  remain.   If  the  parents  are
             removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children
             to go with  them.   As  the  immigration  judge  found  it  is
             obviously  in  their  best  interests  to  remain  with  their
             parents.  Although it is, of course a question of fact for the
             tribunal, I cannot see that the desirability of being educated
             at public expense in the UK can outweigh the  benefit  to  the
             children of remaining with their parents.  Just as  we  cannot
             provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot  educate
             the world.


         61.  In fact the immigration judge weighed the  best  interests  of
             the children as a primary consideration, and  set  against  it
             the economic well-being of the country.   As  Maurice  Kay  LJ
             pointed out in AE (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the  Home
             Department [2014] EWCA Civ  653  at  [9]  in  conducting  that
             exercise it would have been appropriate to consider  the  cost
             to the public purse in providing education to these  children.
             In fact that was not  something  that  the  immigration  judge
             explicitly   considered.    If   anything,   therefore,    the
             immigration judge adopted an approach too  favourable  to  the
             appellant.


         62.  I can see no error of law which would entitle  this  court  to
             set aside that decision.  For these reasons,  in  addition  to
             those given by Christopher Clarke LJ, I too would dismiss  the
             appeal."


 9. And in Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74 at paragraphs 63 and 64 in which
    Lewison LJ found:

         "63. The first case is the decision of this Court in MM  (Lebanon).
             The only substantive judgment is that of Aikens LJ (with  whom
             the Vice-President, Maurice Kay LJ,  and  Treacy  LJ  agreed).
             Most of the issues with which the case is concerned are wholly
             remote from those in this appeal, but in one  section  of  his
             judgment Aikens LJ had to consider Nagre.   In  para.  129  he
             refers to Sales J having said that 'if a particular person  is
             outside the rule then he has to demonstrate, as a  preliminary
             to a consideration outside the rule, that he has  an  arguable
             case that there may be good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to
             remain outside the rules': that is evidently a  paraphrase  of
             the second half  of  para.  29  of  Sales  J's  judgment.   He
             continues:


                  'I cannot see  much  utility  in  imposing  this  further,
                  intermediary, test. If the applicant  cannot  satisfy  the
                  rule, then there either is  or  there  is  not  a  further
                  Article 8 claim.  That will have to be determined  by  the
                  relevant decision-maker.'


             Mr Malik submitted - this being his second ground of appeal in
             Ms Khalid's case - that  this  short  passage  undermined  the
             entirety  of  Sales  J's   point   about   a   full   separate
             consideration of article 8 not always being necessary.


         64.  In my view that is a mis-reading of Aikens  LJ's  observation.
             He was not questioning the substantial point made by Sales  J.
             He was simply saying that it was unnecessary for the decision-
             maker, in approaching the 'second stage', to  have  to  decide
             first whether it was arguable that there was a good article  8
             claim outside the Rules  -  that  being  what  he  calls  'the
             intermediary test' - and then,  if  he  decided  that  it  was
             arguable, to go on to assess  that  claim:  he  should  simply
             decide whether there was a good claim  outside  the  Rules  or
             not.  I am not sure that I would myself have read Sales  J  as
             intending to impose any such intermediary requirement,  though
             I agree with Aikens  LJ  that  if  he  was  it  represents  an
             unnecessary refinement.  But what matters  is  that  there  is
             nothing in Aikens LJ's comment which casts doubt on Sales  J's
             basic point that there is no need to conduct a  full  separate
             examination of article 8  outside  the  Rules  where,  in  the
             circumstances of a particular case, all the issues  have  been
             addressed in the consideration under the Rule."


10. Having heard submissions from Mr Malik on Ganesabalan Lewison  LJ  said
    at paragraph 66 and 67:

         "66. Point (3) in Mr Fordham's  summary  broadly  reflects  earlier
             authorities, though there is a fuller and  more  authoritative
             exposition in the judgment of Beatson LJ  in  Haleemudeen,  at
             paras. 59-61. I would not disagree with either of  points  (1)
             and (2); but I am conscious of how practitioners in this field
             can sometimes seek to exploit even the faintest ambiguity, and
             I would accordingly wish to make three  comments  about  point
             (1):


             (1)  I should emphasise - though it is in truth entirely clear
                  from the full judgment - that Mr Fordham's statement  that
                  'there is always a second  stage'  does  not  in  any  way
                  qualify what Sales J says at para. 30 of his  judgment  in
                  Nagre.  Sales J's point is that the second stage  can,  in
                  an appropriate case, be satisfied  by  the  decision-maker
                  concluding that any family life  or  private  life  issues
                  raised by the claim have already  been  addressed  at  the
                  first stage - in which case obviously there is no need  to
                  go through it all again.   Mr Fordham's point is that that
                  is a conclusion which must  be  reached  as  a  matter  of
                  conscious decision in any given case and cannot simply  be
                  assumed.   I agree with both points.


             (2)  The statement that  the  decision-maker  'must  be  in  a
                  position to demonstrate' that he  or  she  has  given  the
                  necessary consideration is  simply  a  reflection  of  the
                  ordinary obligation to record a material decision.  If the
                  decision-maker's view is straightforwardly  that  all  the
                  article 8 issues raised have been addressed in determining
                  the claim under the Rules, all that is  necessary  is,  as
                  Sales J says, to say so.


             (3)  It may not be entirely apt to describe a decision  as  to
                  whether article 8 requires  that  an  applicant  be  given
                  leave outside the Rules as an 'exercise of discretion'.


         67.  In short, neither MM (Lebanon) nor Ganesabalan undermines  the
             point made by Sales J in para. 30 of his  judgment  in  Nagre,
             which in  my  view,  together  with  his  endorsement  of  the
             approach in Izuazu, remains good law."


The Evidence

11. The evidence before the FTTJ and the submissions made  thereon  is  set
    out in paragraphs 8 to 10 of the decision which I set out below:-

         "8.  The main  appellant  confirmed  the  content  of  her  witness
             statement and asked that it be  adopted  as  her  evidence  in
             chief.  The evidence can be summarised: the family arrived  in
             this country in July 2007 when the children were  aged  10,  8
             and 5.  The youngest child was born here.  The main  appellant
             has completed a postgraduate diploma in  Computing  Management
             and a Master of Science in Computing with IT Management  since
             arriving in the UK.  Her children are all being educated  here
             and her youngest son Joseph who is 5 years old and  has  never
             been to Nigeria.  They have always  been  self-sufficient  and
             receive support from their extended family.  In  her  evidence
             the main appellant stated that she had been separated from the
             other appellants' father since 2010 and whilst they  have  not
             discovered he is in another relationship, has a child and  has
             married again.  Her concern was for her  children's  education
             which would be disrupted if they  returned  to  Nigeria.   Her
             eldest daughter is in the final year of her A levels  and  the
             next oldest daughter is sitting her GCSE  examinations  during
             this academic year.

         9.   Submissions were made by the respondent who said  that  whilst
             he had not seen the proof that the family had been here  since
             2007, if that was correct and the children crossed the 7  year
             relevant period it was still  reasonable  to  expect  them  to
             return  with  their  mother.   Doubt  was  raised  as  to  the
             intention of the family when they arrived on  visit  visas  as
             the evidence indicated that due to a  robbery  at  their  home
             none of them wished to leave and they  therefore  enrolled  in
             school and remained here ever since.  The failure  to  mention
             on the application form that the marriage was no longer viable
             was a matter raised and it was said that the  contention  that
             the marriage had ended was to bolster the claim and to give  a
             different perspective on  their  circumstances.   It  was  not
             accepted that he had remarried.  Reliance was  placed  on  the
             case law and the case of EV which states that  it  is  in  the
             children's best interests to return with their parent  and  'I
             cannot see that the desirability of being educated  at  public
             expense in the UK can outweigh the benefit to the children  of
             remaining with the parents.  Just as we cannot provide medical
             treatment for the world, so we cannot educate the world' (para
             60).  The children had  mainly  been  born  in  Nigeria,  been
             brought up  in  a  Nigerian  household  and  had  ever  had  a
             legitimate expectation that they would be able  to  remain  in
             this country.  I was also referred to the case of  Zoumbas  in
             which it  was  said  to  not  be  disproportionate  to  expect
             children to return to  the  country  of  nationality  and  the
             difference here being  that  the  children  were  not  British
             citizens and therefore would not have a legitimate expectation
             to have education and  medical  treatment.   To  return  to  a
             country as a family unit where their father  lives  and  there
             are other family members was said to not be disproportionate.

         10.  In response it was submitted on behalf of the appellants  that
             now, as opposed to the date of the  application  the  children
             have resided in the UK for 7 years and that  the  decision  to
             remove would disrupt their education.  The best  interests  of
             the children should be the primary consideration.  Looking  at
             the children's ages  and  experiences  in  the  round  it  was
             submitted that it was not reasonable to expect them to  leave.
             The other family members in Nigeria  were  not  known  to  the
             children  due  to  their  long  period  of  absence.   It  was
             submitted  that  exceptional  circumstances  exist  such  that
             removal would be unjustifiably harsh and not proportionate."

12. At the time the respondent applied for further leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom none of her three  children  had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom for seven years and whilst seven years had elapsed at the  time
    the FTTJ heard the appeal as she correctly points out E-LTRPT 2.2 makes
    it clear that the child of the first respondent must have lived in  the
    UK continuously for at least seven years immediately preceding the date
    of the application and that was not the  case  before  the  FTTJ.   The
    first respondent could not succeed under Article 8  under  Appendix  FM
    nor could she succeed under paragraph 276ADE because she had not  lived
    in the United Kingdom continuously for twenty years.  Thus none of  the
    respondents could meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   In
    assessing the Article 8 appeal as  she  did  the  FTTJ  erred  for  the
    reasons set out in the grounds.  The interests of the  children  are  a
    primary not a paramount consideration in the assessment of  the  appeal
    under Article 8.

13. Following Singh from which I have set out relevant extracts above there
    is no need to conduct a full separate examination of Article 8  outside
    of the Rules, where in the circumstances  of  a  particular  case,  all
    issues have been addressed in the consideration under the Rules.

14. I agree with the approach of the FTTJ that this is not a case where all
    issues have been addressed in the consideration  under  the  Rules  not
    least the youth of the children and the fact that as  at  the  date  of
    hearing the Article 8 appeal the two elder children have now  lived  in
    the United Kingdom for more than seven years.  The youngest  child  has
    known no other life but life in the United Kingdom because he was  born
    here.

15. I therefore find that the  children  have  established  a  private  and
    family life with their mother and in  their  education  in  the  United
    Kingdom  with  their  circle  of  friends   and   acquaintances.    The
    respondent's decision is undeniably in accordance with the law and  has
    a legitimate aim which is  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control.  The issue for this appeal is whether the decision  to  return
    the family to Nigeria is proportionate to the aims to be achieved.

16. In evaluating the proportionality exercise in Azimi-Moayed  and  Others
    (decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013]  UKUT  197  (IAC)
    Blake J held that lengthy residence in a country other than  the  state
    of  origin  can  lead  to  the  development  of  social,  cultural  and
    educational ties that it would  be  inappropriate  to  disrupt  in  the
    absence of compelling reasons to the contrary.   He  found  that  seven
    years from the age of 4 is likely to be more  significant  to  a  child
    than the first seven years of life.   Past  and  present  policies  and
    paragraph 276ADE do identify seven years as  a  relevant  period  in  a
    child's life.

17. In this case Juliana was born on 31 July 1997 and she is  currently  17
    years old.  Her sister Judith was born on 7 October  1999  and  she  is
    currently 15 years of age.  Juliana is studying for her  A  levels  and
    Judith is studying for her GCSE examinations.  Joseph was born in  2008
    and is currently 6 years old and his brother Simon was born in 2002 and
    is 12 years old and at secondary school.  Juliana has undertaken almost
    all of her secondary education in the United  Kingdom  and  Judith  has
    completed primary education and commenced secondary  education  in  the
    United Kingdom and will very shortly sit her GCSE  examinations.   Most
    of Simon's education has been in the United Kingdom.  Joseph as a young
    child who is not yet 7  years  of  age  does  not  fall  for  the  same
    consideration as his elder three siblings.

18. It is clearly in the best interests of  the  children  to  remain  with
    their mother, the first respondent.  It is also in the  best  interests
    of the children that their education  in  the  United  Kingdom  is  not
    disrupted.  But in a real world assessment of the best interests of the
    children it must be conducted against the background which is that  the
    first respondent their  mother  has  no  right  to  remain.   Thus  the
    ultimate question arises which is,  is  it  reasonable  to  expect  the
    children to follow their mother to Nigeria.

19. As in EV (Philippines) none of the family is a British  citizen.   None
    has the right to remain in this country.  If the  first  respondent  is
    removed and their father is already in Nigeria,  then  it  is  entirely
    reasonable  to  expect  the  children  to  return  with  their  mother.
    Although it is in the best interests for the elder  three  children  to
    continue their education in the United Kingdom I find that the  benefit
    of being educated at public expense in  the  United  Kingdom  does  not
    outweigh the benefits of the children of remaining with  their  mother.
    It was necessary for the FTTJ to consider the cost to the public  purse
    in providing education to the children and that was not something  that
    the FTTJ considered.

20. Therefore in carrying out the balancing exercise on proportionality the
    factors in favour of the  three  elder  children  are  that  they  have
    undertaken the main part of their education in the United Kingdom.  The
    eldest child is about to complete her A levels, the  second  eldest  is
    about to complete her GCSE examinations, the third child has had almost
    all his education to date in the  United  Kingdom.   Unlike  his  elder
    sisters he has not had the benefit of education in  Nigeria  before  he
    came to the United Kingdom.

21. In favour of the  respondents  the  interests  of  immigration  control
    outweigh the best interests of the children, their continued  education
    in the United Kingdom is a significant expense  on  the  public  purse,
    their mother has no right to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
    Immigration Rules are not met by the appellants which  indicates  where
    the exercise of  discretion  should  lie  in  an  Article  8  balancing
    exercise.  Their father and the rest of their extended  family  are  in
    Nigeria.  It is reasonable to expect the children  to  accompany  their
    mother to Nigeria where she can settle them  into  life  and  education
    there.  Nigeria is not a  Third  World  country,  it  does  provide  an
    education for its citizens and there is university education  available
    for the children should they wish to avail themselves  of  a  place  at
    university in Nigeria.

22. All in all the factors in favour of the Secretary  of  State  do  weigh
    against the right of the family to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    having found the judge erred in law by finding  the  interests  of  the
    children were a paramount consideration which infected the exercise  of
    her discretion on  proportionality,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is set aside and I hereby remake the  decision  by  dismissing
    the appeal.

Summary

The decision of the FtTJ is set aside
