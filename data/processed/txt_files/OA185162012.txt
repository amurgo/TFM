                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Robinson
    made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 14th May 2013.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born on 8th September 1974.  She
    applied for leave to come to the UK as a the spouse  of  Norman  Rhoden
    but was refused entry clearance on 24th February 2012  on  the  grounds
    that the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied  that  the  marriage
    was subsisting, nor that the accommodation would be adequate, nor  that
    the maintenance requirements of the Rules could  be met.

 3. The judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor. The couple had  married
    in October 2004.  He had been married before,  in  1979,  and  had  two
    children from that marriage.  However, since the marriage he had had  a
    child with a former girlfriend who was born in 2006.

 4. The judge recorded that the Sponsor said that he  and  his  wife  spoke
    about four times a week on the telephone and that he had visited her in
    Jamaica.  There was also evidence of money transfers.

 5. However the judge stated that the Sponsor provided no information about
    his married life with the  Appellant  in  Jamaica,  and  there  was  no
    evidence of letters, emails or  phone  calls  between  the  couple.  No
    wedding photographs were produced.  The Appellant  did  not  provide  a
    statement for the appeal hearing and gave no reasons for the  delay  of
    eight years before  making  application  for  settlement.   Apart  from
    details of the Sponsor's travel to Jamaica  there  was  no  information
    about his relationship with her or their future  plans.  There  was  no
    independent evidence from family members, friends or acquaintances. The
     judge concluded that there was very little evidence  to  suggest  that
    the couple were in a genuine subsisting relationship.

 6. With respect to maintenance, he said that  the  Sponsor's  monthly  net
    income from benefits was approximately �112  per  month.   His  housing
    costs are his rent of �780 per month and council tax, details of  which
    were not given. This represented a monthly figure less housing costs of
    �332 which he said was not adequate  to  maintain  the  family  without
    recourse to public funds.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that,  whilst
    it was accepted that the Appellant did not provide a  statement,  there
    was no legal obligation on her to do so and the fact that she submitted
    an application to join the Sponsor and pursued the matter until  appeal
    was indicative of her intent.

 8. Secondly, the judge had failed to take into account the cultural  norms
    of the Appellant in that it was entirely conceivable for them  to  have
    an age gap and on some occasions children born out of  marriage.  There
    were photographs and oral evidence of the Appellant that  the  children
    were known to the Appellant and had met her  on  the  last  holiday  in
    Jamaica. The  judge failed to  consider  the  case  of  GA  (Subsisting
    marriage) Ghana [2006] UKAIT 00046,  in  particular  that  evidence  of
    telephone cards was capable of being corroborative of the contention of
    the parties that they communicate by telephone even if the data  cannot
    confirm the particular number. The Sponsor continued to provide for the
    Appellant and  remained  in  touch  by  regular  phone  calls  and  the
    Appellant wished to adduce further evidence to  put  her  case  forward
    which was admissible since it showed the true position of  the  parties
    as at the date of decision.

 9. Finally, the judge had been wrong in his  treatment  of  the  issue  of
    maintenance. The housing benefit would remain the same whether  or  not
    the Appellant came to  the  UK.   It  was  accepted  that  the  Sponsor
    received pension credit which was �142.70 per week which was well above
    the income support level.

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Deans  on  3rd
    July 2013 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

11. On  12th  July  2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.

Submissions

12. Mr Balancy said that he had a bundle of evidence  which  he  wished  to
    adduce should an error of law be found in relation to  the  subsistence
    of the marriage.  He relied on his grounds  and  said  that  there  was
    sufficient  evidence  before  the  judge  to  allow  the  appeal.   The
    Appellant had not been able to join the Sponsor before because she  had
    to care for her mother who had died in 2011.   There  was  evidence  of
    regular visits, telephone calls and financial support which was  enough
    for the judge to approach the question differently.

13. With respect to maintenance, he said that the income available  to  the
    couple exceeded the benchmark established by  income  support  and  the
    judge had erred in his calculations.

14. Mr Saunders submitted that the judge had looked all of the evidence and
    come to a conclusion open to him.  The couple had married in  2004  but
    since that time the Sponsor had had a relationship with  another  woman
    and had  another  child.   Against  that  background  the  judge  ought
    properly to have closely examined whether the marriage was  subsisting.
    He accepted that telephone cards were capable of corroborative evidence
    but were not determinative.  The judge was entitled to  find  that  the
    dearth of evidence  from  the  Appellant  herself  cast  doubt  on  the
    subsistence of this marriage and whilst it was  acknowledged  that  the
    Sponsor had visited Jamaica, that did not necessarily mean that he  had
    visited her.

15. The Sponsor's weekly income  was  �290.40  which  exceeded  the  income
    support level for a couple and two children of �241.43.  However income
    support was a gateway to other  benefits,  and  given  the  lack  of  a
    schedule of the Sponsor's expenditure,  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
    demonstrate that the funds available were sufficient to meet  the  test
    as set out in KA and Others (Adequacy of maintenance)  Pakistan  [2006]
    UKAIT 00065.





Findings and Conclusions

16. Given that the figures show  that  the  Sponsor's  income  exceeds  the
    income support level, the reasons given by the judge for dismissing the
    appeal on maintenance grounds are not adequate.  Indeed he  appears  to
    have made  a  mistake  in  his  calculations.   However  any  error  is
    immaterial  because  his  decision  as  to  whether  the  marriage  was
    subsisting was plainly open to him.

17. This is a case where there has been an eight  year  delay  between  the
    marriage and the application for entry clearance.  The reason given  by
    the Sponsor was that the Appellant had to look after  her  mother,  but
    she died in 2011.

18. There was a dearth of evidence from the Appellant herself.   The  judge
    was entitled to observe that  the  Sponsor  was  much  older  than  the
    Appellant, and given the lack of evidence from her he was not satisfied
    that the burden had been discharged.

19. There was evidence of the Sponsor visiting Jamaica, but it appears that
    in 2010 he did not live with the Appellant and stayed in  a  hotel.  In
    any event, the judge took into account the fact that  the  Sponsor  had
    travelled there.  The judge was entitled to  place  significant  weight
    upon the lack of evidence from the Appellant herself  whose  intentions
    are central to this appeal.  He was also understandably concerned about
    the dearth of evidence from any family or friends who might  have  been
    able to corroborate the Sponsor's evidence that this was  a  subsisting
    marriage.

20. The Appellant has not identified in the grounds any  relevant  evidence
    which the judge did not take into account.  Given these  circumstances,
    particularly since the Sponsor had a child with another woman after  he
    had entered into marriage with her, it is  entirely  unsurprising  that
    the judge was not satisfied that this was a subsisting marriage.

Decision

21. The judge did not err in law and the decision stands.  The  Appellant's
    appeal is dismissed.
