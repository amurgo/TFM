For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the avoidance of confusion and to be consistent, I  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



Background

 2. On 28th May 2014 Designated Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Digney
    gave permission to the respondent to appeal against  the  determination
    of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dickinson in which he  allowed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds  against
    the decision of the respondent to refuse entry clearance as  a  partner
    in accordance with the provisions of  Appendix  FM  and  FM-SE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 3. In granting permission Designated Judge Digney thought it arguable that
    the judge was wrong to  apply  section  EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  to  his
    consideration of the application of the Immigration Rules and that  the
    judge was also  arguably  wrong,  in  the  light  of  jurisprudence  in
    existence at the time of  the  decision,  to  allow  the  appeal  under
    Article 8.

 4. In the grounds of application the respondent also made reference to the
    Tribunal determination in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) on the  basis
    that the judge was wrong to proceed to an Article 8 assessment  outside
    the  Rules  where  he  had  not  found  compelling  circumstances   not
    recognised by the Rules to enable him to do so.   The  respondent  also
    contended that the judge was wrong to conclude that the  sponsor  could
    not be expected to move to Kenya taking into  account  her  career  and
    stable financial situation without considering how such  a  move  would
    result in  an  unjustifiably  harsh  outcome,  particularly  since  the
    appellant could submit a further application  once  the  sponsor  could
    demonstrate that financial requirements of the Rules were met.

Error on a Point of Law

 5. I heard brief submissions from  Ms  Johnstone  who  asserted  that  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in MM and Others [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985
    had overturned the approach recommended in Gulshan and had endorsed the
    maintenance requirements of the Rules which could not  be  regarded  as
    disproportionate.  She also pointed out that, at paragraph  27  of  the
    determination,  the  judge  was  wrong  to  consider  that  maintenance
    requirements could now be met when, as the application  was  for  entry
    clearance, the future financial position of the parties  could  not  be
    considered.

 6. As the sponsor was unrepresented I assisted  her  to  make  submissions
    after I had explained the  nature  of  the  proceedings  to  her.   She
    emphasised that, at the time of the hearing, she had been  working  for
    six months and, coupled with the sums she received from her son she had
    the required amount to maintain her husband under the Rules.   However,
    Ms Johnstone pointed out that the rental income from the  son  was  not
    admissible as the provisions of Appendix FM-SE required evidence of the
    contract for such income which had not been provided.

 7. After I had considered the matter for a few moments I announced that  I
    was satisfied that the determination showed an error on a point of  law
    such that it should be re-made.  My reasons for that conclusion follow.

 8. Whilst, on the face of it, the judge's approach  to  Article  8  issues
    might appear to be without error in view  of  the  conclusions  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MM where it was concluded (paragraphs 128  and  134)
    that the conduct of an intermediary test before considering  Article  8
    issues outside the Rules was unnecessary, the  judge's  approach  still
    shows an error.  That is because in paragraphs 21 to  24  inclusive  of
    the determination the judge considers the application of  section  EX.1
    and reaches the conclusion that it would be unreasonable to expect  the
    sponsor to conduct family life in Kenya.  However, as was made clear by
    the Upper Tribunal  in  Sabir  (Appendix  FM-EX.1.  not  free-standing)
    Pakistan [2014] UKUT  63  (IAC),  that  section  is  parasitic  on  the
    relevant Rule and was not intended to be  a  free-standing  element  of
    Appendix FM.  Section EX.1 does not apply to  a  partner's  application
    for entry clearance, it is only relevant to an application for leave to
    remain by such a person.

 9. It is also evident  that  the  judge  gives  inadequate  reasoning  for
    reaching his conclusion that it would not be reasonable to  expect  the
    sponsor to move to Kenya. That is because he did not explain how such a
    move  could  result  in  an   unjustifiably   harsh   outcome   without
    consideration of the possibility of  the  appellant  making  a  further
    application once the sponsor could demonstrate, at  the  time  of  that
    application, that the financial requirements of the Rules were met.  It
    also appears, from the brief conclusions set out in paragraph 27 of the
    determination that the judge took into consideration evidence of income
    which would not have met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

10. These errors are material and mean that the determination should be re-
    made.

Re-making the Determination

11. I heard further submissions from Ms Johnstone and the sponsor.

12. Ms Johnstone  contended  that  there  had  been  no  challenge  to  the
    maintenance findings of the judge that a requirement for an  income  of
    �18,600 could not be met.  She also drew  attention  to  the  sponsor's
    document dated 24th September 2014  containing  financial  calculations
    which, she argued, showed that maintenance requirements  could  not  be
    met.  In the skeleton argument submitted there was also  no  contention
    that the financial requirements of the Rules could  be  met.   Further,
    she argued that the statement of the sponsor  of  24th  September  2014
    took no issue with those requirements.

13. As to Article 8 issues Ms Johnstone  finally  submitted  that,  as  the
    Rules were now recognised as a complete code and because the  appellant
    could make a fresh application,  there  was  no  breach  of  Article  8
    rights.

14. The sponsor confirmed that she relied upon the content  of  her  latest
    statement along with the skeleton argument, financial  calculation  and
    bundle submitted.  In relation to the statement and skeleton  the  main
    thrust of the argument is that it would not be reasonable to expect her
    to move to Kenya bearing in mind her established employment in  UK  and
    the need to care for her mother and  father  who  are  both  ill.   Her
    mother has cancer and her father  has  "crumbling  bones  and  a  heart
    condition associated with high blood pressure".  She also refers to the
    presence of her three adult children in the United Kingdom.  She  gives
    examples of difficulties which she might experience if the parties were
    required to live together in Kenya which has  now  become  an  unstable
    place in which to live.

15. At the hearing the sponsor confirmed that she had met  her  husband  on
    holiday in Kenya in 2009 and they married in 2011.  She  had  given  up
    employment in 2010 to maintain the  relationship.  She  emphasised  the
    details of her income and savings set out in paragraphs 22  and  23  of
    the skeleton argument.  She considered that jobs would be difficult  to
    obtain in Kenya.  She conceded that  her  husband  could  re-apply  for
    entry clearance but pointed out that there was the expense of doing so.
     It would also be costly for her to maintain her relationship by visits
    and phone calls.

Decision and Reasons

16. At the time  of  making  the  application  and  when  the  respondent's
    decision was made on 3rd June 2013 the appellant had not shown that the
    financial requirement for entry clearance  as  a  partner  of  a  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600 set out in E-ECP.3.1  could  be  met.
    Although the sponsor claims that her income now comes  to  a  total  of
    �19,345.75 with savings of over �26,000 evidence of that  income  which
    met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE was not provided.  For  example,
    receipt of rental payments of �3,600 per year from the  sponsor's  son,
    Kieran, would need to meet the provisions of paragraph 10  of  Appendix
    FM-SE which include the requirement for a rental agreement or  contract
    in addition to monthly personal bank  statements  for  a  twelve  month
    period showing receipt of such income. Additionally evidence of  future
    income was neither admissible or in accordance with the requirements of
    the Rules.

17. As the Court of Appeal made clear in MM the financial  requirements  of
    the Rules in relation to partners are not disproportionate in terms  of
    the  respondent's  legitimate  exercise  of  immigration  control.   In
    relation to entry clearance the Rules do not incorporate  the  provisos
    set out  in  section  EX.1  which  are  relevant  to  leave  to  remain
    applications.  Thus, the Rules themselves cannot avail the appellant.

18. Whilst it is unnecessary for me to apply an intermediary test to find a
    good arguable case for considering Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, my consideration of  the  factors  put  forward  to  support  an
    Article 8 claim in this case do not enable me  to  reach  a  favourable
    conclusion for the appellant and sponsor.

19. Following the five stage approach recommended in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27
    I can accept that the respondent's refusal decision interferes with the
    appellant's family life with his wife because  of  the  desire  of  the
    parties to live together in the United Kingdom but it is difficult  for
    me to conclude that such interference will have  consequences  of  such
    gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.   That  is
    because the parties did  not  have  the  right  to  expect,  when  they
    married, that they could enjoy their marriage in the country of choice.
     In any event it now appears that the sponsor may be able to prove that
    the parties can meet the financial requirements of the Rules and  so  a
    renewed application can be made which might be successful.  But even if
    I am wrong in that view, the same reasons lead me to conclude that  the
    decision of the respondent  was  not  a  disproportionate  exercise  of
    legitimate immigration control.  In reaching that conclusion I now must
    also  take  into  consideration  Section  117B  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which  sets  out  the  public  interest
    considerations in cases such as this.  Parliament has declared that  it
    is in the public interest, and in particular in the  interests  of  the
    economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom,  that  persons  who  seek  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent.  The
    appellant has not  shown  such  financial  independence  in  this  case
    although it may be that proof of the income requirements of  the  Rules
    can be provided in a future application.

20. Balanced against the above matters are the sponsor's reluctance  to  go
    to Kenya because of family and work commitments here and the worry that
    society in Kenya is becoming more unstable. But I must again  emphasise
    that the parties had no right to expect that their  relationship  could
    continue in this country. The relationship can be continued  by  visits
    and modern methods of communication. There is also the  prospect  of  a
    further application which will meet the requirements of the Rules.

21. For all the above reasons I find that the respondent's decision is  not
    disproportionate.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  on  a  point  of
law such that  it  should  be  re-made.   I  re-make  the  determination  by
dismissing it on immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested in this case nor do I consider it appropriate.
