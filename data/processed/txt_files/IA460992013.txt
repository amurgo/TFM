Direct Access


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the resumed hearing of this appeal following my  error  of  law
    decision promulgated on 22 September 2014, following a hearing at Field
    House on 10 September 2014. The First-tier Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity order, and I do not consider that such an order  is  required
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. At the outset of the hearing, Ms Reid addressed the query raised by  Mr
    Wilding at  the  previous  hearing.   The  claimant  had  not  met  the
    financial requirements at the date of application, and for that  reason
    had not sought to rely on her ability  to  comply  with  the  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM.  But her case was that  she  could  do  so
    now, and she had gathered together ten months' worth of bank statements
    and pay slips to show this.  This material was not going to be deployed
    before me, as it was recognised that she could only rely on her ability
    to meet the financial requirements in the context of a new application,
    and not by way of appeal against the refusal  decision.   The  claimant
    was working in a  hospital  as  a  healthcare  assistant,  and  earning
    �21,000 per annum.  Her husband was working part-time for  a  glassware
    company, earning around �500 per month.

 3. The claimant was called as a witness, and she adopted as her  evidence-
    in-chief the witness statement which she had  relied  upon  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  She entered the UK on 22 July 2008, and first met
    Jafaaa in March 2010.  Although they  were  in  a  relationship  before
    their wedding, she had maintained a room  at  another  address  because
    most of his  friends  were  conservative  Muslims  who  disapproved  of
    cohabitation before marriage.  So they wanted to show  them  that  they
    were not living  together  before  marriage.   So  although  they  were
    cohabiting, she had to stay  at  her  alternative  address  on  certain
    occasions.  She got married on 18 September 2013,  and  they  had  been
    living officially as a married couple since 1 October 2013.

 4. The family did not approve of her marriage to a Muslim man, as she came
    from a devout catholic family.  They, like  the  majority  of  catholic
    Christians in the Philippines, had a strong bias against Muslims.  This
    was especially at a time when they had a crisis  of  Muslim  extremists
    who had terrorised one of the three major islands of  the  Philippines,
    Mindanao.  It would be extremely difficult for Jafaaa to settle in  the
    Philippines because of his rejection by her family and her community.

 5. The  claimant  was  cross-examined  by  Mr  Melvin,  and  she  answered
    questions for clarification purposes from me.  Before she came  to  the
    UK, she was living with her family  in  Manila.   She  was  financially
    independent, earning an income as a nurse.  She contributed  a  portion
    of her earnings to the household expenses of the family.  After  coming
    to the UK, she used to remit money to the family  in  the  Philippines,
    but she had stopped doing so since the family had found  out  that  she
    had got married to Jafaaa.

 6. She agreed she could work in the  Philippines,  although  nursing  jobs
    were very limited there.  It would be difficult for Jafaaa  to  find  a
    job.  There was discrimination against the Muslim community in  Manila.
    She was asked whether there were  laws  which  prevented  Muslims  from
    working.  She said she did not know.  She then added that she  was  not
    familiar with the Muslim community in Manila, as she had grown up in  a
    catholic community.

 7. In re-examination, the claimant was asked why it would be difficult for
    her husband to get a job.  She said it would be  difficult  because  of
    his limited knowledge of English and he would not be  able  to  earn  a
    living through glassware in the Philippines.  She was  scared  for  his
    safety.  She did not want to reawaken his trauma.

 8. Mr Jafaaa Mohamed Karim spoke through a Kurdish Sorani interpreter whom
    he clearly understood.  Later he confirmed that he spoke to his wife in
    English, but he preferred to give his evidence to the Tribunal  in  his
    first language.

 9. He adopted as his evidence-in-chief his witness statement for the First-
    tier Tribunal.  He first entered the UK on 10 October 2002.  Living  in
    the Philippines was not acceptable to him for  the  following  reasons.
    Firstly, he did not know the culture, and the language barrier would be
    a problem.  Secondly, he wanted to live his  life  in  a  non-stressful
    environment where  he  could  easily  communicate  on  a  daily  basis.
    Thirdly, his religion was Muslim and his  wife  was  a  catholic.   The
    family would not accept him because of his religion.  She had asked her
    parents permission to marry him before the ceremony, but they  rejected
    the idea to the point that they had broken all ties with her because of
    the marriage.  There was a degree of tolerance of  Muslims  in  Manila,
    according to his wife.  But his wife's family were  not  amongst  those
    who were okay with Muslims.

10. Mr Karim was cross-examined by Mr Melvin, and he answered questions for
    clarification purposes from me.  His work options were limited  by  the
    fact that he had  problems  with  his  neck.   He  did  not  receive  a
    disability allowance.  He was currently working in a glass company.  He
    was asked whether he could work in a  shop  or  drive  a  vehicle.   He
    answered he had a driving licence.  But he liked his job, and he  would
    like to gain more experience in that area.

11. Judge Oakley found that  Mr  Karim  did  not  attend  the  mosque:  see
    paragraph 19 of his determination.  However, when asked to confirm that
    he was a non-practising Muslim, Mr Karim said  that  he  practised  his
    faith during Ramadan and on holy days.  In re-examination, he  said  he
    prayed at a mosque every Friday, and had been doing so since one or two
    years after his arrival in this country in 2002.

12. His problem with his neck was a long-standing one.  He had  had  it  in
    Kurdistan.  When he first arrived here, he had studied English to level
    3.  Subsequently he obtained a job in a pizza restaurant,  and  he  had
    also worked in a Poundland shop.

13. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Melvin  submitted  that  the  claimant  had  not   shown   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles to her enjoying family life with  her  husband
    in the Philippines.  It was simply a  matter  of  choice.   They  would
    prefer  to  live  here.   The  lack  of  family  support  was  not   an
    insurmountable obstacle.

14. In reply, Miss Reid submitted that there was societal discrimination in
    the Philippines against Muslims, as demonstrated by the attitude of the
    claimant's family in cutting her off.  The fact that the  couple  would
    be ostracised by the community represented an insurmountable  obstacle.





Discussion and Findings

15. The couple have given credible and unchallenged evidence that at around
    the time that her student visa was about to expire, the claimant sought
    permission from her parents to marry Mr Karim with a view  to  settling
    with him in the United Kingdom.  Although the claimant  attributes  the
    refusal, and the subsequent disowning of her, to  religious  prejudice,
    it was reasonable to question whether this is the truth or at least the
    whole truth. For, from a parental prospective,  there  were  reasonable
    grounds for objecting to the proposed marriage which are  unrelated  to
    Mr Karim's faith, not least the fact that they had not met him, and the
    proposed marriage was taking their eldest  daughter  down  a  different
    path than was envisaged by them when they paid for her to study  abroad
    for a limited period.

16. But even assuming that the sole or main objection to the  marriage  was
    Mr Karim's faith, it is not credibly established that the couple  would
    be at risk of being ostracised by "the community" if they had to settle
    in Manila, which is the capital city of the Philippines and  where  the
    claimant was born and brought up, and also worked prior  to  coming  to
    the UK.

17. The claimant has not brought forward any  objective  evidence  to  show
    that people of Muslim faith are subject to societal  discrimination  in
    the Philippines generally, let alone in its capital city.  Although the
    claimant has made some sweeping statements about discrimination against
    the Muslim community in Manila and elsewhere, it became  apparent  from
    her answers in cross-examination that she actually knew nothing at  all
    about the day-to-day experiences of followers of the  Muslim  faith  in
    Manila.  As she  said  herself,  she  was  brought  up  in  a  catholic
    community, not a Muslim community.  Moreover, she has  acknowledged  to
    her husband (see his witness statement) that there are people in Manila
    for whom Muslims were okay.

18. The claimant has demonstrated her independence from her family by going
    against their wishes and marrying Mr Karim.  Although there will  be  a
    degree of hardship for the couple in relocating to Manila, the lack  of
    financial support from her family  in  Manila  will  not  cause  severe
    hardship.  It  is  likely  that  the  couple  have  available  to  them
    sufficient savings from their earnings in the  UK  to  tide  them  over
    while they find employment.  As  the  claimant  has  worked  in  Manila
    before as a nurse, there is no reason to suppose that she cannot obtain
    employment as a nurse in Manila again, particularly as she will be able
    to rely on the qualifications she has obtained in the UK.  For Mr Karim
    the job opportunities will be more limited, but not  non-existent.   He
    can already speak English to some extent, and there is no reason why he
    cannot strive to improve his level of English.

19. In conclusion, I find  that  there  are  not  insurmountable  obstacles
    preventing the claimant continuing her  marital  relationship  with  Mr
    Karim in the Philippines, and thus she fails to fulfil the criteria  of
    EX.1(b) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

20. Turning to an Article 8 claim outside the Rules, I answer  questions  1
    and 2 of the Razgar test in the claimant's favour.  I answer  questions
    3 and 4 of the Razgar test in favour of  the  respondent,  and  so  the
    crucial question is that of proportionality.  On the Article 8(1)  side
    of the equation, it is the  private  life  rights  of  Mr  Karim  which
    principally militate against removal.  The claimant entered the  United
    Kingdom for a temporary purpose, and so  has  never  had  a  legitimate
    expectation of being able to carry on private or family life here on  a
    permanent basis.  In contrast, Mr Karim has now resided in  the  United
    Kingdom for some twelve  years,  and  has  become  a  British  citizen.
    Nonetheless, Article 8 does not confer on a couple the right to  choose
    where to carry on their married life.   When  the  couple  embarked  on
    their relationship, they knew, or are to be taken as knowing, that  the
    claimant's status in the United Kingdom was precarious, and they  might
    not be able to carry on their relationship here.  They were  even  more
    acutely aware of this fact by the time they got married.  For  by  that
    time the claimant's limited leave to remain had expired,  and  she  had
    applied for leave to remain as Mr Karim's fianc�e.

21. On the other side of the equation, I have taken into account the public
    interest considerations set out in Section 117B of  the  2002  Act,  as
    amended by the Immigration Act 2014.  The decision appealed against was
    made on the premise that the claimant did  not  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM, and thus was going to be a burden  on  the
    tax payer.  She  is  now  apparently  in  a  position  to  provide  the
    specified documents to show that she is earning at  least  �18,600  per
    annum.  Provided that she makes a new application for leave  to  remain
    under the Rules within 28 days of her appeal rights being deemed to  be
    exhausted, she will not be treated as an overstayer.  As this route  is
    available to the claimant, I find that the decision appealed against is
    proportionate to the legitimate  public  end  sought  to  be  achieved,
    namely the maintenance of firm and effective immigration controls.   It
    strikes a fair balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  rights  and
    interests of the claimant and her husband, and, on the other hand,  the
    wider interests of society.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted: this appeal is dismissed on all grounds raised.

No anonymity direction is made.
