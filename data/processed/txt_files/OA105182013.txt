For the Respondent:    Mr S Saleem, Legal Representative

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  in  Islamabad
   against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hillis)  to  allow
   the respondent's appeal from the refusal of  his  application  for  entry
   clearance as the spouse of a person who is settled in the United Kingdom.

2. The ECO refused the application on the ground  that  the  respondent  had
   not met the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
   Rules; namely, that the annual gross  income  of  the  respondent's  wife
   should equal at least  �18,600,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with
   savings of �16,000 plus a sum that is equal to 2.5  times  any  shortfall
   that may exist in her ability to meet the income  threshold.  Further  or
   alternatively, the ECO refused the application on  the  ground  that  the
   respondent had not met all the requirements to submit specified  evidence
   under appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules. I  shall  return  to  this
   aspect of the ECO's decision at a later stage of this determination.

3. The respondent had submitted payslips as evidence of his wife's  earnings
   with two different employers in the United  Kingdom;  namely,  'PMP'  and
   'Harehills DIY' [paragraph 14 of the judge's  determination].  There  was
   evidence that his wife's employment with PMP had commenced  on  the  28th
   October 2011 [paragraph 17]. However, she only  submitted  payslips  from
   the 6th July 2012 [paragraph 16]. There was also evidence  that  she  had
   begun her employment with  Harehills  DIY  on  the  10th  September  2012
   [paragraph 18]. She had accordingly submitted payslips in connection with
   that  employment  from  the  14th  September  2012  [paragraph  19].  The
   application was made on the 6th February 2013 [paragraph 15]. It followed
   from this that the respondent had submitted evidence of his wife's income
   over a period  of  only  7  months  immediately  preceding  the  date  of
   application. The judge sought to overcome this evidential  difficulty  by
   grossing up the income from the two employments to produce an average for
   a period of 12 months. He then added those  sums  together  in  order  to
   produce a total sum, which he calculated  to  be  �19,006.  He  therefore
   allowed the appeal on the ground that the decision was not in  accordance
   with Immigration Rules, because the annual  income  of  the  respondent's
   wife was "clearly in excess of �18,600"

4. Mr Diwnycz  sought  to  persuade  me  that  the  judge's  arithmetic  was
   incorrect. He was not however able to substantiate that claim because  he
   had not brought his notes with him. This is not in any  event  the  basis
   upon which permission to appeal was granted. The real point of the appeal
   (and that for which permission has been granted) lies in  the  fact  that
   the judge appears wholly to have overlooked the  evidential  requirements
   of Appendix FM-SE.

5. The relevant part of Appendix FM-SE reads as follows:


    2. In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where  paragraph
    9 applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:


    (a) Payslips covering:


         (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of  application  if  the
         person has been
         employed by their current employer for at least 6 months (and where
         paragraph
         13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); or
         (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of  12  months
         prior to the date
         of application if the person has been  employed  by  their  current
         employer for less
         than 6 months (or at least 6 months but the person does not rely on
         paragraph 13(a) of this Appendix),  or  in  the  financial  year(s)
         relied upon by aself-employed person.


    (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at  paragraph
    2(a) confirming:


         (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
         (ii) the length of their employment;
         (iii) the period over which they have been or were
         paid the level of salary relied
         upon in the application; and
         (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
    agency).

6. The point that had originally been taken by the ECO was that  the  letter
   from PMP did not contain any of the required information  and,  moreover,
   the letter from Harehills DIY did not specify  the  gross  annual  income
   that  was  payable  to  the  respondent's  wife  under  her  contract  of
   employment. It is  fair  to  say  that  these  matters  were  simply  not
   addressed by the judge.

7. However, it will also be seen (and this is the real point of the  present
   appeal) that it was not open to the judge to remedy the deficiency in the
   appellant's documentary evidence by calculating the average annual salary
   of his wife on  the basis of documentary evidence that covered  a  period
   of only 7 months. As his wife had only been employed by Harehills DIY for
   a period of five months prior to the date  of  application,  it  followed
   that the provisions of Appendix FM-SE required the respondent to  produce
   payslips covering a full 12-month period immediately preceding  the  date
   of application. It necessarily follows this that, had the  judge  applied
   the provisions of Appendix FM-SE to the facts of this  appeal,  he  would
   have been bound to conclude that the ECO's  decision  was  in  accordance
   with immigration rules.

8. However, the judge also found (presumably, in the alternative)  that  the
   appeal should be allowed on the ground that the decision to refuse  entry
   clearance was incompatible with the  respondent's  right  to  respect  to
   private and family life under Article 8 of the 1950  European  Convention
   for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms.  The
   rationale of that decision is contained in paragraph 25:

    As I have found all the requirements of paragraph 3-ECP.1.1 of appendix
    FM to the relevant standard of proof I find that any interference  with
    the Appellant's right to family life would  not  be  proportionate  and
    that the Appellant's rights to a private life with his spouse would  be
    breached if this appeal was refused. In my judgement, it would  not  be
    proportionate  to  the  UK  Government's  legitimate  aims  of   proper
    immigration control to require the Sponsor to  leave  her  job,  family
    members and life in the UK to go to Afghanistan to maintain her  family
    life.

9. That analysis is in my view flawed in three particular respects.


10. Firstly, the fact  that  the  appellant  had  been  found  to  meet  the
   substance (if not the form) of the financial requirements of Appendix  FM
   was of extremely limited relevance to the assessment under Article 8.  As
   was said in Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC):


    A person's human rights are not enhanced  by  not  committing  criminal
    offences or not relying on public funds. The only significance of  such
    matters in cases concerning proposed or hypothetical removal  from  the
    United Kingdom is to preclude the Secretary of State from  pointing  to
    any public  interest  justifying  removal  over  and  above  the  basic
    importance of maintaining a firm and  coherent  system  of  immigration
    control.

11. Secondly, the judge's analysis overlooks the fact that a State  has  the
   right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory,  and  the
   duty imposed by Article 8 cannot therefore be considered as extending  to
   a general obligation on the part of a Contracting State  to  respect  the
   choice by married couples of the country of their  matrimonial  residence
   and to accept non-national spouses for settlement  in  that  county  (see
   Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United  Kingdom  [1985]  ECHR  7,  at
   paragraph 67).

12. Thirdly, and  in  any  event,  the  question  was  not  whether  it  was
   disproportionate to require the respondent's wife to  move  to  Pakistan.
   Indeed, neither the ECO nor the UK Government has  any  power  to  impose
   such a requirement upon her. Rather, the appropriate question was whether
   it is disproportionate to require an applicant to  submit  the  documents
   that are required by the United Kingdom's immigration policy  as  a  pre-
   condition to settlement within its territory.

13. I have therefore concluded that the  judge's  incorrect  application  of
   the Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  for
   the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was such that his
   decision cannot stand and must be set aside. Both representatives  agreed
   that in the event of me reaching this conclusion, it would be appropriate
   to remake the decision without receiving further evidence. As it seems to
   me, there was only ever one appropriate outcome to the  appeal  that  was
   before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  that  was  to  dismiss  it.  The
   respondent (to this appeal) did not meet the Immigration Rules,  for  the
   reasons that I have already stated. Moreover, I can see nothing  that  is
   either unjustifiably harsh or disproportionate  about  requiring  him  to
   meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules - if necessary, by  making
   a fresh application - as a pre-condition to being permitted to settle  in
   the United Kingdom.

Decision

14. The appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer is allowed.

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  allow  the  appeal  against
   refusal of the respondent's application for entry clearance is set aside,
   and it is substituted by a decision to dismiss that appeal.
