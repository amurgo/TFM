Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms L Turnbull (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Entry Clearance  Officer,  now  the  appellant,  has  been  granted
    permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell
    allowing the appeal of the respondent refusing  her  application  under
    the immigration provisions relating to the Ankara Agreement.

2.   The respondent is a citizen of Turkey born on 26  February  1982.   She
    applied to the appellant for entry clearance in order to  establish  or
    operate a business  under  the  Turkey-European  Community  Association
    Agreement ("the Ankara Agreement").

3.   The respondent wishes to take over an existing  business,  known  as  [
                    ].  She proposes to purchase  an  established  business
    for the sum of �8,000.  She will be the  sole  owner  and  there  is  a
    projected annual turnover amounting to �77,800.  She also  proposed  to
    rent accommodation for her private residence.   As  the  company  is  a
    limited company she will take a monthly salary in the amount of �800.

4.   The relevant provisions applicable are set out in HC509 and  as  stated
    by the  ECO  an  application  under  the  Ankara  Agreement  provisions
    presupposes a right to take the benefit of the standstill clause.   The
    relevant Immigration Rules applied by the ECO are as follows:

         "If joining an established business, that he will be bringing money
         of his own to put into the business; that he will be able  to  bear
         his share of the liabilities; that his share of the profits will be
         sufficient to support  him  and  his  dependant;  or  the  actively
         concerned in the running of the  business;  and  that  there  is  a
         genuine need for his services and investment.  The audited accounts
         of the business for previous years will be required to be produced,
         in order to establish the precise  financial  position.   An  entry
         clearance will not be issued where it  appears  that  the  proposed
         partnership or directorship  amounts  to  disguised  employment  or
         where it seems likely that, to obtain a livelihood,  the  applicant
         will have to supplement his business activities by  employment  for
         which a work permit is required.


         If establishing a new business in the United  Kingdom  on  his  own
         account, that he will be bringing into the country sufficient funds
         to establish a business  that  can  realistically  be  expected  to
         support him and any dependants without recourse to  employment  for
         which a work permit is required."

5.   The Entry Clearance Officer  gave  various  reasons  for  refusing  the
    respondent's application.  There was a review by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager  who  conceded  that  there  was  funding  which  was  properly
    available to the respondent and that the concerns of the appellant were
    adequately addressed in that respect  within  the  grounds  of  appeal.
    However, the Entry Clearance Officer remained concerned overall at  the
    proposed transaction and noted that the respondent did not herself have
    experience of running a business.  The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  also
    stated that the decision did not  constitute  an  infringement  of  the
    human  rights  of  the  respondent  with  reference  to  the   European
    Convention.

6.   The Judge heard from the respondent's husband and  the  vendor  of  the
    premises.  He found that they gave evidence in a truthful manner.  This
    was significant as the evidence accepted lent strong  credence  to  the
    respondent's intentions. He found that the vendor of the business  gave
    credible reasons  for  being  willing  to  sell  the  business  to  the
    respondent.   He  was  satisfied  that  on  the   evidence   that   the
    respondent's intentions are genuine.

7.   The Judge held  that  the  respondent  currently  holds  a  responsible
    university administrative post.  Her husband, whose evidence  he  found
    credible, emphasised the degree of interest which the respondent has in
    culinary  matters.   In  the  light  of  the  oral  evidence  and   the
    documentary evidence the Judge accepted that the respondent is  capable
    of managing [                              ] and that the  business  is
    viable.

8.   The Judge found that the respondent's  husband  is  currently  employed
    and found him to be financially self-sufficient.  He  did  not  require
    the respondent to come to this  country  for  financial  reasons.   The
    respondent has demonstrated a good reason  for  wishing  to  acquire  [
                        ] in her own right.  She was  able  to  access  all
    information about the business from Turkey and the Judge did  not  find
    it unusual that the respondent has not sought to visit this country  to
    inspect the premises.  Her husband was able to do that quite adequately
    on her behalf.  It was for these reasons that  the  Judge  allowed  the
    appeal.

9.   The appellant's appeal challenges the Judge's finding at  paragraph  45
    that the business is viable.  The grounds submit that the judge  failed
    to take account of relevant evidence  which,  if  he  had,  would  have
    prevented him from reaching such a finding and would have precluded him
    from finding that the ECAA rules and requirements had been  met.   This
    is because at paragraph 5 of the determination where the Judge outlined
    the substance of the application where the  respondent  was  projecting
    annual turnover amounting to �77,800.  The grounds submitted that there
    was no detail on how that figure was  to  be  achieved.   The  evidence
    given by the current owner of the business and recorded at paragraph 35
    was that the current takings exceeded �20,000  per  annum.   The  exact
    figure is not specified but more importantly this discrepancy  (and  it
    must be a discrepancy because takings clearly in a caf� business equate
    to gross turnover) is not addressed at all by the Judge.

10.  I find that the grounds reflect the third ground given by the  ECO  for
    refusing the respondent's  application.   Therein  the  ECO  states  as
    follows:

         "(3) Your share of the profits will be sufficient  to  support  you
             and any dependant


             The business that you intend to purchase has shown a  turnover
             of between �63 to �65K GBP for the financial years to 2013 and
             2014 and  made  profits  on  these  of  6.5K  and  �7,048  GBP
             respectively.  You have no experience in this field but I have
             stated that you expect the turnover in the first  year  to  be
             �77,800 but still with  a  profit  of  �7,048  as  per  2014's
             figures.  You will have other charges  such  as  accommodation
             and bills outside of the business and whilst you say that your
             husband works, this has not been evidenced.   I  am  therefore
             not satisfied that your profits will be sufficient to  support
             you and any dependants."

11.  It is recorded at paragraph 35 of  the  determination  that  the  Judge
    asked the witness, some questions of clarification.  He confirmed  that
    the current takings exceeded �20,000 a year with the business  run,  as
    now, as a caf�.  The caf� had operated for  five  years.   Ms  Turnbull
    submitted that she had sought instructions and been told by the current
    owner that he did not give that confirmation in court and had not  used
    the word  "takings".   Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  argued  that  the  current
    owner's profit of �20,000 a year was not  reflected  in  the  evidence.
    She relied on the Profit and Loss Accounts for the year ending  31  May
    2014 prepared by [                   ]  at  pages  53  and  54  of  the
    appellant's bundle.  At page 56, the profit at 1 June 2013 was �15,315;
    at 31 May 2014 it was �22,393.  She submitted  that  the  ECO  did  not
    raise the viability of the business as an issue.   She  submitted  that
    the judge did not engage with the reasons set out in paragraph 3 of the
    ECO's refusal.

12.  I find that even if the current owner's profit of �20,000  a  year  was
    not reflected in the evidence, the profits at 1 June 2013 were not  far
    off; and the profits at 31 May 2014  exceeded  it.   I  find  that  the
    reasons given by the ECO as set out at paragraph 9  above  concern  the
    viability of the business  the  respondent  wished  to  take  over  and
    whether the projected profit figures given by the respondent  would  be
    sufficient to support  her  and  any  dependants,  in  this  case,  her
    husband.

13.  I bear in mind the positive credibility findings  made  by  the  Judge.
    The respondent's lack of experience was one of the reasons given by the
    ECO for questioning the respondent's  projected  profit  figures.   The
    judge considered it and accepted that the  respondent  was  capable  of
    managing the business.  The ECO questioned the projected profit figures
    because the respondent would have other charges such  as  accommodation
    and bills outside the business.  I note in  the  evidence  recorded  at
    paragraph  6,  that  the  respondent  said  that  private   residential
    accommodation would be at a likely rent of between �300 and  �500  each
    month.  This evidence was accepted by the judge in his overall findings
    and has not been challenged.

14.  Ms Turnbull submitted that the respondent's projected turnover  was  in
    respect of her evidence of the percentage increase of  2.36%  projected
    by her.   I note from the evidence that the respondent proposes to  pay
    herself a salary of �800 per month.  This equates  to  �9,600  a  year.
    Her husband's income was said to be �13,655 a  year.   This  gives  the
    couple an annual income of �23,255 which is over and above  the  income
    level for a couple set out in the Immigration Rules.  I find  that  the
    respondent and her husband can realistically support themselves on this
    income without recourse to  employment  for  which  a  work  permit  is
    required.

15.  Accordingly  I  find  that  the  judge  did  not  err  in  law  in  his
    conclusions.  His decision  to  allow  the  respondent's  appeal  shall
    stand.
