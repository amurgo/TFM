                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this appeal the Appellant is referred to as the Secretary  of  State
    and the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Nigeria,  date  of  birth  20  April  1952,
    appealed against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fletcher-
    Hill (the judge) who on or about  22  April  2014  allowed  the  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision, dated 9 July 2013, to refuse
    to vary leave to remain and make removal directions.

3.   The judge allowed the appeal under Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   It  was
    accepted that the Appellant could not  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, it would seem  with  reference  to  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE.

4.   On 30 October 2014 I concluded  that  the  judge's  reasoning  was  not
    adequate and in particular the judge had made no reference to the issue
    of the public interest in the assessment of proportionality.

5.   My conclusion  stands  notwithstanding  the  change  in  emphasis  when
    assessing Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules as demonstrated by
    the cases of MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, Nagre [2013]  EWHC  Civ
    720 (Admin), Ganesabalan [2014] EWHC 2712, Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74 and
    Ajila [2014] EWHC 3763 (Admin), as iterated in Oludoyi [2014] UKUT 539.

6.   It is of note that the judge heard a  significant  amount  of  evidence
    concerning the claims as to the availability of care  or  oversight  or
    access to treatment the Claimant might obtain in  Nigeria.   The  judge
    found that

         "...Unfortunately there was neither up-to-date medical  information
         concerning the Appellant's [the  Claimant]  current  prognosis  nor
         indeed any up-to-date evidence of her current  medication  and  the
         stability of her condition."

         (My parenthesis)

7.   The judge found having  regard  to  the  considerations  arising  under
    paragraph 276ADE, reliant upon the version in being at  the  time  that
    the Claimant still retained ties with Nigeria; the social, cultural  or
    family  ties.   The  judge  found  "she  clearly  does  but  they  (her
    relatives) are reluctant to involve themselves."  (My parenthesis)

8.    The  judge  found  the  Claimant  to  be  "a  fragile  and  vulnerable
    individual who seems  to  rely  heavily  on  her  daughter,  who  is  a
    healthcare professional, trained in mental health issues".  The grounds
    of the Secretary of State did not challenge  the  judge's  findings  of
    fact nor is there any  dispute  to  the  judge's  conclusion  that  the
    Claimant

         "...appears not to be able to access any support network or  indeed
         the  medication  which  is  crucial  to  her  wellbeing   and   any
         interference in that medical care would not be proportionate."

9.   For remaking the decision I  had  given  directions  that  any  further
    evidence relied upon should be served on the opposing  party.   At  the
    hearing the Claimant sought to enlarge upon the lack of  relations  who
    would be willing to care for her, a lack of  a  business,  as  she  had
    previously had before coming to the United Kingdom, to  return  to  and
    the medication being  taken  for  diabetes,  high  blood  pressure  and
    schizophrenia.  The Claimant confirmed that she did not  know  if  that
    treatment was available in Nigeria.   The  Claimant's  daughter  Modupe
    gave evidence and confirmed that when the Claimant was unwell  she  did
    not know what she was doing, the Claimant was financially dependent  on
    her and she repeated the difficulties likely to be faced on a return to
    Nigeria.  She confirmed that certain living relatives  in  Nigeria  had
    not made contact with the Claimant when she had last been  there.   The
    witness also confirmed her belief from searching, it  was  assumed  the
    internet, the limitations  of  access  in  the  Claimant's  village  to
    treatment and her concerns as to the effects of any relapse.

10.  In considering whether the Secretary of State's decision was  compliant
    with the European Convention on Human Rights I found that the  Claimant
    has a private life of which her  daughter  forms  part  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  I find that the effects of removal on the Claimant are likely
    to be significant.  I find that the Secretary of  State's  decision  is
    lawful and properly served purposes falling within Article 8(2) of  the
    ECHR.

11.  I do not find that there is adequate evidence to  address  the  claimed
    comparative  differences  between  mental  health  care   and   medical
    treatment available in Nigeria showing that it falls so far  below  the
    standard to be expected as to pose a risk to the Claimant's  health  or
    as to engage Article 3 ECHR.

12.  It may well be that the medical services are not in the same  class  as
    available in the United Kingdom but that of itself does not  entitle  a
    person to remain here.

13.  Evidence provided from the Country  of  Origin  Information  Report  of
    June 2013, reissued 3 February 2014, dealing with  mental  health  does
    not suggest that medication which the Claimant takes is  not  available
    either in terms of mental health requirements or for diabetes  or  high
    blood pressure.

14.  In these  circumstances  cases  such  as  Akhalu  (health  claim:  ECHR
    Article 8) [2013] UKUT 400 noted the difficulty if an individual was to
    remain in the United Kingdom and require healthcare at public  expense,
    which on the face would happen here, that plainly bears on  the  public
    interest in removal.  Public interest  is  an  issue  identified  as  a
    matter of the case law relating to  Article  8  in  the  assessment  of
    proportionality but also  arises  under  Section  117A  and  B  of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.

15.  The Claimant's problems on a return to Nigeria  are  not  insignificant
    but I find in the light of the judge's unchallenged findings  that  the
    medical evidence is not  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that  the  appeal
    should succeed under Article 8 in relation to the Claimant's moral  and
    physical  integrity.   Further,  in  relation  to  the  issue  of   the
    Claimant's private life in the United Kingdom it is plain that she  has
    had one and that part of her private life has been her contact with her
    daughter.  I do attach very substantial weight to the  public  interest
    in removal and managing immigration control.

16.  I take into consideration the  judge's  conclusions  having  heard  the
    evidence as to the lack of an accessible support network or of ease  of
    access to obtain  the  medication  required  and  those  were  material
    considerations in the assessment of proportionality.

17.  In this case I find that there is a  consideration  of  what  might  be
    called common humanity is material to  the  assessment  of  the  public
    interest in the Claimant's removal.  In my judgment, applying as  I  do
    the case law of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang [2007] UKHL 11 in  this
    truly exceptional case of the hardships of the  Claimant  as  a  single
    woman aged 62 on her own returning to live without home, family support
    or care, trying to survive  with  significant  mental  health  problems
    which although the public interest shows that the Respondent's decision
    is disproportionate.

18.  The original Tribunal's decisions in relation to the Immigration  Rules
    and in particular Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE stands.
