                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The first appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 4th  May  1975,
       and the other appellants are her children, who are all also citizens
       of Pakistan. The second appellant was born on 14th March  2002,  the
       third appellant was born  on  15th  November  2006  and  the  fourth
       appellant was born on 29th November 2011.  They  applied  for  entry
       clearance to join the sponsor, Mr Shabbir Ahmed, a British  Citizen.
       Mr Ahmed is the spouse of the first appellant,  the  father  of  the
       fourth appellant  and  the  step-father  of  the  second  and  third
       appellants. The applications were made on 7th July 2012, and refused
       on 5th December 2012 on the basis that the appellants could not meet
       the requirements of the Immigration Rules at paragraphs 281 and 301,
       primarily  because  there  was  insufficient  income  so  that   the
       appellants could not show that they would  be  adequately  supported
       without recourse to public funds. The appeals against the  decisions
       were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Sharp in a determination
       promulgated on the 5th February 2014.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Mark Davies on 3rd March 2014 on the basis that it was arguable that
       the First-tier judge had erred in law  in  considering  whether  the
       sponsor could show an "income threshold" when this was a case  under
       the old Immigration Rules not the new ones at Appendix  FM,  and  so
       this concept was not relevant.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law. At the start of the hearing I established
       that the Tribunal file did not contain the appellant's  bundle  that
       had been before the First-tier Tribunal,  however  Mr  Avery  kindly
       allowed his copy to be duplicated for the Tribunal.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. Ms Mardner submitted that Judge Sharp had erred in  law  because  he
       had not  looked  to  see  if  the  sponsor  had  adequate  funds  in
       accordance with KA and Others  (Adequacy  of  Maintenance)  Pakistan
       [2006] UKAIT 00065 but instead had looked to see  if  sponsor  could
       show "a regular income in excess of the threshold at either the time
       of  application  or  the  decision",  see  paragraph   16   of   the
       determination. Also Judge Sharp had failed to properly consider  the
       appeal under Article 8 ECHR, saying most peculiarly that: "Article 8
       of the ECHR does not apply to people in his position" with reference
       to the sponsor. Article 8 ECHR applies to existing family  life  and
       to the development of family life, see  R  (on  the  application  of
       Ahmadi) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 1721. The sponsor had lived in the UK
       for 16 years and  was  a  British  citizen  lawfully  and  genuinely
       married to the first appellant, and was the father  /step-father  of
       the other appellants.

    5. Mr Avery submitted that Judge Sharp had not erred in law in relation
       to his determination of the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
       Judge Sharp had clearly dismissed the appeal under  the  Immigration
       Rules because there was no  evidence  that  an  adequate  amount  of
       income could be shown. At paragraph 16 he  says  that  he  was  only
       satisfied that the sponsor had an income of a little  in  excess  of
       �800 a month as there was so little evidence. There was no reason to
       think that any use of the word "threshold" meant  that  Judge  Sharp
       had the wrong Immigration Rules in mind. Ultimately this case failed
       due to lack of evidence of adequate income, and  given  the  finding
       about the level of income clearly the appeal would  have  failed  on
       this point under paragraphs 281 and 301 of the Immigration Rules. Mr
       Avery accepted that Judge Sharp should not have said that Article  8
       did not apply to people in the sponsor's position. He also  accepted
       that there was a lack of detail in the analysis, although Article  8
       ECHR was addressed at paragraph 20 of the determination.

    6. I told the parties that I did not find that Judge Sharp had  made  a
       material error of law in respect of his determination of the  appeal
       under the Immigration Rules. However, I did find  that  Judge  Sharp
       had erred in relation to determination of the appeal under Article 8
       ECHR. The reasons for my decision are set out below. I set aside the
       decision of Judge Sharp under Article 8 ECHR  at  paragraph  20  his
       determination.

Evidence and Submissions for re-making the appeal under Article 8 ECHR

    7. The sponsor adopted his statement and  confirmed  it  was  true  and
       correct,  and  that  there  had  been  no  significant  changes   in
       circumstances since it was made. The sponsor explained that he stood
       by his claim that he had a net income of �1890 per  month  from  his
       newsagent, on line business, and helping another shop owner  at  the
       time of decision. He said he found it very difficult to maintain his
       family life by making trips to Pakistan as the three  trips  he  had
       made cost about �12,000 and he was away for 6 weeks each time  which
       seriously disrupted his businesses.  His  youngest  child  would  be
       three years old in November 2014 and he  had  only  seen  her  three
       times since she was born. His  business  would  not  survive  if  he
       continued in this way, whereas if his wife was in the UK this  would
       help him in his business. In answer to questions from me the sponsor
       explained that it would not be possible for him to set himself up in
       business in Pakistan as he was now seen as someone from the  UK.  He
       would face a lot of demands for money as the system was very corrupt
       in Pakistan, and those from the UK were viewed as very  wealthy.  He
       had seen others go back to Pakistan and try to establish  themselves
       in business and fail due to this problem.

    8. Mr Avery submitted that he relied upon the entry clearance  decision
       and the findings under the Immigration Rules made by Judge Sharp. Mr
       Avery submitted that the fact that the appellants could not  succeed
       under the new Immigration Rules  was  a  relevant  consideration  to
       Article 8 ECHR even though the application had been  made  prior  to
       the Article 8 ECHR being part  of  the  Rules  and  despite  of  the
       transitional provisions. This was clear from the case of Haleemudeen
       v SSHD [2014] EWCA  Civ  558.  If  Article  8  ECHR  was  considered
       generally then the decision was proportionate as the sponsor  cannot
       show adequate support for all  the  appellants  and  has  not  shown
       sufficient evidence that he could not  reasonably  have  his  family
       life in Pakistan.

    9. Ms Mardner submitted that  it  would  be  disproportionate  for  the
       sponsor and appellants to have their family life in Pakistan because
       the sponsor had lived in the UK for 16 years;  he  could  adequately
       support his family in the UK; and he would lose  the  investment  he
       had made in his business in the UK or be  forced  only  to  see  his
       family via visits which meant he had only seen his daughter on three
       occasions and was not able to bond with his step-children.

   10. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   11. The only issue at the appeals under paragraphs 281 and  301  of  the
       Immigration Rules was that of adequate accommodation  and  financial
       support.  Judge  Sharp  was  satisfied  that  there   was   adequate
       accommodation.

   12. Judge Sharp has not clearly set out the  legal  basis  on  which  he
       assessed the issue of the  adequacy  of  financial  support  in  his
       determination. He should have cited KA Pakistan  or  the  principles
       set out in that case, and  measured  the  sponsor's  income  against
       these. His reference to a "threshold"  was  unhelpful  and  possibly
       confusing. However there is no evidence that Judge Sharp had applied
       the financial amounts under Appendix FM, and he  certainly  did  not
       apply the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE.

   13. Judge Sharp makes it plain that he did not have evidence before  him
       in terms of payslips, letters from an accountant or  other  evidence
       that satisfied him that the there was "sufficient" income. He  found
       that the only evidence which related to the time of decision  showed
       that the sponsor earned a little over �800 a month, and this was not
       enough (see paragraph 16 of the determination). Even if Judge  Sharp
       did not adopt a clear framework for the financial assessment he  did
       make reasoned findings of fact as to the  level  of  income  of  the
       sponsor that he was entitled to reach on the evidence before him. Ms
       Mardner did not draw my attention to any evidence which showed  that
       Judge Sharp's conclusions on the facts as to the amount of income of
       the sponsor were perverse or factually wrong.

   14. The amount of income the appellants and sponsor would have needed to
       equal that provided by Income Support at the time of  decision  (the
       proper measure of adequacy under KA Pakistan) would have been  �2227
       (�1327 of income support for a couple plus three children plus  �900
       for the monthly rent). Thus if Judge Sharp had made a legal error in
       not directing himself clearly on this point it was  not  a  material
       error, as the level of monthly income the sponsor had shown  on  the
       balance of probabilities at the time  of  decision  (around  �800  a
       month) fell well below that needed to satisfy the Immigration  Rules
       relating to financial support when properly understood.

   15. Judge Sharp did err however in his determination of Article 8  ECHR.
       It was profoundly wrong for him to state that Article 8 ECHR did not
       apply to the sponsor: Article 8 ECHR  applies  to  everyone  in  the
       jurisdiction which clearly includes the appellant. The Supreme Court
       in Quila v SSHD [2011] UKSC 45 also  clarified  that  no  difference
       should be made between family life in an entry case as opposed to an
       expulsion case, as there was no different standard  in  relation  to
       positive or negative obligations. In  Quila  Lord  Wilson  explained
       that the old authority of Abdulaziz v UK 7 EHRR 471 should no longer
       be followed, and that  issues  of  the  possible  reasonableness  of
       family life being  exercised  elsewhere  should  be  dealt  with  in
       consideration of whether the decision to refuse entry  clearance  is
       justified. Judge Sharp therefore erred in not  finding  that  family
       life both existed in this case and was subject to an interference by
       the refusal of entry clearance, and by failing to conduct a reasoned
       proportionality assessment to ultimately decide if refusal of  entry
       clearance was a breach of Article 8 ECHR.

Conclusions - Re-making

   16. As set out above I am satisfied that the appellants and sponsor have
       family life together. The first appellant and sponsor are  genuinely
       married, and have had a child together (the fourth  appellant),  and
       the second and third appellants are the sponsor's step-children from
       the first appellant's previous marriage. There is a  further  child,
       Sharjeel Rasheed born on 13th March 2008 whom it was  also  intended
       to apply to bring to the UK in the future, who also  forms  part  of
       the family. The sponsor has made three visits to Pakistan since  his
       marriage on 2nd  April  2011,  and  is  clearly  distressed  by  his
       separation from the appellants.  I find that the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance interferes with the family  life  of  the  appellants  and
       sponsor, and that the  interference  is  of  sufficient  gravity  to
       engage Article 8 ECHR.

   17. The appellants cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules for the  reasons
       set out above so the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  is  in
       accordance with the law. The respondent justifies  the  interference
       with the appellants' family life in the interests of the maintenance
       of economic order by applying a  consistent  system  of  immigration
       control. It is not argued that the appellants have criminal  records
       or otherwise are not of good character.

   18. I must finally consider whether the  significant  interference  with
       the appellants' family life rights that refusal of  entry  clearance
       represents is justified as proportionate, and a fair balance between
       the competing considerations of the appellants' family life and  the
       respondent's  desire  to  maintain  economic  order  by  applying  a
       consistent system of immigration control.

   19. In favour of the appellants is the fact that the sponsor  cannot  be
       reasonably expected to relocate to Pakistan by virtue of his British
       citizenship. In  Sanade  &  Others  (British  Children  -Zambrano  -
       Dereci) [2012] UKUT 48 at point 5  of  the  head  note  it  says  as
       follows:  "Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano now makes it clear that  where
       the child or indeed the remaining spouse is a  British  citizen  and
       therefore a citizen of the European Union, as a matter of EU law  it
       is not possible to require the family as a unit to relocate  outside
       of the European Union or for the Secretary of State to  submit  that
       it would be reasonable for them to do so."

   20. Further at the time of decision the sponsor rented his own  home  in
       the UK and like Judge Sharp I am satisfied that there  was  adequate
       accommodation at the time of decision for all the appellants to join
       him here (this is verified by the tenancy  agreement).  The  sponsor
       clearly has strong private life connections in the UK  having  lived
       here for seventeen years at the date of decision, having come to the
       UK on 30th September 1995.The sponsor is a  business  man  with  two
       businesses, namely SKT Stars Limited  and  Mazzbro  Sports  Limited.
       This was accepted by Judge Sharp in his findings and is supported by
       evidence from Companies House for both  businesses,  a  letter  from
       Sarwar & Co chartered accountant regarding Mazzbro Sports  Ltd,  and
       amazon information about on-line sales. Judge  Sharp  also  accepted
       the the fact that the  sponsor  also  did  some  employed  work  for
       another lady running another shop called Sirwa Karem at the time  of
       decision, and I  note  that  the  appellants'  bundle  contains  six
       payslips dated 2013 for the sponsor from Sirwa Karem.

   21. The sponsor has not evidenced his contention that he would  struggle
       to set up a business in Pakistan due to  issues  of  corruption  and
       attitudes towards those who have settled for long periods in the UK.
       Whilst there is some logic behind this contention, and the pervasive
       extent of corruption in Pakistani society is  very  clear  from  the
       Country of Origin Information Report on Pakistan 2013, I cannot find
       that he would be unable to find work in Pakistan given his  historic
       links with that country and understanding of a relevant language and
       culture. However it is clear that a lot of  hard  work  in  building
       businesses in the UK would be sacrificed if the sponsor had to leave
       this country.

   22. I note in addition that the appellants in  this  case  are  of  good
       character  with  no  adverse  immigration  history;  from  the  visa
       applications forms it is clear that  the  first,  second  and  third
       appellants have suffered the tragic  loss  through  death  of  their
       previous husband and natural father in  2011;  and  that  the  first
       appellant has satisfied the respondent that she  has  the  necessary
       basic level of English language to integrate in this country.

   23. Mr Avery has argued that weight must be given to the fact  that  the
       appellants  could  not  meet  the  new  Article  8  ECHR   compliant
       Immigration Rules, despite the fact that this application  was  made
       prior to the coming into force of these Rules and in  spite  of  the
       fact that  transitional  provisions  in  HC  194  provide  that  the
       application was therefore to be dealt with under the old Rules (with
       no Article 8 ECHR provisions) as existed on 8th July 2012. He  cites
       the case of Haleemudeen in support of this. However I note that  the
       Court of Appeal authority of Edgehill and Bhoyroo v SSHD [2014] EWCA
       Civ  402  supports  my  view  that  the  new  Rules  can   have   no
       applicability to Article 8 ECHR applications made  before  9th  July
       2012  as  otherwise  the  express  provision  in  the   transitional
       provisions would be contradicted. I will therefore proceed  on  this
       basis as Haleemudeen does not deal with the judgment in Edgehill  or
       address the issue of the transitional provisions in any way.

   24. In favour of the respondent is the fact that the  appellants  cannot
       show an adequate level of financial support in the UK as Judge Sharp
       found the evidence taken as a whole only showed an income  of  about
       �800  a  month  for  the  sponsor,  which  would  have   only   been
       approximately equivalent to the monthly rent  and  left  the  family
       with no other income whatsoever. I am guided by Mr Justice Blake  in
       MM (on the application of) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 280 in his summary  of
       conclusions from paragraph 142. It is legitimate that the  Secretary
       of State try to ensure that migrant families are not  living  at  or
       near subsistence level and not perceived to be a long term drain  on
       the public purse through increased access to  state  benefits.  This
       case does not fall within the "less intrusive" responses set out  at
       paragraph 147 as, for instance, the level of income of  the  sponsor
       does not reach the minimum level proposed, there is no  evidence  of
       savings and there is no evidence  that  the  first  appellant  could
       contribute to the household  budget.  Further  I  have  insufficient
       information to find that there are other matters which would counter
       balance the lack of income in this case:  for  instance  I  have  no
       statements   or   other   information   about   any    compassionate
       circumstances  relating  to  the  situation  of  the  appellants  in
       Pakistan so must assume that there are none. Ultimately I  find  the
       very low income shown in this case means that the decision to refuse
       entry clearance  was  proportionate  in  accordance  with  the  UK's
       obligations  under  Article  8  ECHR  despite  the  factors  in  the
       appellants' favour, primarily concerning the  sponsor's  citizenship
       and connections to the UK, listed above.

   25. This is not a consideration in reaching my conclusion under  Article
       8 ECHR but merely an observation. The sponsor  has  claimed  in  his
       witness statement to  have  a  gross  annual  income  in  excess  of
       �35,000. If this is true, and if  he  produces  the  very  extensive
       documentary evidence required by Appendix FM-SE, for  which  he  may
       benefit from very careful legal advice  from  qualified  immigration
       law  experts,  then  fresh  applications  by  the  appellants  under
       Appendix FM would look likely to succeed on financial grounds.  They
       should be aware however if any required documentary evidence is  not
       supplied in the precise form set out in Appendix FM-SE that this  is
       likely to lead to further refusals.

Decision

   26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law in the determination  of  the  appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR.

   27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing the appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR is set aside.

   28. The appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR is re-made and dismissed.
