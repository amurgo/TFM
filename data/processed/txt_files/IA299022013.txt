       pending before the Upper Tribunal.

    2. The appellant's representatives have notified the Upper Tribunal  by
       letter dated  20 March 2014 that the appellant has now been  granted
       leave to remain under Article 8 of the ECHR.

    3. The appeal before the Upper Tribunal is therefore abandoned pursuant
       to section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002.
