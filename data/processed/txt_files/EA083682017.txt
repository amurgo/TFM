Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Papasotiriou, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a  citizen  of  France  born  in  1999.   He  made  an
    application on 26 June 2016 for a residence card as confirmation  of  a
    right  of  permanent  residence  pursuant  to  regulation  15  of   the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the   EEA
    Regulations").  That application was refused by  the  respondent  in  a
    decision dated 21 September 2017.

 2. The application was refused on the basis that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided adequate evidence to show that he has been a qualified  person
    as a worker, a self-employed person, a student, a jobseeker or a  self-
    sufficient person for a continuous five year period.

 3. The appellant's appeal against that  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Row on 9 December  2017.   There  was  no  oral  hearing
    because that was the basis upon  which  the  appellant  asked  for  the
    appeal to be decided.  Judge Row dismissed the appeal.   Permission  to
    appeal having been granted the appeal came before me.

 4. Judge Row correctly identified that the appellant had to establish that
    he had exercised Treaty rights for a continuous period of five years as
    a qualified person.  He identified the evidence that he had before  him
    and gave an appropriate self-direction on the burden  and  standard  of
    proof.  There was evidence before him which was, amongst other  things,
    to the effect that the appellant had been a student in  the  UK  for  a
    period of time.  Judge Row concluded however, that  that  evidence  did
    not show that the appellant had been a student for  the  required  five
    year period.

 5. The appellant's claim was that  he  had  been  a  student  studying  at
    Bradfield College between September 2013  and  June  2017  and  he  had
    produced a letter from Bradfield College confirming that that  was  the
    case.

 6. At para 7 Judge Row referred to two other letters.  Those were from the
    Lycee Fran�ais Charles de  Gaulle,  dated  10  September  2011  and  14
    September 2012.  The first of the letters recorded that  the  appellant
    had been a full-time pupil there from 7 September 2011, the second that
    he had been a pupil there  from  5  September  2012.   Judge  Row  also
    referred to a letter from the appellant's  GP  dated  1  October  2012.
    There were also some bank statements from 2016 and 2017.

 7. At paragraph 8 Judge Row said this:

         "It was not clear whether the  French  school  was  in  the  United
         Kingdom or not. The letter from the school dated 14 September  2017
         did not confirm when the appellant had left that establishment.  It
         was therefore still uncertain whether the appellant had been in the
         United Kingdom studying since 2011.  In any event there was  a  gap
         between 14 September 2012 and when the appellant began to study  at
         Bradfield College in September 2013."

 8. It was on the basis of those conclusions that he dismissed the  appeal,
    i.e. it was not clear whether the French school,  the  Lycee  Fran�ais,
    was in the United Kingdom. In addition, on the basis that the second of
    the letters from that school did not confirm when the  appellant  left,
    there was thus a gap between September 2012 and when he began to  study
    at Bradfield College in September 2013.

    Submissions

 9.  In  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  before  me  today  Mr
    Papasotiriou referred to  the  documentary  evidence,  submitting  that
    Judge Row had misapprehended the information contained in  the  letters
    from the Lycee Fran�ais.  Firstly, in that  there  was  information  on
    those documents that indicated that that was a school based  in  London
    and secondly in terms of the date of the  second  letter  as  being  14
    September 2017 whereas it was in fact dated 14 September 2012.

10. Mr Papasotiriou also relied on the GP's letter  dated  1  October  2012
    which it was said is some indication that the appellant  was  still  in
    the UK at that time and supported the contention that he was a student.
    That evidence helped to bridge the gap between September 2012  and  the
    September 2013 start date at Bradfield College.  He submitted that  but
    for those errors the judge would have found in favour of the appellant.



11. Ms Fijiwala on behalf of the respondent submitted that  Judge  Row  had
    come to conclusions to which he was entitled based on the evidence that
    was before him.  She  pointed  out  that  the  letter  from  the  Lycee
    Fran�ais dated 14 September 2012 was dated but a  few  days  after  the
    appellant's start date of 5 September 2012. The point made on behalf of
    the respondent is that it was not clear,  and  the  evidence  does  not
    show, that the appellant actually continued the  academic  year  there.
    Thus there was still the  gap  between  that  and  the  start  date  at
    Bradfield College.  It was submitted that the GP's letter does not show
    the exercise of Treaty rights to September 2013.

12. In his reply Mr Papasotiriou submitted that even if the letter dated 14
    September 2012 did not confirm completion of  the  academic  year,  had
    Judge Row considered the evidence properly and applied the  appropriate
    standard of proof of a balance of probabilities and taking into account
    the GP's letter dated 1 October 2012 evidencing his  residence  in  the
    UK, he would have concluded that the appellant  had  met  the  relevant
    requirements.  He further submitted that it was less likely than not or
    (putting it a little more clearly) more likely than not that  he  would
    have stayed in the UK as a student rather than  study  somewhere  else.
    The point was also made that there was continuity between  his  studies
    in the UK in year nine and then moving on to GCSEs.

    Assessment and Conclusions

13. I am grateful to both parties for their submissions which  clearly  set
    out the parameters of the appeal before  me.  Having  considered  those
    submissions and Judge Row's decision, I am satisfied that his  decision
    contains errors of law requiring it to be set aside.

14. There is an error of fact in that Judge Row  wrongly  referred  to  the
    date of the second letter from the Lycee Fran�ais as being 14 September
    2017 whereas in fact it was 2012. In the same paragraph (8) he seems to
    have understood the date correctly (14 September 2012) but there is  at
    the very least some confusion evident in that respect. In addition,  it
    was conceded on behalf of the respondent before me that actually  there
    was information before Judge Row in the letters from the Lycee Fran�ais
    which revealed that it was and is a school in London.  That information
    is to be found at the foot of the letters giving  the  address  of  the
    school as 35 Cromwell Road, London, SW7.  Furthermore as  submitted  on
    behalf of the appellant, the English translation which  forms  part  of
    the letters in both cases states that the  Lycee  is  a  French  public
    school and belongs to the  network  of  the  AEFE  (Agency  for  French
    Teaching Abroad).  That is a further  indication  that  the  school  is
    located elsewhere than in France.

15. I should also say that although Mr Papasotiriou said  that  because  it
    was not translated he did not seek to rely on it,  the  stamps  on  the
    letters bearing the name Lycee Fran�ais Charles de Gaulle have the word
    "Londres", but that needs no translation.

16. All those circumstances reveal that  that  the  school  is  in  London.
    Accordingly, in that respect Judge Row was also wrong when he  said  at
    para 8 that it was not clear whether  the  French  school  was  in  the
    United Kingdom or not.  Furthermore, it seems to  me  that  the  letter
    from the GP has more significance than Judge Row gave it.  It does  not
    establish that the appellant was exercising Treaty  rights  but  it  is
    evidence to some extent at least of the appellant's  residence  in  the
    UK.  It is not categoric evidence of residence because  he  could  have
    registered and then have left the UK but that does not appear likely in
    the light of the other evidence.

17. In addition, it appears that the error made by Judge Row  in  terms  of
    the date of the second letter and his misapprehension of  the  location
    of the Lycee Fran�ais cumulatively led him to the conclusion  that  the
    appellant was not studying in the UK and that there was a gap that  was
    unaccounted for between 2012 and 2013.

18. The point made on behalf of the appellant in terms of the  standard  of
    proof is in my judgement a  good  one  as  regards  the  likelihood  of
    continuity of studies.  If Judge Row had been deciding whether  he  was
    sure that the appellant had been resident in the UK  exercising  Treaty
    rights for the requisite period of five years he may have come  to  the
    conclusion that he was not. However, that is  not  the  standard.   The
    standard is the balance of probabilities.

19. The errors of law to which I  have  referred,  stemming  in  part  from
    errors of fact, are such as to require his decision to be set aside for
    the decision to be re-made.

20. My analysis of the evidence in the course of  this  judgment  indicates
    that in the re-making of the decision the correct outcome is  to  allow
    the appeal. That is because I am satisfied that the evidence  that  was
    before Judge Row and  thus  the  evidence  before  me  shows  that  the
    appellant has been exercising Treaty rights for a continuous period  of
    five years in the United Kingdom as a qualified person, that is to  say
    as a student.  Accordingly he is entitled to confirmation of the  right
    of permanent residence with reference to reg 15 of the EEA Regulations.



    Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision is set aside. I re-make  the  decision
    by allowing the appeal.



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I was invited to make a fee award in favour of  the  appellant  although  no
sum was specified. On behalf of the  respondent  it  was  pointed  out  that
documents which supported the appeal were only provided  during  the  course
of the appeal. On  behalf  of  the  appellant  it  was  submitted  that  the
appellant was unrepresented at the time of the application  and  on  appeal.
The respondent, it is said, should have reviewed the decision in  the  light
of the documentary evidence provided.

It appears to be accepted that the appellant provided some documents at  the
appeal stage. The FtJ's decision refers at [7]  to  (at  least)  the  school
letters having been provided with the  notice  of  appeal.  Those  documents
were not provided to the respondent  at  the  date  of  the  decision  under
appeal. It appears  that  other  documents  were  also  provided  after  the
decision since the  decision  itself  refers  to  very  little  having  been
provided by the appellant.

I have considered making a fee award and have decided not to make to make  a
fee award because the appellant could have provided  relevant  documents  at
the time of the application which may have made an appeal unnecessary.
