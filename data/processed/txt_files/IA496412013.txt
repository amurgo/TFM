Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Hussein, Counsel, instructed by Sky Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge Cohen made
    following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 28th May 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  18th  April  1990.   He
    first came to the UK on 29th January 2011 as a student with leave until
    31st July 2014.  On 24th May 2011 he was granted leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student until 30th August 2013.

 3. On 30th July 2012 he made a combined application for leave to remain in
    the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system
    and for a biometric residence permit.

 4. On 14th June 2013 the Secretary of State refused  that  application  on
    the basis that she was not satisfied that he met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  No points were
    awarded  in  respect  of  the  funds  held  in  a  regulated  financial
    institution nor in respect of funds disposable in the UK.

 5. The judge dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 6. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  his  decision  which  was
    granted by Judge McDade on 24th June 2014.

Findings and Conclusions

 7. The original judge appears to have overlooked the fact that he  had  no
    jurisdiction to consider this appeal.

 8. The Appellant was not entitled to appeal against the decision  of  14th
    June 2013 because he still had leave to remain in the UK.   Accordingly
    the decision does not fall within Section 82(2)(e) of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provides a right of appeal  where
    variation of a person's leave to enter or remain in the UK if, when the
    variation takes effect, the person has no  leave  to  enter  or  remain
    constitutes an appealable immigration decision.

 9. Since the Appellant still had leave to remain until  30th  August  2013
    the decision under challenge of 14th June 2013  is  not  an  appealable
    immigration decision.

10. Mr Hussein accepted that this was the position.

Decision

11. The judge erred in law.  His decision  is  set  aside.   The  following
    decision  is  substituted.   The  appeal  is  dismissed  for  want   of
    jurisdiction.
