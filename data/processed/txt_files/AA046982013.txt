For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Maguire,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This determination refers to parties as they  were  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The SSHD appeals against a determination by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mrs  J  C  Grant-Hutchinson,  dated  24th  June  2013,  dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal on asylum and humanitarian  protection  grounds  but
    allowing it under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. At the end of her determination, paragraph  52,  the  judge  said  that
    there was a "good arguable case" not covered by the  Immigration  Rules
    and going to the crux of the appeal in that the Appellant's  two  young
    daughters are illegitimate and do not have their father named on  their
    birth certificates.  She found it reasonably  likely  that  this  would
    give rise not only discrimination but to social stigma and to  concerns
    about the future social  welfare  of  the  children,  such  that  their
    Article 8 rights outweighed the public interest.

 4. The SSHD now criticises that conclusion as unreasoned, or  inadequately
    reasoned.   The  grounds  recite  evidence  of  schools   and   medical
    facilities to which the Appellant and her children would have access in
    India, and argue that there is no evidence that the  children's  rights
    would be breached due to being born out of wedlock and having no father
    listed on their birth certificates.

 5. On 12th July 2013 permission to appeal was granted on the view that  it
    was not clear on what the judge's conclusion was based, the  background
    evidence cited being general and not related to illegitimate children.

 6. Mr Winter accepted that the determination errs in law.   There  was  no
    evidence  before  the  judge  to  justify  the  conclusion  reached  at
    paragraph 52.

 7. Mrs O'Brien said that it followed  that  the  determination  should  be
    remade by dismissing the appeal also under Article  8.   Even  to  look
    outside the Rules, there had to be a  "good  arguable  case".   As  the
    Article 8 outcome  outside  the  Rules  had  no  evidential  basis,  it
    followed that the Rules applied, and there could be only one outcome.

 8. Mr Winter submitted that the Upper Tribunal in  remaking  the  decision
    could admit such new evidence and make such further findings of fact as
    it thought appropriate.  He said that even on the evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, there was a good arguable case for the  appeal  to
    be allowed not on the disadvantages of illegitimate children in  India,
    but on the best interests of the children.  They are now aged 6 and 4ï¿½.
     Their mother suffers from medical problems, including depression.  She
    is of a poor village background and limited education, likely  to  find
    only low-paid work in  India.   Her  parents  are  elderly.   The  case
    involved some delay on the side of the Home Office.  The Appellant came
    to the UK as a spouse but remained after the breakdown of her marriage.
     She came to light apparently after an enforcement visit (perhaps based
    on a tip-off) in 2006.  Since then she has complied  with  Home  Office
    reporting requirements, and has not failed to cooperate.  The  children
    are doing well.  Both are now at  school,  and  the  younger  has  just
    started her first primary year.  The situation for children in India is
    brought out in the Respondent's Country of Information Report (COIR) at
    24.04  onwards.   Given  the  Appellant's  mental  health  and  general
    situation, her children are likely to be among the  more  disadvantaged
    in India.  It would be a reasonable inference that they might end up at
    a young age in the child labour force.   Section 25 of  the  COIR  sets
    out the potential  disadvantages  for  children  and  particularly  for
    females - high mortality rate, illiteracy, sexual and  physical  abuse,
    child labour and so on.  These are prospects which the  children  would
    not face in the UK.  Mr Winter accepted  that  the  availability  of  a
    resettlement package from the Respondent is relevant, but he said  that
    could not cover the long-term, and in a case involving  young  children
    it was crucial to look further into the future.  No  enforcement  steps
    were taken against the Appellant since it was identified that  she  was
    here illegally, and both children  were  born  since  then.   The  Home
    Office policy document "Every Child Matters", November 2009, opens with
    the words, "Improving the way  key  people  and  bodies  safeguard  and
    promote the welfare of children as crucial to  improving  outcomes  for
    children".  It could not possibly be in the better interests  of  these
    children to be sent back to India rather than to live in  the  UK.   In
    summary, on return they would be among the more  disadvantaged  section
    of the Indian population; they have lived here all their  lives  up  to
    the present, respectively reaching the ages of 6 and  4;  there  is  no
    public interest  of  substance;  and  the  appeal  should  be  allowed,
    although along another line of evidence and reasoning.

 9. Mrs O'Brien next submitted that it is essentially now argued  that  the
    prospects for the Appellant's children are not  generally  as  good  in
    India as in the UK.  That is not enough.  Although the Respondent  took
    no steps to remove the Appellant, she was  under  a  responsibility  to
    leave the UK.  She was  awaiting  a  decision,  but  had  no  remaining
    status.  The crux of  the  case  was  that  the  Appellant  wanted  her
    children to  take  advantage  of  the  educational  and  welfare  state
    provision available in the UK.  She had her problems, but  there  could
    be no doubt that she would do her best  to  maintain  herself  and  her
    family in India if she had to.   Some  of  the  family's  disadvantages
    would apply in the UK as they did in India.  The Secretary  of  State's
    duty to promote the welfare of children was not to be equated to a duty
    to enable foreign children to have access to free education and welfare
    in the UK.  The reintegration package offered by the Respondent is  not
    simply a sum  of  money.   Packages  are  tailored  to  the  individual
    circumstances of a returnee, and are intended to help them get back  on
    their feet, not only to last for a short period  and  then  leave  them
    with nothing.  The Appellant's children are bilingual and of a cultural
    background and age such that they should have no real  difficulty  into
    integrating into Indian society, even though have not yet  been  there.
    It was not disproportionate to expect the Appellant to return to  India
    and that her children should go with her.

10. Mr  Winter  finally  submitted  that  any  immigration  faults  of  the
    Appellant should not be visited on her  children.   The  situation  the
    children would face on return could not sit  with  the  terms  of  Home
    Office policy on promoting children's welfare.  The  interests  of  the
    children should customarily  dictate  the  result  of  the  case.   The
    Appellant herself has  an  unfortunate  history  and  is  a  vulnerable
    person.  It is not a case of seeking a free  education  and  guaranteed
    future for her children.  There are  adverse  factors  in  India  which
    differentiate the case from that.

11. I reserved my determination.

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's conclusion on the children's Article  8
    rights has been  agreed  to  have  no  evidential  basis.   In  a  case
    involving the best interests of children, I am reluctant to  hold  that
    it follows that the determination  is  simply  reversed.   I  therefore
    consider whether the best interests of the children require the  appeal
    to be allowed.

13. Although Mr Winter said that further evidence could be  looked  at,  he
    put the case about the children  essentially  on  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and in the public domain.

14. The case involves only whether it is in the best interests of the child
    to live with and be brought up by their mother in India or in  the  UK.
    There is no question of separation of children and parent.   The  other
    parent plays no meaningful part in their lives, and  the  little  known
    about him suggests that he has no right to be in the UK.

15. The children have been in the UK throughout their lives, but  they  are
    still in their earlier years, so as to be primarily  focused  on  their
    mother, and not to have formed such ties outside the family that  their
    disruption will impact significantly on  their  wellbeing.   They  have
    been brought  up  to  be  bilingual  and  there  should  not  be  great
    difficulty for them in adjusting to life in India.

16. It does not appear that the children will be among the more  advantaged
    parts of the Indian population, but (as the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    found at paragraph 49) the Appellant, despite any health problems, will
    do the best she can for them.  She has an  unfortunate  background  and
    history, but she is not helpless.

17. The assistance with return offered by the Respondent  is  an  important
    factor.  As narrated at  paragraph  28  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination, a  package  is  offered  including  support  in  finding
    employment, housing and childcare.  As the Presenting Officer  said  in
    the Upper Tribunal, this is not just a lump sum, leaving the family  to
    get on with it, but an individually tailored scheme.

18. The case attracts some sympathy for the  Appellant'  personal  history,
    and for the children, but the argument on their interests does  resolve
    essentially into  the  free  education  and  other  welfare  advantages
    available in the UK.  On return to India, it does not appear that  they
    would be brought up as part of the rising  middle  class,  but  with  a
    caring mother and a resettlement programme, nor would they  be  amongst
    the worst off.  The submissions for the Appellant  emphasise  the  most
    dreadful features of  the  lives  of  many  children  in  India.    The
    background excerpts in the Respondent's grounds of appeal draw  on  the
    same sources to emphasise more positive features of life in India  even
    for many less advantaged children.  There is no guarantee of a glorious
    future for the children in the UK, and no reason  to  think  that  they
    must be dragged into degradation  and  despair  if  they  return.   The
    submission that they might end up as child labour goes too  far.    The
    extent to which they might be better off by remaining  here  cannot  be
    measured with any exactitude, but I do not find the evidence persuasive
    that they would be badly disadvantaged by return to India.

19. The Appellant came here lawfully.  She stayed on after she knew she was
    not entitled to be here.  This is not a case of a very bad  immigration
    history, but nor is it one where the Respondent delayed a  decision  on
    an application.  Her children have lived here from birth, but  are  not
    UK citizens.

20. The public duty to respect the best interests of children is not a duty
    to extend state provision to relatively poor families  from  relatively
    poor countries.  The  Appellant  asks  for  a  finding  that  the  best
    interests of the children outweigh the public interest  so  far  as  to
    entitle them to remain here with their  mother  rather  than  returning
    with her, and with public assistance, to India.  That  would  impose  a
    high duty on the state  to  advance  the  interests  of  the  children,
    notwithstanding the state's declared policy in terms of the Immigration
    Rules, and the assisted return.

21. I conclude, in the round, that the children's best  interests  in  this
    case are not likely to be adversely affected to such an  extent  as  to
    outweigh the public interest in  the  application  of  the  Immigration
    Rules (as explained in Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL at paragraph 16).

22. The determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.    The
    following decision is substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to
    the First-tier Tribunal, now  stands  as  dismissed  on  all  available
    grounds.
