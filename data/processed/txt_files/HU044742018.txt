Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Jegarajah, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq who applied for entry  clearance  to
    the United Kingdom  on  the  ground  of  family  life.  The  Respondent
    considered  the  application  against  the  requirements  EC-P.1.1   of
    Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC395  (as   amended).   The
    application was refused and the Appellant appealed.

 2. Following a hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 17 December 2018,
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Keane  dismissed  the  Appellant's
    appeal.

 3. He sought permission to appeal which was granted by Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Cruthers on 21 January 2019. His reasons for so  granting
    were: -

         "l.  This  appeal  -  against  a  spouse  entry  clearance  refusal
         decision dated 25 January 2018 - stands dismissed by a decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane. Having assessed the evidence,  the
         judge concluded  that  the  appeal  did  not  succeed  through  the
         application of article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights.

         2.   In deciding that a grant  is  appropriate  here  (but  without
         restricting that grant), I offer the following comments:

             -    paragraphs 11 to 15 of the grounds suggest that the judge
             should  have  found  that  the  appellant  met  the   relevant
             requirements of the immigration rules. But it appears that  at
             the hearing on 23 October 2018 Counsel for the  appellant  was
             notable to put forward an argument as to how the appellant met
             / meets the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules  -  see
             paragraphs 5 and 6 of the decision under consideration

             -    however, it seems to me that paragraphs 7 to  10  of  the
             grounds are arguable in that is it  arguable  that  the  judge
             materially applied a test of "precariousness" -  a  test  that
             arguably has no relevance in out of country appeals  (such  as
             this one) (see the judge's paragraphs  11  on).  In  addition,
             referring to paragraphs 16 to 19 of the  grounds,  it  may  be
             arguable that if  the  judge's  reasoning  was  based  on  the
             perceived  reasonableness  of  the  appellant's  spouse  ("the
             sponsor") and their son relocating to  Iraqi  Kurdistan,  then
             that reasoning is not sustainable (cp, for example,  paragraph
             44 of KO and others [2018] UKSC 53, 24 October 2018).

         3.   Overall, there is sufficient in the grounds to make a grant of
         permission appropriate. But the appellant and  sponsor  should  not
         take this grant of permission as any  indication  that  the  appeal
         will ultimately be successful."

 4. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 5. The Appellant's Sponsor was present at today's hearing. At  the  outset
    Ms  Jegarajah  asked  if  she  could  draw  my  attention   to   recent
    developments in that the Sponsor gave birth to the Appellant's child on
    3 February 2019.  That  child  remains  an  inpatient  in  a  neo-natal
    specialist care facility  and  as  of  today,  the  child's  ill-health
    remains undiagnosed. Further the Sponsor continues to work on  a  part-
    time basis. It was Counsel's intention to persuade me that Judge  Keane
    had materially erred in his decision and to remake that decision  today
    allowing the  appeal  and  taking  into  account  further  evidence  in
    relation to the Appellant's new-born child. That evidence was contained
    within a bundle which she asked me to consider both  at  this  juncture
    and again prior to my rising to consider whether or not the  Judge  had
    in fact materially erred as asserted. On both occasions I rejected  the
    bundle of evidence as it did not go to the immediate issue before me as
    to whether or not there was  a  material  error  within  Judge  Keane's
    decision.

 6. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant is  an  Iraqi  Kurd
    and qualified veterinarian. He met the  Sponsor  in  May  of  2017.  In
    November of the same year an application was made for  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom under Appendix FM to  the  Immigration  Rules  to
    join his wife in the United Kingdom. The entry clearance officer  found
    that ï¿½2000.00 of the funds were not properly  evidenced.  There  was  a
    further issue concerning the absence of a valid medical certificate  in
    relation to screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis. However,  this
    issue was resolved at the hearing by  an  unequivocal  concession  that
    appropriate medical evidence had then been presented. Beyond the  issue
    of the Appellant's inability to meet the financial requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules the appeal was also considered under Article 8 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights. The Appellant's  first  child  was
    born on 23 January 2018 and at the date of hearing was  9  months  old.
    One of the  issues  central  to  this  appeal  is  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's Counsel, Mr S Canter, at the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    conceded that the Appellant could not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. It is recorded within paragraph  5  of  the  Judge's
    decision as follows: -

         "... Mr Main further submitted that the Appellant had not satisfied
         the eligibility financial requirement of the applicable Immigration
         Rules at the date when the application for entry clearance was made
         and Mr Canter agreed with such a submission."

 7. The grounds seeking permission to appeal are three-fold. It is asserted
    that the Judge has applied the "fundamentally wrong test" at  paragraph
    11 of his decision. It states there: -

         "11. It is necessary for me to arrive  at  a  finding  whether  the
         instant appeal disclosed a precarious family life. I find that  the
         instant appeal did disclose a precarious family life. The appellant
         has at no time had a right to reside in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
         appellant and Mrs Kerim commenced a relationship,  which  became  a
         marital relationship, at a time when each knew, or surely should be
         taken as having known, if they  had  averted  their  minds  to  the
         matter, that their family life insofar as it concerned  a  prospect
         of living together in the United Kingdom was precarious because the
         appellant did not have a right to reside in the United Kingdom."

    I have deliberately  set  out  this  paragraph  in  full  so  that  the
    reference to a "precarious family life" is seen within the  context  it
    was written. Ms Jegarajah submitted that the question of precariousness
    of family life simply does not arise in an entry clearance case of this
    kind  where  the  applicant  for  entry  clearance  is  seeking  lawful
    permission  to  the  United  Kingdom  under  the   Immigration   Rules.
    Accordingly, she contended that Judge Keane's reference to  R  (on  the
    application of Agyarko) (Apellant) v SSHD (Respondent) [2017]  UKSC  11
    had no bearing. The Judge has further erred  at  paragraph  12  of  his
    decision in considering the question of proportionality in the  context
    of the maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control.  However,  the
    Appellant is not an immigration offender nor a person who  has  had  or
    has leave to remain of any kind. For this reason, Ms Jegarajah  asserts
    that the Judge's "reasoning is profoundly flawed".

 8. Mr Whitwell submitted that the reference to  "precariousness"  was  not
    made in the context of section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002. He submitted that the Judge had not erred as  asserted
    by his opponent.

 9. Dealing firstly with this ground I find that it  is  quite  simply  not
    made out. On reading the Judge's decision as a whole it is  plain  that
    at no point in time does he have in mind the issue of  "precariousness"
    in the context put forward by Ms Jegarajah and consequently  it  cannot
    be said that there has been an application of the "fundamentally  wrong
    test". The Judge is not seeking to apply a test that has no bearing  on
    entry clearance cases.  He  is  looking  at  the  family  life  of  the
    Appellant and coming to a conclusion that was open to be  made  on  the
    evidence regarding its very nature. He has come to that  conclusion  in
    the  setting  of  the  entire  factual  matrix,   including   Counsel's
    concession as to the ability of the Appellant to meet  the  Immigration
    Rules, and within the required balancing exercise finding, as  he  did,
    that exceptional and compassionate circumstances were  not  established
    in this appeal.

10. Secondly, it is submitted that the Judge erred in not  making  findings
    in respect of the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  The  application
    was made when the Sponsor was nine months pregnant and  the  Judge  has
    failed to recognise the Sponsor's advanced pregnancy which should  have
    lead the Judge to conclude that it would be  fair  and  just  to  apply
    evidential flexibility in respect of omissions within the evidence. The
    Judge has failed to make findings in respect of these issues.

11. Mr Whitwell submitted that it was unnecessary for the Judge to set  out
    these issues given the concession that  was  made  by  the  Appellant's
    Counsel at the hearing as detailed earlier in my decision.

12. The simple fact is that the Judge cannot be  said  to  have  materially
    erred by accepting this concession. The Appellant  was  represented  by
    Counsel at the hearing. He had his instructions which were conveyed  to
    the Judge who in the circumstances had no alternative but to accept the
    concession and move on to consider the appeal outside  the  Immigration
    Rules. In the circumstances the Judge cannot be criticised (even if  it
    was open to him) for failing to apply evidential  flexibility  and  for
    factoring into his balancing  exercise  the  Appellant's  inability  to
    satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

13. Finally, Ms Jegarajah submits that the Judge's decision  is  irrational
    in that it expects a British citizen and her son to live in  Kurdistan.
    She refers in her grounds to paragraph 109 of the R  (MM  (Lebanon))  v
    SSHD [2017] UKSC 10 and 67 of Agyarko and  asserts  that  in  light  of
    those decisions the entire  paragraph  12  of  Judge  Keane's  decision
    "falls away". In a case where there is a British citizen child there is
    no question of the mother and  child  relocating.  British  citizenship
    itself constitutes insurmountable obstacles to relocation.  This  is  a
    case where a family are to be permanently separated. The Sponsor  meets
    the financial threshold and the Appellant has been separated  from  his
    child for a year since birth. Given  the  Supreme  Court's  declaration
    that the spouse visa rules are unlawful in respect of Section 55 of the
    BOIC 2009, there is recognition of this in this appeal as the  pregnant
    Sponsor is expected to meet the financial threshold when pregnant.  She
    has taken up two jobs to support the Appellant. This, it is  submitted,
    amounts to good reason as to why the appeal should be  allowed  with  a
    direction that entry clearance be granted forthwith.

14. Mr Whitwell submitted that being a British citizen is  no  obstacle  to
    relocation as can be seen by the very facts in this  appeal  where  the
    Appellant and his Sponsor were able to meet up in Turkey (and where  Ms
    Jegarajah informed me the Appellant's second child had been conceived).



15. Like the first two grounds there is no merit in this one either.  There
    is no irrationality in the Judge's decision. He was entitled  to  find,
    as he did, that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  to  relocation
    and that the Appellant's family life could be  conducted  in  Iraq  (or
    indeed elsewhere) there was evidence that the Sponsor had not lost  all
    connection with that country including the fact that she  had  returned
    there on four occasions and was able to speak Kurdish Sorani. Given the
    Judge's findings in relation to the failure of the Appellant to be able
    to meet the Immigration  Rules  the  conclusion  that  he  came  to  in
    relation to Article 8 was open to  be  made.  It  has  been  adequately
    reasoned.

16. There is here no material error of law.
