                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent, Shahriar Mannan Rony (the Applicant) is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh born on 7 March 1981.  On 6 February 2007 he was given leave
    to enter as a student. His leave was extended in  different  capacities
    several times, eventually expiring on 24 June 2016. On the  day  before
    expiry he lodged an application for applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) migrant which application on 7 February he
    varied to an application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of
    10 years' continuous law for residence.

The SSHD's Original Decision

 2. On 8 January 2018 the Appellant  (the  SSHD)  refused  the  application
    because  the  Appellant  did  not   meet   the   relevant   suitability
    requirements of paragraphs 276B and 322(5) of the  Immigration  because
    having regard to the public interest it was undesirable  to  grant  him
    indefinite leave in the light of his conduct. At  page  3  the  reasons
    letter of 8 January 2018 identifies the relevant conduct.

 3. The SSHD noted the Applicant's application of 3 June 2013  for  further
    leave as a Tier  1  (General)  migrant  claimed  previous  earnings  of
    �52,735. �30,435 was attributable to employment and  �22,300  to  self-
    employment for the period ending May 2013.  The  SSHD  noted  that  the
    Applicant's tax return to HM Revenue & Customs for the  year  ending  5
    April 2013 showed a total  income  from  all  sources  of  �38,904  and
    concluded the Applicant had either failed to declare his full  earnings
    to HMRC or had  falsely  represented  his  earnings  to  UK  Visas  and
    Immigration.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

5.   By a decision promulgated on 7 November 2018 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal MR Oliver found the Applicant had given a  clear  explanation,
    identifying  the  SSHD's  misunderstanding  of  his  tax  affairs.  The
    relevant period for purposes of his 2013 tax return and  for  his  June
    2013 further leave application were not identical and two months of the
    Applicant's income declared to UKVI fell within a different  tax  year.
    He went on to allow the appeal.

6.   On 6 December 2018 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Povey  granted  the
    SSHD permission to appeal because it was arguable  the  Judge  had  not
    given adequate reasons for accepting the  Applicant's  explanation  and
    dismissing the SSHD's objections.

Proceedings in the Upper Tribunal

7.   The Applicant attended the  hearing  but  other  than  to  confirm  his
    current address took no active part.

8.   Mr Whitwell confirmed the SSHD did not  intend  to  pursue  the  second
    ground for appeal that the Judge made a material misdirection of law on
    a material matter but would proceed on the first ground that the  Judge
    had failed to provide  reasons  or  adequate  reasons  to  support  his
    findings.

9.   The Applicant had disclosed in his June 2013  application  for  further
    leave earnings of �52,735 and in his 2013 tax return had declared  only
    �38,905: a difference of almost �14,000. Further, in the year ending  5
    April 2013 the Applicant had  been  earning  approximately  �1793  each
    month at Whitbread (Costa Coffee). In the month  of  May  2013  he  had
    received from this same source �8656. It was accepted he  had  produced
    evidence that tax on that month's earnings had been  paid  in  the  tax
    year 2013/2014. Paragraph 12 of the Judge's decision  was  inadequately
    reasoned and failed to address the issues  raised  on  page  3  of  the
    reasons for refusal letter. Mr Whitwell agreed that the SSHD's  concern
    was mainly focused on the Applicant's May 2013 earnings of  �8656  from
    Whitbread with which the Judge had not adequately dealt.

Submissions for the Applicant

10.  Mr Biggs explained there was no discrepancy in the  figures  which  the
    Applicant had declared to HMRC and UKVI: the  income  was  received  at
    different times and in different tax years. The SSHD had not  made  any
    allegation  that  the  Applicant  had  not  earned  �8656  working  for
    Whitbread in May 2013. The Applicant had produced evidence of this  and
    furthermore the earnings would have been reported by Whitbread to  HMRC
    and Whitbread would have accounted to HMRC for the tax  deducted  under
    the PAYE scheme. The Applicant had  also  produced  HMRC's  form  SA302
    which confirmed the income for the tax year ending 5 April  2014  which
    will have included the May 2013 earnings of �8656 from Whitbread.

11.  The  income  which  the  Applicant  had  disclosed  in  his  June  2013
    application to UKVI was consistent with HMRC records for  the  relevant
    years ending 5 April 2013 and 2014.

12.  The Judge had adequately addressed these issues. At paragraph 8 of  his
    decision he had explained that the income declared to HMRC and  claimed
    to UKVI covered different periods and had accepted the  explanation  of
    this given in the Applicant's accountants' letter of 31 August 2018. He
    had summarised this at paragraph 12  of  his  decision.  There  was  no
    actual discrepancy to be explained. The decision  did  not  contain  an
    error of law and should stand

Further Submissions for each party

13.  Mr. Whitwell raised the point that  the  SSHD's  bundle  had  not  been
    before the Judge at the hearing.  Mr  Biggs  responded  that  the  only
    relevant additional document was the statement from HMRC but  this  did
    not  assist  the  SSHD  because  it  merely  confirmed  the   evidence,
    particularly that of the Applicant's accountants, which  was  contained
    in the Applicant's bundle. As he had already  submitted,  the  evidence
    showed there was no discrepancy in the income figures declared to  HMRC
    and claimed in the further leave application to UKVI. Mr  Whitwell  had
    no further submissions to make.

Consideration and Conclusion

14.  I understand the concern that the Applicant's  earnings  for  May  2013
    from Whitbread are almost 5 times the  average  monthly  earnings  from
    this source for the tax year ending  5  April  2013.  I  note  that  no
    explanation has been given how it was that the Applicant came  to  earn
    so much in May  2013.  Despite  the  absence  of  an  explanation,  the
    Applicant has produced evidence to show both that the amount was earned
    and has been declared to HMRC. Payment of  tax  would  have  been  made
    under the PAYE scheme. The Applicant's accountants have  explained  why
    what appears to be an inconsistency is not, namely because the  periods
    for which the Applicant had to account to HMRC and  to  UKVI  were  not
    synchronous.

15.   The  Judge  dealt  adequately  with  these  issues,   principally   at
    paragraphs 8 and 12 of  his  decision.  It  is  fair  to  say  that  an
    understanding of the difference between the period of account  and  the
    year in which  a  return  of  tax  should  be  submitted  would  be  of
    assistance in understanding the Judge's reasoning. He was  entitled  to
    assume that his decision  would  be  read  in  the  light  of  such  an
    understanding. He was not obliged  to  detail  HMRC's  rules  on  these
    issues.

16.  The Judge  gave  proper,  adequate  and  sustainable  reasons  for  his
    decision. He was not required to explain basic  principles  of  revenue
    law. His decision contains no material error of law and shall stand.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error of law
    and shall stand.  The consequence is that the appeal  of  the  SSHD  is
    dismissed and the Applicant's original appeal has been allowed.

    No anonymity direction is made.
