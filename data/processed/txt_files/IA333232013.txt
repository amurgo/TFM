    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr F Junior a legal
           representative from UK Immigration Consultants
          For the Respondent: Mr E Tufan a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on 1 July  1978.
      He has been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Herlihy ("the FTTJ") who dismissed his  appeal  against
      the respondent's decision of 23 May 2013 to refuse to vary  his  leave
      to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant. The  appellant
      had made a joint application with Mr Syed Abu Asad.  Together  I  will
      refer to the appellant and Mr Asad as the applicants.

   2. The respondent refused the application because she was  not  satisfied
      that the documents which had been submitted by the applicants met  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules. The appellant was not  entitled
      to 25 points for access to funds under paragraph 245DD (b) because  of
      three defects. Firstly, the letter from the third party was not  valid
      because it was not signed by the applicants. Secondly,  the  Notarised
      Certificate submitted from the third parties legal representative  did
      not give details of the registration authority  for  him  to  practice
      legally in Bangladesh. Thirdly, the letter from Citibank  Limited  did
      not include the third-party's telephone number or email  address.  The
      respondent also concluded that Mr Asad was not entitled to  10  points
      for funds under Appendix C because the Barclays bank statements  which
      he had submitted did not demonstrate that he held the  required  funds
      for the required period. For part of that period the amount fell below
      the ï¿½900 threshold.

   3. The claimants appealed and the FTTJ heard their appeals on 24 February
      2014. Both sides were represented, the  claimants  by  Mr  Junior  who
      appears before me. The FTTJ found that the documents submitted by  the
      claimants did suffer from the defects alleged by  the  respondent  and
      did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules. The FTTJ  went
      on to consider whether there were evidential flexibility  requirements
      which the respondent should have applied.  She  concluded  that  there
      were evidential flexibility provisions  but  they  were  not  met.  In
      relation  to  Mr  Asad,  it  was  found  that  he  did  not  meet  the
      requirements because for some of the required period he did  not  have
      the necessary amount in his  bank  account.  The  FTTJ  dismissed  the
      appeals of both claimants under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8
      human rights grounds although it  appears  that  these  had  not  been
      pursued.

   4. The claimants sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
      Permission was granted in respect of the appellant had not Mr Asad. Mr
      Asad's application for permission to appeal has not been  renewed  and
      in the circumstances the only appeal before me is that of the  current
      appellant, Mr Bhuiyan.

   5. It is  not  clear  from  the  determination  exactly  what  evidential
      flexibility policy was put before the FTTJ. Paragraph  6.4  refers  to
      the case of Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC). In
      paragraph  6.5  there  is  reference  to;  "I  have   considered   the
      respondent's policy which the appellants' representatives now seeks to
      rely on..."

   6. Mr Tufan now submits two extracts from the archived Immigration Rules,
      one which was correct at 3 October 2012 and the other  at  30  October
      2012. They are identical. He has  been  unable  to  find  an  archived
      version at the precise date of the application by the claimants  which
      was 18 October 2012. He contends that these extracts contain paragraph
      245AA which was the Immigration Rule applicable  to  this  application
      and appeal replacing the respondent's earlier  evidential  flexibility
      policy outside the Immigration Rules. I  had  armed  myself  with  the
      tracked changes in the Immigration Rules which indicate that paragraph
      245AA contained in the extracts produced by Mr Tufan was the provision
      in force both at  the  time  of  the  application  and  the  decision.
      Paragraph 245AA in this form was deleted with effect  from  1  October
      2013 and a changed version inserted.  I  will  need  to  make  further
      reference to this.

   7. Both representatives agreed and I find that  the  relevant  evidential
      flexibility provisions are those contained in the version of paragraph
      245AA produced by Mr Tufan. These are;

      "245AA Documents not submitted with applications

        a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to  in  Part  6A  state
           that specified documents must be provided, the UK Border  Agency
           will only consider documents that have been submitted  with  the
           application, and will only consider  documents  submitted  after
           the application where subparagraph (b) applies.

        b) The subparagraph applies if the applicant has submitted:


                 (i)A sequence of documents and some of  the  documents  in
                 the sequence have been omitted (for example, if  one  bank
                 statement from a series is missing);


                  (ii)A document is in the wrong format; or


                  (iii)A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                  document, the UK Border Agency will contact the  applicant
                  or his representative in writing, and request the  correct
                  documents. The requested documents must be received by the
                  UK Border Agency at the address specified in  the  request
                  within seven working days of the date of the request.

         (c) the UK  Border  Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
         specified document has not been submitted (for example  an  English
         language certificate is missing), or where  the  UK  Border  Agency
         does not anticipate that addressing the omission or error  referred
         to in subparagraph (b) would lead to grant because the  application
         will be refused for other reasons."

   8. I note that the version of paragraph 245AA which came into effect on 1
      October 2013 and is now in force differs in a number of respects  from
      the version set out above. It provides;

      "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications


        a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to  in  Part  6A  state
           that specified documents must be provided, the  Entry  Clearance
           Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State will only
           consider  documents  that   have   been   submitted   with   the
           application, and will only consider  documents  submitted  after
           the application where they  are  submitted  in  accordance  with
           subparagraph (b).


        b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:


           (i)Some of the documents in a sequence have  been  omitted  (for
           example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);


           (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter
           is not on letterhead paper as specified); or


           (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or


           (iv)  A  document  does  not  contain  all  of   the   specified
           information;


         The Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
         of State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in
         writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
         must be received at the address specified in the request  within  7
         working days of the date of the request.


         (c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document  has
         not been submitted (for example an English language certificate  is
         missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer
         or the Secretary of State does not anticipate that  addressing  the
         omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will  lead  to  a
         grant because the application will be refused for other reasons.


         (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document:


                  i) in the wrong format; or


                  (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or


                  (iii)  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the   specified
                  information, but the  missing  information  is  verifiable
                  from:


                        1) other documents submitted with the application,


                        2) the website of the organisation which issued the
                           document, or


                        3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body;


         The application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State is
         satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are  genuine  and   the
         applicant meets all the other  requirements.  The  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State reserves the
         right to request the specified original documents  in  the  correct
         format in all cases where (b) applies and to refuse applications if
         these documents are not provided as set out in (b)."


   9. Mr Junior relied on the appellant's grounds of  appeal  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal. However, these  grounds  rely  on  the  current  version  of
      paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules not the earlier version which
      he now accepts is the applicable version.  He  applied  to  amend  the
      grounds of appeal to reflect the correct version of  paragraph  245AA.
      Mr Tufan objected but I allowed the application.  I  do  not  consider
      that Mr Tufan, who produced the correct version of the  Rule,  was  in
      any way disadvantaged or taken by surprise.


  10. Mr Junior admitted that the three documents in question were, in their
      original form, defective for the  reasons  given  by  the  respondent.
      However, he took me to the amended versions of these  documents  which
      were before the FTTJ which, he argued, remedied all  the  defects.  He
      submitted that the defects  in  the  documents  came  within  "(ii)  a
      document in the wrong format" and  that  the  respondent  should  have
      informed the appellant or  his  representatives  and  given  them  the
      opportunity to rectify these defects. In failing to refer to or  apply
      paragraph 245AA the FTTJ erred in law. The correct decision would have
      been to conclude that the respondent's decision was not in  accordance
      with the law and to remit the application to her for reconsideration.


  11. In relation to the point  raised  in  the  Rule  24  reply  Mr  Junior
      submitted that there was nothing in the documentation to indicate that
      the sponsor's funds were only available to both  the  applicants.  The
      appellant's contention was that they were available to him even if his
      business partner was not given leave. He accepted that paragraph 245AA
      did not assist Mr Asad because the ground for refusal  affecting  only
      him related to a missing document not covered by  this  provision.  In
      reply to my question he  contended  that  "a  document  in  the  wrong
      format" encompassed "required information".

  12. Mr Tufan submitted that the defects in the documents were not  covered
      by; "a document in the wrong format". In  reply  to  my  question,  he
      indicated that he was not aware of any judicial authority as  to  what
      was covered by "the wrong format". Furthermore, the evidence  did  not
      indicate that the funds would be available to the appellant if Mr Asad
      was not able to continue with his business partner because he did  not
      have leave to remain in the UK. I was asked to find that the FTTJ  had
      not erred in law and to uphold the determination.

  13. Mr Junior informed me that he had been instructed  that  Mr  Asad  was
      making a fresh application on the same basis as before accompanied  by
      the correct documents. I reserved my determination.

  14. I find that the FTTJ  erred  in  law.  She  should  have  applied  the
      evidential flexibility policy contained  in  paragraph  245AA  of  the
      Immigration Rules rather than, as she appears to have done, the policy
      outside the rules referred to in Rodriguez. Having found that there is
      an error of law I set aside the decision which I now remake. Mr Junior
      accepted and I find  that  no  further  evidence  or  submissions  are
      required.

  15. Mr Junior accepts and I find that the three documents with  which  the
      respondent found fault, submitted with the original  application,  did
      not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  However,  he
      submits that the amended versions of the same  three  documents  which
      were before the FTTJ did meet these requirements. I have studied these
      documents carefully and  compared  them  with  the  earlier  defective
      versions. Mr Tufan did not dispute  and  I  find  that  the  documents
      before the FTTJ do meet the requirements of the Rules. This brings  me
      to the question whether the respondent should have  applied  paragraph
      245AA and considered documents which had not been submitted  with  the
      application.

  16. Paragraph 245AA in the form which I have set  out,  in  force  at  the
      relevant time, lacks clarity in a number of ways. It may be,  although
      I have no evidence about this, that this  is  why  the  paragraph  was
      amended to the form in which it now appears. Whilst  subparagraph  (c)
      refers to the UK Border Agency requesting documents it  is  not  clear
      how this should be done or whether there are any and if so  what  time
      limits for supplying documents which have been requested.  It  is  not
      clear what is meant by "a document in the wrong format".  The  current
      version is clearer. It includes at (b) (ii) "a document in  the  wrong
      format (for example, if  a  letter  is  not  on  letterhead  paper  as
      specified)" and "(b) (iv) a document  does  not  contain  all  of  the
      specified information". I consider that "format"  normally  means  the
      way in which something, in  this  case  a  document,  is  arranged  or
      presented. I can see no reason why  presentation  should  not  include
      elements of content. Considering the version in force at the  relevant
      time both in isolation and in the light of the version now in force  I
      find that there is ambiguity and that ambiguity  should  be  construed
      against the respondent who, through Mr Tufan, submits  that  I  should
      apply a restrictive interpretation. In this context I find  that  "the
      wrong  format"  encompasses  the  differences  between  the  documents
      originally submitted by the appellant and those which I  now  find  to
      meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.  Furthermore,  looking  at  the
      corrected versions and comparing them with those originally  submitted
      I find that the addition of the  missing  words  has  meant  that  the
      format has changed.

  17. Whilst the appellant and Mr Asad  made  applications  which  indicated
      that they wished to be entrepreneurs in business together I  can  find
      nothing in the documentation including the funding declaration from Mr
      Islam which indicates that  the  appellant  would  not  or  could  not
      continue in business if Mr Asad was unable to  join  him  or  that  in
      these circumstances the funding would not be provided.

  18. I find that the respondent  should  have  applied  the  provisions  of
      paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules and that had she done so  the
      appellant would have provided the amended  documentation  which  meets
      the requirements  of  the  Rules.  In  the  circumstances  it  is  not
      necessary or appropriate for me to find that the respondent  erred  in
      law or to send the application back to her for further  consideration.
      I am not dealing with the application of a  discretionary  policy  but
      the application of an Immigration Rule.

  19. Having set aside the decision of the FTTJ I remake it by allowing  the
      appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.
