For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case appeals against a decision made by the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Howard) who in a decision and reasons  promulgated
    on  30  August  2017  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision to reject his EEA residence card  application  as
    an extended family member.  The basis of the decision was that  relying
    on the decision of this Tribunal in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016]
    UKUT 00411 (IAC) the judge considered that he  lacked  jurisdiction  to
    hear the appeal because there was no statutory right of appeal  against
    a decision of the respondent not to  grant  a  residence  to  a  person
    claiming to be an extended family member.


 2. The Court of Appeal in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1755  has  decided
    that the decision in Sala was incorrect and that there is  a  statutory
    right of appeal in these circumstances.  It follows that the First-tier
    Tribunal's decision contained a material error  of  law  and  that  the
    decision must now be re-made.  In these circumstances  the  appropriate
    course is to remit this appeal back to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
    heard by any judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Howard.


Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal that there was  no  statutory  right
of appeal contained a material error of law and the appeal  is  remitted  to
be re-heard by the First-tier Tribunal, sitting at  Hatton  Cross  (or  such
other hearing centre as shall be directed) by any judge  other  than  First-
tier Tribunal Judge Howard.
