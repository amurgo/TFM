Representation:
For the Appellant:     in person
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iran who lived in  the  UK  between  31
       July 2008 and 22  November  2011  without  leave  to  remain,  having
       entered illegally on a date unknown. On 22 November 2011 a  grant  of
       discretionary leave to remain was made in his favour until 25  August
       2014. On 4 August 2014 the Appellant  applied  to  vary  that  leave,
       which was refused on 20 May 2015 when  the  Respondent  also  made  a
       decision to remove him from the UK.

    2. The  Appellant's  appeal  against  those  immigration  decisions  was
       dismissed on all grounds, in a decision promulgated  on  10  November
       2015 by First Tier Tribunal Judge Hands.

    3. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal that  decision  on  14
       June 2016 by Upper Tribunal Judge  Goldstein  on  the  basis  it  was
       arguable the Judge's approach to the  Appellant's  relationship  with
       his son was flawed.

    4. Thus the matter comes before me.

  Adjournment

    5. When the appeal was called on  for  hearing  the  Appellant  attended
       alone, and despite his personal history, claimed to speak no English.
       An interpreter was found for  him,  and  the  following  history  was
       elicited.

    6. The Appellant accepted that he owed his solicitors ï¿½500 for work done
       in relation to the hearing before Judge Hands, and that he had failed
       to attend an appointment with his solicitors on  28  July  2016.  His
       solicitors had as a result declined to act for him further,  and  had
       notified the Tribunal of that decision the  same  day,  although  the
       Appellant denied to me that he was aware of their decision to  do  so
       until he had attended the hearing centre  today.  The  Appellant  was
       however inconsistent in that claim, having  earlier  accepted  to  me
       that he when he had contacted his lawyer in advance  of  the  hearing
       that he had been told by his lawyer that he refused to  act  for  him
       further.

    7. The Appellant demanded a lawyer, and  an  indefinite  adjournment  to
       allow him to secure one. He accepted that he had been  refused  legal
       aid, and was required to  pay  himself  for  any  legal  services  he
       required. He accepted that he  had  his  own  business,  but  had  no
       evidence of its profitability, and denied an ability to pay what  was
       owed to date for services already  rendered,  let  alone  for  future
       services. His explanation for failing to attend the appointment on 28
       July 2016 was that he had problems with a house, although  he  denied
       being homeless, and then claimed  that  he  was  looking  for  a  new
       tenancy his existing tenancy having expired.

    8. In the circumstances I was not satisfied that the Appellant had  told
       me the truth about his conversations with his  former  solicitor  and
       his denial of knowledge that he was without representation  after  28
       July 2016. Thus I was not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  would  be
       denied a fair hearing if the appeal was not adjourned,  since  I  was
       not satisfied he was taken by surprise by his lack of representation.
       I was also not satisfied that the Appellant had a reasonable prospect
       of being able to pay for future legal services. I was  not  therefore
       satisfied that an adjournment would serve any useful  purpose,  since
       there was no reason to suppose on the basis  of  the  information  he
       could provide, that he would secure  representation  for  any  future
       hearing.

    9. I therefore invited the Appellant to consider whether he wanted me to
       deal with the appeal on the basis of the papers filed by  his  former
       solicitors, but he appeared unable to  grasp  that  concept.  In  the
       course of the ensuing conversation he then disclosed that he  is  now
       the father of a  second  child,  and  that  he  is  in  a  subsisting
       relationship with that  child's  mother,  Ms  G,  who  is  a  British
       citizen. Upon further questioning he claimed that this  relationship,
       and Ms G's  pregnancy,  predated  the  hearing  before  Judge  Hands,
       although he accepted that it had not been disclosed to the Tribunal.

   10. In the circumstances I told the Appellant that I would deal with  the
       appeal on the basis of the papers filed by his former solicitors.

  Error of Law?

   11. The Respondent accepts the Judge's conclusion [23] that the Appellant
       was enjoying contact with his son at the date of the hearing pursuant
       to an informal agreement with the child's mother Ms  L,  rather  than
       pursuant to the terms of an court  order.  That  was  not  challenged
       before the Judge, and nor was it challenged that the Appellant's  son
       enjoyed and benefited from that contact. The Respondent  accepts  the
       guidance to be found in JA (meaning of "access rights")  [2015]  UKUT
       225, and thus accepts that the Appellant did make  out  paragraph  E-
       LTRPT.2.4.  (a)(ii)  as  the  alternative   to   establishing   "sole
       responsibility" for that child (E-LTRPT.2.4.(a)(i). In  fact  it  had
       been conceded before the Judge that the Appellant did not have  "sole
       responsibility" for that child.

   12. That therefore begged the question under Appendix FM or  whether  the
       Appellant could establish  that  he  was  "taking,  and  intended  to
       continue to take an  active  role  in  the  child's  upbringing";  E-
       LTRPT.2.4.(b).  Mr  McVeety  accepted  that  the  drafting  of   this
       paragraph meant that this test had to  be  distinct  from  the  "sole
       responsibility" test, and that the Appellant could establish that  he
       was enjoying direct, as opposed to indirect, contact.

   13. The decision contains no finding that the Appellant did  not  have  a
       genuine and subsisting relationship with his son, although the  Judge
       did find (as she was entitled to do) that the boy's mother, Ms L, did
       not permit him any role in significant decisions concerning the boy's
       upbringing and well being. The Judge went on  to  conclude  that  the
       Appellant did not have "sole responsibility" for his  son  [25],  and
       whilst that conclusion was undoubtedly correct  since  the  Appellant
       had conceded the point, as Mr McVeety accepted it did not address the
       issue with which the Tribunal had to engage to determine whether  the
       Appellant had made out his primary case under the Immigration Rules.

   14. Mr McVeety also accepted  that  the  decision  does  not  contain  an
       analysis of what was inherent in the test of "genuine and  subsisting
       parental relationship with a child", whether that test be  considered
       in the context of paragraph EX.1 to Appendix FM, or, in  the  context
       of section 117B(6) to the 2002 Act. Moreover the decision appears  to
       also conflate that test (whatever  its  nature  might  be)  with  the
       requirements of the  "sole  responsibility"  test,  and/or  with  the
       requirements set out in paragraph E-LTRPT.2.4 of Appendix FM.

   15. Indeed I note that the decision upon the Article 8  appeal  fails  to
       identify whether the Judge accepts that  "family  life"  between  the
       Appellant and his son exists,  and  also  contains  no  reference  to
       s117B(6).

   16. In conclusion Mr McVeety accepted that the Judge's approach  amounted
       to a material error of law, and that the decision should be set aside
       and remade. When considering the  practicalities  for  doing  so,  he
       accepted that further evidence would now be required  both  upon  the
       true nature of the relationship between the Appellant and his  eldest
       son, and also, the  true  nature  of  the  relationship  between  the
       Appellant and his youngest son, and also that child's mother Ms G.

   17. I have in these circumstances considered whether or not to remit  the
       appeal to the First Tier Tribunal  for  it  to  be  reheard,  as  the
       Respondent accepts iis the proper course. In the circumstances of the
       appeal  I  am  satisfied  that  this  is  the  correct  approach.  In
       circumstances where it would appear that the  relevant  evidence  has
       not properly been considered by the First Tier Tribunal,  the  effect
       of that error of law  has  been  to  deprive  the  Appellant  of  the
       opportunity for his case to be properly considered by the First  Tier
       Tribunal; paragraph 7.2(a) of the Practice Statement of 25  September
       2012. Moreover the extent of the judicial fact  finding  exercise  is
       such  that  having  regard  to  the  over-riding  objective,  it   is
       appropriate that the appeal should be  remitted  to  the  First  Tier
       Tribunal; paragraph 7.2(b) of the Practice Statement of 25  September
       2012. Having reached that  conclusion,  with  the  agreement  of  the
       parties I make the following directions;

        i) The decision upon  the  appeal  is  set  aside.  The  appeal  is
           remitted to the First Tier Tribunal for rehearing. The  findings
           of fact set out in paragraphs 20 and  23  of  the  decision  are
           preserved. The appeal is not to be listed before Judge Hands.

       ii) A Farsi interpreter is required for the hearing of the appeal.

      iii) The Appellant must serve upon the Respondent and file  with  the
           Tribunal by 5pm on 26 September 2016  any  further  evidence  he
           seeks to rely upon.

       iv) The appeal is to be listed on the first available  date  at  the
           North Shields hearing centre after 10 October 2016.

Decision


   18. The decision promulgated on 10 November 2016 did involve  the  making
       of an error of law sufficient to require it to be set aside  and  the
       appeal to be reheard. Accordingly the decision upon the appeal is set
       aside and the appeal is remitted to the First Tier Tribunal with  the
       following directions;

        i) The decision upon  the  appeal  is  set  aside.  The  appeal  is
           remitted to the First Tier Tribunal for rehearing. The  findings
           of fact set out in paragraphs 20 and  23  of  the  decision  are
           preserved. The appeal is not to be listed before Judge Hands.

       ii) A Farsi interpreter is required for the hearing of the appeal.

      iii) The Appellant must serve upon the Respondent and file  with  the
           Tribunal by 5pm on 26 September 2016  any  further  evidence  he
           seeks to rely upon.

       iv) The appeal is to be listed on the first available  date  at  the
           North Shields hearing centre after 10 October 2016.
