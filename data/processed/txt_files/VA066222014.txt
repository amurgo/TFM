Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr H Farook, the sponsor
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Sri  Lanka,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the ECO of 2 October  2014  to  refuse
    her application for entry clearance to visit her family in the UK for 2-
    3 months. First-tier Tribunal Judge Jones dismissed the appeal.

 2. The appellant's right of appeal in this case is limited to the  grounds
    that the decision is unlawful on race discrimination grounds  or  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. There is no allegation of  race
    discrimination in the appellant's grounds of appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or elsewhere. The issue for the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was
    therefore whether the decision to refuse entry clearance  breaches  the
    appellant's right to private life or family life with her relatives  in
    the UK. The First-tier Tribunal Judge correctly identified this as  the
    issue in the determination.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted the evidence given by  the  sponsor
    that he was to provide the ï¿½1000 to be available to the  appellant  for
    her visit and that the ECO had  therefore  been  wrong  to  refuse  the
    application on the basis that the appellant had not  provided  evidence
    that she had these funds. The Judge  accepted  the  sponsor's  evidence
    that the appellant had a genuine  reason  for  her  visit,  to  provide
    practical and emotional support to her daughter  at  the  time  of  her
    confinement and the birth of her child, and  that  she  had  previously
    left the UK after a visit in similar circumstances previously.  However
    the Judge said that, even accepting the sponsor's evidence,  she  could
    not allow the appeal on the grounds that it is wrong  under  the  Rules
    because the only ground she could  consider  is  whether  the  decision
    breaches the appellant's rights under the European Convention on  Human
    Rights.

 4. The Judge went on to say [13];

         "I accept that there are emotional ties between the  appellant  and
         her relatives in the UK and the sponsor is providing her with  some
         financial support. But, having regard to the guidance in Mostafa, I
         find her relationship with them is not so unusual or exceptional as
         to engage Article 8 of the Convention. Her appeal cannot  therefore
         succeed."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it is arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge may not have given sufficient reasons for
    finding that, for Article 8 purposes, there is no family  life  between
    the appellant and her UK based relatives.

 6. I heard submissions from Mr Farook who said that the  appellant  has  a
    family relationship with himself, her daughter and their three children
    who are all based in the UK. He submitted that it is necessary for  the
    appellant to visit the UK for the relationships to evolve and  develop.
    The appellant can visit for a few months at a time whereas the  sponsor
    and his family can only travel to Sri Lanka for a few weeks at a  time,
    when work and school holidays permit.  He  also  pointed  out  that  it
    makes more financial sense for the appellant to come to the UK than for
    a family of five  to  travel  to  Sri  Lanka.  He  submitted  that  the
    maintenance of family ties through visits is important in his  culture.
    He said that the  appellant  has  applied  for  entry  clearance  on  6
    occasions and was granted entry clearance only once,  when  she  stayed
    for three months and returned to  Sri  Lanka.  He  also  said  that  he
    provides the appellant and  her  husband  with  financial  support.  He
    submitted that not all of his oral evidence was taken into  account  by
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 7. Dealing with the last point first I am satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge took all of the evidence into account.  The  Judge  need
    not set out all of the evidence. The Judge was clear that she  accepted
    that the sponsor is credible. The Judge did not fail  to  consider  any
    evidence which is of relevance to the issues to be determined  in  this
    case.

 8. In the decision in Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT  00487
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal gave the following guidance as  summarised  in
    paragraph 3 of the head note;

         "3.  Unless  an  appellant  can  show  that  there  are  individual
         interests at stake covered by Article 8 "of a particularly pressing
         nature" so as to give rise  to  a  "strong  claim  that  compelling
         circumstances may exist to justify  the  grant  of  LTE  [Leave  to
         Enter] outside the rules": (see SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387  at
         [40] and [56]) he or she is exceedingly unlikely to  succeed.  That
         proposition must also hold good in visitor appeals."

 9. I accept that the First-tier Tribunal Judge could have been clearer  in
    her finding as to whether there is family life  between  the  appellant
    and her UK based family.  However,  in  saying  that  there  is  noting
    'unusual' or 'exceptional' in so as to engage Article 8 [13] the  Judge
    makes it sufficiently clear that she does not accept that  family  life
    has been established because there is nothing over and above the normal
    emotional ties between the appellant and her adult daughter and son-in-
    law and her grandchildren.

10. In my view it is clear from  the  determination  as  a  whole  and  the
    evidence before the Judge why she made the decision that there  was  no
    family life within Article 8. In these circumstances the Judge did  not
    have to go on to consider Article 8 (2) and issues of  proportionality.
    Even if the Judge had accepted that there is family life within Article
    8 in this case and gone on to consider proportionality she  would  have
    had to weigh the public interest  in  the  maintenance  of  immigration
    control against any interference in family life. Given her finding that
    there is nothing unusual or exceptional in this case it  is  inevitable
    in my view that would have reached the conclusion that any interference
    with family life is proportionate. This is particularly so  given  that
    it is open to the appellant to  make  a  fresh  application  for  entry
    clearance with all relevant evidence.

11. Accordingly the Judge approached this appeal properly. As  Ms  Fijiwala
    acknowledged, the Judge correctly looked at the Rules  and  found  that
    they were met. Having considered the evidence relating to the Rules the
    Judge went on to consider Article 8. In  my  view,  when  read  in  the
    context of the determination as a whole, the finding  at  paragraph  13
    that there is no family life for the purposes of Article 8 was open  to
    her.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
