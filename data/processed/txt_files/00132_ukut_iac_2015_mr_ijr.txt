Introduction


JUDGE GOLDSTEIN: The applicant brings an application for judicial review  of
    the respondent's decision of 4 March 2013 to refuse his application for
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant under the Points-Based System and  for  a  Biometric  Residence
    Permit.


2.       The respondent maintains that the decision was lawful and that  the
    claim is without merit and should be dismissed.


3.       The claim for judicial review  was  commenced  on  7  August  2014.
    Permission was refused on the papers by Her Honour Judge Taylor sitting
    as a Deputy High Court Judge on 5 March  2014.   However,  on  19  June
    2014, permission to bring these proceedings was granted after  an  oral
    hearing by Upper Tribunal Judge Coker who further granted the applicant
    permission to amend his grounds.


Factual Background


4.       The applicant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  on  17  April  1980,
    entered the United Kingdom with entry clearance  as  a  student  on  13
    February 2009 with a visa valid until 31 March 2010.


5.       On 30 March 2010 the applicant applied for further leave as a  Tier
    4 Student that was granted on appeal to 7 October 2012.


6.       On 29 October 2011, the applicant's spouse and  child  entered  the
    United Kingdom with leave in line with that of the applicant.


7.       On 9 October 2012, the applicant applied out of time for  leave  as
    a Tier 4 Student.


8.       The respondent wrote  to  the  applicant  on  25  January  2013  to
    request  original  bank  statements  in  the  form  of  overseas   bank
    statements from Hatton Bank (Sri Lanka) and for  the  original  of  the
    applicant's marriage certificate and for the birth certificate  of  his
    child.


9.       I pause there to point out that the parties before me  were  agreed
    that the letter was sent in  error  to  79  Cardiff  Road  WC1  8TP  by
    recorded delivery, by which time the  applicant  had  changed  address.
    Indeed and as acknowledged by Ms Rowlands, it was evident from the GCID-
    Case Record Sheet that appeared at page 97 of  the  applicant's  bundle
    that as recorded:


         "Notes record that  a  letter  was  sent  on  25/01/13  to  request
         original Hatton  Bank  statement  along  with  marriage  and  birth
         certificates.  It isn't clear if  this  was  sent  to  the  correct
         address - notes gave the correct one but the previous one is on the
         letter".


10.      It was however her position that it was  the  materiality  of  that
    error that was relevant.


11.      The application was  refused  on  4  March  2013  under  paragraphs
    322(9), 245ZX(a)  and  (d),  because  the  information  that  had  been
    requested of the applicant had not been forthcoming.  Further in  terms
    of the applicant's claim for 10 points for  Maintenance  (funds)  under
    Appendix C of the Immigration Rules, the respondent was  not  satisfied
    that the documents provided by the applicant demonstrated that  he  had
    been in possession of the required level of funds for 28 days.  Thus it
    was considered that there were insufficient funds  shown  to  meet  the
    higher maintenance requirement.


12.      In that latter regard, and in her decision letter,  the  Respondent
    explained that the applicant had to prove  that  he  had  the  required
    maintenance fees of �19,800 plus any outstanding course  fees  for  the
    first year of his course.


13.      Paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C states that:


         "The end date of the 90-day and 28-day periods will be taken as the
         date of the closing balance on the most  recent  of  the  specified
         documents, and must be no earlier than 31 days before the  date  of
         application".


14.      As such, the  applicant  was  required  to  show  that  he  was  in
    possession of �19,800 for a consecutive 28 day  period  ending  on  the
    date of the closing balance of the most recent  document  submitted  or
    for the account that most favoured the applicant.


15.      The respondent concluded that: the applicant had failed to  provide
    his document; failed to provide bank statements that demonstrated  that
    he was in possession of the required level of funds for  a  consecutive
    period of 28 days; and failed to provide  evidence  of  an  established
    presence.


16.      The applicant's dependants (his wife and  child)  were  refused  in
    line with that decision.


17.      On  14  March  2013  the  applicant's  reconsideration  letter  was
    received to which the respondent replied on 29 May 2013 stating that no
    reconsideration was possible, because the  applicant  had  applied  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student after his leave had expired.  There
    was no right of appeal.  Further, because Article 8 of the ECHR had not
    been raised before, a separate application would have to  be  made  for
    that purpose.


18.       On  7  August  2013  the  applicant  lodged  his  judicial  review
    proceedings, that being more than three months after  the  decision  to
    refuse his leave to remain.


The Issues


19.      The applicant's amended  grounds  raised  four  challenges  to  the
    respondent's decision, namely; he should have been considered  to  have
    established presence; that the respondent erred in calculating  the  28
    day period; erred in the  application  of  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy;  finally,  that  the  respondent  should  have  considered  the
    applicant's Article 8 rights, although they  were  not  raised  in  his
    application.


20.      However, before me at the outset of the hearing both  parties  took
    a very sensible approach and agreed  that  the  outcome  of  this  case
    turned on the proper construction of paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C.  It
    was accepted that if the applicant could not satisfy the requirement of
    that Rule then he could not succeed and vice versa.  Mr  Jafar  further
    however clarified that the applicant continued  to  maintain  that  the
    Respondent should have considered his Article 8 ECHR rights.


28 Day Period


21.    The statement dated 1 October 2012 showed a closing balance that  had
    remained unaltered since 24 September 2012.


22.    Having referred to the requirements of paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix  C
    (above) Mr Jafar drew attention to the Respondent's decision letter  of
    4 March 2013 where in reliance on the provisions of 1A(h)the respondent
    continued as follows:


         "As such, you are required to show that you are  in  possession  of
         �19,800 for a  consecutive  28  day  period  to  meet  the  Tier  4
         (General)  Student  Migrant  Maintenance  (funds)  requirements  as
         required by paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.


         You have provided a copy of an overseas bank statement that is  not
         notarised (it does have a stamp and states true copy  but  this  is
         what the bank have put on) - the copy  shows  transactions  between
         the required 28 day  period  in  corroboration  with  the  UK  bank
         statements.


         An original letter from the overseas bank  states  the  balance  of
         account which cannot be accepted as it  does  not  demonstrate  the
         full 28 days.


         The Lloyds TSB account shows the lowest amount of funds held within
         the 28 day period as 7088.14 on 30 August 2012.


         The Hatton National Bank document with  account  shows  the  lowest
         amount of funds held within period as 1121224.79 SLR which converts
         to 5,458.98 British Pound.


         As the  bank  letter  submitted  only  shows  the  level  of  funds
         available to you on 24 September 2012, you  have  not  demonstrated
         that you have a level of funds required over the specified  28  day
         period to be granted as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.


         It  has  therefore  been  decided  that  you  have  not   met   the
         requirements as specified  within  the  Immigration  Rules  and  no
         points have been awarded for Maintenance (funds)".


23.    It was Mr Jafar's submission that there  was  nothing  in  the  Rules
    that would have prevented the respondent from taking the  balance  from
    the printout date of 1 October 2012 and calculating 28  days  back  and
    concluding that combined with the other accounts submitted, this  would
    have taken the applicant over the requisite threshold.


24.    In this regard Mr Jafar  referred  to  a  schedule  prepared  on  the
    applicant's behalf that showed that if one calculated the printout date
    of 1 October 2012 and worked back 31  days  to  4  September  2012  the
    applicant's funds would have been shown to be in total  �20,597.82  and
    thus comfortably over the required threshold.


25.      Mr Jafar submitted that the  respondent  had  in  error  calculated
    backwards from the date of the closing balance shown  on  the  printout
    namely 24 September 2012, that took the applicant's combined  funds  to
    31 August 2012 and thus well below the requisite threshold in  the  sum
    of �13,662.31.


26.      Mr Jafar continued that it was now accepted that  the  respondent's
    letter to the applicant of 23 January 2013 that  requested  inter  alia
    original bank statements was by mistake sent to the wrong  address  and
    therefore never received by the applicant.  He maintained that this was
    highly material because had  the  Respondent  written  to  the  correct
    address the applicant would have furnished the relevant bank statements
    that would have included the applicant's Hatton National Bank passbook,
    a certified true copy of which appeared within the  applicant's  bundle
    and where at page 68 of that bundle a balance as at 31 October 2012  of
    over 1,000,000 Sri Lankan rupees was shown that went back to July 2012.


27.      Mr Jafar continued that had the respondent requested  the  original
    passbook in January 2013 she would have had the balances  to  which  Mr
    Jafar referred.


28.      There was no dispute that had these balances shown in the  passbook
    that range from 7 July 2012 to October 2012, combined with  the  Lloyds
    balances been considered they would have met the required bank  balance
    threshold.


29.      Mr Jafar continued that in the event what actually happened  on  23
    January 2013 was that notwithstanding the evidence that showed that the
    respondent had already been  notified  of  the  applicant's  change  of
    address the letter was sent to an incorrect address.


30.      Mr Jafar submitted that had that request been made and received  by
    the applicant he would have been required to produce  the  Hatton  Bank
    passbook as it was in January  2013  and  that  would  have  shown  the
    balance of 1,132,567.21 Sri Lankan rupees covering July 2012 to October
    2012 and that would clearly have met the requisite income threshold  in
    conjunction with the Lloyds statements.


31.      Mr Jafar repeated that there was nothing in the Rules  which  would
    have prevented the respondent from taking the  balance  for  1  October
    2012 and calculating 28  days  back  and  that  would  have  taken  the
    applicant over the income threshold.


32.      Mr Jafar contended that by sending the letter of  January  2013  to
    the  wrong  address,  the  respondent  had  denied  the  applicant  the
    opportunity of "putting things right".  Mr Jafar continued  by  stating
    "it's a knockout point and  if  we  win  on  this  point  nothing  else
    matters".


33.      Ms  Rowlands  in  response  maintained  that  it  would  be  wholly
    artificial to take as the date of the closing  balance  the  date  upon
    which a document showing that balance happened to be printed.


34.      She referred to the applicant's  bundle  pointing  out  that  there
    were two types of bank statements in the bundle from Lloyds  TSB.   The
    document on page 24 of the bundle was headed  "classic  statement"  and
    was headed with the following:


         "The date as shown on your statement was correct  at  the  time  of
         printing.  Please remember this isn't an official bank copy".


35.      Ms Rowlands continued that on page 26  of  the  applicant's  bundle
    appeared a formal Lloyds printed bank statement that banks put  in  the
    post and send to their customers usually monthly.  The statement in the
    bundle showed at the top of the page "Statement Opening Balance" in the
    sum of �7,284.94 and no doubt although the next page  was  not  in  the
    bundle it would have stated "Closing  Balance"  and  then  provided  an
    appropriate figure.


36.      Ms Rowlands continued that one could go to the Lloyds Bank  website
    to obtain the printout that appears in this case  at  page  24  of  the
    bundle before one received the actual bank  statement.   That  did  not
    mean that the closing balance shown in that statement was  the  closing
    balance as at the date it was printed.


37.      Given the statement at the top  of  the  printout  (above)  it  was
    clear that the bank was pointing out that the data on the statement was
    correct at the time of printing.  She cited the  example  of  a  cheque
    that may have been banked and would be included in such a  printout  at
    the time of printing.  The amount shown would not  have  been  "set  in
    stone, after all, such a cheque may have subsequently bounced".


38.      Ms Rowlands submitted that what the document at  page  24  did  not
    purport to do was give any information as to  what  happened  after  24
    September 2012.  Between 24 September and 1 October  2012  there  could
    have been a lot happening.  Indeed the entries  on  the  printout  show
    that this was the kind of account that got used on a daily  basis.   It
    followed that whilst the date at the time of printing  was  correct  so
    far as it went, the document did not say or purport to say  that  there
    were no entries between 24 September and 1 October  2012  or  that  the
    closing balance remained the  same  on  1  October  as  it  did  on  24
    September 2012.


39.      Ms Rowlands continued that she was supported in that submission  by
    the phrasing of the Rule itself.  The date required to be taken was not
    the date of the document, but the date of the closing balance shown. In
    the present case, that was the most recent of the specified  documents,
    showing the date of the closing balance as 24 September 2012.


40.      In reference to Ms Rowlands' schedule, she pointed out that  if  24
    September 2012 was day 28 of the 28 day period then day 1 was 28 August
    2012 from which it was clear that it was only on  day  7  (3  September
    2012) that the applicant got above the threshold.


41.      Ms Rowlands continued:


         "If you are with me on this point this  claim  must  fail  and  the
         accepted error of the Respondent therefore  had  made  no  material
         difference".


42.      Mr Jafar in response maintained that the printout document on  page
    24 was


         "a proper statement.  It is signed by the bank which means that  it
         is a statement, it was correct at the time of printing and the date
         of printing was 1 October 2012."


43.      Having checked with the parties it was agreed  that  in  accordance
    with 1B of Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules  more  particularly
    (iv)(3) that the printout document met the requirement of the specified
    document.


44.      Mr Jafar continued that in those  circumstances  the  document  was
    sent by Lloyds and verified  and  stamped  by  the  bank  showing  what
    appeared on their statement as at 1 October 2012. Once the printout was
    stamped and verified by the bank it had equal weight in the way it  was
    received as a  bank  statement   The  date  of  the  statement  was  he
    submitted:


         "the key to understanding the balance  and  the  last  entry  would
         always be the date of the last transaction.  The closing balance is
         the date of the printout".


45.      I reserved my decision.


Assessment


46.      I am satisfied that the error of  the  respondent  in  sending  the
    letter of January 2013 to the applicant at the incorrect  address  made
    no material difference to the outcome of this case as it would not have
    rectified matters even if her letter had been  posted  to  the  correct
    address. I note that in addition to the original statements sought  not
    being provided, the respondent on 7 November 2014, had this to say:


         "This [copy statement] showed equivalent to  5,458.98  so  was  not
         enough by itself even if an original had been submitted".


    It follows that as submitted by the respondent  the  applicant's  claim
    was not refused solely for lack of an original statement.


47.       I  would  further  note  that  the  letter  from  the  applicant's
    solicitors to the Treasury Solicitor  dated  22  May  2014  encloses  a
    second statement from Hatton Bank but this was submitted after the date
    of the respondent's decision and therefore would not have been  in  any
    event considered under the evidential flexibility policy.


48.      I turn now to the printout document at page 24 of  the  applicant's
    bundle.  It is stamped  by  Lloyds  Bank  and  signed  to  confirm  its
    authenticity.  This means that it is admissible as evidence  as  if  it
    were a bank statement.


49.      It does not have a specific entry  labelled  "Closing  Balance"  or
    "Opening Balance" but it is perfectly plain that it shows  the  balance
    on the applicant's account specified  in  the  left-hand  column.   The
    statement bears the date 1 October 2012 but it is clear  that  this  is
    when the document was printed.  It says nothing about  the  balance  in
    the account as at 1 October 2012, neither does it purport so to do.


50.      The qualification at the top of the document:


         "The data as shown on your statement was correct  at  the  time  of
         printing"


    means that according to the bank's records  the  data  printed  on  the
    account is the up-to-date correct statement of the account on  the  day
    shown.


51.      It does not purport to show the balance on  the  date  of  printing
    and it does not convey that the balance on the most recent date in  the
    account is the balance on the date of printing.  For example, the  bank
    might have been asked on 1 October 2014 to print out the statement  for
    the period 6 September 2012 to 24 September  2012.   Assuming  that  no
    error had come to light in the meantime, the entries would  be  exactly
    the same as those on the document on page 24 except it would  be  shown
    to be printed on 1 October 2012.


52.      No-one  would  suggest  that  it  was  likely  there  had  been  no
    transactions in the account since  24  September  2012.   It  was  only
    because the statement was printed  close  to  24  September  2012  that
    anyone would think that the date on  the  statement  was  in  some  way
    connected to the closing balance on that date.  There is no reason  why
    it should be.


53.      I remind myself of the terms of the  Rule.   1A(h)  of  Appendix  C
    refers to:


         "the end date of the closing balance on  the  most  recent  of  the
         specified documents and must be no earlier than 31 days before  the
         date of application".


54.      In that regard, the date of 1 October 2012 might help  to  identify
    the most recent of the specified documents, but it does not  illuminate
    the closing balance on any date other than the last one  shown,  namely
    24 September 2012.


55.       I  therefore  find  that  Mr  Jafar's  case  notwithstanding   the
    eloquence of his submissions is fundamentally misconceived.





Article 8


56.      I shall now deal with this issue given that at the  outset  of  the
    hearing Mr Jafar was clear that the  applicant  continued  to  maintain
    that the respondent should have considered his Article  8  rights  even
    though they were not raised in his application.


57.       Indeed  the  applicant  made  no  mention  of  Article  8  in  his
    application and as rightly submitted by the Respondent it follows  that
    the applicant would need  to  make  a  proper  application  paying  the
    relevant fee.


58.      Further in any event the applicant has failed to  demonstrate  that
    there are exceptional or compelling  circumstances  in  this  case  not
    covered by the Immigration Rules which the  respondent  has  failed  to
    take into account.  No such considerations have been identified by  the
    applicant to demonstrate his case is either exceptional or compelling.


59.      Whilst the applicant appears to suggest that he  wishes  to  pursue
    an Article 8 ECHR challenge to the decision in  terms  of  his  private
    life, given his wish to continue his studies in the UK, the application
    fails to engage with the guidance to be found in Patel  v  SSHD  [2013]
    UKSC 72 and Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) and as
    such, there is no merit to this argument, since the  applicant  has  no
    right to pursue studies in the UK as he chooses.


60.      In Nasim it was observed that the judgment of the Supreme Court  in
    Patel served to refocus attention on the nature and purpose of  Article
    8 and in particular to recognise  that  Article's  limited  utility  in
    private life cases that were far removed  from  the  protection  of  an
    individual's moral and physical integrity.


61.      Finally, any reliance  on  Article  8  is  premature  in  that  the
    Respondent has not made a removal decision such that the  applicant  is
    unable to continue with his studies.


62.      Therefore this ground must also fail.


Decision


63.       For  the  above  reasons,  this  claim  for  judicial  review   is
    dismissed.


Costs


64.      The  respondent  seeks  payment  of  her  costs  by  the  applicant
    summarily assessed in the sum of �6,191.


65.      The applicant must show cause as to why he  should  not  pay  those
    costs and for this purpose I grant him seven days from the date of  the
    judgment in which to make such submissions (if any) with liberty to the
    respondent to reply seven days thereafter, such respective  submissions
    to be limited to two sides of A4 paper.   Unless  otherwise  agreed,  I
    shall make a summary assessment on the papers.


Permission to Appeal


66.      No application has been made for permission to appeal to the  Court
    of Appeal, but having considered this issue for myself as I am required
    to do by Rule 44(4B) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, I refuse to grant such permission.


67.      Finally I would like to express my  thanks  for  the  clarity  with
    which the parties' representatives presented their respective arguments
    that I found to be of particular assistance.~~~~0~~~~
