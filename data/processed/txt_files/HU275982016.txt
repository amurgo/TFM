Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal whose date of birth is 1st  October
    1988.  He  made  application  for  entry  clearance  as  the  dependant
    relative of a settled person; his father being an ex-Gurkha  discharged
    from service prior to 1st July 1997.  On 27th January 2017  a  decision
    was made to refuse the application and the appellant appealed.  On 16th
    October 2017 the appellant's appeal was heard by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Malcolm sitting at Hatton Cross.  Judge Malcolm dismissed
    the appeal finding that family life was not engaged for the purposes of
    Article 8 ECHR.

 2. Not content with that decision, by Notice dated 27th November 2017  the
    appellant sought permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.   First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Robertson, in a decision dated 13th December  2017,
    refused permission finding that the grounds lacked arguable  merit.   A
    renewed application was made dated 4th January 2018.  On 19th  February
    2018 Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul refused  permission,  principally  on
    the basis that it was open to the judge to find that the appellant  had
    made a life for himself in Australia, and for the reasons  set  out  in
    the Decision and Reasons of Judge Malcolm.

 3. Application was then made to the High Court by way of judicial  review.
    The effect of that was that on 20th June 2018 the Vice-President of the
    Upper Tribunal granted permission, thus the matter comes before me.

 4. The grounds submit that the judge  erred  in  finding  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence of family life and indeed it was  suggested  that
    Judge Malcolm fell into error in the same way as was identified on  the
    part of the decision maker in the  case  of  Rai  -v-  Entry  Clearance
    Officer (New Delhi) [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  In the grounds Mr Lee pointed
    to the contact which the appellant had with his parents  by  telephone,
    WhatsApp, and video calling, as well as  the  monthly  support  in  the
    region of ï¿½600-700, accepted  by  the  judge,  that  was  sent  to  the
    appellant each month.

 5. The second ground attacks the decision of Judge Malcolm  on  the  basis
    that Judge Malcolm did not make explicit in her findings, but did  make
    it implicit in her treatment of  the  appeal,  that  she  accepted  the
    appellant's submission that but for the historic injustice (in relation
    to Ghurkha family members) his father would have  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom earlier and the appellant would have been entitled to join him.
     It was in that context that it was submitted, in the grounds, that the
    judge's comments regarding the appellant's choice to live in  Australia
    was to be seen.  Again, reference is made to the case of  Rai  and  the
    error identified in that case wherein  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  had
    repeatedly referred to the appellant's parents having chosen to  settle
    in the United Kingdom leaving the  appellant  in  the  family  home  in
    Nepal.

 6. The leading case is that of Rai [2017]  EWCA  Civ  320.   The  material
    facts of that case were that the Gurkha father and his wife remained in
    Nepal from 1971 until their settlement in the United Kingdom  in  2010.
    At the time of the Gurkha father's discharge from the army in  1971  he
    had two children born in 1969 and 1971.  Those other children lived  in
    Nepal and Malaysia respectively.  Thereafter the father and mother  had
    four further children with the appellant, the youngest, being  born  on
    1st January 1986.  Of those four children the  eldest,  born  in  1975,
    lived in Malaysia, the second, born in 1979, lived in  India,  and  the
    third, born in 1982, lived in Dharan, Nepal.   The  appellant  in  that
    case, born in 1986, lived in the family home in Nepal.

 7. The Court of Appeal considered the authorities beginning with  Kugathas
    [2003] EWCA 31, Ghising  and  others  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 567, Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy)
    [2012] UKUT, Gurung [2013] 1 WLR 2546 and Singh -v- Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630.

 8. The important question for a decision maker which emerges from the case
    of Rai is whether "real" or  "committed"  or  "effective"  support  was
    shown to exist.  What is also important  to  recognise,  and  which  is
    consistently emphasised in the case of Rai is that cases  such  as  the
    instant case are fact-sensitive.   There are a number of  factors  that
    one might look  to,  including  the  emotional  impact  of  separation.
    However, as I have already sought to emphasise, repeating the words  of
    Lord Dyson MR in Gurung, "The question  whether  an  individual  enjoys
    family life is one of fact and depends on a  careful  consideration  of
    all the relevant facts of the particular case".

 9. Pointing to paragraph 36 of the case of Rai in  which  reference  again
    was made to Kugathas and "real", "committed"  or  "effective",  it  was
    said by Lindblom LJ that  there  was,  it  seemed  to  him,  ample  and
    undisputed evidence on which the Upper Tribunal Judge "could have based
    a finding that such 'support' was present in the appellant's case".   I
    note that the words "should" or  "must"  are  not  used  consistent  of
    course with cases turning on their own facts.

10. Mr Lee sought to persuade me that the judge in the instant  appeal  had
    sought some exceptional factor and had elevated the test to too high  a
    level falling into the same error as identified in the case of Rai.

11. At paragraph 82 of the decision Judge Malcolm had stated as follows:

         "It was submitted by Mr Lee  that  the  test  for  family  life  is
         whether there is support (which support has to be  real,  committed
         or effective) and that if  so  then  Article  8  is  engaged.   The
         appellant quite clearly has  established  a  life  for  himself  in
         Australia and whilst evidence was given of regular contact with his
         parents I was not satisfied that this was anything other  than  the
         level of contact which would be  expected  between  family  members
         living in  different  countries.   Also,  as  detailed,  I  do  not
         consider that financial support alone is  sufficient  to  meet  the
         test of  real,  effective  or  committed  support  when  considered
         against the background of  the  appellant's  circumstances  of  his
         lengthy separation from his parents and the financial support which
         they have provided  throughout  his  life.   I  consider  that  the
         evidence in this case supports the view that this is a  family  who
         are in contact, where financial support is given to a family member
         who is living, working and studying in a different country."

12. I was then invited to consider paragraph 36 in the case  of  Rai  which
    reads as follows:

         "As Ms Patry submitted, it was clearly open to the  Upper  Tribunal
         judge to have regard to the appellant's dependence, both  financial
         and emotional, on his parents. This was, plainly,  a  relevant  and
         necessary consideration in his assessment (see the judgment of  the
         court in Gurung, at paragraph 50).  If,  however,  the  concept  to
         which the decision-maker will generally need to  pay  attention  is
         'support' - which  means,  as  Sedley  L.J.  put  it  in  Kugathas,
         'support' which is 'real' or 'committed'  or  'effective'  -  there
         was, it seems to me, ample and undisputed  evidence  on  which  the
         Upper Tribunal judge could have based a finding that such 'support'
         was present in the appellant's case. He found,  however,  that  the
         appellant had a 'reliance upon his parents for income that does not
         place him in any particular unusual  category  either  within  this
         country or internationally' ... and no 'indication on balance of  a
         dependency  beyond  the  normal  family  ties  and  the   financial
         dependency' ... These findings, Mr Jesurum submitted, suggest  that
         he was looking not just for a sufficient degree  of  financial  and
         emotional dependence to constitute family life, but also  for  some
         extraordinary,  or  exceptional,   feature   in   the   appellant's
         dependence upon his parents  as  a  necessary  determinant  of  the
         existence of his family life with them. Mr Jesurum  submitted  that
         this approach was too exacting, and  inappropriate.   It  seems  to
         reflect  the  earlier   reference,   in   paragraph   18   of   the
         determination,  to  the  requirement  for   'some   compelling   or
         exceptional circumstances  inherent  within  [an  applicant's]  own
         case'.  In  any  event,  Mr  Jesurum  submitted,  it  elevated  the
         threshold of 'support' that is 'real' or 'committed' or 'effective'
         too  high.  It  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  jurisprudence  -
         including the Court of Appeal's decision in Kugathas - as  reviewed
         by the Upper Tribunal in Ghising (family life  -  adults  -  Gurkha
         policy) (in paragraphs 50 to 62 of  its  determination),  with  the
         endorsement of this  court  in  Gurung  (in  paragraph  46  of  the
         judgment of the court).  It represents,  Mr  Jesurum  contended,  a
         misdirection which vitiates the Upper Tribunal judge's decision."

13. Mr Lee goes on in his grounds to point to the fact that  the  Court  of
    Appeal found that those submissions "had force".  Mr  Lee  goes  on  at
    paragraph 6 of his grounds the key point to further examples  in  which
    he submits that the judge at first instance was looking for  additional
    factors, thereby elevating the test.

14. The second ground of appeal was not advanced with the  same  degree  of
    enthusiasm as the first, i.e. that the judge appears to  have  accepted
    that the Gurkha father would have come to the  United  Kingdom  earlier
    had his son been entitled to join him.

15. The level of financial support sent each month is of course a  relevant
    factor to be  considered,  and  the  judge  took  those  into  account.
    However, I remind myself that the Court of Appeal in Rai  was  pointing
    to what could be sufficient to enable a judge to find family life,  but
    the judgment was not prescripted.  It is important that a  judge  takes
    an holistic view of the evidence.  The judge properly directed herself.
     Not only did she judge set out Mr Lee's submissions, and  I  refer  in
    particular to paragraph 57 of the Decision  and  Reasons,  and  to  the
    historic injustice, or at least the recognition of it at paragraph  53,
    but then  set  those  factors  in  context  against  other  factors  at
    paragraph 80.

16. The facts of the case of Rai  are,  as  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul
    pointed out in refusing permission, somewhat different from the instant
    case in which it was the appellant who left Nepal to  go  to  Australia
    before his parents came to the United Kingdom.  At the  time  when  the
    Gurkha father of the appellant had come to the United  Kingdom,  family
    life was already being enjoyed apart.

17. It is to be remembered there is a distinction  between  the  first  and
    second tests in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  The first test is  whether  the
    proposed removal (though the same principles apply in entry  clearance)
    amounts to an interference by a public authority with the  exercise  of
    the applicant's right to respect for his private or (as  the  case  may
    be) family life. The second test is: if so, will such interference have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8?

18. The fact that there is some private or family life is  not  sufficient.
    It has to be family life and/or  private  life,  deserving  of  respect
    sufficient to engage the operation of Article 8.

19. Mr Lee drew my attention to the fact that  in  the  findings  of  Judge
    Malcolm it was accepted that the appellant was in regular contact  with
    his parents, evidenced by the documents provided, and  that  there  was
    financial support given by the sponsor and his wife to the appellant.

20. That the Appellant is the son of a  Ghurka,  without  more,  cannot  be
    sufficient to succeed. I appreciate that that was not being argued  but
    it is a point that I feel needs to be made in this  appeal  because  it
    leads to the next point, which emerges from the authorities and that is
    that it must be established that family life existed at the  time  when
    it is said  "but  for"  the  historical  wrong"  and  at  the  time  of
    consideration of the appeal,  family  and  private  life  deserving  of
    respect (in the legal sense) existed or exists as the case may be.  The
    Tribunal should not elevate the standard or look for  some  exceptional
    factors; indeed, to do so would  arguably  negate  the  impact  of  the
    historical wrong. Against the  factors  the  question  for  me  is  not
    whether I might have come to a different view but, given that the  case
    is fact-sensitive, was it open to the judge to come to a view that  the
    family and private life, such as they were, did not engage Article 8.

21. The appellant left for Australia before his parents left for the United
    Kingdom.  It was open to the judge in my view to find that having  gone
    to Australia he chose to remain there, and whilst in the  case  of  Rai
    the court was critical of the Upper Tribunal placing too much  reliance
    on what they found to be a choice, it was open to Judge Malcolm,  in my
    judgment, to take account of the fact that the appellant and his father
    had not met, even though the Gurkha father spent eleven months  of  his
    time in Hong Kong; that neither of them had met since  2007;  and  that
    the  appellant's  parents  did  not  know  sufficient  about  what  the
    appellant was doing or studying in Australia; that the evidence of  the
    appellant's father was that he had "no idea whether his  son  had  many
    friends in Australia" (paragraph 13) and was unable to give details  of
    the work which his son was undertaking.  Significantly at paragraph  28
    the evidence was that for most of his life, from  the  age  of  5,  the
    appellant had been away from home and family, although this was for the
    sole purpose of attaining a better  education.   I  note  however  that
    prior to  moving  to  Australia  the  appellant  completed  his  entire
    education from year  1  to  12  in  India,  attending  three  different
    schools.  The evidence in my view meant  that  is  was  open  to  Judge
    Malcolm to come to the view that the appellant was living  and  leading
    an independent life from his parents, which  is  essentially  what  the
    judge found.

22. For the avoidance of doubt, I find no basis  for  the  premise  in  the
    second ground that the Judge found sufficient  family  life  to  engage
    article 8 by the acceptance that monies were sent. Whilst such might be
    evidence sufficient for the first Razgar test, it was open to the Judge
    after consideration of all the evidence to find that  the  second  test
    was not satisfied. Whilst the judge did not  express  herself  in  that
    way, it is clear that that was the approach to the appeal.
