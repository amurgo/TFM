                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This determination refers to parties as they were in the  First-tier
       Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Boyd,    promulgated  on  18  February  2014,  allowing   the
       appellant's appeal against refusal of a residence card as the family
       member (wife)  of  an  EEA  national  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
       Regulations 2006.

    3. The appellant produced with her application to the SSHD  a  Ghanaian
       customary marriage certificate, along with a  statutory  declaration
       of marriage by proxy.

    4. The SSHD's "reasons for refusal letter" of 6 August 2013  said  that
       although such proxy marriages could be recognised, they  had  to  be
       registered in Ghana, and there was no evidence of that.

    5. Judge Boyd allowed the appeal  on  the  view  that  the  SSHD's  own
       sources showed that  registration  was  not  mandatory  and  that  a
       statutory declaration such as produced was sufficient.  He therefore
       held at �13 that the appellant  had  established  a  marriage  valid
       under the law of Ghana and so recognised in the UK.

    6. The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT raise two issues.  The  first
       is that the judge failed to take note of Kareem (proxy  marriages  -
       EU law) Nigeria [2014]  UKUT  24,  promulgated  shortly  before  his
       decision, which required  him  to  address  "whether  this  type  of
       marriage is recognised in the EEA state of  the  sponsor,  Belgium".
       The second is that at �12 the judge went wrong by relying upon a  UT
       decision which was unreported and which predated Kareem.

    7. Mr Whitwell referred to Kareem at �11 in particular, "... whether  a
       person is married is a matter that falls within  the  competence  of
       the individual member states", and headnote (e), "...  the  starting
       point will be to decide whether a marriage  was  contracted  between
       the appellant and the qualified person according to the national law
       of the EEA country  of  the  qualified  person's  nationality".   He
       referred "for completeness" also to AO (unreported decisions are not
       precedents) [2008] UKAIT 00056.

    8. Mr Akohene referred in his submissions to the UT's  general  remarks
       in Kareem at �68, saying that based on (b)  a  marriage  certificate
       issued according to the registration laws of the country  where  the
       marriage took place will usually be sufficient, based  on  (d)  that
       proof of the marital relationship by other evidence is required only
       where there is no marriage certificate or there is doubt whether  it
       was issued by a competent  authority,  and  based  on  (g)  that  an
       appellant may prove her case  by  evidence  of  recognition  of  the
       marriage under the laws of  the  country  where  the  marriage  took
       place.  He said that only if there were misgivings about recognition
       of the marriage in Ghana would any  question  of  cross-checking  by
       reference to recognition in Belgium arise.  The judge  resolved  the
       issue by reference to the evidence about validity of the marriage in
       Ghana.  The SSHD's grounds did not attack that point.

    9. Mr Akohene also sought to support his case by reference  to  Article
       24 on equal treatment of Union citizens, but I  do  not  think  that
       raises any issue which I need to resolve.

   10. Mr  Whitwell  responded  that  Kareem  could  not  be  construed  as
       submitted for the appellant, which would deprive  the  case  of  all
       significance.

   11. I reserved my determination.

   12. I prefer Mr Akohene's submissions on Kareem.   There is no  need  to
       consider whether a marriage is recognised in the home state  of  the
       sponsor unless there is difficulty over whether it is recognised  in
       the state where the marriage was contracted.  In this case the judge
       resolved the latter point in the  appellant's  favour.   The  SSHD's
       grounds and submissions do not suggest that he erred  in  doing  so.
       They assume that proof of recognition in the EU citizen's country is
       required in all cases.  That is not what Kareem  says.   Absence  of
       reference to Kareem in the determination is immaterial.

   13. The judge does not say how he came to be referred to the  unreported
       UT determination but at most this was to back up  his  finding  that
       the statutory declaration was sufficient.  The  SSHD  has  not  said
       that  he  intrinsically  erred  on  that  point,  so  this  is  also
       immaterial.


   14. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
