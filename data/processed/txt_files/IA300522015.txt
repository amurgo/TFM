For the Respondent: Ms Petterson Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
3. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge D Taylor promulgated on 31 December 2015  which  dismissed
   the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent  to  remove
   the Appellant from the UK following a decision to  refuse  the  Appellant
   leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student under the Points Based System.
Background
4. The Appellant was  born  on  1  September  1979  and  is  a  national  of
   Pakistan.
5. On 25 July 2013 the Appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK as  a
   Tier 4 Student Migrant under the Points Based  System  (PBS)  and  for  a
   Biometric Residence Permit.
6. On 21  August  2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter gave the following reason:
   a) For the purposes of the application the Appellant  submitted  a  TOEIC
      certificate from Educational Testing Service ("ETS") to the Respondent
      and his sponsor in order to obtain a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  of
      Studies.
   b) The TOEIC certificate produced was as a result of a test the Appellant
      claimed to have taken at Premier Language Training Centre  in  Barking
      27 June 2012.
   c) ETS confirmed to the Respondent that there was  evidence  to  conclude
      the certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use of a proxy tester
      and they declared the Appellants test to be invalid.
   d) As a false document was produced the  application  was  refused  under
      paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.
The Judge's Decision
7. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Taylor ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the  Respondent's
   decision. The Judge in his assessment of the evidence  and  findings  set
   out the following conclusions:
   a) The Issue was whether the Appellant had used a proxy for  the  English
      Language test on 27 June 2012.
   b) The Appellant gave evidence that he had not done so and that the  test
      result truly reflected his performance at the test centre.
   c) The Appellant gave evidence that he had no reason to to use  deception
      when his level of English was' upper intermediate.'
   d) In August 2015,  the  Appellant  was  awarded  a  Master's  Degree  in
      Business Administration by Anglia Ruskin University.
   e)  He  set  out  in  detail  the  investigation  made  by  BBC  Panorama
      underpinning the assertion made  of  proxy  language  test  fraud.  He
      identified that the two lengthy witness statements of Rebecca Collings
      and Peter Millington to explain  the  investigations  undertaken,  the
      methodology used and the manner in which it was  sought  to  establish
      which tests were invalid. He acknowledged  that  the  statements  were
      generic in that there was nothing specifically relating to Mr Shah  in
      either of them (paragraphs 23-30)
   f) He took into account the documents produced by the Respondent entitled
      "Project Faï¿½ade- criminal enquiry into abuse of the TOEIC" in relation
      to Premier Language Training Centre Barking dated 5 May 2015.  He  set
      out the findings in that report  which  contrasted  the  'significant'
      level of cheating found at private test centres such  as  the  one  in
      Barking as opposed to the very much lower levels found in public  test
      centres noting that 75% of tests at Barking were found to be  invalid,
      25% questionable. Again he acknowledged that this report did not refer
      to the Appellant.
   g) He then at paragraph 33  identified  the  evidence  that  specifically
      related to the Appellant which he analysed at paragraphs 34-36.
   h) He found that at the time of the test  the  Appellant  was  living  in
      Manchester and noted that in his witness statement he claimed he  took
      the test in Barking because the dates were 'convenient'  and  'readily
      available'.
   i) The Judge heard evidence from the Appellant as to why he chose to take
      the test in Barking rather than where he lived and did  not  find  his
      explanation was credible. He found his  evidence  in  respect  of  his
      friends to be unconvincing and his responses were inconsistent.
   j) He found that there was no evidence from the  friends  he  claimed  he
      took the test with to support the reasons he gave for taking the  test
      in Barking and failed to give an answer as to why he was no longer  in
      contact with the friends.
   k) He identified that the burden of  proof   was  on  the  Respondent  to
      establish that false documents had been used  and  noted  the  caselaw
      relied upon by Ms Barton who represented the Appellant at that time.
   l) He accepted that the statements  of  Ms  Collings  and  Mr  Millington
      although not relating to the Appellant specifically were  accurate  as
      to the testing process and the investigation  of  the  fraud  and  the
      records relating to the Appellant that were produced were the products
      of that process.
   m) The Judge did not accept the Appellants evidence as to how he came  to
      take the test at Barking and found at paragraph  46  that  the  likely
      reason he took the test at Barking because he found out  from  friends
      it was open to abuse.
   n) He found that the Appellant had used a proxy tester.
8. Grounds of appeal on 13 January  2016  were  lodged  but  permission  was
   refused on 31 May 2016.
9. On 3 June 2016 the application was renewed arguing  that  the  Judge  had
   placed  too  much  weight  on  the  statements  of  Ms  Collings  and  Mr
   Millington; relied on the case of SM and Qadir v Secretary of  State  for
   the Home Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT  00229
   (IAC).
10. On 17 June 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan gave  permission  to  appeal
   noting that it was for the Appellant to explain the error of law when the
   material before the Tribunal in Qadir  was  not  before  the  First  tier
   Judge.

11. At the hearing I heard submissions from  Ms  Barton  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellant that:

   a) SM was not promulgated at the time the Judge made his decision.

   b) The Judge placed too much weight on the statements of Ms Collings  and
      Millington.

   c) Those statements did not entitle the Judge to find that the  Appellant
      was dishonest.

   d) The Judge heard evidence from the  Appellant  and  the  only  evidence
      related to why he took the test in Barking.

   e) The Judge accepted that the Appellant  had  been  awarded  an  MBA  in
      Business Administration which suggested  that  he  was  proficient  in
      English.

12. On behalf of the Respondent Ms Petterson submitted that :

   a) The Judge recognised that the statements of  Collings  and  Millington
      were generic and was simply setting out the background to explain what
      the results meant if an invalid test was recorded.

   b) The Judge did not only find against the Appellant because he took  the
      test in Barking but he found his evidence in relation to  his  friends
      was vague and unconvincing.

   c) Ms Barton accepted that the previous decisions by the FT and  UT,  the
      latter decision made by me, were neutral in  that  she  accepted  they
      were not assessments of his credibility  but  simply  related  to  CAS
      certificates.

   d) Whilst acknowledging  that  the  statements  of  Ms  Collings  and  Mr
      Millington were generic the Judge was entitled to  take  into  account
      the relevance of the Appellant taking the test in Barking even of  the
      report did not refer to him by name.

   e) The Judge directed himself appropriately.

   f) In relation to the Appellant taking an MBA in 2015 this  was  3  years
      after he was alleged to have taken the English language test  and  his
      English may have improved.

Legal Framework
13. Reference was made in the  decision  to  Shen  (Paper  appeals;  proving
   dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 00236 (IAC) where it was held that  in  terms  of
   the approach that a tribunal should adopt towards decisions of  the  SSHD
   in which dishonesty or deception is  alleged  against  an  applicant  for
   leave to remain, the starting point should be, as the Court of Appeal  in
   Adedoyin (formerly AA (Nigeria) v SSHD) [2010] EWCA  Civ  773  have  made
   clear, that pursuant to paragraph  322  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
   reference to "false" means "dishonestly"  false;   Where  an  application
   form etc is false in a material way, this may be relied on by the SSHD as
   prima facie evidence establishing dishonesty. The inference of deliberate
   deception can be strengthened by other facts: eg if a criminal conviction
   (not disclosed in an application) occurred shortly before  completion  of
   the application form. Here, the conviction must have  been  high  in  the
   applicant's mind and any  explanation  based  on  oversight  would  carry
   little weight. But it is always  open  to  an  appellant  to  proffer  an
   innocent explanation and if that  explanation  meets  a  basic  level  of
   plausibility, the burden  switches  back  to  the  SSHD  to  answer  that
   evidence. At the end of the day the SSHD  bears  the  burden  of  proving
   dishonesty.

The Law

14.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
   authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons,  ignoring  material
   considerations by taking into account immaterial considerations, reaching
   irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or   giving   legally
   inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute
   errors of law.

15. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give  too
   little weight or too much weight to a  factor,  unless  irrationality  is
   alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  to  fail  to
   deal with every  factual  issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
   Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of  the  evidence
   or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of  risk  does  not  give
   rise to an error of law.
Finding on Material Error

16. Having heard those  submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no material errors of law.

17. The grounds argue in essence that the Judge placed too  much  weight  on
   what is commonly referred to as the generic evidence of Ms  Collings  and
   Mr Millington as to the testing process  and  the  investigation  of  the
   fraud in relation to TOEIC language certificates.

18. I am satisfied however that the Judge  in  his  findings  was  extremely
   clear in what was a well-reasoned decision that he acknowledged the  fact
   that these statements did not refer specifically to the Appellant's  case
   (paragraph 24). However he was entitled to set out in detail and  explain
   why he accepted that  their  account  of  the  process  had  led  to  the
   production of documentary  evidence  stating  that  the  Appellants  test
   result was invalid was a process he found  to  be  reliable.  I  am  also
   satisfied that the Judge was  entitled  to  place  weight  for  the  same
   reasons  on  the  report  relating  to  significant  levels  of   invalid
   certificates at the Barking test centre  where  the  Appellant  took  his
   test.

19. Reliance was placed in the grounds on the case of  SM  which  Ms  Barton
   accepted was not before the Judge. The Tribunal in SM  while  recognising
   the shortcomings  of  the  Respondents  evidence  nevertheless  found  at
   paragraph 68 that:
   "By an admittedly narrow margin we are satisfied that  the  Secretary  of
   State has discharged this burden.  The effect of this is that there is  a
   burden, again an evidential one, on the Appellants of raising an innocent
   explanation."

20. Therefore even had the case of SM been available to this Judge it  would
   have been open to him to find that the Respondent had met the  evidential
   burden of establishing dishonesty as he had with  the  statements  of  Ms
   Collings and Mr Millington and the Report suggesting that the test centre
   where the Appellant took his test was one where there was a greater level
   of fraud and it was not the Appellants 'local' or nearest test centre. It
   was then for the Appellant to advance an innocent explanation and if that
   explanation met ''a basic level of plausibility', the burden was  on  the
   SSHD to answer that evidence.

21. The Judge however, unlike the Tribunal in SM,  had  no  evidence  of  an
   expert in the science of voice recognition to challenge the  evidence  of
   the Respondent or  indeed  the  investigative  process  of  the  Panorama
   programme. There was no historical or contemporaneous  evidence  produced
   of the Appellants ability in English by reference to  other  unchallenged
   language tests: the only documents in  his  bundle  related  not  to  any
   previous language test but to a BTEC qualification from 2013 that  was  a
   distance learning course. Therefore it could not  be  said  that  he  had
   demonstrated he had no incentive to cheat. I do not  accept  Ms  Barton's
   submission that the Judge should have placed any weight on the fact  that
   the Appellant was awarded an MBA in 2015 as this did not reflect  on  his
   proficiency at the time of the TOIEC test 3 years before.

22. I am satisfied that the Appellant was required to address the  issue  of
   why he took the test in a centre that was not local him and which was the
   subject of the report produced by the Respondent: the  Appellants  in  SM
   faced the same challenge. The Appellants witness statement  was  woefully
   short on detail. The witness statement before the Judge was silent as  to
   the venue at Barking, how he  travelled  there,  what  happened  when  he
   arrived, the components of the test, the layout of the test room and  the
   conduct of the test or any questions he was asked all of which would have
   been relevant as to the credibility of his claim to  have  sat  the  test
   himself. I accept  that  he  was  apparently  not  asked  about  this  in
   examination in chief or challenged in cross examination and  should  have
   been: but it is for him to meet this stage of the burden  of  proof.  The
   Appellant was however challenged in cross examination about why  he  took
   the test where he did: his evidence was unsupported by any evidence  from
   the friends that he alleged he sat the test with and the Judge found  his
   evidence as the absence of  such  evidence  was  conflicting,  vague  and
   unconvincing.
23. The final question for the Judge to determine was whether the  Secretary
   of State had discharged the legal burden of establishing on  the  balance
   of probabilities that this Appellant procured his  TOEIC  certificate  by
   deceit. I am satisfied that on the evidence before him he was entitled to
   reach the conclusion that he did.

24. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as  a
   whole set out findings that were sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed
   and based on cogent reasoning.



CONCLUSION

25. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.



DECISION

26. The appeal is dismissed.
