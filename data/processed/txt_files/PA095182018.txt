Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Mustafa on 10th December2018,
                    Mr A Maqsood on 12th March 2019; instructed by
                    Solicitors Inn
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan on 10th December 2018,
                    Mr D Clarke on 12th March 2019; Senior Home Office
                    Presenting Officers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  YM.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings




      1. Permission to appeal the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         O'Garro dismissing the appellant's appeal against  the  refusal  of
         his Article 8 human rights claim was given by  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Povey on 5th  November  2018.  The  appellant  did  not  seek
         permission to appeal the dismissal of his claim  for  international
         protection.

      2. On 10th December 2018, before me, the respondent accepted that  the
         First-tier Tribunal judge had erred in law dismissing Mr  Mehmood's
         appeal such that the decision should be set aside to be remade.

      3. At the resumed hearing before me  on  12th  March  2019  Mr  Clarke
         accepted that, in the light of KO (Nigeria) &  ors  v  SSHD  [2018]
         UKSC 53 and LG (s117B(6) "reasonable to leave"  UK)  Turkey  [2019]
         UKUT 00072 (IAC) and it being agreed that  the  youngest  dependent
         child was a minor, the appeal should be allowed.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point  of  law  in  so  far  as  Article  8  is
    concerned.

    I set aside the decision on Article 8.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it on Article 8  human
    rights grounds.
