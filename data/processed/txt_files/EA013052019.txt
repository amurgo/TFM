                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the appellant:           Ms Hashmi, instructed by Mamoon Solicitors
For the respondent:          Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer



           DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES 34, 39 & 40 (3) OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. The appellant appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 25 July 2019.

   2. I am satisfied the Judge erred in  failing  to  consider  whether  the
      appellant satisfied reg 8 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2016. ("the EEA  Regulations").  That,  however,  was  the
      substantive issue in dispute. On that basis, it was  agreed  that  the
      decision involved the making of an error of law  and  had  to  be  set
      aside.

   3. In terms of remaking the decision, it is evident from the finding that
      the relationship is genuine and substantive and that  there  has  been
      cohabitation since 2014, a period of some five  years.  There  was  no
      challenge to  that,  and  it  was  agreed  that  this  was  a  durable
      relationship and thus that reg. 8 of the EEA Regulations was  met.  On
      that basis, it is now for the respondent to consider whether or not to
      exercise her discretion to issue a residence card under reg. 17 of the
      EEA Regulations.


   4. Rule 40 (1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provided that the Upper Tribunal may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
      hearing which I did. Rule 40 (3) provides that the Upper Tribunal must
      provide written reasons for its decision with a decision notice unless
      the parties have consented to the Upper Tribunal  not  giving  written
      reasons. I am satisfied that the parties have given  such  consent  at
      the hearing.


      Notice of Decision

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and is set aside.


   2. By consent, the appeal is allowed to the extent that, regulation  8(2)
      of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 is satisfied and it  is  now
      for the  respondent  to  consider  whether  or  not  to  exercise  her
      discretion to issue the appellant with a residence  card  pursuant  to
      reg 17.

      Signed                       Date: 28 October 2019
