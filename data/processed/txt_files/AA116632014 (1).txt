                                  ANONYMITY

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI2008/269) I make an Anonymity Order.  Unless the Upper Tribunal or  Court
orders otherwise, no report of any proceedings or any  form  of  publication
thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the original  Appellant.  This
prohibition applies to, amongst others, all parties.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal has its origins  in  a  decision  made  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (hereinafter the  "Secretary
    of State"), dated 03 December 2014,  whereby  the  application  of  the
    Appellant, a national of Afghanistan aged 21 years, for  further  leave
    to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  was  refused.  By  its   decision
    promulgated on 17  July  2015,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (the  "FtT")
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.  Permission to  appeal
    to this Tribunal was  granted  (in  summary)  on  the  basis  that  the
    decision of the FtT failed to  consider  certain  pieces  of  important
    evidence, adequately or at all and, linked to this debility, failed  to
    provide a properly reasoned decision.

 2. The Appellant's application for further leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom was made on 15 February 2012.  Previously, he had departed  his
    country of origin, Afghanistan, around August 2010 and had subsequently
    travelled  through  and  remained  in  certain  other  countries  until
    arriving in the United  Kingdom  on  23  November  2010,  whereupon  he
    claimed asylum.  This application was refused by the Secretary of State
    on 21 February 2011, accompanied by a grant of discretionary  leave  to
    remain until 01 March 2012, upon which date the Appellant would  attain
    the age of 17 ï¿½ years, giving effect to the Secretary of  State's  then
    published policy.  There was no appeal against this decision.

 3. The next material event was the  Appellant's  application  for  further
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom, which was made timeously, on  15
    February 2012.  The decision letter rehearses that the application  was
    considered in accordance with,  firstly,  the  "asylum  instruction  on
    discretionary leave", Article 8 ECHR and Articles 2 and  3  ECHR.   The
    application was refused on all grounds.  The refusal also purported  to
    consider the Appellant's case under paragraph 353B of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. The decision of the FtT is couched in somewhat formulaic terms  in  the
    setting  of  a  pro-forma  structure  and,  above  all,  is  noticeably
    lightweight as regards findings.  Indeed, the  conclusionary  character
    of the decision is unmistakable by virtue of its format  and  structure
    which,  under  a  series  of  headings,  gave  consideration   to   the
    substantive issues under appeal; the law; the  ECHR;  the  proceedings;
    the Appellant's  case;  and  the  Tribunal's  conclusions.   The  stark
    absentee is findings, sufficient and properly reasoned.

 5. Under the rubric of "Conclusions", one can identify a limited number of
    findings, namely:

    (a)  The Appellant was not considered credible.

    (b)  The Appellant's fear of his father's  business  partners  did  not
         constitute a persecution reason under the Refugee Convention.

    (c)   The  Appellant  was  not  of  adverse  interest  to   anyone   in
         Afghanistan.

    (d)  The Appellant could relocate internally in Afghanistan.

    These passages in the  decision  of  the  FtT  are  notable  for  their
    conclusionary character and their simple adoption of  the  Respondent's
    refusal  reasons  -  without  analysis,  reflection,   particulars   or
    elaboration.  This analysis of the decision of the FtT is reinforced by
    the mechanism employed by the Judge of simply and  without  elaboration
    or reasoning adopting substantial passages of the refusal decision.

 6. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Wilding  acknowledged  most  of
    the infelicities of the decision of the FtT,  as  outlined  above.   He
    sought  to  argue,  nonetheless,  that  these  were  not  material  and
    developed his submissions accordingly.

 7. Given the nature and depth of the shortcomings  highlighted  above  and
    for the further reasons expressed in our ex tempore decision, we do not
    possess  the  confidence  necessary  to  conclude  that,  absent  these
    vitiating elements, the decision of the FtT would have been  the  same.
    There are  several  errors  of  law  and  their  materiality  has  been
    demonstrated to our satisfaction.

Decision

 8. We set aside the decision of the FtT.  It will  be  remade  within  the
    forum of the Upper Tribunal.  It will not be necessary to  reconstitute
    the same panel of Judges for this purpose.
