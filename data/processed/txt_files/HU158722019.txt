Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Karim instructed by Liberty Legal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appealed with permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Row promulgated  on  19th  November  2019  in
    which he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision of 11th September 2019.

 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh born on 2nd August  1989  and
    he entered the United Kingdom on 9th February 2009 with a student visa.
     Further grants of leave as a student  were  made  until  20th  October
    2014.  One of the applications was made on 25th January 2013.  On  19th
    October 2014 the appellant applied for leave not as a  student  but  on
    the basis of his private life.  This was  refused  on  23rd  July  2015
    because the appellant did not meet the  suitability  criteria;  in  his
    application for leave on  25th  January  2013,  he  had  used  a  TOEIC
    certificate  from  ETS  and  the  respondent  had  evidence  that   the
    certificate had been fraudulently obtained by a proxy  test-taker.   He
    was thus refused under S-LTR.1.1 - 3.1 of the Immigration  Rules.   The
    second reason for refusal was that the appellant did not in  any  event
    meet the criteria for leave to remain on the basis of his private life.
     There were no circumstances outside the Immigration Rules which  would
    enable him to succeed under Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  The appellant did not challenge that decision.

 3. Further submissions were made on the appellant's  behalf  on  27th  May
    2016 but rejected.  He made a further application for leave  to  remain
    on the basis of his private life and this application  was  refused  on
    12th October 2017; he appealed, and his appeal  was  dismissed  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  after  a  hearing  on  19th  October  2018.   The
    appellant then sought leave to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  and  his
    application was dismissed on  25th  January  2019.  That  decision  was
    subject to judicial review.  On 11th July 2019 the High  Court  quashed
    the decisions of the First-tier and Upper Tribunal because the decision
    of 12th October 2017 only gave him an out of country  right  of  appeal
    and thus neither the First-tier Tribunal nor  the  Upper  Tribunal  had
    jurisdiction.

 4. The respondent reconsidered the application of 1st August 2016  and  on
    11th September 2019 refused  the  application  granting  an  in-country
    right of appeal.  That decision was appealed and came before First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Row  and  was  dismissed.   The  determination  was  the
    subject of the challenge before me.

 5. The lengthy grounds for permission to appeal set out the following:

         Ground 1:  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  apply  the
         approach to the burden and standard of proof mandated by the  Upper
         Tribunal in SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof)  [2016]
         UKUT 229 (IAC).

         In SM and Qadir, the Upper Tribunal concluded:

         a. The respondent bore the  "evidential  burden"  of  demonstrating
             that there is a case to  answer,  after  which  the  appellant
             bears the burden of raising an "innocent explanation".   Where
             an "innocent explanation" is produced, the burden shifts  back
             to the respondent.

         b. The generic evidence, taken with the look-up tool evidence,  was
             sufficient to discharge  the  respondent's  evidential  burden
             albeit by a "narrow margin" (paragraph 68).

         c. What was  required  for  an  appellant  to  raise  an  "innocent
             explanation" such as to return the burden to  the  respondent,
             was for them to raise a factual account of  having  taken  the
             test themselves that met the "minimum level  of  plausibility"
             (applying Shen (Paper Appeals: Proving Dishonesty) [2006]).

         The First-tier Tribunal in the  present  case  failed  entirely  to
         apply  the  stepped  approach  in  SM  and  Qadir,   treating   the
         respondent's evidence as if it were  sufficient  to  discharge  the
         legal burden of proof rather  than  merely  the  evidential  burden
         requiring a response.  In effect the judge required  the  appellant
         to discharge the legal burden of proof.

         Ground 2: The judge erred by reversing the burden of proof

         The burden on  the  appellant  was  merely  to  give  a  plausible,
         innocent explanation that the appellant sat  for  his  ETS  (TOEIC)
         exam.  The appellant gave his oral evidence in good English as said
         by the judge (at paragraph 29).  In his witness statement, produced
         in the case bundle, there were  various  documents  supporting  his
         appeal including his previous English  language  certificates  from
         IELTS prior to his arrival, his academic achievements  in  the  UK,
         his  letters  from  past  employer  and  tutor  who   unequivocally
         confirmed the appellant's proficiency in English  at  the  relevant
         time.

         The appellant gave a detailed account of his journey from  home  to
         the test centre and  produced  a  bank  statement  which  showed  a
         payment for a rail ticket in order to travel to the test centre  on
         the day of the test.  There was clear evidence  the  appellant  did
         attend the centre on the day of the test.

         The respondent produced a statement from Professor French,  a  Home
         Office report 'Project Fa�ade - criminal enquiry into abuse of  the
         TOEIC Queens' College, London, a  statement  from  Mr  Anwar  Tariq
         dated 14 November 2019 and also relied on the generic statements of
         Collings, Millington et al and a  certificate  of  the  appellant's
         test result.

         The judge failed to address the report of the APPG on  TOEIC  dated
         19th July 2019, which highlighted fundamental flaws in the evidence
         produced by the ETS.  This stated that the Home Office  had  relied
         extensively on the 2016 report by Professor Peter French  and  that
         in evidence  to  the  APPG,  Professor  French  stressed  that  his
         conclusion was only correct 'if the results the ETS had  given  the
         Home  Office  were  correct'.     "The  cornerstone  of  Government
         position undermined by expert who wrote it (sic)".

         Professor French in evidence to the APPG stressed  his  conclusions
         were only correct if the result that ETS  had  given  to  the  Home
         Office were correct.

         The  appellant  was  merely  required   to   raise   an   'innocent
         explanation', such as to return the burden  to  the  respondent  by
         giving  a  factual  account.  His  explanation  together  with  the
         substantial evidence that he was present at the test centre on  the
         day of the test and sat for himself should be accepted against  the
         generic evidence which was highly questionable and the legal burden
         on the respondent could not be discharged.

         The respondent did not rebut the appellant's  innocent  explanation
    and:

             "The FTTJ  based  on  the  project  fa�ade  (sic),  which  was
             included in the Respondent's bundle, drew a legal  presumption
             that even if the Appellant was present at the test  centre  on
             the day in question it did not necessary (sic)  mean  that  he
             took the test.  Such presumption of  the  FTTJ  is  completely
             erroneous."

         and

              "In  the  contrary  (sic)  the  Appellant  gave   satisfactory
              explanation (sic) with evidence about his TOEIC exam".

         Despite all the facts the judge still failed  to  shift  the  legal
         burden on the respondent and set the appellant an  impossible  task
         and required him to prove his innocence thus reversing  the  burden
         of proof.

         Ground 3 The judge  erred  in  failing  to  give  reasons  for  his
         conclusions on material matters.

         The judge rejected  the  appellant's  factual  account  largely  in
         reliance on the respondent's evidence contrary to the  approach  in
         SM and Qadir.  In doing so he said at paragraph 35 that:

             "There are two matters which go against  the  appellant.   The
             first is that the evidence produced by the respondent is  that
             80% of the tests on that day were taken by proxy.   There  was
             insufficient evidence that the rest were taken by  proxy,  but
             they were cancelled because of the evidence of irregularity on
             the day".

         And at paragraph 36:

             "If the appellant took this test, he must have been about  the
             only  one  who  did.   It  is  difficult  to   see   in   what
             circumstances Queens College would organize a cheating session
             unless all the participants in the test were involved  in  it.
             An innocent person who was taking the test would realise  what
             was going on and might object".

         By asserting the above remark, the judge was ultimately saying that
         all the tests taken at Queens' College were taken  by  proxy.   But
         the ETS did not make all the tests invalid  because  some  of  them
         were only questionable.

         It was argued that the Appellant had  been  taught  in  English  in
         Bangladesh and education establishments in the  UK  and  the  judge
         accepted this as a  valid  argument  but  said  that  even  if  the
         appellant spoke reasonable English at the time this  did  not  mean
         that he took the test.  At paragraph 34 the judge accepted that the
         appellant speaks good English now but said this  did  not  mean  he
         could speak it to the required standard in 2012;  thus,  the  judge
         was inconsistent in his reasoning.

         The judge seemed to have ignored or did not give due regard to  the
         evidence submitted in the appellant's  bundle  which  included  the
         IELTS certificate obtained  in  2008  with  5.5  in  speaking,  his
         academic certificates obtained in Bangladesh, and reference letters
         from  a  tutor  and  employer.   Although  some  of  his   academic
         certificates were awarded after 2012, they were  taught  throughout
         the years before 2012 and showed the  appellant  had  a  reasonable
         level of skill to be able to pass an ETS test without the help of a
         proxy.

         At paragraph 38 to 40 the judge heavily undermined the  appellant's
         innocent explanation because he did  not  get  in  touch  with  his
         college or ETS demanding an explanation.   The  appellant  did  not
         have a right of appeal to challenge the respondent's  decisions  of
         25th July 2014 or the 1st August 2016.  The judge imposed  a  heavy
         burden  on  the  appellant  to  discharge  his  duty  to  give   an
         explanation whereas the appellant only had to discharge this burden
         with minimum plausibility.

         The judge did not record any questions put in cross-examination and
         did not record anywhere any responses said to lack clarity.

         The judge did not record the highly detailed account given  by  the
         appellant in his witness statement of the  details  of  taking  the
         test, including its content.  The judge failed to take into account
         relevant material or failed to give adequate  reasons  for  finding
         that the appellant's account was vague.

         Ground 4 the judge failed to apply the  approach  mandated  in  the
         Court of Appeal in Majumder v the Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2016] EWCA 11 which held at paragraph 18:

         "... The UT accepted (at [69))] the submission  on  behalf  of  the
         Secretary of State, that in considering an allegation of dishonesty
         the relevant  factors  included  the  following:  what  the  person
         accused had to gain from being dishonest; what he had to lose; what
         is known about his character; the cultural environment in which  he
         operated; how the individual accused of dishonesty performed  under
         cross-examination, and whether the Tribunal's  assessment  of  that
         person's English language proficiency is commensurate with  his  or
         her TOEIC scores; and whether his or her academic achievements  are
         such that it was unnecessary or illogical for them to have cheated.
          There was no  criticism  in  this  court  by  Mr  Kovats  of  that
         approach."

         The judge failed to apply that approach and failed to consider what
         was known about the  appellant's  character,  failed  to  give  any
         consideration as to  whether  the  appellant's  English  was  of  a
         standard  commensurate  with  the  results  he  received,  gave  no
         consideration to what he would lose from cheating which was on  its
         face  unnecessary,  and  gave  no  consideration  at  all  to   the
         appellant's academic history.

 6. Following the  grant  of  permission  and  directions  further  written
    submissions were supplied by Michael West.  Although at the hearing  Mr
    Karim  described  these  as  'expanding'  on  the  grounds  for   which
    permission was granted,  I note, in particular,  that  it  is  asserted
    that the judge failed to have regard that the low evidential  threshold
    on  the  appellant  was  "not  the  civil  standard   of   balance   of
    probabilities", that the judge had reached "a  perverse  conclusion  in
    the face of overwhelming evidence capable of amounting to  an  innocent
    explanation", and the submissions identified that the APPG  highlighted
    the serious deficiencies in the evidence used by the Secretary of State
    to condemn the test-takers.

 7. It was asserted the judge arguably erred in overreliance on the generic
    evidence from the Project Fa�ade.  None of the generic evidence in  the
    Project Fa�ade report was relevant to the  actual  date  the  Appellant
    took the test on 12th December 2012.    It  was  clear  that  from  the
    generic  evidence  different  methods  were  used  when  evidence   was
    uncovered of the mode for using  proxy  test-takers  including  "remote
    testing" (i.e., when  a  real  candidate  does  not  attend)  but  also
    "pilots" being used i.e., when the real candidate  does  attend  but  a
    pilot takes the exam in their stead.

 8. Again, it was repeated that the findings in respect of the  appellant's
    evidence at 31 was perverse. The judge used the fact that the appellant
    first failed a TOEIC test on 21st November 2012 to conclude that he may
    have wished to ensure that he passed but  the  look  up  tool  did  not
    reflect the fact that the appellant failed;  his  speaking  test  which
    indicated he scored 180, that was a pass and  the  appellant,  and  the
    judge may have become confused if the appellant failed his writing test
    on that day scoring 150.  This point had been  adversely  held  against
    the appellant when he had not actually failed his speaking test on  the
    21st November, he only failed overall due to his writing test  and  the
    appellant appears to have  mistakenly  intimated  that  he  failed  the
    speaking part.

 9. The decision should be set aside.

10. In the hearing before me, Mr Karim submitted that the judge  failed  to
    apply the three stage approach as  required.   The  appellant  was  not
    required to "rebut" but to provide an innocent explanation.  The  judge
    had  not  taken  into  account  the  relevant  evidence  such  as   the
    appellant's ability to speak English, his studies and his diplomas  and
    the fact that a tutor had given a reference stating he had taught  him.



11. SM and Qadir particularly at paragraph  69,  set  out  an  inexhaustive
    array of factors to  be  considered  and  which  the  judge  failed  to
    address.  The judge had only approached the  evidence  in  a  piecemeal
    fashion and had failed to consider the extensive evidence.  There  were
    inadequate findings from the judge and the reference at  paragraph  36,
    such that the appellant was the only one who attended  the  centre  was
    contrary to the evidence before the judge as disclosed by page 3 of the
    Project Fa�ade report which demonstrated that  there  was  evidence  of
    remote testing seen.  The academic achievements of the  appellant  were
    not appreciated, and it was illogical to draw the  conclusion  that  he
    could not speak English.  Another factor was what was known  about  the
    character and the conduct of the appellant which was  not  acknowledged
    despite  being  evidence  from  the  cricket  club  showing  he  had  a
    reasonable command of the English  language.   There  was  a  wholesale
    failure to grapple with the evidence.

12. The lookup tool showed that the previous test was classified as invalid
    which suggested that a proxy would have taken and failed the test which
    was not credible.  Mr Karim confirmed that the appellant took  all  the
    components of the test on the second occasion. In essence  this  called
    into the question the reliability of all of the evidence.

13. As could be seen from the Court of Appeal's judgment in SSHD v  Shehzad
    [2016] EWCA Civ 615, it was only where there were invalid results where
    there was  a  detection  of  a  proxy.   This  undermined  the  judge's
    conclusion at paragraphs 35 and 36 that  the  appellant  was  the  only
    person who genuinely took the test.

14. Mr Karim then referred to the APPG report and although Mr Karim  argued
    that it should be considered, it was  established  that  this  was  not
    before the First-tier Tribunal, the report is dated 18th July 2019  and
    the appellant has been represented throughout.

15. Miss Isherwood relied on the written submissions of Mr Clarke and  also
    submitted that there was no application  to  put  to  the  APPG  report
    before this Tribunal.  Many of the grounds of submissions relied on the
    fact that the appellant could speak English at the time  but  that  did
    not take account of MA (ETS- TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT  450  (IAC)  at
    paragraph 57 and there were a lot of reasons why people cheated even if
    they were proficient in English.

16. Looking at the structure of the decision it was clear  that  the  judge
    had taken into account SM and  Qadir  and  for  example,  paragraph  41
    described the prima facie case to answer.  Miss Isherwood  referred  to
    paragraphs 15 and 16 where  the  judge  had  set  out  the  burden  and
    standard of proof and then gone through the evidence.  The evidence had
    been covered in extensive detail.  It was clear from paragraph 20  that
    the judge accepted that the generic evidence  provided  a  prima  facie
    case and the ball passed to the appellant which the  judge  then  fully
    took into account.  He noted at paragraph 25 that the appellant  stated
    he had taken the test and remarked at paragraph 39  that  there  was  a
    lack  of  action  from  the  appellant  albeit  that  he  was   legally
    represented throughout.  The judge at paragraph 30 considered the clear
    evidence that he attended the centre.

17. At paragraph 32 it was not the case that the judge ignored  the  letter
    from the teacher or the cricket team and it was clear that there was an
    acknowledgement of that evidence.  There may be many  reasons  why  the
    appellant took the test, and the judge factored this in.  At  paragraph
    37 the judge was persuaded that there was no action of the appellant to
    rectify the issue albeit that he was aware in 2014  that  he  had  been
    considered to have cheated.

18. I was urged to uphold the determination.

Analysis

19. I question whether the grounds of appeal,  together  with  the  further
    submissions, are in fact based on a cut and paste  undertaking  from  a
    template or other grounds of appeal in other cases.  I say this because
    ground 2, which asserted a reversal of the burden of proof,  refers  to
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge failing to address the report of the APPG
    on TOEIC dated 19th July 2019.  Much was made of this document  in  the
    grounds of appeal on which  permission  was  granted.   The  permission
    grant dated 26th February 2020 specifically referred to  ground  2  and
    stated as follows:

         "The grounds in support of the (in time) application  first  argued
         that the Judge failed to  apply  a  final  legal  burden  upon  the
         respondent to prove that the appellant used  a  proxy  as  alleged.
         This argument would have no merit by itself given the reference  at
         [41] to correct the burden.  Nonetheless the individual  points  of
         complaint contained in the  second  and  third  grounds  create  an
         arguable case that the judge did not actually apply a burden.   The
         Judge attaches such great  weight  to  the  respondent's  'generic'
         evidence that, at this permission stage at least, I cannot see  how
         any appellant could realistically have overcome it.  The Judge  did
         find two specific matters undermined credibility, but  the  logical
         difficulties set out in the  grounds  are  arguable.   The  grounds
         therefore cross the threshold of arguability, notwithstanding  that
         they challenge findings of fact.  Any such error  would  likely  be
         material, the issue of suitability  being  at  the  centre  of  the
         appeal.

20. As Mr Karim acknowledged at the hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal  (I
    note there was no indication that Mr Karim  settled  the  grounds)  the
    APPG on TOEIC document was not before the First-tier  Tribunal.   There
    was no formal application to admit it.   Even  if  an  application  had
    been made under Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489, principles it  would
    not have succeeded.  The  appellant  was  legally  represented  at  all
    points and the document,  according  to  the  grounds  of  appeal,  was
    published on 19th July 2019 well before the hearing before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 15th November 2019 and the decision being  promulgated
    four days later.

21. Similarly, reliance on a document, even if it is in the  public  domain
    should be specifically identified and drawn to  the  attention  of  the
    judge at the First-tier Tribunal.  As held in BH (policies/information:
    SOS's duties) Iraq [2020] UKUT  189  (IAC)  despite  their  experience,
    judges in the Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber  cannot  reasonably  be
    expected to possess a comprehensive knowledge of each and every  policy
    of the Secretary of State in the immigration field, even less each  and
    every document at large and in the public domain on which the appellant
    wishes to rely.  By analogy reports said to be  in  the  public  domain
    should be brought to the attention of the judge by the party wishing to
    rely upon it.

22. Following the grant of permission on  26th  February  2020,  directions
    were issued in the light of the COVID pandemic to the effect  that  the
    parties should comment on whether the appeal was to  be  determined  on
    the papers and invited to make further submissions thereon on  7th  May
    2020.  In response  to  those  directions  thirteen  pages  of  further
    submissions were submitted by Michael West of Counsel.  In response  to
    my enquiry, according to Mr  Karim  these  grounds  "expanded"  on  the
    grounds within the challenge but did not raise fresh  grounds.   I  can
    see that the challenge in relation to the burden and standard of  proof
    has been raised previously in  the  grounds  on  which  permission  was
    granted, but at paragraph 16 onwards there is a challenge  in  relation
    to perversity and there is further reference to the APPG report  which,
    as I have said, was not before the FtT.   The further  submissions  set
    out large sections of that report to  support  the  argument  that  the
    judge erred in the overreliance upon generic evidence concerning TOEIC.



23. A further argument raised in the further submissions was that  none  of
    the generic evidence in the Project Fa�ade report was relevant  to  the
    actual date the appellant took the test (on  the  12th  December  2012)
    (paragraph 43 of the further submissions).

24.  Perversity  was  not  specifically  raised  in  the  grounds   granted
    permission.  Perversity has a very high threshold.  The APPG report was
    not before the judge.

25. I turn to address the grounds on which permission was actually granted.

26.  Ground 1, that the judge failed to apply the approach  to  the  burden
    and standard of proof as set out in SM and Qadir.

27. The approach in SM and Qadir is set out at paragraph 57:

         "57.     Both the applicable principles and the jurisprudence  were
             reviewed  by  this  Tribunal  in  its   recent   decision   in
             Muhandiramge (Section S-LTR.1.7) [2015] UKUT 00675  (IAC),  at
             [9] - [11]:
             '9. Burdens and standard  of  proof  have  progressively,  and
                   almost with stealth, become  an  established  feature  of
                   decision making in the field of  immigration  and  asylum
                   law.  Their  emergence  may  properly  be  described   as
                   organic. They have featured particularly in  cases  where
                   it  is  alleged  by  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the
                   applicant has engaged in deception or dishonesty with the
                   result  that  the  application  in  question  should   be
                   refused. This discrete line of authority is  not  recent,
                   being traceable to the decision of the Immigration Appeal
                   Tribunal in Olufosoye [1992]  IMM  AR  141.  In  tribunal
                   jurisprudence, the origins of this particular lineage can
                   be traced to the decision of the House of Lords  in  R  v
                   Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department,  ex  parte
                   Khawaja [1984] AC 74, which concerned  the  inter-related
                   issues of  procuring  entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  by
                   deception and precedent fact in the Secretary of  State's
                   ensuing decision making process. It is  well  established
                   that in such cases the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the
                   Secretary of State and the standard of proof  belongs  to
                   the higher end of the balance of probabilities spectrum.
             10.            One  of  the  more  recent   reported decisions
                   belonging to this stable is that of Shen (Paper  Appeals:
                   Proving Dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC). This  decision
                   is  illustrative  of  the  moderately  complex   exercise
                   required of tribunals from time to time. Here  the  Upper
                   Tribunal held, in  harmony  with  established  principle,
                   that in certain contexts the evidential  pendulum  swings
                   three times and in three different directions:
                   (a)              First,  where  the  Secretary   of State
                         alleges that an applicant has practised  dishonesty
                         or deception in an application for leave to remain,
                         there is an evidential burden on the  Secretary  of
                         State. This requires that  sufficient  evidence  be
                         adduced to raise an issue as to  the  existence  or
                         non-existence of a fact in issue: for  example,  by
                         producing the completed application which is  prima
                         facie deceitful in some material fashion.
                   (b)             The  spotlight  thereby  switches  to the
                         applicant. If he discharges the burden - again,  an
                         evidential   one   -   of   raising   an   innocent
                         explanation, namely an account which satisfies  the
                         minimum level of plausibility, a  further  transfer
                         of the burden of proof occurs.
                   (c)             Where (b) is satisfied, the  burden rests
                         on the Secretary of  State  to  establish,  on  the
                         balance  of  probabilities,  that  the  Appellant's
                         prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.
                   A veritable burden of proof boomerang!
             11.         Shen is preceded by  a  lengthy  line  of Tribunal
                   jurisprudence to this effect: see JC (Part  9  HC  395  -
                   Burden of Proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027,  at  [10];  MZ
                   (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
                   [2009] EWCA  Civ  919,  at  [25];  Mumu  (Paragraph  320;
                   Article 8; Scope)  [2012]  UKUT  143  (IAC);  and  Kareem
                   (Proxy marriages - EU  law)  [2014]  UKUT  24  (IAC).  In
                   short, in cases of alleged deceit, the  legal  rules  are
                   well settled.'
         In this context, we highlight what was stated at [11] of Shen:
            'At the end of the day the SSHD bears the burden of proof.  This
             is  a  proposition  which  is  uncontroversial  and  has  been
             confirmed on many occasions."
         We record here the submission of Mr Biggs on behalf of  the  second
         Appellant, with which we agree, that, doctrinally, a  legal  burden
         of proof does not 'shift'."

28. The grounds advanced that  the  judge  failed  entirely  to  apply  the
    stepped approach in SM and Qadir.   The judge at paragraph  15  made  a
    general statement as to the appellant fulfilling  the  requirements  of
    the immigration rules but showed at paragraph 16 that he was aware that
    where the  respondent  alleged  fraud  it  is  for  the  respondent  to
    demonstrate that on the balance of probabilities.

29. The judge demonstrated in the determination that he was  clearly  aware
    that there was a shifting burden of proof and careful  reading  of  the
    decision discloses a reference to the use of the concept  of  'a  prima
    facie case'.  This is language that would not have been  used  had  the
    judge been unaware of the shifting burden of evidential proof.

30.  In  his  opening  paragraph,  under  'consideration  of  evidence  and
    findings' at [20] the judge referred  to  the  'generic  statements  of
    Collings, Millington et al used in these cases and a certificate of the
    appellant's test results'.  This shows the judge was aware of the first
    step under SM and Qadir.

31. Indeed, the written submissions correctly pointed out that at paragraph
    21 that the judge stated:

         "It is well-established case  law  that  these  generic  statements
         together with the relevant results  of  test  certificates  of  the
         appellant provide a prima facie case that the  test  was  taken  by
         proxy. The appellant can rebut this with evidence."

32. Mr Karim took issue with the use of the word "rebut"  but  this  merely
    means "remove the effect of the other sides facts or arguments".   This
    can no doubt include reference to the evidential burden.  The judge was
    clearly aware having applied the first step, that the evidential burden
    then shifted to the appellant.

33. The judge did proceed  to  consider  the  appellant's  explanation  and
    evidence in depth from paragraph 25 onwards. Rather  than  setting  out
    self-directions in law the judge simply applied  them.    His  approach
    thus also accorded with the second stage of the approach to burden  and
    standard of proof because as stated at the second stage in SM and Qadir
    "the spotlight therefore switches to the applicant.  If  he  discharges
    the burden  -  again  an  evidential  one  -  of  raising  an  innocent
    explanation, namely an account which satisfies  the  minimum  level  of
    plausibility, a further transfer of the burden of proof occurs".

34. The judge at paragraph 25 took into account  that  the  appellant  gave
    evidence that he had taken the test himself and that he had not used  a
    proxy.  The judge clearly considered the appellant's evidence.

35. Finally, at paragraph 41 in particular the judge states:

         "There is a prima facie case for  the  appellant  to  answer.   The
         appellant can rebut this with evidence.  On the evidence before  me
         I do not find that he has.  I find the respondent  has  established
         on the balance of probabilities that the  appellant  used  a  proxy
         test and to obtain the certificate on 12th December 2012".

36. This identifies that the judge was aware  of  the  shifting  burden  of
    proof and that the ultimate responsibility lay in the  respondent  when
    discharging the legal burden of proof.

37. The judge between paragraphs 22  and  24  referred  to  the  additional
    evidence which was relied upon by the respondent and that this evidence
    was referred to at that stage in the determination does  not  undermine
    the validity of the judge's overall approach. Mr  Karim  affirmed  that
    the analysis of the relevant facts could be  taken  under  stage  2  or
    stage 3.

38. It is not apparent from a careful reading of the determination that the
    judge failed to apply the approach of SM and Qadir.

39. Turning to ground 2, it was asserted that the judge reversed the burden
    of proof.  Much of that ground  relied  on  the  APPG  report.  I  have
    already pointed out that the APPG report  was  not  before  the  judge.
    According to the further written grounds the judge  applied  the  wrong
    standard of proof.  The judge  made  clear  reference  to  the  correct
    standard of proof at the outset of his determination at paragraph 16.

40. Having referred to the evidence on  which  the  respondent  relied,  at
    paragraphs 20 to  24,  the  judge  went  on  to  acknowledge  that  the
    appellant's  plausible,  innocent  explanation.   This,  together  with
    paragraph 41, does not indicate that the judge reversed the  burden  of
    proof.  Indeed, the appellant's explanation is set out at paragraph  25
    where the judge states the appellant gave evidence that  he  had  taken
    the test himself and had not used a proxy.  The judge stated:

         "25.     The appellant gave evidence that he  had  taken  the  test
             himself.  He had not used a proxy.  He had failed  a  test  at
             Queensway College the month before.  He re-sat the  text.   He
             travelled from Watford to the test centre to  take  the  test.
             He produced a bank statement which showed a payment for a rail
             ticket in order to travel there that day.  He gave a  detailed
             account of the journey and of the  test  procedure.   He  said
             that the certificate issued bore his photograph which had been
             taken at the test centre on the day of the test.  He  was  not
             able to produce the certificate as it had  been  sent  to  the
             respondent."

41. Reference was made in the further submissions to the "minimum level  of
    plausibility" but as identified in Shehzad at paragraph  3,  the  civil
    standard of proof is just that, the balance of probabilities.

           "3...The approach in Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35, [2009] 1 AC
           11 to the standard of proof required to establish that a  child
           "is likely to suffer significant harm" under  section  31(2)  of
           the Children Act 1989 is of relevance in the present context. It
           was held in that case that the standard required is the  balance
           of probabilities. Baroness Hale stated (at [70])  that  "neither
           the seriousness of the allegation nor  the  seriousness  of  the
           consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof
           to  be  applied  in  determining   the   facts.   The   inherent
           probabilities are simply something to  be  taken  into  account,
           where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies."

42. The question as to whether it is more likely than not that the  balance
    of probabilities is fulfilled  will  rest  on  the  assessment  of  the
    evidence.  The weighing of that evidence is a matter for the judge, and
    in this case, he went through a careful analysis of  all  the  evidence
    and ultimately rejected the appellant's  explanation.   That  does  not
    mean he has reversed the burden of proof as shown by  paragraph  41  of
    the determination.

43. The grounds state that the "respondent's generic evidence"  is  "highly
    questionable at paragraph 13 and indeed that is repeated in the further
    submissions but SM and Qadir accepted that  the  generic  evidence  was
    sufficient albeit just.

44. From a reading of the decision, it cannot be argued that the judge  set
    the appellant an impossible task  of  requiring  him  to  prove  he  is
    innocent by reversing the burden of proof.  The judge as  can  be  seen
    took into account all of the evidence and was cognisant of the relevant
    facts  and  spelt  out  at  paragraph  41  that  "the  respondent   has
    established on the balance of probabilities that the appellant  used  a
    proxy to sit the  test  and  obtain  the  certificate".   That  clearly
    identifies that the judge was aware that the ultimate legal  burden  of
    proof rests with the respondent.

45. The grounds in effect are an attempt to reargue the evidence.

46. Ground 3 asserts  that  the  judge  failed  to  give  reasons  for  his
    conclusions on material matters.  There was criticism  in  the  further
    submissions that the judge had not considered  all  relevant  evidence.
    The judge, however, acknowledged the  substantial  evidence  which  had
    been produced by the appellant and indeed engaged with that evidence.

47. The points in the written further submissions also criticise the weight
    the judge gave to parts of the evidence for example the Project  Fa�ade
    report and the appellant's own evidence and material.  The approach was
    construed as perverse.  As the Court of Appeal said at [18] of  Herrera
    v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412,  it  is  necessary  to  guard  against  the
    temptation to characterise as errors of law what are in reality no more
    than disagreements about the weight to be given to  different  factors.
     The judge had the benefit of seeing the appellant give evidence first-
    hand and McCombe LJ in Lowe v SSHD [2021] EWCA  62,  at  paragraph  25,
    explains the caution to be exercised by appellate courts in interfering
    with evaluative decisions of first instance judges who  will  have  had
    the 'whole sea of evidence before them' and the  first-hand  experience
    of hearing the appellant give evidence.

48. From paragraph 25 onwards, the judge analysed the evidence put  forward
    by the appellant in  his  "innocent  explanation"  comprehensively  and
    acknowledged that the appellant had produced  a  bank  statement  which
    showed a payment for a rail ticket for an order to travel to  the  test
    centre on the day.  The judge noted that the appellant spoke English in
    Bangladesh, had passed an English language test when he was there,  had
    studied in the United Kingdom for an HND and various diplomas  and  had
    taken an MBA at Sunderland University and that all the college  courses
    were in English.  This was set out at paragraph 26.

49. The judge also identified that the appellant had produced a letter from
    a former tutor confirming that the appellant  spoke  English  well  and
    identified that the appellant gave evidence  at  the  hearing  in  good
    English.  The judge clearly sets out the appellant's case at  paragraph
    30, having reviewed that evidence.  Only then did the judge proceed  to
    bring the strands of evidence together; the judge stated that

           "The evidence produced by  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
           candidates for tests on other days were present when others took
           the test for them.  Candidates would have had to attend the test
           centre to produce their identification.[31]"

    The judge thus accepted that the appellant would have had to have  made
    the journey on that day and he would know the way there  and  he  would
    know what happened at the test centre but that  particular  finding  of
    the judge at paragraph 36 was criticised when saying that

           "If the appellant is tested he must have been about the only one
          who did".

    First this statement does not categorically state  that  the  appellant
    was the only one because of the use of the word "about".   Secondly  it
    is not made out that it is a  fundamental  misreading  of  the  Project
    Fa�ade report.  That in fact stated, "evidence of  remote  testing  was
    seen".  Paragraph 4 of the Project Fa�ade  report,  specifically  notes
    that different methods were used when evidence  was  uncovered  of  the
    mode for using proxy test-takers including "remote testing" (i.e.  when
    the real candidate does not attend) and "but also 'pilots'  being  used
    i.e. where the real candidate does attend but a  pilot  takes  exam  in
    their stead)."    This could be  read  either  way  that  some  of  the
    candidates attended and some of them did not but  logged  on  remotely.
    It was open to the judge to make the  comments  that  he  did  in  this
    regard and to find that it was logically feasible for the appellant  to
    indeed have attended on that day.

50. There was criticism of the judge's findings at paragraph 35 and  36  by
    reliance on Shehzad in that  only  where  proxies  were  used  could  a
    certificate  be  classified  as  invalid  and  that  not  all  of   the
    certificates were found to be invalid and some were  questionable.   In
    other words, the appellant may have  been  one  of  the  'questionable'
    ones.   That criticism would appear to ignore the fact that there was a
    'look up tool' which specifically declared the appellant's test  to  be
    invalid along with a very significant  statistical  figure  of  80%  of
    those who took the test  on  that  day  being  declared  to  have  used
    proxies.  Nothing in Shehzad undermines the  judge's  finding  in  that
    regard. Those are the figures of ETS.

51. It is clear that the  judge  did  not  ignore  the  IELTS  certificates
    obtained in 2008 or the academic certificates obtained  as  these  were
    specifically identified at paragraph 26.  As noted in the grounds, some
    of the appellant's academic certificates were awarded after  2012.   It
    was submitted that "all these evidences (sic) could sufficiently  prove
    that the appellant had a reasonable level of English language skill  to
    pass an ETS test without the help of a proxy test-taker".  That may  be
    the conclusion by the author of the grounds, but it was for  the  judge
    to assess the evidence overall which he did.

52. Mr Karim also ran an argument that the previous test of  21st  November
    was classified as invalid, and that it would be  ludicrous  to  suggest
    that a proxy would have sat a test only to fail it.  That  was  not  an
    argument that was run before the First-tier Tribunal but moreover,  the
    judge, as I pointed out, proceeded on the evidence that  the  appellant
    himself put forward that he failed the exam.  As Mr  Karim  identified,
    the appellant was to take all of the components of the test and  indeed
    failed the writing test on 21st November 2012 but  achieved  30  points
    higher, 180, not three weeks later.  It was entirely open to the  judge
    to find that the appellant had the incentive to cheat because  of  time
    pressures.

53. The argument that it was absurd for  a  proxy  to  have  taken  a  test
    previously and failed does not alter the spotlight from the later  test
    under scrutiny.   As pointed out by the judge, it was  the  appellant's
    own evidence and not just the evidence of the ETS, that  the  appellant
    had taken a test and failed it on  21st  November  2012  and  thus  the
    appellant "was under pressure to pass the test to enable  him  to  make
    his application of 23rd January 2012" (in fact  the  leave  expired  on
    28th January 2013 but I do not find this slip material). In the further
    submissions in writing, it was detailed (as it was not in  the  grounds
    given permission) that the appellant had not 'failed' a  speaking  test
    in November; it was submitted that at the  hearing  the  appellant  was
    confused but that does not mean that the  judge  was  not  entitled  or
    erred when relying  on  his  oral  evidence.   The  fact  is  that  the
    appellant did fail even if it  were  only  the  writing  element.    He
    needed to pass both sections. Secondly the speaking part of the test in
    November scored 180 whereas it appears the  writing  test  scored  150.
    From the lookup tool, it appears  the  ETS  description  'invalid'  was
    ascribed as a composite description of the status.  In other words,  it
    is not necessarily absurd for 'the proxy  to  have  failed  a  speaking
    test' because it appears whoever took the test did not fail; that  test
    was classified as invalid.     The criticism proceeds on the basis that
    the same person took both the  writing  and  the  speaking  test.   The
    writing  test  element  in  November  however  only  scored   150   and
    notwithstanding was a fail, and, the  applicant  needed  to  pass  both
    sections.

54. As the judge recorded with regard the appellant "He was under  pressure
    to pass the test to enable him to make his application...If he  failed,
    his leave would have run out".  It was submitted to me at  the  hearing
    that six weeks was sufficient time within which to take  another  test,
    but I consider that these are arguments which should have  been  raised
    before the judge at the First-tier Tribunal and in  any  event  without
    merit.  There were clearly only three weeks between the tests taken and
    failed on 21st November 2012 and the retake on 12th December  2012  and
    immediately prior to the  Christmas  vacation.   The  visa  expired  in
    January the following year and within a matter of weeks  of  the  first
    failure.   The judge clearly found and was entitled to find that to  be
    a short period of time.  The judge's reasoning was  not  inadequate  on
    this basis.

55. Notwithstanding, the period of the test  dates  was  not  lost  on  the
    judge, but moreover he found, at paragraph 33, for a cogent reason that
    the appellant "may simply have wished to ensure that he passed".    The
    judge was entitled to make that finding.

56. The grounds also submit that the appellant did  not  have  a  right  of
    appeal to challenge the respondent's decisions dated 25th July 2014  or
    1st August 2016.  The grounds also criticised the judge's  analysis  of
    the failure of the appellant to get in touch with  Queens'  College  or
    ETS prior to 9th November 2019 and  criticised  the  weight  the  judge
    attached to this failure.

57. The point made by the judge in context, is that the appellant was fully
    represented throughout but on receipt of the refusal letters  did  not,
    as an intelligent well-educated man, challenge those  decisions  either
    by statutory appeal or judicial review or by  reference  to  ETS.  That
    finding was open to the judge.

58. The judge, however, states at paragraph 37

           "the appellant gave evidence that he  became  aware  that  there
           were issues with his certificate before  the  respondent  raised
           this in the refusal letter of 25 July 2014'.  He had applied for
           a PH.D. course at London Southbank University.  He was told that
           the University would not accept his  TOEIC  certificate  because
           there were irregularities with it.  He made  other  applications
           to other establishments all of which were refused for  the  same
           reason".

    And at paragraph 38:

         "An innocent man presented with that  allegation  [cheating  in  an
         exam] would have got in touch with Queensway College immediately to
         demand an  explanation.   He  would  have  contacted  ETS  to  seek
         clarification.  He would want to obtain the test results and listen
         to recordings to see if someone else was speaking on the recording.
         He would have insisted upon knowing how the results  were  recorded
         and  how  it  was  known  that   the   recording   considered   was
         unequivocally linked to him'...'The appellant  did  none  of  those
         things'".

59. Bearing  in  mind  the  appellant  became  aware  before  2014  of  the
    difficulties with his certificate, it was entirely open to the judge to
    state at paragraph 39 that the appellant effectively  took  no  action,
    even when he received the refusal letter of 25th  July  2014.   If  the
    appellant was unable to appeal it was still open to him to contact  ETS
    and Queensway College and open to him to take a judicial review  as  he
    clearly did later.  The fact is the refusal was  certified  as  clearly
    unfounded on 23rd July 2015 and there was apparently  no  challenge  to
    the certification, rather, the appellant waited until May 2016 to  make
    further submissions.  The judge noted that the appellant  had  made  an
    application to the High Court and was legally  represented  throughout.
    The judge also noted that the appellant, apparently of good  character,
    was having his applications to study  rejected  because  of  the  issue
    around his test certificate.

60. In The Queen (On the application of) Abbas v the Secretary of State for
    the Home Department the court observed that

          'No steps were taken by the Claimant to obtain the recording'

      and the appellant's explanation was disbelieved.  At paragraph  24  Mr
      Justice Davis held
          "The Claimant had no sensible  explanation  for  his  failure  to
          obtain the voice recording. Mr Malik made the point  that  it  is
          not for the Claimant to prove his case and that the Secretary  of
          State could also have obtained the recording. That would not have
          got her very far in the absence of a  sample  of  the  Claimant's
          voice with which to compare it".

61. The judge in this instance did consider the appellant's explanation for
    the failure to  obtain  a  recording  as  noted  at  paragraph  38  and
    identified that one week before the hearing of the appeal the appellant
    sent an email to ETS to request information about  the  test.   It  was
    open to the judge to observe that this was a belated  attempt  to  give
    some explanation for his failure to investigate or challenge  the  test
    results in the five years between 23rd July 2014 and 15th November 2019
    and to give weight to it.

62. In response to the criticism that the judge failed to record  the  oral
    evidence put to the appellant the decision references  the  appellant's
    oral evidence throughout the decision for example as paragraphs 25, 26,
    29, 37 and 40.  The judge has  clearly  woven  the  evidence  into  the
    decision and referenced the written evidence throughout.

63. The judge did not impose a heavy burden on the appellant  to  discharge
    his duty to give  an  innocent  explanation  but  merely  assessed  the
    evidence and found on balance that the explanation was wanting.

64. The evidence with regards to Queensway College,  that  is  the  Project
    Fa�ade report, is further evidence to that referred to in SM and  Qadir
    being the statements  of  Collings,  Millington  et  al  and  Professor
    French.  The lookup tool was specific to the  appellant  was  provided.
    The additional  evidence,  which  was  relied  on  by  the  respondent,
    identified at paragraph 22, that 80% of the tests taken on the day  the
    appellant was stated to have taken his test were established as  having
    been taken by a  proxy  and  were  invalid.   The  rest  (eleven)  were
    regarded as questionable.   That is  not  an  insignificant  number  of
    fraudulent tests.  The judge also noted at paragraph  23  that  between
    20th March 2012 and 5th February 2014,  2,793  tests  were  taken,  and
    investigations revealed that 1,971 had been taken  by  proxy  and  'the
    rest were cancelled as being questionable'.  Contrary to  the  grounds,
    that did, in fact, as the Project Fa�ade report noted, cover the period
    during which the appellant took the test on 12th December 2012.  Albeit
    that the audits occurred on 16th April 2013 and 17 September 2013,  the
    evidence nonetheless indicated that ongoing and longstanding fraud  had
    occurred at the college.  The judge was fully aware of the dates as per
    paragraph 23 and was entitled, as he did, to include this report in his
    assessment of the final legal burden resting on the respondent.

65. In the instant case the tests were either invalid or questionable, that
    means there were no validated tests at that test centre on the day  the
    appellant was said to have legitimately taken the test, and  as  stated
    in The Queen (On the application of) Abbas v the Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2017] EWHC 78 at paragraph 14 'it is of evidential
    significance that there were no apparently genuine  candidates  on  the
    day in question'.

66. Ground 4 submits that the judge failed to apply the  approach  mandated
    by the Court of Appeal in Majumder v the Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 1167 at paragraphs 18, that is all  the
    relevant factors relating to the appellant.

67. I repeat, for convenience, the relevant factors  set  out  in  Majumder
    which include

           'what the person accused had to gain from being dishonest;  what
           he had to lose; what is known about his character; the  cultural
           environment in which he operated; how the individual accused  of
           dishonesty performed under cross-examination,  and  whether  the
           Tribunal's  assessment  of  that   person's   English   language
           proficiency is commensurate with his or her  TOEIC  scores;  and
           whether his or her academic achievements are such  that  it  was
           unnecessary or illogical for them to have cheated'.

68. It is not evident that the judge failed  to  take  into  account  these
    elements and I refer to the approach and findings of the judge  covered
    above. Not every piece of evidence needs necessarily to be set  out  in
    the decision but that said, the judge addressed  the  salient  factors.
    The judge set out what the accused had to gain (further  leave  in  the
    UK), and what he had to lose; at paragraph 38 the judge properly  notes
    that exam  cheating  has  very  serious  consequences.   There  was  no
    suggestion that the appellant had a history of dishonesty.

69. The judge referred to the appellant's college  background  and  cricket
    environment and was aware of his academic  achievements  in  Bangladesh
    and the UK; that is the cultural environment, in  which  the  appellant
    operated.  The judge specifically referred to the appellant's  academic
    certificates, his studies in Bangladesh and in the UK, and at paragraph
    32, to the evidence that the appellant brought to bear on the case that
    he had been taught in Bangladesh and in the UK in English.

70. The judge specifically at paragraph 34 noted  that  the  appellant  was
    able to speak good English now.  There  was  no  inconsistency  in  the
    finding of the judge that the appellant may have  been  able  to  speak
    good English at the hearing but not necessarily in 2012  and,  further,
    the judge found there were many  reasons  why  someone  might  wish  to
    cheat.    There was no indication that the appellant did  not  bear  up
    under cross-examination and at paragraph 25 the  judge  noted  that  he
    gave a detailed account of the journey and the  test  procedure.   That
    does not mean that the evidence has to be accepted.   However,  as  the
    judge noted, the evidence produced showed that  candidates  engaged  in
    fraud could in fact attend the centre on the  day  in  question.   That
    some operated by 'remote means' as identified  by  the  Project  Fa�ade
    report does not undermine the judge's point.

71. Turning to the assessment of the appellant's English by the  judge;  as
    stated in Majumder at paragraph 25, the assertion that the UT erred  in
    failing to have regard to the quality of the  respondent's  English  at
    the hearing when concluding that neither of them had cheated  in  their
    TOEIC exams went "nowhere."  The Court  of  Appeal  remarked  upon  the
    relevance of the passage of time between the date of the test  and  the
    hearing.

72. As to the tutor's reference, there was no indication of  the  threshold
    or benchmark set by the tutor, who confirmed that the  appellant  spoke
    English well and the judge identified this at paragraph 27.

73. Critically, the judge rightly stated at paragraph 33 that "even if  the
    appellant spoke reasonable English at the time this does not mean  that
    he took the test".  It is relevant to note that the test failed by  the
    appellant in November 2012 was a writing test, but it was open  to  the
    judge to find the appellant, notwithstanding  that  he  was  conversant
    with English "may simply have wished to ensure that he passed".

74. As set out in  MA  (ETS-  TOEIC  testing)  [2016]  UKUT  450  (IAC)  at
    paragraph 57 motive can be difficult to determine and

          "In the abstract, of course, there is  a  range  of  reasons  why
          persons proficient in English may engage in TOEIC  fraud.   These
          include, inexhaustively, lack of  confidence,  fear  of  failure,
          lack of time and commitment  and  contempt  for  the  immigration
          system.  These reasons could conceivably  overlap  in  individual
          cases and there is scope for  other  explanations  for  deceitful
          conduct in this sphere".

75. Many of the points raised in this challenge were in  fact  answered  in
    The Queen (On the application of) Abbas v the Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department by Mr Justice Davis.  He reiterated that each  case
    was fact sensitive as to the factors to be  considered  when  assessing
    whether the Secretary of State had discharged the legal burden  in  any
    case (paragraph 26) and as Mr Justice Davis stated at paragraph 27

         "In any event it will be difficult if not  impossible  for  a  fact
         finding tribunal (whether in my position or that of the First  Tier
         Tribunal) to reach clear conclusions as to  motive.  As  the  Upper
         Tribunal observed in MA (supra) ...there may be  many  reasons  why
         even someone proficient in English may engage in TOEIC fraud.   The
         crucial issue is whether the evidence in a particular  case  proves
         to  the  necessary  standard  that  the  individual  concerned  has
         knowingly provided a fraudulent TOEIC certificate."

    Indeed, Mr Justice Davis also referred to the fact that  the  appellant
    appeared to be the only person at the hearing centre on the day.

76. I repeat it was held in Majumder every case will be fact-sensitive  and
    the outcome determined on the basis of  the  evidence  adduced  by  the
    parties.  The judge  factored  into  his  conclusions,  when  assessing
    whether the respondent had discharged the legal  burden,  his  findings
    following an evaluative assessment of the weight to  be  given  to  the
    evidence.  It is not apparent from the  determination  that  the  judge
    failed to  take  into  account  all  the  relevant  evidence  or  erred
    materially in his approach. At paragraphs 37 to 39, the judge took into
    account that the appellant in fact knew of the irregularities with  his
    test certificate even before the Secretary of State took issue with  it
    on 25th July 2014 because he was told  by  London  Southbank  that  his
    TOEIC would not be accepted and still did not take it up with the  ETS.
    It was open to the judge to find it weighed against the appellant  that
    he had done nothing about the allegation of cheating at the time,  even
    by writing to ETS or writing to Queensway College.   Additionally,  the
    judge  identified  that  there  had  been  a  Project  Fa�ade  criminal
    investigation into Queensway College.

77. There must be sound reasoning but in Lowe v SSHD  [2021]  EWCA  Civ  62
    McCombe LJ at paragraph 29 cited paragraphs 114 and 115 of Fage UK Ltd.
    v Chobani UK Ltd. [2014] EWCA Civ 5  as follows:

           'At [114] - [115],  Lewison  LJ  explained  the  caution  to  be
           exercised by appellate courts  in  interfering  with  evaluative
           decisions of first instance judges'

           Lewison LJ in particular reasoned

           'In making his decisions the trial judge will have regard to the
           whole of the sea  of  evidence  presented  to  him,  whereas  an
           appellate court will only be island hopping.'

78. Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set  aside)  [2013]  UKUT  00085  (IAC)
    confirms there  is a legal duty to give  a  brief  explanation  of  the
    conclusions on the central issue on which an appeal is determined,  but
    those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole  makes
    sense, having regard to the material accepted by the judge.  A  careful
    reading of the determination  under  challenge  demonstrates  that  the
    judge applied the correct  legal  approach,  took  full  cognizance  of
    material  matters  and  relevant  evidence  and  weighed  the  evidence
    properly.

79. On the basis of the findings in  relation  to  the  TOEIC  certificate,
    which were sound, it was open to the judge to make the findings he  did
    on Article 8.
