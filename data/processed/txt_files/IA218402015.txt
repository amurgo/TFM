                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State,  I  will  for
    convenience refer to the parties as they appeared before the First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 27 December 1989.
     He entered the United Kingdom on 16 February 2012 with leave as a Tier
    4 (Student) valid until 30 October 2015.  That leave  was  subsequently
    curtailed to expire on 5 April 2015.  On 21 January 2015, the appellant
    made an application for further leave based upon his private and family
    life in the UK.  That application was refused on 20 March 2015.

 3. On 1 April 2015, the appellant made a  further  application  for  leave
    based upon his private and family  life.   That  application  was  also
    refused on 27 May 2015.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  He relied upon  his
    private and family life and, in particular, his relationship  with  his
    wife, Bethan Albina Eferebo, a British citizen whom he had  married  on
    13 December 2014 and with their son, Kribi who was born on 22  December
    2015.

 5. Judge Loughridge concluded that the appellant could not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).  First, he found  that  para
    EX.1. of Appendix FM of the Rules did not  apply  because  it  was  not
    unreasonable for the appellant's son to leave the UK  and  relocate  to
    Nigeria with his parents.  Secondly, the judge found that there were no
    insurmountable obstacles to the appellant's family life with  his  wife
    continuing in Nigeria.  Thirdly, the judge found that  there  were  not
    "very  significant  obstacles"  to  the  appellant's  reintegration  in
    Nigeria so that para 276ADE(1)(vi) did not apply.

 6. However, Judge Loughridge went on to find that the appellant's  removal
    was a disproportionate interference with his family  life  and  allowed
    the appeal under Art 8 outside the Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State was granted permission to  appeal  against  that
    decision by the First-tier Tribunal (DJ Manuell) on 15 December 2016.

 8. Following a hearing on 10 March 2017, in  a  decision  dated  14  March
    2017, I allowed the Secretary of State's appeal on the basis  that  the
    judge had erred in law in allowing the appeal under Art 8  outside  the
    rules and I set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are  set  out  in  my
    decision dated 14 March 2017 and I do not repeat them here.

 9. The appeal was adjourned for a resumed hearing in order for  the  Upper
    Tribunal to remake the decision under Art 8 outside the Rules.

The Resumed Hearing

10. The resumed hearing was listed before me on 16 May 2017.  The appellant
    was represented by Ms Khatun and the Secretary of State by Mr Mills.

11. Ms Khatun indicated that she did not wish to call any  witnesses.   She
    relied upon her written submissions made to the First-tier Tribunal (at
    pages 1-11 of the appellant's bundle).  No new evidence was relied upon
    before me.

The Submissions

12. Ms Khatun submitted that  the  factual  position  in  relation  to  the
    appellant and sponsor was unchanged.  She relied upon the  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship between the appellant and his wife.  She relied
    upon the close family  relationship  with  his  spouse's  family.   She
    submitted that the appellant's removal would be harsh  and  the  family
    would be devastated.  It would not be reasonable to expect his  son  to
    leave the UK.  If the appellant and his family went  to  Nigeria,  then
    his wife's family would not be able to see their  grandchild  so  often
    because of the cost and difficulties of travel.   Ms  Khatun  submitted
    that it would be harsh to require the appellant's  family  to  relocate
    and adjust to  living  in  Nigeria.   She  submitted  that  there  were
    "compelling circumstances", namely the appellant had a young child, his
    subsisting relationship with his wife and her family and both his  wife
    and son were British citizens.

13. Ms Khatun submitted that the appellant  was  not  reliant  upon  public
    funds.  Both he and his wife were supported financially by  her  family
    and were living in accommodation with her parents.  She submitted  that
    the appellant was likely to be able to work if he remained  in  the  UK
    and not reliant on public funds.  He is a  person  of  good  character.
    She submitted that the family's future lies in the UK.

14.  As  regards  the  appellant  returning  to  Nigeria  to  obtain  entry
    clearance, she submitted that the family was unlikely to be able to  do
    so given  the  appellant's  young  child.   In  any  event,  Ms  Khatun
    submitted that any such application was unlikely to  be  successful  as
    the appellant's spouse would be unlikely to  meet  the  �18,600  income
    requirement in Appendix FM.  She would require  a  number  of  jobs  in
    order to do this and was currently not employed.   She  would  need  to
    produce at least six months' pay slips and there would be an inevitable
    delay perhaps of one and a half and two years if there  was  a  refusal
    and a subsequent appeal.

15. In those circumstances, Ms Khatun invited me to conclude that it  would
    be disproportionate to remove the appellant.

16.  Mr  Mills  relied  upon  the  judge's  findings  in  relation  to  the
    application of the Immigration Rules.  He submitted that the judge  had
    already found, and it had not been challenged by  the  appellant,  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in
    Nigeria and that it was not unreasonable for the child to go to Nigeria
    with the family.

17. Mr Mills submitted that, following the Supreme Court's  decision  in  R
    (Agyarko and another) v SSHD [2017]  UKSC  11,  the  appellant  had  to
    establish that there were "compelling  circumstances"  that  outweighed
    the public interest such that a grant of leave outside  the  rules  was
    appropriate.

18.  Mr  Mills  submitted  that,  applying  s.117B  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "NIA Act 2002"), the fact that the
    appellant spoke adequate English was at best a neutral  factor  and  he
    was not financially independent at the date of hearing even if, as  was
    suggested, he could become so in the future.  Mr  Mills  accepted  that
    following the Supreme Court's decision in R (MM) (Lebanon) and others v
    SSHD [2017] UKSC 10, in determining proportionality and a claim outside
    the Rules third party support was relevant.  It  could  be  taken  into
    account in an entry clearance application but to what extent, following
    MM, was yet to be determined in any revised guidance by  the  Secretary
    of State.

19. Mr Mills submitted that the appellant's family life had initially  been
    established when his  immigration  status  was  "precarious"  and  such
    family life was entitled to lesser  weight  and  only  in  "exceptional
    circumstances" would any interference be disproportionate.   He  relied
    upon the Upper Tribunal's decision in Rajendran (s.117B - family  life)
    [2016] UKUT 138 (IAC).  He submitted that  there  were  no  "compelling
    circumstances" to outweigh the public interest.

20. Further, he submitted that this was not a Chikwamba  ([2008]  UKHL  40)
    case.  He submitted that this was not a case, unlike  Chikwamba,  where
    the only reason that the appellant could not succeed in his  claim  for
    leave to  remain  was  a  procedural  one  and  otherwise  he  met  the
    requirements of the  Rules.   Further,  Mr  Mills  submitted  that  any
    separation of the appellant from his family was proportionate  and,  in
    any event, the judge had found that the whole family could go  back  to
    Nigeria to live.  In either circumstance, Mr Mills  submitted,  it  had
    not been established that they were unjustifiably harsh consequences.

21. Mr Mills invited me to dismiss the appellant's appeal under Art 8.

22. Ms Khatun made no submissions in reply.

Discussion

23. As I have already indicated, Ms Khatun did not seek to rely on any  new
    evidence before me.  She placed reliance upon  the  evidence  that  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

24. Judge Loughridge set out the principal facts in  his  determination  at
    paras 11-20.  Nothing  in  the  submissions  of  either  representative
    suggested that the facts set out by the judge were other than accepted.
     He set out the underlying facts as follows:

         "11.     The Appellant and his wife are in a  genuine  relationship
             and the Appellant does his fair share  of  looking  after  his
             son.  These matters are conceded by the Respondent.

         12.  The Appellant and  his  wife  first  met  in  April  2014,  at
             college.  After their marriage they spent a few weeks  in  the
             Appellant's student accommodation  in  Swansea  but  since  10
             January 2015 they have lived with the wife's parents, and  her
             siblings, at their home in Bridgend.

         13.  The Appellant chose to defer his studies for the academic year
             starting in September 2014, partly due to difficulties  paying
             the tuition fees and partly because by then  he  had  met  his
             wife and he saw his future somewhat differently.  This appears
             to be why his leave was curtailed to 5 April 2015.

         14.  The Appellant has  been  completely  accepted  by  his  wife's
             relatives as part of the family.  It is  a  close-knit  family
             including her parents, siblings, grandparents,  uncles,  aunts
             and cousins.

         15.  The Appellant has friends and social  connections  in  the  UK
             having now been here for over four years.

         16.  Unfortunately, the Appellant  has  not  been  able  to  secure
             employment.   He  has  enquired  about  jobs   with   numerous
             potential  employers.   They  have  told  him  that  jobs  are
             available  but  cannot  be  offered  to  him  because  of  his
             immigration status.  They have said he should go back  to  see
             them again once he has permission to work.  He is desperate to
             work because he wants  to  support  his  family.   His  wife's
             parents, and her grandparents,  have  helped  out  financially
             because he is unable to earn a living.

         17.  The Appellant's wife does not work.  She intends to work  when
             their son starts attending primary school.  However, she  does
             not have particularly high qualifications and in order to meet
             the financial requirement for a spouse visa, of  �18,600,  she
             would need to have more than one  job.   She  receives  income
             related state benefits, currently child tax credits.

         18.  The Appellant and his wife would like  to  live  independently
             from her family, in their own home.

         19.  The Appellant's wife has picked up a  few  words  of  Nigerian
             from the Appellant and his  friends.   However,  she  has  not
             enrolled on a formal language course.

         20.  The Appellant has family members back in Nigeria including his
             mother, eight younger siblings and various aunts/uncles.   His
             aunts/uncles live in the same general  area  of  Nigeria  from
             which he is from, but they are not immediately local."

25. The appellant's claim based upon his private and family life before the
    judge failed under the Rules.  The remainder of  the  judge's  findings
    and reasoning are set out at paras 29-39 as follows:

         "29.     In EA Nigeria only the third Appellant was born in the UK,
             and was Nigerian because she was  born  to  Nigerian  parents.
             The other child in the case was also Nigerian and  accordingly
             the family comprised four Nigerian citizens, three of whom had
             come to the UK on the basis of a student visa.  That is a very
             different factual scenario to the circumstances in this  case,
             in which two  of  the  family  members  are  British  citizens
             neither of whom have ever left the UK.

         30.  On the other hand, Mr Hibbs [the Presenting Officer]  makes  a
             good point in my view when he says that the cultural  heritage
             of the Appellant's son is just  as  much  Nigerian  as  it  is
             British.  It would not be difficult for  him  to  grow  up  in
             Nigeria.  It is self-evident  that  this  would  involve  less
             contact with his maternal relatives than if he grows up in the
             UK, but on the other hand he would probably have more  contact
             with his paternal relatives.

         31.  I conclude that it will not make any significant difference to
             the son whether he grows up in UK or  in  Nigeria.   His  best
             interests are to remain with his parents, and the location  of
             the family unit is largely immaterial.

         32.  Accordingly, it would not be unreasonable for the son to leave
             the  UK  and  relocate  in  Nigeria  with  his  parents,   and
             consequently EX.1(a) is not met.

         33.  I have little evidence about what life would be like  for  the
             Appellant and his wife in Nigeria.  During oral  evidence  the
             issues cited were matters such as the  weather  and  language,
             neither of which in my view are insurmountable.  As  Mr  Hibbs
             put it, there may be certain challenges  but  these  could  be
             overcome and would not constitute very serious  hardship.   It
             may well be that life in the UK is generally more  comfortable
             than in Nigeria.  However, that is not the test.

         34.  I must also take into account the fact  that  the  Appellant's
             wife is part of a close-knit and extensive family in  the  UK,
             as well as having friends here, and that relocating to Nigeria
             would  undoubtedly   be   a   difficult   process   for   her.
             Furthermore, she says in her witness statement that there  are
             ethnic and cultural differences and that she  cannot  move  to
             Nigeria as she was born and raised  in  the  UK  and  all  her
             connections and ties are here.

         35.  However, it seems to me that  the  wife  has  always  made  an
             assumption that the Appellant will be able to remain in the UK
             permanently,  and   has   never   seriously   considered   the
             possibility of relocating to Nigeria in order to be  together.
             She says in her  witness  statement  that  the  Appellant  has
             always been open and honest about his  immigration  background
             and that when they met and began a relationship she was  aware
             that  he  was  in  the  UK  legitimately.   Being  in  the  UK
             legitimately is not the same  thing  as  having  a  reasonable
             expectation of being able to  remain  here  permanently.   His
             immigration status has always been  precarious,  meaning  that
             his ability to remain has always been dependent upon a further
             grant of leave.  He came to  the  UK  as  a  student  and  his
             intention, presumably, certainly until he  met  his  wife  and
             they began a relationship, was  to  return  to  Nigeria  after
             completing his studies.  His wife has been somewhat na�ve,  in
             my view, in thinking  that  his  long  term  status  here  was
             secure.  There should have been some thought/discussion at the
             outset as to whether she was willing to  go  to  Nigeria  with
             him, if necessary,  and  that  possibility  should  have  been
             factored into the decision to proceed with their  relationship
             and to have a child.

         36.  Overall, I find that the Appellant's wife would cope with life
             in Nigeria if this is the only way in which she, the Appellant
             and their son can remain together.  The disruption to her life
             in the UK, even combined with the difficulties she may face in
             the short-term in  adjusting  to  life  in  Nigeria,  and  any
             ongoing lack of 'creature comforts' which she would  otherwise
             have in this country, cannot properly be  categorised,  in  my
             view, as very serious hardship.

         37.  Accordingly, there are no insurmountable obstacles  to  family
             life between the Appellant and his wife continuing outside the
             UK, and consequently EX.1(b) is not met.  I  acknowledge  that
             the Appellant and his wife have a very  strong  preference  to
             remain in the UK rather than  relocating  to  Nigeria,  but  a
             preference is not enough to fulfil  the  requirements  of  the
             Rules.

         38.  As for  the  Appellant's  private  life  under  the  route  of
             Paragraph 276ADE, I am not persuaded that there would be  very
             significant obstacles to integration in  Nigeria.   I  do  not
             have very much information about his private life  but  it  is
             reasonable to assume that he has made friends in the UK during
             the time he has been here, and he has also established  social
             contacts within his  wife's  family.   However,  he  lived  in
             Nigeria until he was 22 years old, he  is  familiar  with  the
             culture of the country, he knows the language  and  he  is  in
             good health and capable of finding work there.   Whilst  there
             might be certain challenges in returning to Nigeria,  they  do
             not amount to very significant obstacles.  I  should  make  it
             clear that the issue of his wife and son do  not  fall  to  be
             considered under this provision because  they  constitute  his
             family life and not his private life.

         39.  Accordingly, there are no 'very significant obstacles' to  the
             Appellant returning  to,  and  integrating  in,  Nigeria,  and
             consequently Paragraph 276ADE is not met."

26. The judge made essentially four factual findings at paras 28-39 of  his
    determination.  First, he concluded that it was in the  best  interests
    of the appellant's son (aged 9 months at the date of the hearing before
    the judge and now aged 1 year and 5 months) to remain with his  parents
    even if they were to relocate as a family unit to  Nigeria.   Secondly,
    it would not be unreasonable for him to relocate to  Nigeria  with  his
    parents.  Thirdly,  there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant and his spouse  continuing  their  family  life  in  Nigeria.
    Fourthly, it was not established  that  there  were  "very  significant
    obstacles" to the appellant returning to, and integrating in,  Nigeria.



27. The appellant did not  seek  to  challenge  those  findings  either  by
    seeking permission to appeal or in a rule 24 notice at  either  hearing
    before  me.   In  my  judgment,   therefore,   those   findings   stand
    unchallenged.  Nothing in the evidence before me leads me to doubt  the
    sustainability of those findings.  Although the appellant's son is  now
    8 months older than at the time of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,
    no new evidence was led as to the impact  upon  him  of  relocating  to
    Nigeria with his parents.  Although Ms Khatun submitted that  it  would
    be unreasonable for him to leave the UK, at no  time  has  the  judge's
    finding to the contrary been challenged and, although the judge did not
    approach the issue of "reasonableness" by taking account of the  public
    interest as required by R (MA) (Pakistan) and others v UTIAC  and  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 706, had he done so  that  could  not  materially  have
    advanced the appellant's claim that it was "not reasonable"  to  expect
    him to leave the UK.  Further, no new evidence was relied  upon  as  to
    the impact upon the appellant's spouse  and  her  family  if  she  were
    required to relocate to Nigeria with her husband.

28. Therefore, I accept and  apply  Judge  Loughridge's  findings  set  out
    above.

29. The appellant's claim is put forward under Art 8 outside the Rules.

30. As regards Art 8, I apply the 5-stage test in R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]
    UKHL 27 at [20].  I accept that Art 8.1 is engaged.  I accept that  the
    appellant has family life with his wife  and  son  and,  as  the  judge
    found, the "close-knit" family of his wife.  In any event,  the  latter
    would, in my view, amount to private life in the UK.  Ms Khatun did not
    place any reliance specifically on the appellant's private life in  the
    UK and, at para 38 of his determination, Judge Loughridge noted that he
    had  not  been  provided  with  "very  much  information   about   [the
    appellant's] private life".  Nevertheless, I  accept  that,  since  his
    arrival in the UK in February 2012, the appellant will have established
    a private life in addition to social contacts with his  wife's  family.
    I  accept  that  there  is  likely  to  be  an  interference  with  the
    appellant's private and family life if removed to Nigeria.

31. As regards Art 8.2, the Secretary of State's  decision  is  clearly  in
    accordance  with  the  law,  namely  the  Immigration  Rules  and   the
    appellant's removal  is  in  pursuance  of  a  legitimate  aim,  namely
    effective immigration control.

32. The crucial issue is that of proportionality.  That  issue  requires  a
    fair balance to be struck between the public interest  and  the  rights
    and interests of the appellant and others protected  by  Art  8.1  (see
    Razgar at [20]).  In MM, the Supreme Court reminded us at [43] that the
    "central issue" was:

         "Whether a fair  balance  has  been  struck  between  the  personal
         interests of all members of the family in maintaining their  family
         life ... and the public interest in controlling immigration".

33. In carrying out that balancing  exercise  and  reaching  a  finding  on
    proportionality, the Tribunal must "have regard" to the  considerations
    set out in s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.

34. The public interest, including that reflected  in  the  fact  that  the
    appellant cannot meet the requirements of the  Rules,  is  entitled  to
    "considerable weight" (see MM at [75];  and  also  Hesham  Ali  v  SSHD
    [2016] UKSC 6 at [46] et seq and R (Agyarko and another) v SSHD at [46]-
    [48]).  The search is for "sufficiently  compelling"  circumstances  to
    outweigh the public interest because the refusal of leave would  result
    in "unjustifiably harsh consequences" (see Agyarko at [48]).

35. In MM, the Supreme Court at [41] considered the position of  a  married
    couple and a claim to reside in the UK based upon Art 8 as follows:

         "There is no general  obligation  to  respect  a  married  couple's
         choice of country  in  which  to  reside  or  to  authorise  family
         reunification.  It will depend upon the particular circumstances of
         the persons concerned and the  general  interest.   Factors  to  be
         taken into account are  the  extent  to  which  family  life  would
         effectively be ruptured;  the  extent  of  the  ties  in  the  host
         country; whether there are 'insurmountable obstacles'  (or,  as  it
         has sometimes been put in other cases, 'major  impediments':   see,
         for example, Tuquabo-Tekle v The Netherlands [2006] 1 FLR 798, para
         48; IAA v United Kingdom (2016) 62 EHRR 233, paras 40  and  48)  in
         the way of the family living  in  the  alien's  home  country;  and
         whether there are factors of immigration control (such a history of
         breaches of immigration law) or publc order weighing in  favour  of
         exclusion (para 107).  If family life was created at  a  time  when
         the people involved knew that the immigration status of one of them
         was such that persistence of family life in the  host  state  would
         from the outset  be  precarious,  'it  is  likely  only  to  be  in
         exceptional circumstances that  the  removal  of  the  non-national
         family member will constitute a violation of article 8' (para  108;
         note that  this  was  expressed  as  a  prediction  rather  than  a
         requirement) ...."

36. The judge's findings, with which I agree, were that it was in the  best
    interests of the appellant's son to remain with his parents.  It  would
    not be unreasonable for him to relocate  with  them  to  Nigeria.   The
    judge found that the appellant's wife could cope  with  re-locating  to
    Nigeria even though she is a British citizen  who  has  never  been  to
    Nigeria.  Although there might be difficulties faced in the  short-term
    by the appellant and his wife of adjusting to  life  in  Nigeria,  they
    would not  suffer  any  "very  serious  hardship"  and  there  were  no
    "insurmountable obstacles" to them relocating to Nigeria.

37. There would, I accept, be a dislocation between  the  appellant's  wife
    and her family in the UK which is close-knit.  Whilst it was  submitted
    that there would be difficulties, both practical and financial, in  her
    family travelling to Nigeria to  see  both  the  appellant's  wife  and
    grandchild, Ms Khatun did not draw my  attention  to  any  evidence  to
    suggest that such visits would be out of the question or that financial
    support would not be available from the family of the appellant's  wife
    in the UK in order to allow travel back to the UK for visits.  And,  of
    course,  between  visits  modern  internet   communication   via   such
    applications as Skype would permit continuing contact in a way that  is
    now commonplace between families split between  countries  or,  indeed,
    geographically within a country.

38. As regards to the public interest, the  public  interest  in  effective
    immigration control, as set out in s.117B(1) of the NIA  Act  2002,  is
    engaged.  Whilst I accept that the appellant is able to speak  English,
    s.117B(2) of the NIA Act 2002 does not mean that the public interest is
    in some way lessened: it is, at best, a neutral factor (see Rhuppiah  v
    SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803 at [59]-[61]).

39. Further, the public interest in s.117B(3) is engaged as  the  appellant
    is not "financially independent" as he is dependent  upon  third  party
    support from his wife's family (see Rhuppiah  at  [63]).   Consistently
    with what was said in MM at [41] and s.117B(4) and (5), the appellant's
    "family" and "private" life must be given "little weight"  in  that  it
    was established at a time when the appellant (and his wife)  were  well
    aware that his immigration status  was  precarious,  in  the  sense  of
    temporary and that there could be no expectation of remaining in the UK
    in order to continue that family and private life.

40.  Finally,  s.117B(6)  does  not  apply  as,  consistently  with   Judge
    Loughridge's finding  which  has  not  been  challenged,  although  the
    appellant has a "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" with his
    son who is a "qualifying child", it has not been  established  that  it
    would "not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom".

41. Ms Khatun submitted that the "compelling circumstances" to outweigh the
    public interest were the subsisting relationship between the  appellant
    and his wife and her extended family, the position of his son and  that
    both his wife and son were British citizens.  I bear in mind  that  the
    private and family life of the appellant was formed at a time when  his
    status was, at best, precarious in the UK and that this  was  known  to
    both him and his wife: that is  relevant  in  the  assessment  and  the
    weight to be attached to any family life formed in  such  circumstances
    (see Jeunesse v the Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR  17  and  R(Agyarko  and
    another) at [49]-[50]).  I also bear in mind that both the sponsor  and
    their son are British citizens.

42. In my judgment, the appellant  has  failed  to  establish  "compelling"
    circumstances sufficient to outweigh the public interest  that  I  have
    identified.   Whilst  there  will  be  "difficulties"  in  the   family
    relocating to Nigeria, it is in the child's "best interests" to  remain
    with his parents and no specific evidence of detriment to him has  been
    identified before me: the circumstances do not, in my view,  give  rise
    to "unjustifiably harsh consequences".

43. For these reasons, the refusal  of  leave  to  the  appellant  and  his
    removal to Nigeria would not breach Art 8.

44. As regards the Chikwamba point, I accept Mr Mills' submission that this
    case is to be distinguished from that in Chikwamba.  The essence of the
    Chikwamba point was identified by Lord Reed in Agyarko at [41]:

         "If ... an applicant - even if residing in the UK unlawfully -  was
         otherwise certain to be granted leave to  enter,  at  least  if  an
         application was made from outside the UK, then there  might  be  no
         public interest in his or her removal.  The point is illustrated by
         the decision in  Chikwamba  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department."

45. Here, it is simply not established that the appellant would succeed  in
    his entry clearance application and that, in effect, he is  subject  to
    removal simply in  order  to  satisfy  the  procedural  requirement  of
    seeking entry from outside the UK.   Indeed,  Ms  Khatun's  submissions
    accepted  that  an  application  for   entry   clearance   would   have
    difficulties.  There was no current evidence  that  would  support  the
    appellant meeting the �18,600 income based upon  his  wife's  earnings.
    She is unemployed.  Whilst I accept following MM, the Supreme Court has
    indicated that in applying Art 8 consideration must be given to  third-
    party support, Ms Khatun did not specifically  address  the  amount  of
    third-party support available and whether it  would  satisfy,  or  come
    close to satisfying, the equivalent of an income of  �18,600.   Whether
    the appellant would, therefore, meet the entry  clearance  requirements
    as a spouse - even with a diluted financial requirement following MM  -
    is speculative.  I do  not  accept  Ms  Khatun's  submission  that  the
    appellant's claim under Art 8 is strengthened by the fact  that  he  is
    unlikely to be able to meet the requirements of  the  Rules  for  entry
    clearance or on a broader MM basis.   As  Mr  Mills  submitted,  and  I
    accept, the strength of an Art 8 claim, as is clear from Chikwamba  and
    in Agyarko at [51], is premised upon hypothetical success  rather  than
    failure under the Rules and, therefore, a possible inference  that  the
    public interest does not require interference with private  and  family
    life simply to 'go through the motions' of leaving the UK  and  seeking
    entry clearance.

46. Further, as Mr Mills submitted, the judge's  findings,  which  are  not
    challenged, are that the appellant and  his  family  can  appropriately
    relocate to Nigeria.  In the light of that finding, it is difficult  to
    see why it would be unreasonable or disproportionate  for  them  to  go
    with the appellant to Nigeria in order to seek entry clearance even if,
    as Ms Khatun submitted, there might be a substantial delay in resolving
    the appellant's application for entry  clearance.   Mr  Mills  did  not
    accept that the delay would be one and a half to two years  but,  given
    the need to amend the guidance to reflect the third-party support point
    in MM, he was unable to provide an estimate as to  how  long  it  would
    take to resolve such an application.

47. As I have already indicated, this is not, in my judgment,  a  Chikwamba
    case.   In  any  event,  I  am  not  satisfied   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate to require the appellant to return to Nigeria to  seek
    entry clearance whether or not  he  were  accompanied  by  his  family.
    Whether they choose to accompany him would be a matter  of  choice  for
    them.  It would not be unreasonable for them to do so  and,  given  the
    public interest, if they choose  to  remain  in  the  UK  a  period  of
    separation in order to determine  his  application  would  not,  in  my
    judgment, be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  his  family  and
    private life in the UK.

48. For all these reasons, the appellant has failed to establish  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision breaches Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

49. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under Art 8 involved the making of an error of law.  That decision  was
    set aside by my decision dated 14 March 2017.

50. I remake the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal under Art 8  of
    the ECHR.
