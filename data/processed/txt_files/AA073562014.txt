                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by leave  from  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hodgkinson which was given on 11 December  2014.   The  appellant
    is a citizen of Afghanistan.  He has a date of  birth  which  has  been
    estimated to be 1 January 1994.  He  arrived  in  this  country  having
    obviously had to go through other countries to get here in  July  2009.
    He was thus then regarded as 15 years old.

2.   He applied for asylum  on arrival. He in fact came in  the  back  of  a
    lorry but his application was refused in November 2009.  However  since
    he was a minor the practice was to give such as him a limited leave  to
    remain until they reached the age of  17ï¿½.  Accordingly  he  was  given
    leave to remain until 1 July 2011.  He  did  not  seek  to  appeal  the
    decision refusing his asylum claim.  He has  said  since  that  he  was
    advised by those then representing  him  that  he  should  not  appeal.
    Quite why that advice was given if he was contending that  his  account
    should have been believed is  difficult  to  understand.   Nevertheless
    there is no reason to disbelieve that part of his evidence.

3.   However in June 2011, shortly before his leave expired he  applied  for
    further  leave  to  remain  effectively  renewing  his  asylum   claim.
    Regrettably, and I am afraid all too regularly, it  took  a  very  long
    time for the Secretary of State to decide that claim.  In fact  it  was
    not decided until September 2014.

4.   Essentially in a very lengthy decision letter the  appellant's  account
    of the reason why he feared return to Afghanistan  was  disbelieved  by
    the Secretary of State.  What he asserted was that he  and  his  father
    had been involved in what I suppose can be described as a  battle  with
    neighbours in relation to the ownership of land and in the course of an
    altercation one of then neighbours was killed.  It was not  clear  from
    the various accounts given by the appellant, and indeed this was one of
    the matters which led to the  First-tier Tribunal Judge  not  believing
    him, as to precisely what  part he played in that death.  At one  stage
    it was said that he and his father were both responsible but, no  doubt
    in order to explain why certainly  until  at  least  2011  nothing  had
    happened to the father and there had been no suggestion of any  attempt
    by the neighbours to revenge themselves upon the  father,  he  asserted
    that actually he was the only one who was as it were a target.  But the
    result was he asserted a blood feud and that would mean that were he to
    be returned his life would be in danger.

5.   In due course a Jirga was produced, that is to say a  decision  of  the
    elders of the village,  which  apparently  had  been  obtained  by  his
    father.  Unfortunately for him the Jirga was entirely inconsistent with
    the account that he had given and  that  again  was  a  matter  heavily
    relied on by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

6.   Overall his account was disbelieved and the judge concluded that  there
    never had been an incident such as he described and there was no  blood
    feud.   That  conclusion  was  reached  following   a   very   detailed
    consideration of the evidence and as Mr Hoshi accepted,  a  proper  and
    full reasoning by the  judge and the appeal did not and does  not  seek
    to challenge that conclusion.  It is important,  however,  for  reasons
    that will become clear to note as a  result  that  his  presence  here,
    certainly after the initial two years granted because he was  a  minor,
    was based upon what clearly would amount to a deception, the  deception
    being that he had a valid claim for asylum when in reality there was no
    such claim.

7.   The appeal is brought because of the approach made by the judge to  his
    Article 8 claim.  This was based on his private life. It was said  that
    he had been here in this country since 2009, by the time the judge  was
    considering the matter for some five years or so, and he had built  up,
    as is perhaps obvious, a life here.  He had made friends, made contacts
    and had lost touch with Afghanistan.  In particular the evidence so far
    as contact with his family was concerned was that he had  last  spoken,
    he said, to  his father in June 2011, and it was his claim that he  had
    had no contact with his father since that time.

8.   One of the conclusions reached by the  judge  related  to  whether  his
    father, indeed presumably the rest of his family, were still living  in
    the village in question or even  were still  alive.   What  so  far  as
    material to this aspect was said by the judge is summarised  really  in
    his conclusion in paragraph 49 where he says this:

         "Having taken into account the totality of the available  evidence,
         and with particular reference to  the  evidence  to  which  I  have
         referred above, even taking into account the appellant's  youth  at
         relevant times, and the lower standard  of  proof,  I  nevertheless
         conclude that the appellant is an  individual  whose  core  account
         lacks all credibility  and  is,  in  fact,  a  fabricated  account.
         Consequently, I conclude that the appellant's account of  the  land
         dispute between him and the neighbouring family  is  fabricated.  I
         find as a fact that neither the appellant  nor  his  father  killed
         anybody at all in Afghanistan in  any  circumstances.   I  conclude
         that the appellant did not flee from his home address  contrary  to
         his claim otherwise, and I  find  as  a  fact  that  his  immediate
         family, comprising his parents and a number of  siblings,  continue
         to live at their home address in their  home  village.  I  conclude
         that the applicant's account,  of  having  lost  contact  with  his
         family is untrue and find as a fact that he continues  to  maintain
         some contact with his father in Afghanistan, despite his contention
         otherwise."

9.   Mr Hoshi submits that that is essentially  unreasoned  and  furthermore
    it was not directly put to the appellant in the course of  the  hearing
    that he did maintain contact with his father or  that  his  family  was
    still where they were.  There was evidence in the  form  of  an  expert
    report and part of that was to follow up the Jirga and this expert  had
    someone in  Afghanistan  who  reported  to  him  when  sent  to  obtain
    information. He went to the village and obtained information  from  the
    elders.   He  was  not  asked  to  obtain  any  information  about  the
    appellant's family there.  But if the father had died, certainly if  he
    had been killed in consequence  of  any  blood  feud,  one  would  have
    expected that to have been  common knowledge.  The reality is that once
    the appellant was comprehensively disbelieved there was in my  view  no
    reason at all why the judge should not have found as he did in relation
    to whether family ties were still maintainable in Afghanistan.

10.  Mr Hoshi sought leave to amend his grounds  to  cover  that  particular
    point because it was not  raised  in  his  original  grounds.   I  have
    considered the matter but it seems to me that whether  or  not  he  has
    leave to raise the point, the point is not one which is maintainable.

11.  I turn then to what the judge said in relation to Article 8.  It is  of
    course common ground that the appellant cannot satisfy the requirements
    of the Rule which seeks to dictate how Article 8 is to be applied.   So
    one has to go outside the Rules in order to consider whether there is a
    valid Article 8 claim.  Certainly since both  the  lower  Tribunal  and
    this Tribunal is a public body within the meaning of Section 6  of  the
    Human Rights Act it is necessary to consider whether there is a  breach
    of an individual's human rights  and  thus  it  is  necessary  for  the
    Tribunal to consider whether return, assuming a private life  has  been
    established, is proportionate.

12.  The way the judge put it in the last sentence of  paragraph  55  founds
    the error of law which is  relied  on  to  enable  this  appeal  to  be
    brought.  Having considered the Tribunal's decision in  Gulshan  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC) and the decision of the Court of Appeal in LC  (China)
    v Secretary of State [2014] EWCA Civ 1310 he concluded in this way:

         "In  the  present  instance  bearing   in   mind   the   particular
         circumstances applicable to the appellant as I find them to  be,  I
         am satisfied that there are no properly arguable grounds for giving
         consideration to the issue of the grant of leave to remain  to  the
         appellant under Article 8."

13.  However he then goes on in 56, 57, 58 and 59 to consider matters  which
    go to  whether  it  would  be  proportionate,  assuming  there  was  an
    interference with private life.

14.  The judge granting leave to appeal did so on the basis  that  reference
    to the Razgar test, which is what the judge did without actually naming
    Razgar specifically, was inconsistent with his  earlier  decision  that
    there was no arguable Article 8 claim outside the Rules.  It  seems  to
    me that the reality is that albeit  he  put  it  on  the  basis  of  no
    properly arguable  grounds,  what  he  was  doing  essentially  was  to
    identify his conclusion in paragraph 55 and then  go  on  to  give  the
    reasons why in his view it was not proportionate to grant them leave to
    remain.

15.  If one goes to the statutory  provisions,  I  now  have  to  take  into
    account Section 117B of the 2002 Act as inserted by the  2014  Act  and
    that provides by subsection (5) that little weight should be given to a
    private life established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
    immigration status is precarious.  Subsection (4) provides that  little
    weight should be given to a private life established by a  person  when
    in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  That one can well understand.

16.  There is an interesting argument I am told by Mr Hoshi which  has  been
    raised in a number of Tribunal decisions as to what  is  meant  by  the
    word "precarious".  Does it extend to cover any limited leave to remain
    or is more than that required? In my view it is quite unnecessary to go
    into the details of that argument and I do not propose to do so. What I
    do say is that it seems to me quite clear that where  someone  is  here
    where that leave is granted as a result of making  a  false  claim  for
    asylum he can properly be regarded as here  precarious.

17.  Mr Hoshi submits that that was not the basis upon  which  the  original
    two years was granted because  the  Rule  was  then  to  grant  limited
    discretionary leave until a minor reached the age  of  17ï¿½.   Therefore
    that leave did not depend upon whether or not  the claim  was  a  valid
    claim.

18.  However, continuing that leave and making a further  application  which
    enabled that leave to be continued under section 3C of the 1971 Act  is
    in a different category.  Once it was established, as it was that  that
    extended leave was obtained in circumstances that were akin at least to
    deception in as much as it was based upon a false claim for asylum,  it
    seems to me quite clear that little weight should be  attached  to  it.
    Whether because it is regarded as precarious or because as a matter  of
    general approach to Article 8 and  proportionality,  having  regard  to
    subsection (1) of 117B which provides  that  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest it seems to me  that  it
    is entirely proper to attach little  weight  to  the  major  period  of
    presence in this country.

19.  Whether or not there can properly be said to be an error of law in  the
    decision of the judge it seems to me that it is  perfectly  clear  that
    his conclusion is one not only to which he was entitled to come but  is
    one which is a proper conclusion on all the evidence before him.  I  am
    entitled in this Tribunal, rather than send the matter back to take the
    view as I do that the conclusion reached was  one  which  was  entirely
    proper and indeed correct and that  no  purpose  is  to  be  served  in
    seeking to have a further decision below.

20.  I am bound to say that that is a conclusion  that  I  personally  would
    have reached had I been  required  to  consider  leave  to  appeal.   I
    certainly would not have granted it because it seems  to  me  that  the
    ultimate conclusion was one which was an entirely proper conclusion  on
    the evidence taken into account by the judge and on the  basis  of  the
    correct approach to proportionality under Article 8.

21.  Accordingly this appeal must be dismissed.
