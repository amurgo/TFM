For the Appellants:    Mr J Martin, Counsel, instructed by Raj Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
         material error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Haria (FtJ) promulgated  on  2  October  2015.  The  FtJ's
         decision, which allowed the appeals,  was  appealed  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal by the respondent. A Deputy Judge of  the  Upper  Tribunal
         found that the FtJ materially erred in law and, having proceeded to
         remake the appeals, dismissed them.  The  appellants  were  granted
         permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. By way  of  a  Consent
         Order it was agreed that the Deputy Judge materially erred  in  law
         and the matter was remitted to the Upper Tribunal to determine once
         again whether the FtJ's decision contained a material legal  error.
         Following an 'error of law' hearing on 19 September  2017  I  found
         that the FtJ did materially err in law. The matter was adjourned to
         allow further evidence to be provided given the significant  length
         of time since the FtJ's decision.

Background

      2. The underlying decisions giving rise to these appeals are those  to
         remove the appellants, all  national  of  Mauritius,  from  the  UK
         pursuant to s.10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999,  their
         human rights claims under  article  8  ECHR  having  been  refused.
         Although these decisions are dated 12 January 2014 they  appear  to
         have been served on 08 January 2015.

      3. The following is a summary of the appellants'  immigration  history
         and their human rights claims. The 2nd appellant  (DOB  [  ]  1972)
         entered the Republic of Ireland on 17 October 2004  as  a  student.
         Between this date and 2 November 2004 he travelled to the UK  where
         he applied for leave to remain as a student. On 27 January 2005 his
         application was refused. Although he had a full right of appeal  he
         did not exercise that right. On 11 May 2005 the 1st appellant  (DOB
         [ ] 1981), who is the wife of  the  2nd  appellant,  departed  from
         Mauritius and entered the Republic of Ireland  with  her  daughter,
         EM, the 3rd appellant (DOB [ ] 2001). They made their way into  the
         UK on an unknown date. On 30 July 2009 the first  three  appellants
         were encountered by immigration officers at their home address.  On
         11 August 2009 the 2nd appellant was convicted of possessing  false
         identity documents and sentenced  to  4  months  imprisonment.  The
         appellants applied for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on
         article 8 grounds but the applications were refused without a right
         of appeal on 17  August  2010.  The  4th  appellant,  the  youngest
         daughter of the 1st and 2nd  appellant,  was  born  on  [  ]  2010.
         Following judicial review proceedings the  respondent  reconsidered
         the human rights claims but maintained her decisions.

      4. The 1st appellant,  with  her  husband  and  2  minor  children  as
         dependents, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The FtJ's analysis
         centred on the position of EM. The FtJ found that she was 3ï¿½  years
         old when she entered United Kingdom, that  English  was  her  first
         language and that she was thoroughly integrated into life in the UK
         through her school and the wider community, a  point  supported  by
         reference to letters from members of their extended family, friends
         and colleagues as well as school reports. At that time she  was  in
         Year 9 and was preparing to choose her GCSE subjects. The FtJ found
         that if EM and her sister were to return to Mauritius it would "...
         be like going to a foreign country  for  both  of  them"  as  their
         knowledge of the creole language  was  basic  and  there  would  be
         difficulties in slotting back into the community  and  in  entering
         school. The FtJ found that EM was  at  a  critical  period  in  her
         development  and  could  ill  afford  such  a  setback.   The   FtJ
         specifically considered evidence contained in the Country of Origin
         Information Service (see COIS report dated 24 June 2014) indicating
         that the Mauritian primary and secondary education system was based
         on the British  model  and  that  primary  education  was  free  in
         principle at state institutions. The FtJ  additionally  noted  that
         the parents of the 1st and 2nd appellant  lived  in  Mauritius  and
         that the appellants kept in regular  contact  with  them.  The  FtJ
         found that the appellants  could  live  with  the  2nd  appellant's
         parents, at least initially, if returned to Mauritius.

      5. The  FtJ  provided  extensive  extracts  from  a  number  of  cases
         considering the proper approach when assessing the  best  interests
         of children (such as EA (Article  8  -  best  interests  of  child)
         Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00315  (IAC);  MK  (best  interests  of  child)
         [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC), EV (Philippines) and Others v SSHD  [2014]
         EWCA Civ 874, and  Azimi-Moayed  and  Others  (decisions  affecting
         children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC).  At  [53],  having
         indicated that he had assessed the evidence as a whole and  applied
         the principles established by those cases, the FtJ  concluded  that
         it would not be reasonable for EM to go back to Mauritius, that  it
         was in her best interest to remain in the UK, and accordingly, that
         she met the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).

      6. The FtJ proceeded to consider the  remaining  appeals  pursuant  to
         article  8.  She  found  that  the  1st  and  2nd  appellants   had
         established private lives in the UK and that  their  removal  would
         constitute an interference with those private lives  of  sufficient
         gravity to engage article 8. In assessing  the  proportionality  of
         such removal, the FtJ referred herself to sections 117A and 117B of
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act). At
         [61] she considered the "somewhat chequered" immigration history of
         the 1st and 2nd appellants. The FtJ noted that they had been in the
         UK illegally for the duration of their residence,  that  they  were
         both arrested for using fraudulently obtained  documents  and  that
         the 2nd appellant was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment in  August
         2009.  Both  the  1st  and  2nd  appellants  admitted  using  false
         documents to access employment and health care under the  NHS.  The
         2nd appellant undertook 3 years  of  study,  completed  a  plumbing
         course and worked as a plumber. Both  the  1st  and  2nd  appellant
         worked in the UK despite having no permission.  The  1st  appellant
         gave birth on the NHS at "huge cost" and the 3rd and 4th appellants
         had the benefit of state funded education. The FtJ found that there
         was huge damage to the UK economy as a result of the  1st  and  2nd
         appellants' illegal employment. At  [65]  the  FtJ  reiterated  her
         finding that EM was at a critical stage in her education and shared
         family life with her parents and sister.  For  these  reasons,  and
         having regard to the age  of  the  children  and  their  length  of
         residence in the UK and their best interests, balanced against  the
         public interest factors so identified, the FtJ concluded  that  the
         removal  of   the   remaining   appellants   would   constitute   a
         disproportionate interference with their article 8 rights.

      7. The respondent sought permission to appeal  this  decision  to  the
         Upper Tribunal. The respondent contended that  the  FtJ  failed  to
         adequately identify why EM's education was sufficient to render her
         removal unreasonable, and that the  FtJ  failed  to  give  adequate
         weight to the public interest factors highlighted in section 117B.

      8. The matter came before Deputy Judge of the Upper  Tribunal  I  A  M
         Murry on 7 March 2016. The Deputy Judge uncovered a material  error
         of  law  in  the  First-tier  decision  and  re-made  the  decision
         dismissing the appeals. It is not necessary for me to  consider  in
         any detail  the  Deputy  Judge's  decision.  This  is  because  the
         appellants were granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal
         by the Rt. Hon. Sir Stephen Richards in a  decision  sealed  on  31
         January 2017. In a consent order sealed on  14  July  2017  it  was
         ordered that the appeal against  the  Deputy  Judge's  decision  be
         allowed and that the appeal be remitted to  a  freshly  constituted
         Upper  Tribunal  for  reconsideration.  A  statement   of   reasons
         accompanying the consent order indicated that the Deputy Judge  may
         have erred in his reasoning in relation to the  3rd  appellant  and
         that the appeal should be allowed to the  extent  that  the  matter
         should be remitted to the Upper Tribunal for a de novo hearing.

      9. It was  agreed  by  both  representatives  at  the  remitted  Upper
         Tribunal hearing on 19 September 2017  that  I  was  still  at  the
         "error of law" stage. Since the decisions of  both  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge and the Deputy Upper Tribunal the  law  relating  to
         the meaning of "reasonable" in  both  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  and
         s.117B(6)  has  been  clarified  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA
         (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705. Despite Mr Martin's submissions  to
         the contrary I was satisfied that the FtJ failed  to  consider  the
         public interest factors when assessing the issue of reasonableness.

     10. In  MA  (Pakistan)  Lord  Justice  Elias  held,  albeit  with  some
         reluctance, that an assessment of the  term  "reasonable"  in  both
         paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and s.117B(6) has to take into account  all
         relevant public interest considerations (see in particular [43]  to
         [45]). In other words, in assessing whether  it  is  reasonable  to
         expect EM to return to Mauritius  one  must  take  account  of  all
         relevant public interest  matters  including  those  identified  in
         s.117B and the conduct of  her  parents.  Although  the  First-tier
         Judge did give  careful  consideration  to  most  of  these  public
         interest factors at [61] this assessment  occurred  after  she  had
         already concluded that it was not reasonable for EM  to  return  to
         Mauritius (see [53]). This strongly suggests that her assessment of
         what was reasonable in relation to EM failed to take  into  account
         the relevant public interest considerations.

     11. Having satisfied myself that the determination contained a material
         error of law I adjourned the appeal to  enable  further  up-to-date
         evidence to be provided given the very significant length  of  time
         since the First-tier Tribunal's decision.



Resumed hearing

     12. The original First-tier  Tribunal  bundle  contained,  inter  alia,
         witness statements from the  1st  and  2nd  appellants,  a  witness
         statement from the EM, and various school reports and  certificates
         of achievement relating to EM and her sister.  The  school  reports
         and documents indicate that EM is a polite and conscientious  pupil
         who is popular and considerate of others' feelings and  who  enjoys
         school immensely.  The  bundle  additionally  contained  manuscript
         letters and statements from EM's friends attesting to the  strength
         of their relationships,  and  from  the  1st  and  2nd  appellants'
         extended family members and friends describing the strength of  the
         family and their social bonds. Also contained  in  the  bundle  are
         various photographs  showing  the  family  at  various  places  and
         functions at various times.  The  statements  from  the  appellants
         indicated that EM had established  strong  bonds  with  friends  at
         school and in the local community, and that she dreams of  becoming
         a designer and hopes to eventually attend  university.  She  has  a
         thriving social life doing the activities that teenagers enjoy such
         as going out frequently to shop and eat and going to  each  other's
         houses for sleepovers. EM has  known  some  of  her  friends  since
         nursery. EM and her friends always look out for each other and  she
         feels she can rely on them, as can they on her, when they are happy
         and sad alike. She considers that she has a special bond  with  her
         friends. While EM and her sister understand some  Creole  they  are
         unable to put one sentence  together  and  always  switch  back  to
         English. EM believes  she  would  struggle  to  cope  in  a  school
         environment in Mauritius given her  very  limited  Creole.  In  her
         statement EM states that  she  has  embraced  British  values,  the
         language and the lifestyle. EM worries that she will be  unable  to
         continue her studies as planned and is distraught at the thought of
         being unable to complete her education in  the  UK  and  having  to
         start from scratch in Mauritius.

     13. At the hearing I was provided with an additional statement from the
         1st appellant signed and dated on 15 November 2017, and  additional
         school documents relating to EM and her sister confirming  that  EM
         is in Year 11 and outlining her predicted  grades,  a  letter  from
         Sutton Court Care  Centre  confirming  that  EM  was  allocated  to
         undertake work experience at a care home  for  elderly  people  and
         that the residents found her  delightful  to  have  around,  and  a
         further manuscript letter from EM in which she indicates  that  she
         really wants to be able to do the things that teenagers of her  age
         are doing (all her friends had already applied  for  jobs  and  had
         started working part-time). She states that  whatever  happens  she
         wants to stay in England because her life has evolved here and  she
         doesn't feel she will be able to  adapt  if  moved  elsewhere.  The
         Presenting Officer provided confirmation  of  the  2nd  appellant's
         convictions which included driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess
         alcohol in 2005 (12 months disqualification), the offence  relating
         to the use of identity documents for which  he  was  imprisoned  in
         2009, and a further driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol  in
         February 2014 for which he was fined and disqualified from  driving
         for 3 years).

     14. The 1st appellant adopted her statements. In cross examination  she
         said her parents and parents-in-law remained in Mauritius and  that
         they maintained telephone contact. When her children spoke  on  the
         phone the 1st appellant had to translate. Her  parents-in-law  were
         retired and lived in a small house. The  1st  appellant  had  never
         worked in Mauritius. She had some  school  qualifications  obtained
         when she was 15 years old. She confirmed her previous employment in
         the UK. In response to questions from me appellant  explained  that
         EM had an important mock GCSE examination the following day.  After
         her GCSEs she wanted to go to 6th form college. The  1st  appellant
         confirmed that lessons in Mauritius were not taught in English  and
         that EM and her sister spoke only broken French and Creole and were
         unable to construct sentences. EM went out weekly with her  friends
         to places like McDonald's and the cinema. She like to interact with
         people and was  an  ambitious  girl.  The  family  went  to  a  few
         Mauritian cultural programs. EM would have  difficulty  making  new
         friendships in Mauritius because she only speak  in  broken  French
         and Creole and because the culture in Mauritius is different. In re-
         examination the 1st appellant confirmed that EM had never  attended
         school in Mauritius  and  that  none  of  EM's  friends  were  from
         Mauritius. She claimed that society is more open in the UK.

     15. The 2nd appellant confirmed his brief statement and underwent cross
         examination. He claimed he had sold everything to come  to  the  UK
         for a better life. He had previously worked in a sugarcane  factory
         which was not a good job and the family were struggling in 2004. He
         confirmed that he had worked for about 3 or 4 years in the UK doing
         mainly building jobs.  He  confirmed  the  telephone  contact  with
         family in Mauritius and that  his  daughters  could  only  speak  a
         little Creole and French and that he often had  to  translate.  The
         only schools in Mauritius  that  taught  lessons  in  English  were
         private schools.

     16. I heard submissions from both representatives who agreed  that  the
         principal issue for the determination was whether it was reasonable
         to expect EM to return to Mauritius.  Ms  Fijiwala  contended  that
         there were strong public interest factors at play such as  the  2nd
         appellants criminality and the fact that the 1st and 2nd  appellant
         worked and remained unlawfully in the UK, that they always intended
         to remain in this country and had not voluntarily departed.  I  was
         reminded that they had accessed NHS treatment and that there  would
         be a burden on the public purse  by  reason  of  the  3rd  and  4th
         appellants' education. It was submitted that the children would  be
         able to learn to speak French and Creole and that  EM  was  already
         studying French at GCSE. The family would  be  supported  by  other
         family members in Mauritius. Although it was accepted that  EM  had
         resided in the UK for 12 ï¿½ years and had developed a private  life,
         and that there would be a significant impact on her private life if
         removed, on the particular facts of this  case  the  strong  public
         interest was sufficient to render her removal reasonable. Mr Martin
         adopted his skeleton  argument  and  submitted  that  EM  had  only
         fleeting memories of Mauritius and that none of her close groups of
         friends was from Mauritius. She had her  final  exams  in  May/June
         2018 and had already  started  earning  points  towards  her  final
         grades. It was submitted that  the  respondent  failed  to  provide
         strong and powerful reasons why a 16-year-old girl who had lived in
         the UK for most  of  her  life  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
         relocate.

Findings and assessment

     17. I will first consider the appeal of the  3rd  appellant.  Paragraph
         276ADE(iv) of the immigration rules seeks to incorporate  and  give
         effect to article 8 private life  considerations  with  respect  to
         children in the UK.

     18. Paragraph 276ADE reads, in material part

             276ADE (1). The requirements to be met  by  an  applicant  for
             leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the  UK  are
             that at the date of application, the applicant:

             (i) does not fall for refusal under  any  of  the  grounds  in
             Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM;
             and

             ...

              (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived  continuously
             in the UK for at least seven years (discounting any period  of
             imprisonment) and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
             applicant to leave the UK

     19. There is no suggestion that EM falls foul of any of the Suitability
         requirements in  Appendix  FM.  The  appellants  have  consistently
         maintained that the 1st and EM entered the UK  in  May  2005.  This
         assertion does not appear to have been challenged by the respondent
         in the First-tier Tribunal, and the FtJ's finding  in  this  regard
         was not subject to the respondent's appeal. The Presenting  Officer
         at the resumed Upper Tribunal hearing did  not  seek  to  challenge
         this assertion and accepted that EM had lived in  the  UK  for  12ï¿½
         years. In the absence of any reason to doubt the accuracy  of  this
         aspect of the appellants' evidence, I find that  the  1st  and  3rd
         appellant have resided in the UK since May  2005.  EM,  who  is  16
         years old, has continuously resided in the UK for 12  years  and  6
         months. The human rights claim was made by letter dated 1  December
         2014 which led to the refusal of that claim  and  the  decision  to
         remove dated 8 January 2015. I find, and it was not disputed,  that
         EM had lived continuously in the UK for at least  7  years  at  the
         date of her application.

     20. I must ascertain EM's  best  interests  pursuant  to  s.55  of  the
         Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009.  I  remind  myself
         that, while her best interests are a  primary  consideration,  they
         are not a paramount consideration and that even though it may be in
         her best interests to remain in the UK this can  be  outweighed  by
         opposing public interest factors.

     21. In EV (Philippines) &  Ors  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2014] EWCA Civ  874  (at  [35])  the  Court  of  Appeal
         explained that a decision as to what is in the  best  interests  of
         children will depend on a number of factors such as (a) their  age;
         (b) the length of time that they have been here; (c) how long  they
         have been in education; (c) what stage their education has reached;
         (d) to what extent they have become distanced from the  country  to
         which it is proposed that they  return;  (e)  how  renewable  their
         connection with it may be;  (f)  to  what  extent  they  will  have
         linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting  to  life  in
         that country; and (g) the extent to which the course proposed  will
         interfere with their family life or their rights (if they have any)
         as British citizens.

     22. The first head note of Azimi-Moayed and others (decisions affecting
         children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197 reads, "As  a  starting
         point it is in the best interests of children to be with both their
         parents and if both parents  are  being  removed  from  the  United
         Kingdom then the starting point suggests that so  should  dependent
         children who form part of their household unless there are  reasons
         to the contrary." Headnote (ii)  reads,  "Lengthy  residence  in  a
         country other than the state of origin can lead to  development  of
         social cultural and educational ties that it would be inappropriate
         to disrupt, in the absence of compelling reason  to  the  contrary.
         What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear  cut  but  past  and
         present policies have identified seven years as a relevant period."
         Headnote (iv) of the same case indicates, "Apart from the terms  of
         published policies and rules, the Tribunal notes that  seven  years
         from age four is likely to be more significant to a child that  the
         first seven years of life."

     23. I consider  and  apply  the  principles  enunciated  in  the  above
         decisions in assessing EM's best interests. EM has lived in the  UK
         since she was 3 years old and is now 16 years old.  She  has  spent
         the formative  years  of  her  life  in  the  UK.  The  uncontested
         evidence, as detailed in the various witness statements  before  me
         and supported by reference to the documents issued by EM's  school,
         indicate that she is currently studying at GCSE level, has  already
         undertaken assessments that will count towards  her  final  grades,
         and will be completing her exams in May/June of this  year.  It  is
         apparent from the various school reports that she  is  a  committed
         student who has worked hard to achieve  good  grades  and  is  very
         firmly integrated within the school community. I note that the  4th
         appellant, who is now 7 years old, has also made good  progress  at
         school although she is not at a critical stage of her education and
         is still in primary education.

     24. The statements from EM and her friends,  supported  by  the  school
         documents, indicate that she has formed strong social networks with
         peers outside her family at a time when she had no control over her
         immigration status. Her statements  indicate  that  she  wishes  to
         remain in the UK and is fearful of the losing her established life,
         of the impact on her education, of the  difficulties  she  believes
         she  will  face  in  Mauritius,  and  of  jeopardising  her  future
         aspirations. I note that although EM has grandparents in  Mauritius
         and that the family do attend Mauritian cultural gatherings in  the
         UK, and she would therefore  not  be  unfamiliar  with  aspects  of
         Mauritian culture, none of  EM's  friends  are  Mauritian  and  she
         firmly identifies herself as someone  who  has  adopted  a  British
         lifestyle. EM  is  neither  independent  nor  self-sufficient,  and
         remains reliant on her family, with whom she lives.  There  was  no
         suggestion by the Presenting Officer that she did not  have  strong
         bonds of love, affection and dependency with her  family.  Although
         the starting point in considering EM's best interest  is  that  she
         should remain with her parents and return with them,  in  light  of
         her age, her establishment of relationships outside  her  immediate
         family, her adoption of a British outlook on life and her level  of
         education I find, pursuant to my duty under  s.55,  that  her  best
         interests are to remain in the UK with her family.

     25. Having identified EM's best interests, I must now consider  whether
         it would be reasonable for her to leave the UK. I  proceed  on  the
         basis that she would be accompanied by  her  immediate  family  and
         that the nuclear family unit will remain intact. In  assessing  the
         issue of reasonableness I have to take into  account  all  relevant
         public interest considerations, including  those  relating  to  the
         conduct of her parents (MA (Pakistan). In  assessing  the  relevant
         public interest factors I  take  account  of  those  identified  in
         s.117B of the 2002 Act. I note that  the  public  interest  in  the
         maintenance of effective immigration controls. I note, pursuant  to
         s.117B(2) and  (3)  that  the  appellants  are  all  proficient  in
         English, and that the 1st and 2nd appellant have previously  worked
         in the UK and that the 2nd appellant has a  plumbing  qualification
         indicating  that  they  are  both  capable   of   financial   self-
         sufficiency. Pursuant to Rhuppiah v Secretary of State for the Home
         Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803 and AM (S 117B) Malawi  [2015]  UKUT
         0260 (IAC) I regard both as neutral factors. I take into account as
         a relevant public interest factor the fact that the appellants have
         resided in the UK without lawful leave and that their private lives
         have been established when their immigration status was precarious.
         This is of greater relevance to the 1st and 2nd appellants  as  the
         3rd and 4th appellants have always been minors and have no  control
         or influence over their immigration status or the  unlawful  nature
         of their residence. I attach little weight  to  the  private  lives
         established by the 1st and 2nd appellants in  the  UK.  I  note  in
         particular that the 1st and 2nd appellants entered the UK with  the
         intention of settling and that they  never  had  any  intention  of
         leaving the UK, which  demonstrates  a  significant  disregard  for
         immigration control and the laws of this country. The family  lives
         had already been established when the 1st to 3rd appellants entered
         the UK although they maintained their relationships when unlawfully
         present.

     26. I additionally take account, as another significant public interest
         consideration, of the 2nd appellant's criminality and his  and  the
         1st appellant's use of false documents. Although the 2nd  appellant
         received a sentence of relatively short duration, and he  does  not
         meet the definition of 'foreign criminal'  contained  in  the  2002
         Act, he has nevertheless transgressed the laws of this country and,
         through his drink/driving convictions, placed members of the public
         in potential serious danger. I take account of the public interests
         relating to the protection of the public, the need to ensure public
         confidence in the removal of those who  commit  criminal  offences,
         the  deterrence  effect  of  removing  the  same,  and  the  public
         revulsion at such offences. I note however that the  2nd  appellant
         has only one sentence  of  imprisonment  and  the  absence  of  any
         submission on behalf of the respondent that he poses  a  danger  to
         the public  or  is  likely  to  commit  any  further  offences.  In
         identifying and considering the relevant public interest factors  I
         additionally take into account the use of  NHS  resources  and  the
         drain on the public purse of educating the 3rd and 4th appellants.

     27. In MA (Pakistan) Lord Justice Elias stated, at [46],

             "Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the fact that
             a  child  has  been  here  for  seven  years  must  be   given
             significant  weight  when  carrying  out  the  proportionality
             exercise. Indeed, the Secretary of State published guidance in
             August  2015  in   the   form   of   Immigration   Directorate
             Instructions entitled "Family Life (as a  partner  or  parent)
             and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in  which  it  is  expressly
             stated that once the seven  years'  residence  requirement  is
             satisfied, there need to  be  "strong  reasons"  for  refusing
             leave (para. 11.2.4). These instructions  were  not  in  force
             when the cases now subject to appeal were determined,  but  in
             my view they merely confirm what is  implicit  in  adopting  a
             policy of this nature. After such a period of time  the  child
             will have put down roots and developed  social,  cultural  and
             educational links in the UK such  that  it  is  likely  to  be
             highly disruptive if the child is required to  leave  the  UK.
             That may be less so when the children are very  young  because
             the focus of their lives will be on their  families,  but  the
             disruption becomes more serious as they get  older.  Moreover,
             in these cases there must be a very  strong  expectation  that
             the child's best interests will be to remain in  the  UK  with
             his parents as part of a family unit, and that must rank as  a
             primary consideration in the proportionality assessment."

     28. At [47] of MA (Pakistan) Lord Justice Elias stated,

             "However, the fact that the child has been in the UK for seven
             years would  need  to  be  given  significant  weight  in  the
             proportionality  exercise  for  two  related  reasons:  first,
             because  of  its  relevance  to  determining  the  nature  and
             strength of the child's best interests; and second, because it
             establishes as a starting point that leave should  be  granted
             unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary."

     29. EM's removal would undoubtedly have a  deleterious  impact  on  the
         life she has established in the UK. Although established  when  she
         had no lawful right to remain she cannot be  held  accountable  for
         the behaviour of her  parents  and  her  private  life  was  rooted
         through no fault of her own. I find  that  she  has  fully  adopted
         English values, culture and lifestyle and is fully integrated  into
         her local community and British society. The  evidence  before  me,
         unchallenged, indicates that, having resided in the  UK  throughout
         the formative years of her life, EM  has  enveloped  herself  in  a
         British way of life, and that it is the  only  life  she  has  ever
         known. She has no memories or experience of life  in  Mauritius.  I
         have no reason to doubt the assertion made by EM herself as well as
         her parents that she can  only  understand  and  speak  very  basic
         Creole and French.  While  she  is  studying  French  at  GCSE  her
         predicted grade is a 6 (the equivalent to what used to be grade B),
         indicating that she is clearly not  fluent  in  the  language.  Her
         removal would effectively severe the friendships, relationships and
         social activities that form the core of her private life and, while
         she may be able to retain some contact  with  her  friends  through
         remote means, the impact on her cultural and social integration and
         her adoption of a British lifestyle is likely to be devastating.

     30. She has commenced her GCSEs and is consequently at a key  stage  of
         her education. The most recent school report indicates that  EM  is
         doing well at school with some high predicted grades. I  find  that
         the disruption caused to her education by her proposed removal,  at
         a critical stage of her studies when she is  undertaking  important
         examinations that could determine her future prospects,  especially
         when considering the language difficulties she would  encounter  at
         schools in Mauritius given her lack of proficiency  in  Creole  and
         French, is likely to be very significant (while I do not proceed on
         the basis  that  English  is  not  a  language  of  instruction  in
         Mauritius, there being no evidence to support this contention,  the
         fact remains that, even if lessons are taught in English, EM's lack
         of proficiency in Crole and French is likely to disrupt her ability
         to integrate into the school community).

     31. In assessing whether it would be reasonable to expect EM  to  leave
         the  UK  I  draw  together  the  strong  public  interest   factors
         identified above, and weight them against the impact of removal  on
         EM and the degree of disruption to her private life.  I  note  once
         again that her best interests are a primary  but  not  a  paramount
         consideration, and that her parents do not meet the requirements of
         the  immigration  rules.  The  evidence  that  I   have   carefully
         considered indicates that the daily social and cultural  experience
         and expectations of this 16-year-old girl, who has lived in the  UK
         since she was 3 years old, have been moulded by  her  residence  to
         such an extent that she  would  encounter  considerable  difficulty
         integrating to life in Mauritius, despite have the support  of  her
         parents and extended family members. I find also that  her  removal
         would cause significant upheaval to her education  which  is  at  a
         critical stage. The extent of her integration and the  solidity  of
         EM's relationships, links and associations established  in  the  UK
         are such that to uproot her from all that she has known  and  grown
         up with over 12 ï¿½ years would render her removal  disproportionate,
         despite the serious behaviour of her parents. I  consequently  find
         that EM does meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(iv).

     32. I turn to the appeals of the 1st,  2nd  and  4th  appellants.  They
         cannot succeed under the immigration rules. TM, the 4th  appellant,
         is only 7  years  old  and  has  not  established  any  significant
         relationships outside her family unit, and is  not  at  a  critical
         stage of her education. I find it  would  not  be  unreasonable  to
         expect her to relocate to Mauritius with her parents. I note  again
         that EM is not independent or self-sufficient  and  remains  living
         with her parents and sibling. She clearly has a  close  and  loving
         relationship with her parents and sibling and any separation  would
         have   a   very   significant    detrimental    impact    on    the
         parental/child/sibling relationship. I must consider  the  position
         of the 1st, 2nd and 4th appellants outside  the  immigration  rules
         and determine whether there are compelling or  exceptional  reasons
         for allowing their appeals on article 8 grounds (SSHD v SS  (Congo)
         & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387; MF (Nigeria) v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, at [42]).

     33. I am satisfied that the 1st and  2nd  appellants  have  established
         private lives in the UK given that they have resided her  for  over
         12 years and by reference to the statements from friends and family
         attesting to their integration  and  the  relationships  they  have
         established, although, pursuant to s.117B(4) I must  attach  little
         weight to that private life. The 4th appellant has lived in the  UK
         for all her life and, although she primarily looks to her  parents,
         she attends school and had made friends. Given the  relatively  low
         threshold for establishing a breach of article  8  I  am  satisfied
         that article 8 is triggered in respect of the remaining appellants.
         I find that their proposed removal is in accordance  with  the  law
         and in pursuit of a legitimate aim.

     34. In assessing  the  proportionality  of  the  proposed  removals,  I
         consider and apply the factors identified in  s.117B  of  the  2002
         Act. I adopt my assessment carried out  in  paragraphs  25  and  26
         above  with  reference  to  s.117B  (1)  to  (5)  and  to  the  2nd
         appellant's criminality and the 1st and 2nd  appellant's  disregard
         and breaches of immigration laws of the UK. Section 117B(6) states,



             In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.

     35. In MA(Pakistan) the Court held, at [17],

             "Subsection (6) falls into a different category again. It does
             not  simply  identify  factors  which  bear  upon  the  public
             interest question. It resolves that question in the context of
             article  8  applications  which  satisfy  the  conditions   in
             paragraphs (a) and (b). It does so by  stipulating  that  once
             those conditions are satisfied, the public interest  will  not
             require the applicant's removal. Since the  interference  with
             the right to private or family life  under  article  8(1)  can
             only  be  justified  where  there  is  a  sufficiently  strong
             countervailing public interest falling within article 8(2), if
             the public interest does not  require  removal,  there  is  no
             other basis on which removal could be justified.  It  follows,
             in my judgment, that  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  section
             117B(6) must be read as  a  self-contained  provision  in  the
             sense that Parliament has stipulated that where the conditions
             specified  in  the  sub-section  are  satisfied,  the   public
             interest will not justify removal."

     36. The 1st and 2nd appellants have a genuine and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with EM, and I have already concluded, at paragraph 31
         of this decision, that it would be unreasonable  to  expect  EM  to
         leave the UK. I consequently find that the public interest does not
         require their  removal  even  having  regard  to  the  elements  of
         criminality  and  the  various  public  interests   considered   in
         paragraphs 25  and  26  above.  Having  regard  to  the  assessment
         conducted outside the immigration rules in PD and Others (Article 8
         - conjoined family claims) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT  00108  (IAC),  at
         [43], I am satisfied that the effect of dismissing the 1st and  2nd
         appellants' appeals would  be  to  stultify  my  decision  that  EM
         qualifies for leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
         rules. undertaking the s.117B(6) balancing exercise, and  in  light
         of my previous analysis and findings, I am satisfied that the  test
         of compelling or exceptional circumstances is satisfied.

     37. I need deal only briefly with the position of  the  4th  appellant.
         She is 7 years old and an integral part of her family. Having found
         that the 3rd appellant meets the requirements  of  the  immigration
         rules, and that there are exceptional  circumstances  rendering  it
         disproportionate to remove the 1st and 2nd appellants,  it  follows
         that there are also exceptional circumstances rendering removal  of
         the 7-year-old child disproportionate. The appeals of the 1st,  2nd
         and 4th appellants are allowed outside  the  immigration  rules  in
         accordance with article 8.

Notice of Decision

As these appeals fall to be determined under the appeal structure  in  place
prior  to  the  amendments  made  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014,  the  3rd
appellant's appeal is allowed under the immigration rules, and the 1st,  2nd
and 4th appellants appeals are allowed on human rights grounds.
