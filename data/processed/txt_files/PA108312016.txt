                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in 1984.  On  the  20th
    July 2017 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Butler) dismissed his  appeal,
    brought on human rights and protection grounds against  a  decision  to
    deport him from the United Kingdom. The Appellant now has permission to
    appeal against that decision,  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Cruthers on the 23rd August 2017.




    Anonymity Order


 2. The Appellant is a foreign criminal and  there  is  no  reason  why  he
    should benefit from an order protecting his identity.  This  case  does
    however turn on the presence in the United Kingdom of his British  son.
     Having had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of  2013:
    Anonymity  Orders  I  am  concerned  that  the  identification  of  the
    Appellant could lead to the identification  of  his  son.  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    The Decision to Deport

 3. The Appellant is known to have arrived in the UK in October 2003,  when
    he was aged 19. He claimed asylum but when it was  identified  that  he
    had already made a claim in Austria arrangements were  made  under  the
    Dublin Convention for his return there. He absconded  and  that  return
    was not therefore affected. The Appellant was encountered by police  in
    November  2004  when  he  claimed  asylum  in  a  false  identity.  His
    fingerprints revealed the truth and that claim was  therefore  rejected
    without consideration because it was a 'multiple claim'.  By March 2006
    it would seem that the Respondent had abandoned all  hope  of  removing
    the Appellant to Austria because he was invited to  interview.  He  did
    not attend.  His claim was rejected and on  the  3rd  August  2007  his
    appeal was dismissed.   The Appellant  was  encountered  again  by  the
    police in April 2010. In May 2011 he made a further claim  for  asylum,
    and made human rights submissions.  These were under consideration when
    the Respondent was notified, in January 2012, that  the  Appellant  had
    been  convicted  of  robbery  and  had  been  sentenced  to  two  years
    imprisonment.


 4. The circumstances of the index offence  were  that  the  Appellant  had
    developed a problem with gambling and alcohol. He had been in a betting
    shop at closing time and the cashier, who was known to  the  Appellant,
    agreed to allow him to stay in the shop  whilst  she  "cashed-up".  She
    made him a drink.   When she had approximately �275  in  her  hand  the
    Appellant demanded that she give it to him. She refused and he attacked
    her, biting her hand until she let go of the  money.  It  was,  by  the
    estimation of the trial judge, a serious and frightening  attack  on  a
    lone woman.  It is not the Appellant's only conviction. On the 3rd June
    2005 he had been convicted of failing to stop after an accident,  using
    a vehicle with no test certificate, using a  vehicle  whilst  uninsured
    and with no licence. He had  on  that  occasion  been  fined  �200  and
    disqualified from driving for 6 months.


 5. The Respondent decided to make an order for the Appellant's deportation
    on the 9th April 2015.


    The Appellant's Case


 6. The Appellant sought to resist the deportation order on both protection
    and human rights grounds.


 7. In respect of protection the Appellant asserted that he  faced  a  real
    risk of serious harm in Afghanistan arising from the  general  violence
    there, but that the risk to him was enhanced because he  has  spent  so
    long in the UK. As a 'westernised'  Afghan  he  would  face  particular
    adverse interest from criminal and extremist elements.


 8. The human rights case rested on the Appellant's relationship  with  his
    son. The child C was born on the 3rd April 2014 to a British mother, T.
    T has not been able to care for her son and  since  the  16th  February
    2015 C has been the subject of a Special Guardianship Order  in  favour
    of his paternal grandparents. Mr and Mrs S, the Appellant's father  and
    step-mother, have looked after C ever since.  He lives in their home in
    Birmingham.  The Appellant also lives in that house. He states that  he
    shares a bedroom with his son, and that the two of them are  close.  He
    avers that he has an Article 8 family life with C and that it would  be
    contrary to C's best interests, and in  all  the  circumstances  unduly
    harsh, to interfere with that right.




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 9. The first thing that the First-tier Tribunal had to deal with  was  the
    fact that the Appellant was without legal representation.  He  attended
    the hearing on his own and requested an adjournment. He explained  that
    he had had solicitors previously but he could not afford the fees  they
    required to attend the hearing. Although his father had agreed  to  pay
    it seems it was not possible to arrange this prior to the appeal  being
    listed. The Appellant submitted a handwritten note said  to  have  been
    given to him by someone at the Solicitors confirming, in bullet points,
    what he had told the Tribunal.  It said that  he  needed  time  to  get
    further evidence including  making  a  'subject  access  request'.  The
    Tribunal noted that there was on the file a letter from the  solicitors
    saying that  they  had  withdrawn  and  that  this  had  been  received
    approximately three weeks before the  hearing.    This  had  given  the
    Appellant  ample  time  to  pay  any  fees  required  or  get   a   new
    representative.  The Tribunal was unable to attach very much weight  to
    the handwritten note since there was nothing at all to indicate that it
    was actually from a solicitor.  The adjournment request  was  therefore
    denied, but the Tribunal did set the matter back in the  list  so  that
    the Appellant could contact his  father  and  ask  him  to  attend  the
    hearing, which was duly done.


10. The Tribunal noted that this was a case that was certified under s72 of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This meant that as  a
    serious criminal the Appellant  could  not  have  the  benefit  of  the
    Refugee Convention unless he could not rebut the presumption  that  his
    presence in the UK would constitute a danger to the community.  It  did
    not accept that the presumption was rebutted.  The  index  offence  had
    been particularly serious. Although a weapon  had  not  been  used  the
    Appellant had preyed on a vulnerable woman on her own.   There  was  no
    evidence that the Appellant was  unlikely  to  re-offend.  He  had  not
    produced evidence to demonstrate that  his  problems  with  alcohol  or
    gambling had been resolved.  The  probation  report  stopped  short  of
    confirming that he was a low risk of re-offending.   The Appellant  was
    not therefore entitled to the protection of the Refugee Convention.


11. The Tribunal turned to consider whether he was, nevertheless, at a risk
    of serious harm in Afghanistan.   It directed itself to  consider,  per
    Devaseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on the 3rd August 2007. On that date Judge Deavin had  made
    what the First-tier Tribunal described as "scathing criticism"  of  the
    Appellant's credibility as a witness. His evidence was  rejected  as  a
    complete fabrication.  That had to be the Tribunal's starting point  in
    the evaluation of his protection claim. It was  bound  to  follow  that
    decision unless there  was  new  evidence,  or  a  material  change  in
    circumstances. The Appellant had pointed out that there was  a  war  in
    Afghanistan. The Tribunal declined to find that the level  of  violence
    was such that Article 15(c) would be engaged and  applied  the  country
    guidance in AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan CG [2012]  UKUT  163  (IAC).
    There was not a sufficiently high risk of harm to  the  Appellant  such
    that he had made out a protection claim, even to the lower standard  of
    proof.


12. In respect of human rights the Tribunal  directed  itself  to  consider
    paragraphs 398-399A of the Immigration Rules.   If the Appellant  could
    show that any of the exceptions to  the  automatic  deportation  scheme
    applied, he would succeed on Article  8  grounds.   The  Appellant  had
    claimed to be in a relationship with an Iranian woman whom  he  planned
    to marry, but she had not attended and  there  was  no  evidence  of  a
    relationship available before the  Tribunal.  He  could  not  therefore
    succeed on the grounds that he had a family life with a  partner.    In
    respect of the 'private life' provisions in 399A  the  Appellant  could
    not rely on those because he had never had leave to remain in the UK.


13. The only possible exception that might apply to his case was  that  set
    out at paragraph 399(b). It was for the Appellant to demonstrate  three
    things. First he had to show that  he  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a British child. He then had to show that it
    would be 'unduly harsh' for that child to remain in the UK without him,
    and that it would be 'unduly harsh' for that child to go to Afghanistan
    with him if he were to be deported. The Respondent  accepted  that  the
    last of those tests was met. The child is  British  and  subject  to  a
    Special Guardianship Order. He could not therefore be removed from  the
    UK and the Respondent accepted that it would be unduly harsh to  expect
    him to go to Afghanistan.


14. Turning to consider the remaining matters in issue the Tribunal was not
    satisfied that the Appellant did in fact enjoy a parental  relationship
    with his son.  Although the Appellant had lived  with  C  since  C  was
    approximately six months old, and the Tribunal appeared to  accept  his
    evidence that they enjoy a "very close relationship" it found that  the
    nature of that relationship was not of  father  and  son.   The  Family
    Court had decided that it was the Appellant's  father  and  step-mother
    who should look after the child.  They had a parental relationship with
    C.  The Appellant's father did  not  believe  that  the  Appellant  was
    responsible enough to look after C. They were content for him  to  live
    in their house, and share a room with the child, but  they  were  clear
    that they would remain C's guardians. They had indicated that  even  if
    the Appellant were to enter into  a  new  relationship  the  boy  would
    nonetheless remain with them.  The inescapable conclusion was that  the
    child's best interests lay with remaining with his  grandparents.   The
    Tribunal therefore dismissed the appeal under the Rules.


15.  Finally the Tribunal considered whether it would, notwithstanding  the
    failure under the Rules, be disproportionate to deport  the  Appellant.
    Having had regard to the various matters  arising  in  respect  of  the
    public interest, it concluded that it was not.


    The Appeal


16. The Appellant sought to appeal the decision on several grounds.


17. First it was submitted that there was a procedural  unfairness  in  the
    Tribunal's decision not to adjourn.  It is  obviously  preferable  that
    appellants are legally represented, particularly where the  fundamental
    rights of a child are involved.  It is  however  not  a  pre-requisite.
    Were that the case then there would be guaranteed legal aid funding for
    such cases. Unfortunately the reality is  far  from  that  ideal.  This
    Chamber deals on a daily basis with appellants who  are  unrepresented,
    either because they could not secure legal aid and they do not have the
    money themselves or because they have been unable to find a  specialist
    with time to take their case. Judges in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are
    therefore well-versed in the appropriate measures to be taken  in  such
    cases, such as taking particular care  to  ensure  that  the  appellant
    understands the proceedings, and is able to participate effectively  in
    them.   There is nothing in the grounds or determination  itself  which
    would indicate that those measures were not implemented here. The Judge
    explored the possibility of the  Appellant  finding  a  representative.
    Since he had already had three weeks to do so it was not satisfied that
    any further adjournment would be of assistance. That was a finding open
    to it on the evidence before it.  I am not satisfied that it  has  been
    shown that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is vitiated  by  any
    unfairness.


18. I need deal with the next two grounds very briefly since  Mr  Woodhouse
    made no submissions on them, and because the new country guidance  case
    of AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan  [2018]  UKUT  (IAC)  renders  them
    unarguable.  Complaint was made first about the way that  the  Tribunal
    approached the rebuttable  presumption  in  s72;  the  grounds  further
    submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  its  approach  to
    protection because it had failed to address the  changed  circumstances
    on the ground  since  AK  was  decided.   AS  expressly  maintains  the
    position of AK, and the submission that 'westernised' returnees face an
    "enhanced risk" is rejected.  There can therefore be no arguable  error
    in the Tribunal having failing to consider the submissions contrary  to
    the findings in AK. Nor can its findings on s72 be of any relevance. If
    there is no risk of harm, it matters not what Convention the  Appellant
    was seeking protection under.


19. In respect of Article 8 it is submitted that the Tribunal has erred  in
    its approach to whether there is a  "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship" because it has failed  to  take  material  evidence  into
    account, namely the significance of the biological relationship and the
    fact that the Appellant shares a room with C.   In his  submissions  Mr
    Woodhouse  submitted  that   the   Tribunal   has   misunderstood   the
    significance of the Special Guardianship Order. Whilst  such  an  order
    does confer legal responsibility on C's grandparents, it does not  take
    anything away from the Appellant's father. As a matter of  law  he  has
    retained parental responsibility. Similarly in terms of the substantive
    relationship there is nothing to show that C's  relationship  with  his
    grandparents  has  diminished  his  relationship  with  his  Dad.   The
    evidence about the living arrangements was not challenged. It was  this
    point that persuaded Judge Cruthers to grant permission.


20. The Tribunal's findings are found at paragraph 49:


         "I cannot ignore the fact that the  Appellant's  father  and  step-
         mother  have  a  special  guardianship  order  in  respect  of  the
         Appellant's son as a result of which they are  his  primary  carers
         and they are the ones who make  day  to  day  decisions  about  his
         upbringing. [Mr S] senior also made it clear that if the  Appellant
         was to enter into another  relationship  which,  according  to  his
         evidence, he  intended  to  do,  his  son  would  remain  with  his
         grandparents".


21. Whilst I understand Judge Cruthers' concerns, I am not  satisfied  that
    the Tribunal was here simply imagining that the  making  of  a  Special
    Guardianship  Order   automatically   creates   a   "genuine   parental
    relationship", or  that  it  automatically  destroys  another.  It  was
    properly concerned with the substance of the relationship. There can be
    no criticism of its finding that it is C's  grandparents  who  are  his
    primary carers, and that they are the ones who have made the day to day
    decisions about his upbringing.   Conversely  Mr  Woodhouse  was  quite
    unable to direct me to any evidence that indicated  that  there  was  a
    substantively parental relationship between the child and  the  parent.
    The fact that they  share  a  bedroom  adds  little  to  the  equation;
    conventionally children share bedrooms with their  siblings,  not  with
    their parents. The same can be said of the evidence that the  Appellant
    plays with C. The Appellant does state that he "sometimes" takes  C  to
    nursery and  that  he  helps  with  his  care,  both  matters  arguably
    consistent with a parental role, but what is strikingly absent from his
    statement and that of his father is any  confirmation  that  the  child
    looks to the Appellant as  a  father,  rather  than  as  a  brother  or
    playmate.  Neither statement even confirms that C  is  aware  that  the
    Appellant is in fact his biological father: since he has lived with his
    grandparents since  he  was  six  months  old  that  is  a  significant
    omission.


22. Even if the First-tier Tribunal - and I am wrong about  the  nature  of
    the relationship, there was not before the Tribunal sufficient evidence
    to support a finding that it would be unduly harsh for C, or  otherwise
    a violation of Article 8, if the Appellant were to be  deported.    The
    Appellant committed  a  serious  criminal  offence  for  which  he  was
    sentenced to two years in prison. That was not his first  offence,  and
    he has in addition a very poor history of compliance  with  immigration
    control. All of that weighed heavily in the balance. Against  that  was
    the Appellant's evidence that it would "not be fair" on his son  if  he
    were to be deported.  No particulars were offered about how  the  child
    might be affected, or why, as alleged  in  the  grounds,  it  would  be
    contrary to his best interests if his father was to be  removed.   This
    is a child who is looked  after  -  by  all  accounts  well  -  by  his
    grandparents who have cared for him since he was 6 months old and  have
    declared it to be their intention  to  carry  on  doing  so.    In  the
    absence of any actual evidence about what the detriment to him might be
    as a result of the Respondent's decision, the First-tier Tribunal could
    have done nothing other than dismiss the appeal.


    Decision


23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law  and
    the decision is upheld.


24. There is a direction for anonymity.
