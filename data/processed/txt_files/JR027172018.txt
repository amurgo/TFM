                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan


            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered all the documents filed  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective  representatives,  Mr  S.  Muquit,  of  Counsel,  instructed   by
Connaught Solicitors, on behalf  of  the  applicant  and  Mr  Z.  Malik,  of
Counsel, instructed by the Government Legal Department,  on  behalf  of  the
respondent, at a hearing at Field House, London on 05/03/19.

      Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

1.    The applicant seeks  to  challenge  the  respondent's  decision  dated
      06/12/17 to refuse Indefinite Leave  to  Remain  (ILR)  as  a  Tier  1
      (General) Migrant and the associated  Administrative  Review  decision
      dated 15/01/18.

2.    The applicant entered the UK on 23/09/09 with  entry  clearance  as  a
      Tier 4 (General) Dependent Partner, which was valid until 18/04/11. On
      18/01/11 he applied to vary his leave to remain to a Tier 1  (General)
      Migrant, which was granted until 28/02/13. The respondent subsequently
      granted further leave to remain as a Tier 1 migrant until 26/02/16. On
      15/02/16 the applicant applied for ILR as a Tier 1 migrant.

3.    The respondent refused the application under  two  provisions  of  the
      immigration rules.

        i) Paragraphs 19(i) and 19(j) of Appendix A
           The respondent was satisfied that there  was  evidence  to  show
           genuine earnings of around �17,945 from employment at Sainsburys
           and  Adelie  Foods  Group   Limited.   However,   after   having
           interviewed the applicant, he was not satisfied that his claimed
           earnings  of  around  �38,849  from  self-employment   providing
           business consultancy services  was  genuine  for  the  following
           reasons:


              a) The applicant's answers about his duties as the Director of
                 the business were vague and lacked  detail  given  that  he
                 claimed to have been working as a sole trader for a  period
                 of six years.


              b) The invoices produced as evidence  of  trading,  similarly,
                 lacked detail and gave vague descriptions of  the  work  he
                 claimed to have carried out.

              c) The respondent found it concerning that the  applicant  was
                 asked three times  to  describe  what  market  research  he
                 carried out before starting  his  business  yet  failed  to
                 answer the question. His answers were considered vague  and
                 evasive.

              d) The respondent also found it implausible that the applicant
                 could work the number of hours he did in employment as well
                 as having time to run the business. The evidence  indicated
                 that he worked an average of 36 hours a week at  Sainsburys
                 and around 17.5 hours a week for Adelie.  It  was  unlikely
                 that he could devote two days a week to self-employed  work
                 and a third day with his family as claimed.

              e) The respondent considered it implausible that the  business
                 could generate a turnover of over �40,000 by word of  mouth
                 recommendations from  friends,  family  and  associates  as
                 claimed  by  the  applicant,  especially  if  he  did   not
                 advertise or have an online presence.

              f) The applicant showed a lack of knowledge  of  the  accounts
                 relating to the business  which  also  cast  doubt  on  the
                 legitimacy  of  his  claimed  self-employed  earnings.  The
                 applicant said that his travel costs for the period claimed
                 were "more than �1,000" when the  accounts  submitted  with
                 the application showed that they only totalled �775.

              g) The respondent was also concerned that the bank  statements
                 submitted with the application did not  appear  to  reflect
                 the accounts. The respondent found that this cast doubt  on
                 whether the income reflected in the statements  was  earned
                 through genuine employment  rather  than  being  "borrowed,
                 gifted, or otherwise shown in your  financial  transactions
                 or records without being earned."

              h)  The  respondent  found  that  discrepancies  between   the
                 applicant's claimed earnings in  earlier  applications  for
                 leave to remain in 2011 and 2013 and  records  of  earnings
                 declared to HMRC in the relevant years also undermined  the
                 credibility of the self-employed earnings  claimed  in  the
                 current application for ILR. The  previous  declaration  of
                 different amounts of income to HMRC and the UKVI led to the
                 conclusion that he had either misrepresented  his  earnings
                 to HMRC to reduce  his  tax  liability  or  provided  false
                 information about his self-employed  earnings  to  UKVI  to
                 meet the requirements for leave to remain.

       ii) Paragraph 322(5)
           The respondent  went  on  to  give  the  following  reasons  for
           refusing the application under the general  ground  for  refusal
           contained in paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules.


                 "The  Secretary  of  State  has  considered   whether   the
                 particular circumstances of your case merit the exercise of
                 discretion.  Having  considered  those  circumstances   the
                 Secretary of State is satisfied that  the  refusal  remains
                 appropriate and is not prepared to exercise  discretion  in
                 your favour.


                 Your actions in declaring different amounts  of  income  to
                 HMRC and UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light of  your
                 character and conduct it would be undesirable to allow  you
                 to remain in the United Kingdom. Your character and conduct
                 with regard to  declaring  your  income  would  lead  to  a
                 refusal of your application under General Grounds Paragraph
                 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  Whilst  a  refusal  under
                 Paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  is  not   a
                 mandatory  decision,  it  is  considered  your  actions  in
                 declaring different income to HMRC and UKVI would mean that
                 a refusal under Paragraph 322(5) is appropriate."


4.    The applicant filed the application for permission to  bring  judicial
      review proceedings on 13/04/18. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Macleman  noted
      that the application  was  not  made  promptly  and  was  outside  the
      extended three-month  time  limit  required  for  an  application  for
      judicial review. He found that no  good  reasons  had  been  given  to
      justify extending time and refused to  admit  the  application.  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Craig  granted  permission  following  a  renewed  oral
      application made on 31/10/18. The order is  silent  on  the  issue  of
      timeliness. I can only infer from the fact that permission was granted
      that the application was admitted. Neither party takes a point on  the
      issue.

Grounds of challenge

5.    The applicant  only  seeks  to  challenge  the  respondent's  findings
      relating to the discrepancies between the declarations  made  to  UKVI
      and HMRC, particularly in so far as they relate to the decision  under
      paragraph 322(5), but also  in  so  far  as  they  form  part  of  the
      assessment under paragraph 19 of Appendix A. Mr Muquit made clear that
      there was no challenge to the respondent's other reasons  for  refusal
      under paragraph 19. The applicant  puts  forward  two  main  heads  of
      challenge.

      (i)   Failure to take into account relevant considerations
           In only taking into account the  initial  discrepancies  between
           the declarations of income made  by  the  applicant  in  earlier
           applications to the UKVI and the income declared to HMRC to form
           the basis  of  his  conclusion  that  it  was  likely  that  the
           applicant had been dishonest in his dealings with one  or  other
           government  department,  the  respondent  failed  to  take  into
           account relevant considerations put forward by the applicant  in
           response.


           a) The respondent failed to consider the applicant's explanation
              at qu.27 of the interview for the apparent discrepancy in the
              income declared to HMRC for the 2010-2011 tax year, which was
              recorded as 'nil return', and the gross income he claimed  to
              the UKVI for the period 15/09/10 to 02/01/11.  The  applicant
              said that "it was an error made by my previous accountant".


           b) The respondent failed to consider the fact that the  declared
              income covered different periods of time i.e.  calendar  year
              and tax year.

           c) The respondent failed to consider the fact that the applicant
              amended the tax returns and the relevance of the  timing  (in
              November 2013 i.e. just over two years before the  subsequent
              application for ILR on 15/02/16).

       ii) Failure to consider the exercise of discretion  under  paragraph
           322(5)
           The initial assertion that there was no mention of discretion in
           the decision letter  was  not  relied  upon  because  Mr  Muquit
           accepted  that  the  wording  did  mention   the   exercise   of
           discretion. However, he continued to rely on  the  assertion  in
           the original grounds that only 'lip service'  was  paid  to  the
           exercise of discretion. No adequate assessment of  the  exercise
           of discretion took place.

Grounds of defence

6.    The respondent asserts that he was  entitled  to  rely  on  the  large
      discrepancies between the income declared to HMRC in 2010-2011,  2011-
      2012 and 2012-2013 and the income the applicant claimed in application
      for leave to remain in 2011 and 2013. The fact that he claims that  an
      accountant made an error is immaterial in the absence  of  any  proper
      explanation as to what the error was. In light of the  fact  that  the
      applicant confirmed in interview that he checked and  signed  his  tax
      returns it is implausible that he would not have noticed such a  large
      discrepancy. In any event, there was no adequate explanation as to how
      the error occurred or evidence to  support  the  claim.  Even  if  the
      applicant took steps to remedy the errors in the tax returns  sometime
      before the ILR application, it still took some time before the alleged
      errors were noticed and corrected. The fact that  the  applicant  took
      steps to amend the tax returns did not mean that he was honest in  his
      original dealings with the UKVI and HMRC.

7.    The respondent considered  whether  it  was  appropriate  to  exercise
      discretion  and  came  to  a  rational  conclusion  that  it  was  not
      appropriate to do so. It was open to  the  respondent  to  refuse  the
      application under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules.

8.    The application for judicial review  should  be  refused  because  the
      other reasons for refusal under paragraph 19 are  not  challenged  and
      were sufficient to justify refusal of ILR in any event: section 31(2A)
      Senior Courts Act 1981 referred.

Decision and reasons

9.    In order to be granted ILR as a Tier 1 migrant under  paragraph  245CD
      of the immigration rules the applicant needed  to  meet  the  relevant
      earnings requirements contained in Appendix A.

10.   The applicant claimed a total admissible income  of  �56,794  for  the
      period from 04/02/15 to 03/02/16 from a combination  of  employed  and
      self-employed  earnings.  The  respondent  accepted  that  there   was
      credible evidence of  the  applicant's  employed  earnings  of  around
      �17,945. Even though the hours he worked  to  earn  this  income  were
      likely to be more than an average working week, it formed the  smaller
      proportion of the overall income claimed. Most of  the  income  relied
      upon by the applicant was said  to  come  from  self-employment  as  a
      business consultant, which he claimed amounted to around �38,849.

11.   After having interviewed the applicant the respondent  gave  at  least
      eight reasons for doubting the credibility of the applicant's  claimed
      earnings from self-employment under paragraph 19 of  Appendix  A.  The
      first seven of those reasons (set out at paragraph 3(i)(a)-(g)  above)
      have not been challenged by the applicant. The sole  challenge  is  to
      the eighth reason (paragraph 3(i)(h)) in so far as it was also used as
      the basis for the refusal under paragraph 322(5).

12.   The eighth reason for doubting the  credibility  of  the  most  recent
      income related to the large discrepancies in income declared  to  HMRC
      and to the UKVI in previous applications. However, it was  a  distinct
      and separate issue relating to the credibility of past  events,  which
      was relevant to the applicant's overall credibility. The  first  seven
      reasons for doubting the credibility of the income  from  his  current
      business activities could easily  stand  on  their  own  even  if  the
      respondent had not taken any point relating to dishonesty in  previous
      applications. For this reason, it becomes  clear  that,  even  if  the
      respondent erred  in  his  assessment  of  the  HMRC/UKVI  issue,  the
      application was  bound  to  be  refused  for  the  other  unchallenged
      reasons.

13.   Nevertheless, I acknowledge that the implications of a  refusal  under
      paragraph 322(5) might be far reaching. A refusal based  on  dishonest
      conduct might affect future applications for leave to remain. To  this
      extent I have considered the points made by the applicant in  relation
      to the HMRC/UKVI issue. However, in my assessment, there is no  public
      law error in the respondent's decision. His findings were rational and
      open to him to make on the evidence before him.

14.   In assessing this aspect of the claim, I have considered  the  general
      guidance given by Spencer J in R (on the application of Khan)  v  SSHD
      (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384.


              i. Where there has been a significant difference  between  the
                 income claimed in  a  previous  application  for  leave  to
                 remain and the income declared to HMRC,  the  Secretary  of
                 State is entitled to draw an inference that  the  Applicant
                 has been deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should  be
                 refused ILR within  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
                 Rules.  Such an inference could be expected where there  is
                 no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


             ii. Where an Applicant has presented  evidence  to  show  that,
                 despite the prima facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
                 dishonest but only careless, then the  Secretary  of  State
                 must  decide  whether  the  explanation  and  evidence   is
                 sufficient, in  her  view,  to  displace  the  prima  facie
                 inference of deceit/dishonesty.

            iii. In approaching that fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of
                 State should remind herself that, although the standard  of
                 proof is the "balance of probability",  a  finding  that  a
                 person has been deceitful and dishonest in relation to  his
                 tax  affairs  with  the  consequence  that  he  is   denied
                 settlement in this country is a very serious  finding  with
                 serious consequences.

             iv. For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant  for
                 an "error" in relation to the historical  tax  return  will
                 not be the end of the matter,  given  that  the  accountant
                 will or should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the
                 return was accurate and to  have  signed  the  tax  return.
                 Furthermore the Applicant will have known  of  his  or  her
                 earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If the
                 Applicant does not take steps within a reasonable  time  to
                 remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
                 entitled  to  conclude  that  this  failure   justifies   a
                 conclusion that there has been deceit or dishonesty.

              v. When considering whether or not the Applicant is  dishonest
                 or merely careless the Secretary of State  should  consider
                 the following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to
                 which they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

                 (i)    Whether  the  explanation  for  the  error  by   the
                 accountant is plausible;
                 (ii)  Whether the documentation which  can  be  assumed  to
                       exist  (for  example,  correspondence   between   the
                       Applicant and his accountant at the time of  the  tax
                       return) has been disclosed or there  is  a  plausible
                       explanation for why it is missing;
                 (iii) Why the Applicant did not realise that an  error  had
                       been made because his liability to pay tax  was  less
                       than he should have expected;
                 (iv)  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps
                       to remedy the situation and, if so, when those  steps
                       were taken and the explanation  for  any  significant
                       delay.

15.   The respondent was entitled to consider the large discrepancy  between
      the 'nil return' declared to HMRC for the tax year 2010-2011  and  the
      claimed self-employed income for the period 15/09/10  to  02/01/11  of
      �43,521 put forward in his application for leave to  remain  in  2011.
      The discrepancy was significant. The applicant is not expected to have
      the same level of forensic knowledge as an accountant  but  given  the
      very large discrepancy it was rational for  the  respondent  to  infer
      that it was highly unlikely that the applicant would not notice it if,
      as he claimed in interview, he checked and signed all his tax returns.



16.   It is true to say that the respondent  did  not  specifically  address
      the applicant's assertion in interview that an error was made  by  his
      previous accountant. Even if he had, it would have  made  no  material
      difference to his conclusions regarding the  applicant's  credibility.
      The explanation provided at question 27 of the interview  was  limited
      to a bare statement. The applicant did not  explain  how  or  why  the
      alleged error occurred.

17.   The applicant  prepared  a  witness  statement  in  support  of  these
      proceedings, but it only compounds the doubts already raised about his
      credibility. He claims that he instructed a person from Globe Visa  to
      help him to make the  Tier  1  application  in  January  2011.  It  is
      reasonable to infer that Globe Visa provided  immigration  advice  and
      were not accountants. The applicant claims that the Yash at Globe Visa
      referred him to an accountant called Arif. He goes on  to  say:  "Yash
      told us that our tax returns were submitted. We never had sight of the
      tax returns and  had  no  knowledge  of  what  was  mentioned  in  the
      returns". This contradicts the applicant's evidence in interview  when
      he confirmed that he checked and signed his tax returns (as  he  would
      be required to do). In any event, there was  no  evidence  before  the
      respondent, and there is still no evidence, from  Globe  Visa  or  the
      accountant in question to explain how or why an error might have  been
      made. Even if there was, the guidance in  Khan  makes  clear  that  it
      would still be open to the respondent  to  infer  that  it  is  highly
      unlikely that a person would be unaware of such  a  major  discrepancy
      if, as the applicant says, he checked and signed all his tax returns.

18.   Although the respondent made a similar  point  about  the  application
      for leave to remain made in 2013 and  acknowledged  that  the  figures
      covered more than one tax year,  the  discrepancy  was  not  quite  so
      stark. The respondent went on to consider the fact that the  applicant
      amended his tax returns in 2013 for the relevant  years.  However,  he
      was entitled to take into  account  the  fact  that,  even  after  the
      amendment, there remained a discrepancy in  the  figures  declared  to
      different government departments. Although the  figure  of  �4,812  is
      perhaps less significant, and this point did  not  appear  to  form  a
      central part of the reasons for  concluding  that  the  applicant  was
      dishonest, it is clear the respondent considered  the  import  of  the
      amendments. The fact that it took place in 2013 and not shortly before
      the application for ILR was unlikely to make any  material  difference
      to the outcome of the respondent's assessment given that the applicant
      has provided no explanation, either then or now, as to how he came  to
      discover the discrepancies in late 2013 even though it  is  reasonable
      to infer that he would  have  reviewed  his  immigration  history  and
      finances as part of the application for further leave to  remain  made
      in early 2013.

19.   The assertion made in  the  grounds  that  the  respondent  improperly
      shifted the burden of proof to the applicant to "credibly account" for
      the  discrepancies  is  unarguable.  The  overall  burden  of  proving
      dishonesty is on the respondent. Khan  makes  clear  that  an  initial
      inference could be drawn from such large discrepancies. The evidential
      burden then shifts to the applicant to provide a plausible explanation
      for those discrepancies. The respondent must then decide  whether  the
      explanation adequately addresses the allegation of dishonesty.

20.   In this case, it was within a range of reasonable  responses  for  the
      respondent to reject the applicant's explanation,  which  amounted  to
      little more than a bare and unexplained statement which has  not  been
      supported, then or now, with any evidence from the accountant. Even if
      an explanation had been  provided,  the  respondent  was  entitled  to
      conclude that it was more likely than not that the applicant had  been
      dishonest in his dealings with  one  or  other  government  department
      because  it  was  implausible  that  he  did  not  notice  such  large
      discrepancies if he checked his tax returns as claimed.

21.   Mr Muquit made various other general submissions on points  that  were
      not pleaded in the original grounds.  The  fact  that  the  CID  notes
      appear to record the  applicant  as  'credible'  by  the  interviewing
      officer was unlikely to make any material difference  to  the  overall
      outcome of the decision given that there is no indication  as  to  why
      the officer came to that conclusion. It was  unarguably  open  to  the
      officer who took the decision  to  make  his  own  assessment  of  the
      credibility of the applicant's claimed  self-employed  income  on  the
      evidence before him. Indeed, most of the reasons he gave for rejecting
      the credibility of the recent income  from  self-employment  have  not
      been challenged.

22.   I conclude that the respondent gave adequate and rational reasons  for
      finding that it was more likely than not that the applicant previously
      misrepresented his earnings to one  or  other  government  department,
      either for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage or  to  satisfy  the
      earnings requirements of the immigration rules,  which  he  would  not
      have met on his employed earnings alone.  In so far as those  findings
      formed only one part of the credibility assessment under paragraph  19
      the  application  would  have  been  refused  for  the   seven   other
      unchallenged reasons in any event.

23.   Notably, Mr Muquit did not pursue the second ground  relating  to  the
      exercise  of  discretion  under  paragraph  322(5)  in   his   opening
      submissions. It was only when this was pointed out by Mr Malik that he
      dealt with the issue in response. He accepted that  the  assertion  at
      [21] of the grounds was incorrect. The decision letter  did  refer  to
      the exercise of discretion. However, he argued that it only  paid  lip
      service to the issue  and  that  inadequate  reasons  were  given  for
      concluding that it was not appropriate to exercise discretion in  this
      case.

24.   First, it is not a central point if it was  not  thought  sufficiently
      important to argue it in opening submissions.


25.   Second, the grounds fail to particularise any  reason  why  discretion
      should have been exercised given that refusal under  paragraph  322(5)
      would "normally" follow from a finding that it was undesirable for the
      person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light  of  his
      conduct.

26.   Third, in so far as Mr Muquit went further than  the  pleaded  grounds
      by suggesting what was, in effect, a new head of challenge,  that  the
      respondent failed to consider a relevant policy,  no  application  was
      made to amend the grounds to include such a challenge.  The  selective
      policy statement he relied upon at  [29]  of  his  skeleton  argument,
      which was not referred to in the grounds, relates to the  Home  Office
      guidance on General Grounds for  Refusal  (10/04/17),  which  suggests
      that the caseworker "must consider  if  there  are  any  human  rights
      grounds" when considering whether to exercise discretion.  Given  that
      this was an application for ILR and was not put to the respondent as a
      human rights claim with relevant evidence relating to the  applicant's
      family life in the UK, the approach taken by  the  respondent  in  the
      Administrative Review decision,  to  require  a  formal  human  rights
      application, was unarguably lawful.

27.   For the reasons given above, I refuse the application and  the  relief
sought.

                                    ORDER
___________________________________________________________________________

UPON HEARING from Mr S. Muquit, on  behalf  of  the  applicant,  and  Mr  Z.
Malik, on behalf of the respondent at a hearing on 05/03/19.

AND UPON judgment being handed down on 18/03/19.

IT IS ORDERED:

Decision: application refused

1.    The application for judicial review is refused.

2.    No relief is granted.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

3.    The grounds fail to particularise any  arguable  errors  of  law  that
      would justify granting permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. It
      is not arguable that the Upper Tribunal erred in its assessment of the
      principles outlined in Khan. The grounds fail to particularise how  or
      why the decisions in Dadzie  or  Oji  would  have  made  any  material
      difference. The  Upper  Tribunal  focused  on  reasons  given  by  the
      respondent in the decision, but in so  far  as  the  applicant  raised
      other points and relied  on  further  evidence  in  the  form  of  the
      applicant's statement, it dealt with them accordingly.  Those  reasons
      did not form a central part of the judgment.

4.     Permission  to  appeal  to  the   Court   of   Appeal   is   refused.



Costs

5.    The applicant shall pay the respondent's costs summarily  assessed  at
      �4,891.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
