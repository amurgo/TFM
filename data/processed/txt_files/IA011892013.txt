               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Kirk, Counsel instructed by Abbott Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  Jhirad  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent refusing his application for leave to remain  as  a  student
    under paragraphs 322(1A) and 245C(b and c) of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  15  October  1979.   He
    arrived in the UK in September 2003 on a student  visa  that  conferred
    leave to enter until 31  October  2006.   Subsequent  applications  for
    leave to remain as a student were made and  granted  and  then  he  was
    granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  valid
    until 6 August 2011.  He applied on 5 April 2011 for further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system.  It is the refusal of that application which is under appeal.

3.   The judge found as follows:

         "5.  With his  application,  the  appellant  submitted  wage  slips
             issued to him by  Samantha  Business  Solutions  ("SBS")  that
             covered the period 21.5.2010  to  11.3.2011.   The  respondent
             applied to  HMRC  for  verification  that  SBS  was  genuinely
             trading.  On 11 December  2012  an  H.E.O.  employed  by  HMRC
             confirmed that SBS along with 16 other  named  businesses  had
             not demonstrated that  they  participated  in  any  legitimate
             trade.


         6.   On being questioned by  me,  the  appellant  stated  that  SBS
             employed him as a marketing consultant.  The nature  of  SBS's
             business was to provide services such as new business  set-up;
             computer  networking;  provision  of  furniture  etc.   Before
             working at SBS he was  a  Manager  at  Domino's  Pizza  and  a
             warehouse operative at Ocado and he was undertaking both those
             jobs when he made his application.  He told me was employed by
             SBS as it office in Luton and that SBS occupied 3 rooms  above
             a parade of shops and working there was a  Manager,  assistant
             Manager, the appellant, 3  other  staff  and  other  marketing
             guys.  The appellant had never been to SBS's  Slough  address.
             A letter purporting to be from SBS at  an  address  in  Slough
             dated 25.3.2011 stated that the appellant  was  employed  part
             time from 15.5.2010 to 15.3.2011 gross wage being ï¿½39,810  and
             that he was paid net, in cash.


         7.   The appellant submitted P45 from SBS.  It is undated by SBS in
             section 13 and I cannot therefore accept it as  a  valid  P45.
             Given that SBS's reputation is at stake it is a  little  short
             of incredible that the appellant has not provided from SBS any
             evidence  whatsoever  to  counter  HMRC's   allegation.    The
             evidence one would have  like  to  see  would  have  been  tax
             returns by SBS, or audited accounts, accountant's confirmation
             etc.  No such evidence has been forthcoming.  In  the  absence
             of that I do not find it has been established that  SBS  is  a
             genuine business that is genuinely  trading,  had  a  turnover
             sufficient to support payment of salary for all staff  members
             or that payslips and P45 issued are genuine.


         8.   The appellant has not made out  his  case.   The  respondent's
             decision was in accordance with the law and the Rules."

4.   The grounds on which permission  was  granted  argued  that  the  judge
    failed to identify and apply the correct burden and standard  of  proof
    in relation to paragraph 332(1A) and to consider  the  requirement  for
    the respondent to establish that the appellant had  acted  dishonestly.
    The judge granting permission said this is arguable and is material  in
    that it is not apparent from the determination whether the judge  found
    that the application  was  subject  to  mandatory  refusal  under  that
    paragraph or failed only under paragraph 245C.   It  is  also  arguable
    that the judge failed entirely to address the  appellant's  case  under
    Article 8 and her failure to consider it was a material error.

5.   Mr Kirk submitted the appellant's written submissions, which he  relied
    on.

6.   Mr Kirk argued that the judge made two  material  errors  of  law;  the
    first is that the judge misdirected himself as to the burden of  proof.
    The Secretary of State had the burden of proving that the  document  in
    question was dishonest or fraudulent.   The  judge  did  not  determine
    whether the document was  dishonest.   She  simply  took  note  of  the
    respondent's allegation that the document was false  and  proceeded  to
    require the appellant to disprove it.   In  taking  that  approach  the
    judge fell into error in three  ways,  firstly,  the  judge  failed  to
    determine whether the documents were honest; secondly,  she  failed  to
    consider whether the burden of proof which was on a higher spectrum  of
    the balance of probabilities had been met, and thirdly, by  taking  the
    approach that the burden had shifted on the appellant.

7.   Mr Kirk submitted that the second material error  was  that  the  judge
    failed to consider Article 8.  The appellant  has  lived,  studied  and
    worked in the UK since 2003, almost a period of ten years.  Due to  his
    length of time he has established a strong private life in the UK.  His
    removal would constitute  interference  sufficiently  serious  for  the
    purposes  of  Article  8  and  it  would  be  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim pursued by the respondent.

8.   Mr Tarlow relied on the Rule 24 response submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent.  He accepted that paragraph 7 of the determination did  not
    mention paragraph 322(1A) or 245C but  there  was  an  inference  which
    could be read into it.  The inference was that on the evidence provided
    by the  Secretary  of  State,  that  is,  the  communication  from  Her
    Majesty's Revenue and Customs, another government department,  the  SBS
    was not a legitimate business.  Given that the reputation of SBS was at
    stake, and there was no information  from  the  company  regarding  its
    trading and paid employees, the judge came to  the  correct  conclusion
    that the evidence submitted by the Secretary of State was sufficient to
    discharge the burden of proof on her.

9.   Mr Tarlow accepted that dishonesty can be made on behalf of a  company.
     The burden of proof on the Secretary of State had been  discharged  in
    light of the documentation from HRMC.

10.  Mr Tarlow conceded that the judge made a material error of law  by  not
    considering the appellant's Article 8 appeal.   He  conceded  that  the
    appellant has been in the UK for a period of almost ten years  studying
    and working the permitted number  of  hours.   However,  his  right  to
    remain in the UK was not  unlimited.   Consequently  it  would  not  be
    disproportionate to remove him to Pakistan.

11.  The respondent's Rule 24 reply stated as follows:

         "3.  HMRC confirmed that  the  SBS  could  not  be  shown  to  have
             participated  in  any  legitimate  trade.   This  is  reliable
             evidence produced by an organisation who deals with tax issues
             on a daily basis and would have a record of tax  returns,  VAT
             payments, etc.  The fact that a search carried out by  one  of
             its employees did not produce evidence of a legitimate company
             trading under the name SBS  is  sufficient  to  discharge  the
             burden on the SSHD to show  that  SBS  was  not  a  legitimate
             trader.


         4.   It can be inferred from the finding at paragraph  7  that  the
             First-tier Judge was dismissing the appeal both in respect  of
             322(1A) and 245C.  The FtTJ found that the SBS company was not
             trading or a genuine business.  Therefore they were not  in  a
             position to pay wages or produce payslips or P45s.   The  FtTJ
             quite rightly found that there was no evidence  to  show  that
             the company was in fact trading as none was  provided  by  the
             appellant.   This  evidence  could  quite  easily  have   been
             provided by the appellant if he was genuinely working for  the
             company."

12.  I agree entirely with the Rule 24  response.   The  reputation  of  the
    company was at stake and the appellant had not  provided  any  evidence
    from the company to rebut the evidence from HMRC.

13.  I find that it can be inferred from the judge's findings that  she  was
    making a decision in respect of both paragraphs 322(1A) and  245C.   In
    light of the evidence from HMRC, I find that the judge did not make  an
    error of law.  Her decision shall stand.

14.  In respect of the appellant's appeal under Article 8  of  the  ECHR,  I
    find that the judge made a  material  error  by  not  determining  this
    appeal.  The appellant's Article 8 appeal relies only  on  the  private
    life he has established  in  the  UK.   Mr  Tarlow  accepted  that  the
    appellant has been in the UK for a period of almost ten  years  living,
    studying and working the permitted number of hours.  He has established
    a  private  life  as  a  consequence.   His  removal  would  constitute
    interference sufficiently serious to engage Article 8.  I find  however
    that the removal would not be disproportionate to the legitimate aim of
    maintaining immigration control.  His  private  life  is  tarnished  by
    either his own dishonesty or the dishonesty  on  the  part  of  SBS  in
    submitting false documents to support an application for further  leave
    to remain in the UK.  The qualifications the appellant has obtained  as
    a result of his studies in the UK should help him find a job and settle
    back to life in his own country.



15.  The appellant's appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR is also dismissed.
