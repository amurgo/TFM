                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge D Dickinson, promulgated on 17th April 2014, following a  hearing
    at  Nottingham  Magistrates'  Court  on  21st  March  2014.    In   the
    determination, the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  of  Muhammad  Waseem
    Shahid.  The Appellant  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  18th
    January 1984.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent Entry
    Clearance Officer dated 9th July  2013,  refusing  his  application  to
    visit the UK on a family visit under paragraph 41 of HC 395.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is a businessman with a  total  income
    of �608 per month, and he had bank deposits to show this.  He wished to
    come to the UK on a family visit to meet his real  brother,  Mr  Masood
    Hussain, following which he will return back to Pakistan to resume  his
    business.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to the Entry Clearance Officer's  refusal  of  9th
    July 2013, as well as the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's  review  on  5th
    January 2014  and  noted  that  the  Appellant  had  claimed  to  be  a
    businessman, which business could properly be demonstrated  by  way  of
    documentary proofs.   However,  it  was  not  clear  that  this  was  a
    successful business and the bank statements did  not  properly  reflect
    for certain, on the balance of probabilities test, his  claimed  income
    of �600 per month.  This was because there were deposits  in  his  bank
    account over the past six months totalling �9,452  which  simply  could
    not be explained.  As far as the Appellant's family circumstances  were
    concerned, the judge held that the Appellant  did  provide  documentary
    evidence that showed that he had a family in Pakistan,  which  included
    his wife and child born on 25th December 2012 (see para 13).  Given the
    lack  of  evidence  with  respect  to  the  Appellant's  running  of  a
    successful business, the judge was not satisfied that the Appellant had
    every intention and every incentive to return back to Pakistan  at  the
    end of his visit (para 14).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state  that  the  judge  had  erred  in  his
    judgment that the Appellant  had  not  given  a  true  account  of  his
    situation in Pakistan and that he had failed to establish on a  balance
    of probabilities that he would return back to Pakistan at  the  end  of
    his visit in the UK.  The ECO himself  had  taken  no  issue  with  the
    Appellant having a business.  There was, moreover, a significant bundle
    of documentary evidence submitted.

 6. On 11th July 2014 permission to appeal was granted on  the  basis  that
    the judge may well have failed to provide adequate  reasoning  and  had
    failed to give due regard to the Appellant's good immigration  history.



 7. On 22nd July 2014 a Rule 24 response  was  entered  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent supporting the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing before me on 11th September 2014,  there  was  a  letter
    faxed at 12.19am on 11th September 2014 requesting  an  adjournment  in
    terms that,

         "I want to submit some new evidence regarding my appeal, which  was
         not before the FTT and is available now,  and  would  be  available
         after a few days, which is deeply related  and  concerned  with  my
         appeal matter.  Now I am extremely requested that my hearing should
         be adjourned for a few days in the interests of justice ..."

    Mr Mills, appearing  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  objected  to  the
    adjournment.  He submitted that it was over a year  since  the  refusal
    decision had been made and six months since IJ Dickinson had given  his
    determination on 6th April 2014 and there had been ample time to submit
    new evidence.  Also, it was far from clear what this new evidence  was.



 9. Having considered the issue, I have decided to refuse the  request  for
    an adjournment.  The application does not state what the  new  evidence
    is.  It is not clear what is meant by "after a few days."  It is in any
    event highly unlikely that evidence, which was not  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, and not before the Entry Clearance Officer,  could
    properly be submitted before an Upper Tribunal Judge, with  a  view  to
    impugning the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   All
    things considered, the application for an adjournment is refused.

10. Subject to this, the hearing proceeded, and Mr Mills, on behalf of  the
    Respondent, submitted that the determination could  not  be  challenged
    because, even if the judge had found that there was a business, he  was
    still entitled to look into the question of whether it was a successful
    business that was being run, with a view  to  determining  whether  the
    Appellant had the intention of just making a  genuine  visit  and  then
    returning back to Pakistan, or staying in the UK.  The judge considered
    this question in a systematic way at paragraph 12.   He  accepted  that
    the Appellant had a wife and child in Pakistan.  He did not accept that
    the business statements were accurate in the  light  of  the  past  six
    months' deposits in the bank totalling �9,452.  Second,  the  Appellant
    had opted for a "paper hearing" and had to  take  the  consequences  of
    this.  If a negative view was taken by the judge of the  documentation,
    it was only because the Appellant did not have anyone representing  him
    to explain the documentation, and unless it could be  shown  that  that
    view was grossly unreasonable, the judge was entitled to come  to  that
    view.

No Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA [2007]) such that I should set aside this decision.  The judge was
    entitled to come to the decision that he did.  He was entitled to  take
    into account the fact that deposits over the last six months  totalling
    �9,452 had been made into the  Appellant's  bank  account,  which  were
    totally out of harmony with the  claimed  income  of  �608  per  month,
    thereby raising a question mark whether these monies were really coming
    from his business, or had  been  deliberately  deposited  in  order  to
    massage the account with a view to showing that  he  would  have  every
    reason to return back to a  business  that  he  claimed  was  a  viable
    business.  The judge did not believe that.  He was entitled to conclude
    (at para 14) that "the  Appellant  has  failed  to  provide  sufficient
    evidence of his financial  and  economic  circumstances  in  Pakistan."



Decision

12. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

13. No anonymity order is made.
