Representation
For the Appellant:      Ms.  P.  Solanki  of  Counsel  instructed  by  Garth
                       Coates.
For the  Respondent:             Mr.  S.  Kandola,  Home  Office  Presenting
                            Officer.


                   DETERMINATION AND REASONS: ERROR OF LAW


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Obhi promulgated on 5 February 2014, dismissing the Appellant's appeal
      against the Respondent's decision dated 2 October 2013  to  refuse  to
      vary leave to remain in the UK for the Appellant to establish  himself
      in  business  under  the  Turkey  -  European  Community   Association
      Agreement, and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47 of the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


Background

   2. The Appellant is a national of Turkey born on 15  November  1985.  His
      immigration  history  is  summarised  in  the  cover  sheet   to   the
      Respondent's bundle  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  also  at
      paragraph 1 of the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge:  it
      is unnecessary to repeat it here. On 19 July 2013 the  Appellant  made
      an application for leave to remain in order to  establish  himself  in
      business under the Turkey - European Community  Association  Agreement
      on the basis of his proposed business providing IT services.


   3. The Appellant's application was refused  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
      'reasons for refusal' letter dated 2 October 2013,  and  a  Notice  of
      Immigration Decision was issued accordingly bearing the same date  and
      served on 4 October 2013.


   4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC. His appeal was dealt with  'on  the
      papers' - i.e.  without  a  hearing.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  reasons  set  out   in   her
      determination.


   5. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was initially  refused
      by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Reed  on  28   February   2014,   but
      subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun on 16 April 2014.


   6. The Respondent has  filed  a  Rule  24  response  dated  10  May  2014
      resisting the appeal. The Appellant in turn has filed a Rule 25  reply
      dated 19 May 2014.


Error of Law

   7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was
      suitably qualified and had the ability to provide the  services  which
      he had outlined in his business plan in support  of  his  application:
      however,  the  Judge  was  "concerned"  that  the  business  plan  was
      unrealistic. The Judge indicated her concerns in respect of  projected
      income, and the provision for the payment of living expenses.


   8. In this latter regard Mr Kandola in due course accepted that the Judge
      appeared to have proceeded on the basis of a factual misconception. Ms
      Solanki highlighted  the  cash  flow  forecast  contained  within  the
      business plan as including a monthly figure of ï¿½1200 under the heading
      'Drawings'. She explained that this was a reference to the drawing  of
      funds from the business to meet the personal living  expenses  of  the
      Appellant.


   9. It is perhaps understandable in circumstances where this was an appeal
      dealt with 'on the papers' that the  Judge  had  not  appreciated  the
      meaning of  this  particular  item.  Nonetheless,  where  there  is  a
      fundamental misconception of fact - even without  blame  attaching  to
      the decision-maker - it is capable of amounting to an error of law.


  10. The Judge plainly placed particular reliance upon the apparent lack of
      "provision for the payment of [the appellant's] living expenses,  such
      as the rent that he will pay, and the basic amount  is  that  he  will
      have to withdraw from  the  business  in  order  to  sustain  himself"
      (paragraph 13), because she went on  to  state  "To  that  extent  the
      business plan is unrealistic. It may be said that the  appellant  will
      rely on his savings to feed, clothe and accommodate  himself,  but  if
      that is the case, then the amounts to be used from his savings  should
      be clearly stated within the business plan" (also  paragraph  13).  As
      now identified, the amounts that the Appellant proposed to use  -  not
      from his savings, but from the monies generated by his business - were
      stated within the business plan and budgeted accordingly.


  11. In such circumstances I am satisfied that the  misconception  of  fact
      amounted to an error of law.


  12. As regards the  Judge's  'concerns'  over  the  Appellant's  projected
      income, I find that the determination is unclear as  to  exactly  what
      evidence the Judge had taken into account, or how she  has  reconciled
      the available evidence with her conclusions. The Judge identifies  the
      specification of hourly and daily rates provided by the Appellant, but
      states "there is inadequate information in the business plan as to how
      he will generate the fees" (paragraph 13); see similarly at  paragraph
      14 - "There is not a proper assessment contained within  the  business
      plan of how much he can realistically  earn  from  the  business",  to
      which the Judge adds  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  the  research
      undertaken as to the rate of remuneration for the work proposed.


  13. There is no apparent dispute as to what the Appellant was proposing to
      do by way of business, and further the Judge accepted his  ability  to
      provide the proposed IT services. The Appellant in his  business  plan
      under the heading 'Market Research' outlined his view as to  the  need
      for such services, which  he  cross-referenced  to  source  documents.
      Moreover, in the Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal  at
      pages 108-135 the Appellant included evidence of: the demand for staff
      in IT and computing; the demand for persons working in  technology  in
      particular in the London region; programmers and software  development
      professionals  being  included  on  the  Respondent  Tier  2  Shortage
      Occupation list; and examples of hourly rates and salaries of  persons
      working in the software/technology sector. Whilst on the  face  of  it
      some of this evidence does not appear to correlate  exactly  with  the
      type of services the Appellant was proposing to supply,  there  is  an
      absence of any proper consideration by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      of this supporting evidence, or any attempt to reconcile it  with  her
      adversely  determinative  assessment  of  the  Appellant's   projected
      income.


  14. In all such circumstances I consider that the  misconception  of  fact
      referred to above, together with the absence of reasons in respect  of
      the supporting evidence, is such that the determination of the  First-
      tier Tribunal requires to be set aside for error of law.


Re-making the Decision

  15. I initially considered  that  it  would  be  possible  to  remake  the
      decision in the appeal without remitting to the  First-tier  Tribunal,
      notwithstanding that the  Appellant  had  not  hitherto  had  an  oral
      hearing of his appeal. However, upon  embarking  on  hearing  evidence
      from the Appellant  it  very  quickly  became  apparent  that  he  was
      struggling to explain in English some of  the  technicalities  of  his
      business. In circumstances where it was therefore necessary to adjourn
      the appeal for the provision of an interpreter, and again  bearing  in
      mind that there has not hitherto been an oral hearing of  the  appeal,
      and with the agreement of both representatives, I determined that  the
      appeal should be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
      hearing with all issues at large.


  16. It is unnecessary to make any  particular  Directions  save  that  the
      Appellant's bundle should be re-served on the Respondent,  Mr  Kandola
      informing  me  that  there  did  not  appear  to  be  a  copy  on  the
      Respondent's file.



Decision

  17. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  contained  material
      errors of law and is set aside.


  18. The decision in the appeal is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal by any First-tier Tribunal Judge except  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Obhi.
