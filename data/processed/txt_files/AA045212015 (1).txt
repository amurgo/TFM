For the Respondent:           Ms Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a female national of  Libya  born  in  1988.  She  has
    permission[1] to appeal  against  a  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge G.D Tobin)[2] to dismiss her appeal against  a  refusal
    to vary her leave to enter and to remove her from the  United  Kingdom,
    that decision following the rejection of her asylum  and  human  rights
    claim.




    Background to Appeal

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on the  3rd  November  2013
    and was given leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant. She
    claimed asylum on the 25th September 2014.


 3. The basis of her claim was that she was facing forced marriage to a  55
    year-old militia leader.   When she had returned home on  a  visit  her
    family had informed her that he was to be her  husband.  The  Appellant
    explained that her family had been Gaddafi supporters  and  that  after
    the revolution they were in a weakened  position.  This  man  was  from
    another branch of their tribe  which  was  pro-revolution  and  he  had
    helped them, giving them protection and money. The  Appellant's  family
    were therefore beholden to him and  when  he  asked  for  her  hand  in
    marriage they felt that they had to agree.   She did not want to  marry
    him and in fact was in a relationship with a different man in  the  UK.
    The militia leader in Libya had found out about this and had threatened
    the Appellant's family in Libya. He had fired shots at their  home  and
    demanded his money back.  The Appellant is now afraid of him, but  also
    her brothers who regard her as having besmirched their  'honour'.  They
    are Berbers and the Appellant's  partner  in  the  UK  is  Arab.  Their
    relationship will not therefore be accepted.

 4. The Respondent refused the claim in a letter dated 3rd March  2015.  It
    was accepted that 'honour' killings do take place in Libya. It was  not
    however accepted that the  Appellant  was  reasonably  likely  to  fall
    victim to one. That was because she had given a discrepant account  and
    the Respondent did not believe that she was facing forced marriage,  or
    that she had brought any 'dishonour' upon her family by refusing such a
    union. She had for instance given inconsistent  dates  about  when  the
    engagement party had taken place and her claim  that  her  family  were
    poor and disadvantaged was inconsistent with the fact that  she  was  a
    5th year medical student who had the funds to travel to the UK for post-
    graduate study.  It  was  also  accepted,  in  line  with  the  country
    guidance case of AT and Others (Article 15 (c); risk categories)  Libya
    CG [2014] UKUT 00318 (IAC), that high  ranking  and  prominent  Gaddafi
    supporters may be at risk of persecution in Libya  today.  It  was  not
    however accepted that the Appellant would be at risk for  that  reason.
    On her own evidence her father who had been a  soldier  in  the  Libyan
    army had died a number of years ago. There was  no  reason  to  believe
    that she would be identified as a high ranking Gaddafi supporter.


 5. When the appeal came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellant
    maintained her account. She averred that  she  would  not  be  able  to
    return to her family in Tripoli because her brothers and/or the militia
    man would attack her. She could not avail herself  of  internal  flight
    because it would be dangerous for a  woman  trying  to  live  alone  in
    Libya.  The Appellant maintained that she was in a relationship in  the
    UK, and called her partner to give evidence.   That  gentleman,  Mr  B,
    produced evidence to confirm that he has been suffering from cancer and
    stated that he was dependent  upon  the  Appellant  for  her  help  and
    support.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal did not believe that the  Appellant  was  in  a
    relationship in  the  UK.  Having  heard  the  oral  evidence  of  both
    witnesses the Tribunal was "not convinced" that they were in a  genuine
    long-lasting relationship [ï¿½ 34].  The first reason  given  is  that  a
    letter from a Macmillan Haematology Nurse dated 3rd December 2013  made
    no mention of their "blossoming relationship";  secondly  the  Tribunal
    "did not believe" that she would have told no-one in her  family  about
    the relationship  prior  to  her  betrothal  in  Libya;  finally  their
    evidence "lacked detail" and was "vague and unconvincing".  It was  not
    accepted that the Appellant would be at risk  of  honour  killing.  The
    Tribunal "did not believe" that the level of public disgrace  was  such
    that she would be at risk. She had described being  subject  to  social
    approbation during her last visit but not receiving a "good welcome" is
    not persecution.   The Tribunal rejected the Appellant's claims  to  be
    from a "poor" family since she was a medical student who  could  afford
    to study abroad.



    Error of Law

 7. The grounds of appeal are not particularly helpful. It  appears  to  be
    argued  for  instance  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in   its
    conclusions because 'honour' killings do happen in Libya.   That  these
    murders do occur was not in issue and was of course expressly  accepted
    by the Tribunal.


 8. I am nevertheless satisfied that this decision must be  set  aside  for
    the following errors of law:

           a) Failure to take material evidence into account/giving  weight
              to immaterial factors


              The Tribunal does not accept  that  the  Appellant  is  in  a
              relationship in the  UK.  The  main  reason  given  for  this
              finding is, with respect, slightly  illogical.  The  Tribunal
              cites a letter from a doctor who  was  treating  her  claimed
              partner for  cancer.  It  is  dated  December  2013  and  the
              Tribunal draws adverse  inference  from  the  fact  that  the
              doctor does not refer to him having a partner. It  was  their
              evidence that although they were then sharing  a  house  they
              did not form a  relationship  until  January  2014.  Why  the
              doctor should mention his flatmate is not clear. The  greater
              error is the fact that there were  at  least  two  subsequent
              letters from doctors who are treating this gentleman which do
              refer to the fact that  he  is  receiving  support  from  his
              partner in the UK.  These letters were written doctor - to  -
              doctor and had not been generated  for  the  purpose  of  the
              appeal. Absent sophisticated and cynical 'evidence  planting'
              by this man they were documents which were capable of lending
              significant weight to the claimed relationship.




           b) Findings not based on the evidence


              At paragraph 31  the  Tribunal  finds  that  the  Appellant's
              rejection  of  the  militia  would  not  raise  questions  of
              'honour'. The reason given  is  that  this  was  not  a  love
              marriage. The Tribunal  appears  to  find  that  the  militia
              leader was not interested in marrying her for love, and  that
              he would not therefore mind that she  had  broken  off  their
              engagement.  There was no evidential basis for this analysis.
              There is nothing to suggest that 'honour' based violence only
              occurs where  love  is  unrequited.  On  the  contrary,  most
              'honour' based violence occurs in  cultures  where  marriages
              are arranged on the basis of social or economic  grounds,  as
              here.

           c) Failure to give reasons

              The Tribunal rejects the Appellant's evidence  that  she  had
              not told any of her family about her relationship in the  UK.
              She had gone  back  to  Libya  twice  in  2014  and  had  not
              mentioned him,  even  to  a  "close  female  relative".   The
              Tribunal does not believe this evidence. No reasons are given
              for this finding.  I, like the Appellant, have  struggled  to
              understand what the reason might be.   This is a woman from a
              conservative culture where marriages arranged  by  family  is
              the norm, and where, it is accepted, 'honour' based  violence
              occurs.  On her evidence her Berber  family  would  not  have
              stood for her marrying an Arab man.  It seems to me  that  in
              those circumstances the last thing she would do would  be  to
              go back to Libya on holiday and tell  her  sister/aunt/mother
              that she is having  a  relationship  outside  the  bounds  of
              marriage with an Arab man.

 9. Ms Johnstone was quite right to point to the sustainable arguments made
    in the determination, and the fact that there are arguably a number  of
    discrepancies in the Appellant's evidence. It may well be that  in  the
    final analysis she does not discharge  the  burden  of  proof.  She  is
    however entitled to a disposal of her appeal in which the reasons given
    are rational, based on the evidence and readily understandable to  her.
     At the heart of this appeal is the claimed relationship in the UK  and
    in order to make findings on this matter, the Tribunal  would  need  to
    hear evidence from both parties. I have therefore decided, in  view  of
    the extent of fact finding required, to remit this matter to the First-
    tier Tribunal for rehearing.







Decisions

10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.


11. The decision is to be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.

12. Having regard to the nature  of  the  evidence  I  make  the  following
    direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of
    2013: Anonymity Orders.


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings".
