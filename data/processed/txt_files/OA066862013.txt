                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Ms G Patel
For the appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Hedieh Hazegh Nikroo, date of birth 26.5.85, is a citizen
    of Iran.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Malik, who allowed the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent, dated  31.1.13  to  refuse  her
    application for clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  to  settle  as  the
    partner of Bardia Hazeeh, a British citizen.

 3. The Judge heard the appeal on 6.2.14.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    10.3.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 11.6.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Malik should be set aside.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Plumptre  found  it  arguable,
    "that the judge erred in her approach  to  "post  decision  facts"  and
    further erred in law in that she made no reference to the provisions of
    Appendix FM-SE and hence  the  failure  of  the  applicant  to  provide
    relevant evidence of her sponsor husband's income from two jobs for the
    periods required at the time of her application."

 8. I have carefully considered and taken account of Ms Patel's submissions
    in her Rule 24 reply, as amplified in her oral submissions.

 9. The  application  for  settlement  fell  to  be  considered  under  the
    provisions of section EC-P of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. The
    claimant's sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements of E-
    ECP 3.1.

10. The application was refused on the grounds that the claimant has failed
    to provide the specified  evidence  of  employment  as  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE. Although FM-SE was not specifically referred to in  the
    refusal decision, its application is mandatory.

11. At �9 and �10 of the decision, Judge Malik  dealt  with  the  financial
    requirements. She was satisfied that the sponsor was  employed  in  two
    jobs at the date of the decision of the Secretary of State.  The  judge
    also calculated that on the evidence his annual income would amount  to
    �20,640.36, in excess of the threshold income required under the Rules.
    The judge was satisfied that the requirements of the Rules  in  regards
    to the financial requirements were met.

12. However, Judge Malik made no reference to Appendix  FM-SE,  which  sets
    out "the specified evidence applicants need  to  provide  to  meet  the
    requirements of rules contained in Appendix FM.  The  Tribunal  has  no
    discretion to dispense with the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    and even though not specifically  referenced  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, for which there was good reason as set out below, the Tribunal
    must apply those rules when considering an appeal.

13.  Effectively,  Judge  Malik  was  making  her  own  assessment  of  the
    prospective income of the sponsor  rather  than,  as  required  by  the
    Rules, a historical assessment of the sponsor's income at the  date  of
    the application.

14. It is clear from the application form that the claimant  asserted  that
    he had been employed since 2011.  That  turned  out  not  to  be  true.
    However, on that basis the Entry Clearance  Officer  expected  to  see,
    amongst other documents, 6  months  monthly  salary  slips.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer was  not  to  know,  because  the  claimant  had  not
    disclosed it, that whilst he had two different employments he  had  not
    had either job for at least 6 months. Also there were no P60  documents
    or letters from the employer.

15. Considering the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the Entry  Clearance
    Manager noted that on the basis of documents  not  submitted  with  the
    application but with the notice of appeal, the sponsor was now claiming
    to have been employed with Artics since  November  2012  and  was  thus
    unable at that date of application to submit 6 monthly wage  slips.  In
    respect of his employment with Pizzeria, he also had less than 6 months
    employment, starting only in June 2012, and thus  was  also  unable  to
    provide 6 monthly wage slips for  that  employment.  There  were  still
    missing documents.

16. Paragraph 13(b) of Appendix FM-SE provides for the situation where  the
    person has been in salaried employment for less than 6  months  at  the
    date of application. In those circumstances the gross annual income for
    the purpose of E-ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM will be the total of the  gross
    annual salary from employment as it was  at  the  date  of  application
    (together with non-earned income and pension income, neither  of  which
    applies to the sponsor). E-ECP 3.1 requires the application to  provide
    specified evidence of a "specified gross annual income of at least" and
    relevant figure in this case is �18,600. It  is  clear  that  Paragraph
    13(b) defines what is to be regarded  as  the  sponsor's  gross  annual
    income.  Ms  Johnstone  referred  me  to  the  salary  slips  for  both
    employments nearest to the date of application which set out the  total
    income to date. Taken together, the gross annual income for the purpose
    of E-ECP 3.1 in this case is approximately �5,569,  woefully  short  of
    the necessary �18,600.

17. Paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE also provides that in order to  evidence
    the level of gross annual income required by Appendix  FM,  the  person
    must meet the requirements in paragraph 13(b) and the  threshold  level
    of income must also be met by the total income from salaried employment
    earned in the 12 months prior to the date of application (together with
    non-employment income and pensions).

18. Whilst I accept in principle Ms Patel's argument that, as  this  is  an
    out of country appeal,  the  Tribunal  can  take  account  of  evidence
    appertaining to the date of decision,  that  does  not  assist  as  the
    Immigration  Rules  provide  very  clearly  that   in   the   sponsor's
    circumstances the income must be as calculated above, i.e. at the  date
    of application. I  do  not  accept  her  submission  that  there  is  a
    contradiction in the Rules or the law. The Rules are very clear and  it
    is abundantly clear that  the  claimant's  application  was  doomed  to
    failure from  the  outset;  on  the  evidence  the  sponsor  could  not
    demonstrate the necessary level of gross annual income required by  the
    Immigration Rules.

19. I also reject Ms Patel's argument  that  because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer didn't mention Appendix FM-SE the judge was entitled to  ignore
    those provisions. I have set out above why the Entry Clearance  Officer
    would not have mentioned the provisions of paragraphs 13 and 15, as the
    application form suggested that the sponsor  had  been  employed  since
    2011.

20. I  have  not  dealt  with  the  absent  documentation,  such  as  P60s,
    contracts, and employer's letters, that were also required as  evidence
    under Appendix FM-SE, as it is clear the claimant and the sponsor could
    not meet the primary financial threshold on the available evidence.  In
    the circumstances,  the  appeal  should  have  been  dismissed  on  the
    Immigration Rules at the First-tier Tribunal and thus there were errors
    of law requiring the decision to be set aside.

21. I heard  further  submissions  from  both  representatives  as  to  the
    remaking of the decision in the appeal.

22. I am satisfied for the reasons set out above that the  claimant  cannot
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.

23. In reaching that conclusion I also  note  the  handwritten  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal where the claimant accepts  that  she
    did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  but  pleaded
    that, "the paperwork demonstrates that I am (my husband)  on  track  to
    provide for my family." If the claimant and the sponsor feel  that  the
    current income may be sufficient to meet the threshold,  and  they  can
    marshal the specified evidence, it is open to the claimant  to  make  a
    fresh application. By the Rules in force Judge Malik was  in  error  to
    consider what the sponsor's income was likely to be in  the  future  or
    even at the date of the appeal hearing.

24. In relation to article 8 ECHR, it is obvious that Judge Malik  did  not
    consider it necessary or appropriate to consider article 8 private  and
    family life, as she allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

25. Summarised, the current case law in relation to article 8  private  and
    family life is to the effect that the Immigration Rules are a  complete
    code and there is no need to look outside the Rules  unless  there  are
    arguably good grounds  for  consideration  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances not adequately recognised in the Rules, which render  the
    decision of the Secretary of State unjustifiably harsh. I set out below
    a summary of some of the recent case law.

26. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be the same. MF (Nigeria) was  followed
    in Kabia (MF: para 398 - "exceptional circumstances") 2013  UKUT  00569
    (IAC).

27. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has set out, inter  alia,  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

         (a)     the  maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2   stand,
             although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary
             of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said
             that they could constitute an unjustified and disproportionate
             interference with the ability of spouses to live together;  he
             suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,
             and highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage
             earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;

         (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if  there
             may be arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
             outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to  go  on
             to consider whether there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the application  of)
             Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC
             720 (Admin);

         (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in  provisions  such  as
             Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are  impossible  to
             surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393
             (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC);
             they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the
             absence of such insurmountable obstacles, it is  necessary  to
             show other non-standard and particular features  demonstrating
             that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

28. It is illustrative that in Gulshan the Upper Tribunal  considered  that
    it was not unduly harsh for a husband who originated from Pakistan  but
    was now a British national, to return to Pakistan with his wife who was
    seeking leave to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that  the
    couple would suffer some hardship, as he had been in the UK since 2002,
    he had worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and
    other state benefits,  some  of  which  could  not  be  transferred  to
    Pakistan.

29. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in
             her decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR
             does not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so  on
             the basis of the materials before it.

          (ii)   "Maintenance of effective immigration control"  whilst  not
             as such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR  can
             normally be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of
             disorder or crime" or an aspect of "economic well-being of the
             country" or both.

           (iii)    "[P]revention  of  disorder  or  crime"  is  normally  a
             legitimate aim both in expulsion cases where  there  has  been
             criminal conduct on the part of the claimant and in  expulsion
             cases where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)    MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
             immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign  criminal
             are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the   express
             requirement in  them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
             exceptional circumstances and other factors.

          (v)   It follows from this that any other rule which has a similar
             provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi)    Where an area of the rules does not have such  an  express
             mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
             particular) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
             approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after
             applying the requirements of the rules, only if there  may  be
             arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside
             them is it necessary for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
             consider  whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not
             sufficiently recognised under them.

30. At �6 of Ms Patel's Rule 24 response it is submitted that the  decision
    to refuse entry has effectively resulted in  a  British  citizen  child
    being denied entry to the UK with  his  mother  and  that  any  further
    application necessary will result in yet further delay  and  separation
    between the child and the sponsoring father. It is further pleaded that
    the sponsor and the claimant abided by the Immigration Rules in sending
    the claimants back to Iran in order to make application from there as a
    spouse, when she had previously been in the UK as a family visitor.

31. Ms Patel elaborated on those  submissions  at  the  hearing  before  me
    asserting that there was a breach of article 8 in the refusal decision.
    She also submitted that because EX1 does not apply to  out  of  country
    applications there was no proportionality assessment within the Rules.

32. I am asked and do take into account the best  interests  of  a  British
    citizen child as a primary consideration. However, there is  no  reason
    why a British citizen child cannot come  to  the  UK  to  be  with  the
    father. It may be practically difficult to arrange care for  the  child
    but that is a matter for the parents to resolve. The  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State does not prevent the child's entry. Neither does  it
    prevent the sponsor from going to visit or stay with the  claimants  in
    Iran or elsewhere; such as Cyprus where they previously lived.  I  have
    to take into account that  the  Rules  are  the  Secretary  of  State's
    response to private and family life rights, as well as  section  55  in
    relation to the best interests of a child. I also  have  to  take  into
    account that the claimant has failed to demonstrate that she meets  the
    requirements of the Rules and that is a significant factor.

33. One may have sympathy  for  the  circumstances  of  the  claimants  and
    recognise their justified desire to be reunited as a  family  with  the
    sponsor and their frustration and sadness at not being able to do so as
    soon as they hoped. However, there is no right for the family to settle
    in the UK just because that is their desire. Like all other  applicants
    they must not only meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  but
    provide the specified evidence required by the Rules.

34. I  take  into  account  that  there  may  be  a  delay  whilst  another
    application is made. However, there remains a route for entry,  one  in
    respect of which the claimant and the sponsor now assert they can  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules. For  that  reason  alone  it
    would be difficult to conclude that requiring the claimant to meet  the
    Immigration Rules by a fresh application is unjustifiably harsh.

35. Taking everything urged upon me into account I find that on  the  facts
    of this case the circumstances of the claimant and  her  family  cannot
    properly be  described  as  compelling  and  insufficiently  recognised
    within the Rules so as to justify allowing the application outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR private and/or  family
    life because the result is unjustifiably harsh.

36. In the circumstances, I also dismiss the appeal under article 8 ECHR.

37. The claimant's application was also refused by the Secretary  of  State
    in relation to the English language requirements of E-ECP 4.2. However,
    Judge Malik found on the evidence that this requirement  was  met.  The
    Secretary of State has not appealed that part of the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and it need be considered no further.

Conclusion & Decision:

38. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds, for the reasons set out above.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.










Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
