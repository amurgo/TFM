                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Buckwell sitting at Taylor House on 21  February  2017)
    allowing the  appeal  of  the  claimant,  an  overstayer,  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  to  grant  her  leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a British national, who is  a  pensioner.   The
    Judge found that there would be insurmountable obstacles, as defined in
    EX.2 of Appendix FM, in the  claimant  carrying  on  family  life  with
    husband in Thailand, due to his  medical  condition.    The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that such a direction is warranted for these proceedings in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 2. Lawrence Tarlow of the Specialist Appeals Team pleaded the grounds. The
    Judge had noted, at paragraphs [61]-[62], that the  claimant's  partner
    had complex medical issues and was under the care of  a  consultant  at
    the Royal Free Hospital in London.  The  Judge  had  further  noted  at
    paragraph [62] that there was no information before him as  to  whether
    this treatment was available in Thailand. However, the Judge  had  gone
    on to find at paragraph [66] that it was highly unlikely that the level
    of treatment which might be available in Thailand to the sponsor  could
    be favourably compared with the level of treatment the sponsor received
    in this country:

         It is submitted that this finding, which forms the  basis  for  the
         finding that the [claimant's] partner comes within the exception of
         EX.1, is based on speculation, there being no evidence on the point
         before the First-tier Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 3.  On  21  September  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pickup  granted
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable, as pleaded in the grounds, that at [66]  the  Judge
         improperly speculated that it was highly unlikely that  appropriate
         medical treatment would be available to the  sponsor  in  Thailand,
         the Judge having accepted at  [61]  and  [62]  that  there  was  no
         evidence  whether  specialist  treatment  would  or  would  not  be
         available  to  him  in  Thailand.   This  finding   supported   the
         conclusion that EX.1 was met, and thus  it  is  arguable  that  the
         entire decision is flawed by a material error of law.

Discussion

 4. The evidence before Judge Buckwell included a  witness  statement  from
    the sponsor, Mr Rowland Austin, and a  medical  report  from  Mr  Jason
    Constantinou, a Consultant Vascular Surgeon, dated 17 February 2017.

 5. In his witness statement, Mr Austin, who was born in 1943, said that he
    was retired and that  he  lived  in  a  council-owned  house  with  the
    appellant. Their income was his state  pension  of  ï¿½155.60  per  week.
    Since his wife had lodged her appeal, his health had taken a  turn  for
    the worst.  In spring 2016, he was seen at the Royal Free  Hospital  as
    he had problems with his prostate, and was  found  to  have  a  bladder
    tumour.  In April 2016, he underwent a CT  scan,  which  also  revealed
    several other medical issues  including  concern  over  his  liver  and
    kidneys, as well as an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   He was admitted  to
    hospital on 11 April 2016 to have the tumour cut out and was discharged
    the following day.  While the operation was successful, he continued to
    be monitored by a  Urology  Team  at  Barnet  Hospital.   He  had  been
    referred back to the hospital for an urgent operation  at  the  end  of
    July 2016.  Since then, he  had  undergone  regular  check-ups  at  the
    hospital, and was continued to be monitored on a monthly basis  by  the
    Urology Team to assess his bladder.

 6. He was also under the care of the Vascular Team  at  Barnett  Hospital,
    having been diagnosed with 3 separate aneurysms: and  abdominal  aortic
    aneurysm and 2 iliac  artery  aneurysms.  He  was  first  seen  at  the
    Vascular Surgery Clinic in October 2016, and then  seen  again  at  the
    clinic in January 2017, when he was advised that  he  would  remain  in
    their care to monitor the change in his aneurysms.  He understood  that
    once they reached the size of 5.5cm he would need to undergo surgery to
    repair the blood vessel.  Until they reached this size, he  had  to  be
    regularly reviewed because he could be at risk of them  rupturing.   If
    he experienced any unusual pain he was required to go straight  to  A&E
    because failure to seek immediate medical help if the aneurysms were to
    rupture could be fatal.

 7. In his medical report, Mr Constantinau said that he had first seen  the
    patient in October 2016.  His aortic aneurysm currently measured  47mm,
    and the protocol in the UK was that these were repaired when  they  got
    to 55mm.  On close inspection, the patient's aneurysm was  complex,  as
    it was just below the kidney vessels, and so it would require a complex
    operation.  The patient also had iliac artery aneurysms which were also
    currently just below the treatment threshold.  These would also require
    treatment at the time of the repair of his aortic aneurysm, which would
    add to the complexity of the procedure: "Such cases are only  performed
    at specialist centres around the world, of which the Royal Free  London
    NHS Foundation Trust is one."

 8. The aneurysms  did  not  currently  cause  the  patient  any  symptoms.
    However, they did require "close surveillance".  It was likely that the
    aneurysms would grow and that they would need treatment  "in  the  near
    future".  If they were not monitored closely, he would be  at  risk  of
    rupture "with a significant associated mortality". He had informed  the
    patient that if he were to develop abdominal/back pain, then he  should
    present as an emergency to Accident and Emergency for assessment.

 9. The claimant's bundle of documents for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  also
    contained an information sheet on abdominal aortic  aneurysms  provided
    by the NHS.  The advice of the NHS included the following:

         A ruptured aortic aneurysm  is  a  medical  emergency,  and  it  is
         important to get to hospital as soon as possible.   Around  80%  of
         people with a rupture die before they  reach  hospital  or  do  not
         survive emergency surgery.  This  is  why  the  NHS  AAA  Screening
         Programme was introduced, so dangerously  large  aneurysms  can  be
         treated before they burst.

10. It is apparent from  paragraphs  [61]  and  [62]  of  Judge  Buckwell's
    subsequent decision that not only was the  complexity  of  Mr  Austin's
    medical issues at the forefront of his reflections on  the  application
    of EX.1 to the facts of the case before him, but also the  risk  of  Mr
    Austin requiring urgent specialist  treatment  at  very  short  notice,
    without which he was likely to die.

11. Although the Judge had no specific information one way or the other  as
    to the availability of equivalent expertise or treatment in Thailand, I
    consider that it was open to the Judge to draw the inference that there
    would be an increased risk to the health of the  sponsor  in  Thailand,
    and that he was less likely to survive in Thailand than he was  in  the
    UK, where he could continue to access - for free - care of the  highest
    quality provided by the NHS. He plainly could not afford to be  treated
    privately. As a British national, he was able to access  for  free  the
    best  possible  treatment  and  care  for  his  complex  and  dangerous
    condition at  the  London  Royal  Free  Hospital,  a  world  centre  of
    excellence. Moreover, it was not just the NHS' ability to carry out the
    complex operation which was of crucial importance,  but  also  the  NHS
    being able to provide constant monitoring and  surveillance  beforehand
    to minimise the risk of Mr Austin experiencing a rupture, which, if  he
    did, might well kill him before he could reach the operating table.  In
    short, Mr Austin was at a very delicate stage of his condition - nearly
    but not yet qualifying for a life-prolonging operation  on  the  NHS  -
    such that it would plainly  be  very  unwise  to  disrupt  his  current
    monitoring regime by relocating abroad.  It was open to  the  Judge  to
    infer that whatever  treatment  and  monitoring  would  be  practically
    available to Mr Austin in a developing country such as Thailand, it was
    highly likely to be markedly inferior to that available to Mr Austin in
    the UK , so as to increase significantly the risk to his health.

12. For  the  above  reasons,  I  consider  that  there  was  a  sufficient
    evidential basis for the Judge's finding that the requirements of  EX.1
    were met on medical grounds, and I find that no material error  of  law
    is made out.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.

This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
