                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This the appeal of the Secretary of State against a decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Hussain who following a hearing at Birmingham on  3
    October 2018, in a decision and reasons promulgated on 17 October  2018
    had allowed the appeals  of  a  family  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State refusing them leave to remain under Article 8.   For
    ease of convenience throughout  this  decision  I  will  refer  to  the
    Secretary of State, who was the original respondent, as "the  Secretary
    of State" and to the various members  of  this  family,  who  were  the
    original appellants, as "the claimants".

 2. The claimants are all nationals of Nigeria and comprise of a mother and
    father and their three children.  The first  claimant  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom on a student visa in November 2008, and was followed  by
    the second claimant in 2013.  Their  first  child,  who  is  the  third
    claimant, was born in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2011 and he  is
    therefore now 7 years old although at the time of  the  decision  under
    appeal he  was  not  quite  7.   The  other  two  claimants  were  born
    respectively on 17 September 2013 and 9 May 2016, and  thus  were  (and
    remain) 5 and 2 years old respectively.

 3. The claimants were originally here lawfully but have not had  leave  to
    remain since May 2013.  The first claimant had a medical problem but it
    is not suggested that he is entitled to remain in this country pursuant
    to any Article 3 rights which he may have;   it  is  however  suggested
    that he should be allowed to remain under Article 8.

 4. The claimants, and  in  particular  the  parents,  have  made  previous
    attempts to remain which have not been successful, the last application
    being in April 2016.  It is not clear how or when the  fifth  claimant,
    who was born a month later, came to be added as a claimant but  by  the
    time the Secretary of  State  considered  the  applications  the  fifth
    claimant had been born and so  his  rights  were  considered  as  well.
    However, in decisions which  were  made  on  15  February  2018,  their
    applications were all refused.  The  claimants  appealed  against  this
    decision and, as already noted, in a decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hussain, promulgated on 17 October 2018 following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham some fourteen days  earlier,  Judge  Hussain  allowed  their
    appeals.

 5. The basis  of  his  decision  for  present  purposes  can  be  set  out
    succinctly.  Judge Hussain had in mind as a very strong factor that the
    third claimant, the oldest child, was just shy of 7 years  old  and  in
    his words, as he stated at paragraph 30 of his decision,  "Despite  the
    first child not having quite reached the age of 7 years of  age,  I  am
    satisfied that the Secretary of  State  still  needs  to  show  'strong
    reasons' for refusing leave in this case".  This was on the basis  that
    it would not be reasonable to remove the oldest child because it  would
    not be in his best interests.  He made clear that this was the basis of
    his decision at paragraph 33 when he stated that,  "The  benchmark  ...
    remains that there is a presumption of grant unless  there  are  strong
    reasons for refusing leave".  He added that:




         "In addition to the 'sins of the parents', the Secretary  of  State
         points to the fact that the children would be  leaving  with  their
         parents and they can continue to enjoy the activities they enjoy in
         the United Kingdom in Nigeria.  These together with  the  'sins  of
         the parents' however do not  amount,  in  my  judgment,  to  strong
         reasons and do not remove the  presumption  of  grant  so  strongly
         emphasised by Elias LJ [in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705]".

    Surprisingly, in the decision there is  no  reference  at  all  to  the
    provisions  now  set  out  within  Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  which  Section  (as  is  clear  from
    Section 117A(1)):

         "applies where a court or Tribunal is required to determine whether
         a decision made under the Immigration Acts -

         (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for  private  and  family
             life under Article 8, and


         (b)  as a result would be unlawful under Section  6  of  the  Human
             Rights Act 1998".

 6. It is further provided under Section 117A "Application of this Part" at
    sub-Sections (2) and (3) as follows:

         "(2) ... In considering the public interest question, the court  or
             Tribunal must (in particular) have regard -

             (a)  in all cases, to the  considerations  listed  in  Section
                  117B, and

             (b)  in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,
                  to the considerations listed in Section 117C.

         (3)  In sub-Section (2), 'the public interest question'  means  the
             question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2)".

 7. In this case, therefore, the claim to remain and the appeal against the
    refusal of the application being founded upon what are said to  be  the
    claimants' Article 8 rights, it was incumbent upon the judge to have in
    mind the considerations (to which the Tribunal must  have  regard)  set
    out in Section 117B.

 8. Unsurprisingly, the Secretary  of  State  has  appealed  against  Judge
    Hussain's decision, in particular because he did not appear to have had
    any regard to these provisions within Section 117B.

 9. There is  one  other  factor  which  also  comes  into  play  now  when
    considering the Secretary of State's appeal and it is  this.   Although
    this decision was promulgated a few days before  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) and Others v  SSHD  [2018]  UKSC  53  was
    handed down, nonetheless that decision has retrospective effect and the
    decision of Judge Hussain has to be considered  now  in  light  of  the
    Supreme Court's decision in KO.

10. Although Mr Sobowale attempted valiantly to persuade the Tribunal  that
    at the very least it was implicit within the decision  that  the  judge
    had had regard to the factors set out within Section 117B, that is  not
    at all apparent from the decision itself.  There is no specific finding
    one way or the other as to  whether  or  not  the  claimants  would  be
    financially independent as required under  Section  117B(3);  the  sole
    consideration that was given to this factor was that they had attempted
    to work when they could.  It was, however, noted at  paragraph  5  that
    currently the family had been declared destitute because they were  not
    allowed to work and  that  they  were  currently  being  maintained  by
    Coventry City Council "at considerable expense to the British  taxpayer
    identified as ï¿½42,432 per year".  It may be that the judge  would  have
    found, had he considered this, that this sum would not  require  to  be
    spent were they to be granted leave, but the decision  lacks  any  such
    finding.  It is also not clear that the judge appreciated  that  little
    weight needed to be given to the private life of the applicants because
    it was  established  at  a  time  when  their  immigration  status  was
    precarious and also when they were all of  them  here  unlawfully  (see
    117B(4) and (5)).

11. What the judge does seem to have regarded as  the  primary  and  indeed
    almost unanswerable factor was that the oldest child was now  nearly  7
    years old and he clearly had in mind what Elias LJ  had  stated  in  MA
    (Pakistan) which he read as being a "presumption of grant unless  there
    are strong reasons for refusing leave".  The difficulty  with  reliance
    on this interpretation of the ratio in MA (Pakistan)  is that it cannot
    survive what is stated by the Supreme Court at paragraphs 18 and 19  of
    KO, which is as follows:

         "18. ... On the other hand, as the IDI  guidance  acknowledges,  it
             seems to me inevitably relevant in both contexts  to  consider
             where the parents, apart  from  the  relevant  provision,  are
             expected to be, since it will normally be reasonable  for  the
             child to be with them.  To  that  extent  the  record  of  the
             parents may become indirectly material, if it leads  to  their
             ceasing to have a right to remain here, and having  to  leave.
             It is only if, even  on  that  hypothesis,  it  would  not  be
             reasonable for the child to leave that the provision may  give
             the parents a right to remain.  [There is then a  citation  of
             what was 'well-expressed' by Lord Boyd in SA  (Bangladesh)   v
             SSHD [2017] SLT 1245] ...

         19.  [Lord Boyd] noted (paragraph 21) that Lewison LJ  had  made  a
             similar point in considering the 'best interests' of  children
             in the context of Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and
             Immigration Act 2009 in EV (Philippines) v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA
             Civ 874, paragraph 58 [which is then set out] ...

         To the extent that Elias LJ may  have  suggested  otherwise  in  MA
         (Pakistan) paragraph 40, I would respectfully disagree.   There  is
         nothing in the Section to suggest that 'reasonableness'  is  to  be
         considered other than in the real world in which the children  find
         themselves".

12. That, in this case, must be that the Tribunal has to  consider  whether
    or not it is reasonable for these children to return with their parents
    to Nigeria in the context (in the real world) that the parents have  no
    right to remain in this country and that the children would normally be
    expected to follow their parents where the parents should  be  expected
    to go.

13. Obviously, Judge Hussain did not have this  guidance  in  mind  (as  he
    could not have done because it had not been handed down by the time his
    decision was promulgated) but also he failed even  to  acknowledge  the
    existence  of  Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act,  notwithstanding  the
    requirement set out within Section 117A of that Act that  the  Tribunal
    must (my emphasis) have in mind the considerations  listed  in  Section
    117B when considering an application under Article 8.

14. It follows that this decision cannot stand but must be re-made.

15. Circumstances will obviously have moved on since the time the  decision
    was made and all relevant factors will have to be  considered.   It  is
    therefore appropriate to remit  this  appeal  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal sitting in Birmingham (which is  where  the  family  currently
    live) so that it can be re-heard by any judge other than Judge Hussain.
     It is not appropriate to retain any findings but the hearing  will  be
    de novo.

Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hussain as  containing
a material error of law and direct that the appeal be re-heard in the First-
tier Tribunal sitting at Birmingham  by  any  judge  other  than  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Hussain.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
