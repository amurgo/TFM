Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Parkin, Solicitor Advocate, instructed by
Windfall Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  against  the
    determination  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Stanford  who,
    following a hearing on 12 February 2015, dismissed his appeal against a
    decision of the respondent of 22 August 2013 to refuse his  application
    of 29 October 2012 for leave as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the Points Based System.

 2. The respondent refused the appellant's application  for  reasons  which
    may be summarised as follows:

    i)     In support of his application, the  appellant  had  submitted  a
         letter  from  the  Mauritius  Commercial  Bank  (MCB)   which   the
         respondent contended was  a  false  document.  The  respondent  was
         therefore satisfied that the appellant had used  deception  in  his
         application and refused the application under para 322(1A)  of  the
         Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules HC 395  (as  amended)
         (the "IRs").

    ii)    The appellant had failed to provide a letter from the University
         of Bristol which he used in order to obtain an offer of a place  of
         study with Leyton College. It was said that it  was  necessary  for
         the appellant to submit this letter because Leyton College was  not
         a Highly Trusted Sponsor. Accordingly, the respondent  awarded  the
         appellant nil points in respect of Attributes - CAS under  Appendix
         A of the IRs. He  therefore  failed  to  score  30  points  as  was
         required.

    iii)   In respect of Appendix C, the appellant had not  shown  that  he
         had the required funds of �7,200 for  the  required  28-day  period
         because:

         a) The appellant was required to produce original  bank  statements
             or internet and ad-hoc printouts which  contain  all  personal
             information and be stamped and signed by  the  bank.  However,
             the bank statement he had provided did not  have  an  original
             stamp and it was a photocopy.

             and

         b) He had provided a bank document which was false.

 3. The judge's findings may be summarised as follows:

    i)     The respondent had not discharged the burden of proof  upon  her
         to establish that the letter  from  MCB  was  forged  or  that  the
         appellant had been fraudulent ([29]).

    ii)    The appellant was required to produce with his  application  the
         letter from the University of Bristol. He therefore did not qualify
         for 30 points under Appendix A, Attributes - CAS.

    iii)   In relation to Appendix C, the appellant could not rely upon the
         letter from the MCB because this states the balance on one day  and
         does not provide the 28-day perspective. He had provided  printouts
         of a statement of this account  with  Barclays  Bank  covering  the
         relevant 28-day period which showed that the balance in his account
         did not drop below �9,199.99 during that period.  These  statements
         were not acceptable because they were photocopies. Under para 245AA
         of  the  IRs,  which  had  incorporated  the  respondent's   policy
         previously  known  as  the  "evidential  flexibility  policy",  the
         appellant  should  have  been  given,  "on  the  face  of  it",  an
         opportunity to have provided the original bank statements. However,
         the  respondent's  obligation  to  give  the  appellant   such   an
         opportunity did not arise because para 245AA(c) provided that  'the
         UK Border Agency will  not  request  documents  where  a  specified
         document has not been submitted .... or where the UK Border  Agency
         does not anticipate that addressing the omission or error .... will
         lead to a grant because the application will be refused  for  other
         reasons'. The judge decided that para 245AA(c) applied because  the
         application fell to be refused on the ground that the appellant had
         not provided the letter from University of Bristol.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on  the  ground  that  the  judge  was
    arguably wrong in failing to consider that the appellant did  not  have
    to produce a document in support of the CAS because Leyton College  was
    a Highly Trusted Sponsor.

    The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

 5. Mr Parkin submitted that the appellant could not be expected to produce
    evidence that Leyton College was a Highly Trusted Sponsor at  the  date
    of the decision because its licence was revoked on 2 May 2014 and there
    is no publicly-accessible archive of the information as to  whether  it
    had Highly Trusted Sponsor status as at the date of the  decision.  All
    that the appellant had been able to produce was a letter dated 22  June
    2012 granting Leyton College a licence  as  a  Highly  Trusted  Sponsor
    valid until 21 June 2013 unless withdrawn or surrendered before then.

 6. We agree with Mr Parkin that the appellant could  not  be  expected  to
    produce evidence that is not publicly accessible and which is  only  in
    the hands of the respondent.

 7. Miss Holmes kindly obtained evidence which showed that the  licence  of
    Leyton College as a Highly Trusted Sponsor was issued on 30  June  2013
    and revoked on 2 May 2014. It was therefore clear that  Leyton  College
    was a Highly Trusted Sponsor as at the date of the decision (22  August
    2013). The respondent was represented at the hearing before the  judge.
    It is not known why this information was not produced to the  judge  by
    the Home Office Presenting Officer.

 8. Miss Holmes therefore accepted that:

    i)     As Leyton College was a Highly Trusted Sponsor as at the date of
         the decision, it was  not  necessary  for  the  appellant  to  have
         submitted with  his  application  the  letter  from  University  of
         Bristol.

    ii)    This meant that the respondent  ought  to  have  given  him  the
         opportunity to produce the originals of his bank  statements.  Miss
         Holmes accepted that this meant that the respondent's decision  was
         not in accordance with the IRs.

 9. Miss Holmes therefore accepted that  the  appellant's  case  should  be
    remitted to the respondent for her  to  re-take  her  decision  on  the
    appellant's application  after  having  given  him  an  opportunity  to
    produce original bank statements pursuant to para 245AA(c) of the IRs.




    Error of law

10. Given that the respondent was the only party to  this  appeal  who  had
    access to information that was material to the appellant's appeal (i.e.
    whether Leyton College as a Highly Trusted Sponsor as at  the  date  of
    the decision), we are satisfied that, through no fault of his own,  the
    determination of the judge  proceeds  upon  a  procedural  irregularity
    (namely, the failure of the respondent to adduce  relevant  information
    to which only she had  access)  which  has  given  rise  to  procedural
    unfairness, in that, the appellant has been deprived of a fair hearing.



11. We therefore set aside the  decision  of  the  judge  and  re-make  the
    decision on the  appellant's  appeal.  The  judge's  finding  that  the
    respondent had not shown that the  appellant  had  practised  deception
    stands since this was not challenged by the respondent.  Given  [8.(i)]
    above, we find that the appellant's application of 29 October 2012  met
    the requirements of Appendix A,  Attributes - CAS.

12. Furthermore, and  for  the  reasons  given  above,  we  find  that  the
    respondent's failure to give the appellant an  opportunity  to  produce
    originals of his bank statements in relation to Appendix C  meant  that
    her decision was not in accordance with the IRs.

13. We therefore allow the appeal to the extent that the  appellant's  case
    is remitted to the respondent for her to take a  new  decision  on  the
    appellant's application of 29 October 2012 after having  given  him  an
    opportunity to produce originals of his bank statements.

14. However, the respondent will be aware that, by letter dated  26  August
    2015  to  the  respondent,  the  appellant  purported  "to   vary   his
    application to include an application for indefinite  leave  to  remain
    under paragraph  276B  of  the  [IRs]  on  the  basis  of  long  lawful
    residence". Accordingly, it will be for the respondent to decide:

    i)     whether the letter of 26 August 2015 did vary the application of
         29 October 2012, given:

         a) the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  JH  (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD
             [2009] EWCA Civ 78 that an application cannot be varied  under
             s.3C of the Immigration Act  1971  (the  "1971  Act")  once  a
             decision has been made on it; and

         b) our decision that the decision of  22  August  2013  is  not  in
             accordance with the IRs.

    We offer some observations in this respect at [15] below,  although  we
    stress that the decision as to whether the letter of 26 August 2015 did
    vary the application of 29 October 2012 will be one for the  respondent
    to take in the first instance.

    ii)    If the letter of 26 August 2015 did not vary the application  of
         29 October 2012, the respondent will have to decide the application
         of 29 October 2012 for leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.
         It will be for the  respondent  to  decide  whether  the  purported
         variation by letter dated 26 August 2015 meant that  the  appellant
         no longer satisfied the requirements for leave as a student.

15. In JH (Zimbabwe), the Court of Appeal held that an applicant  can  vary
    his application at any time up until the time when a decision has  been
    made  on  the  application.  Once  a  decision  has  been  made  on  an
    application, the application cannot be varied under s.3C because  there
    is nothing left to vary (final sentence of [35] of the judgment). In  a
    statutory appeal, the Upper Tribunal does not have  power  to  quash  a
    decision of the Secretary of  State  or  set  it  aside.  There  is  an
    argument  for  saying  that,  whether  the  Upper  Tribunal  allows  or
    dismisses an appeal, the decision appealed against continues  to  exist
    as a decision and that the final sentence of [35] of  the  judgment  of
    the Court of Appeal in JH (Zimbabwe) applies. However, in R  (Bhgat)  v
    SSHD [2014] EWHC 772 (Admin), Miss Clare  Moulder,  sitting  as  Deputy
    High Court Judge, said, at [31]: "Accordingly, in my view,  section  3C
    and in particular subsection (2)(a) that "leave is extended during  any
    period when the  application  for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
    withdrawn" must be interpreted to mean a final decision and  where  the
    Secretary of State is obliged to act on a direction from  the  Tribunal
    it seems to me that during such period of awaiting  implementation  the
    application is not finally decided."

16.  Since  the  respondent's  decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration  Rules  because  she  failed  to  give  the  applicant   an
    opportunity to submit originals of his bank statements  and  given  our
    decision to remit the case to the respondent, it can be argued  that  a
    final decision has not been made on the appellant's application  of  29
    October 2012 for leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.  Although
    we did (at the hearing) use the phrase "re-take" the  decision  in  the
    context of the  respondent  having  to  make  a  new  decision  on  the
    appellant's application of 29  October  2012,  it  is  clear  that  the
    respondent will in fact be taking a  new  decision  because  the  Upper
    Tribunal has no power to set aside the decision of 22  August  2013  or
    quash it.

    Decision

    The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law. We have set it aside. We have re-
    made the decision. We allow the appeal on he ground that  the  decision
    is not in accordance with the Immigration Rules but  only  because  the
    respondent failed to offer the  appellant  an  opportunity  to  produce
    original bank statements. The appellant's case is therefore remitted to
    the respondent for her to  take  a  new  decision  on  the  appellant's
    application of 29 October 2012.
