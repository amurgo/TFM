For the Appellant:      In person
For the Respondent:     Mr A McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants are citizens of India. The First Appellant was  born  on
    22nd February 1986.  The Second Appellant is the husband of  the  First
    Appellant born on 20th December 1981.  The First Appellant had  applied
    on 17th May 2013 for a combined application for leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  under  the  Points  Based
    System and for a Biometric  Residence  Permit.   That  application  was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 11th June 2013 on the grounds that
    the Appellant had not satisfied the attributes section  -  Appendix  A,
    requirements for Tier 1 (General) Applicants, in that the Appellant did
    not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  previous  earnings  and   for   UK
    experience.  The refusal to award points for UK experience was based as
    no points for previous earnings had been awarded.  The area  where  the
    Secretary of State  experienced  difficultly  was  that  the  Appellant
    claimed earnings from self employed activity, for reasons given in  the
    Notice of Refusal those earnings were not considered acceptable.

2.   The Appellants appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First
    Tier Tribunal Matthews sitting at Stoke on 7th February  2014.    In  a
    determination  promulgated  on  25th  February  2014,  the  appeal  was
    dismissed on all grounds.

3.   The Appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal on 5th March and on  18th
    March 2014 Judge of the First Tier Tribunal Keane granted permission to
    appeal.  The permission to appeal set out the salient features.   Judge
    Keane  noted  that  in  dismissing  the  appeals  in  respect  of   the
    Immigration  Rules,  the  Judge  found  that  Mrs  Choudhary  had   not
    established a net income deriving from her self employment of  �10,817.
    He noted that it was common ground between the parties  to  the  appeal
    that bank statements generated in connection with an  account  held  by
    Mrs Choudhary at HSBC had been submitted to  the  Respondent  with  Mrs
    Choudhary's application for leave to remain and a letter  addressed  to
    Mrs Choudhary dated 11th  June  2013  explicitly  confirmed  that  bank
    statements had indeed been presented to the Respondent.

4.   He noted that it was a feature of the hearing  before  the  Judge  that
    the bank statements were not contained in the  Respondent's  bundle  of
    documents.  On the first page of the Judge's record of proceedings, the
    Judge noted Mrs Choudhary's answer to a question put by Counsel that  a
    collection of documents which had been presented to the Respondent with
    her application and including her bank statements were not contained in
    the Home  Office  bundle.   He  noted  that  at  paragraph  18  of  his
    determination, the First Tier Tribunal Judge attributed  responsibility
    for the omission to the Respondent, to include the bank  statements  in
    her bundle as indeed her responsibility stating,

     "it is a matter of regret that the Respondent has been inefficient  and
    has not copied them for me ..."

     At page 8 of the record of proceedings, the Judge had  noted  Counsel's
    submissions made after evidence concluded that

     "Respondent's bundle does not  have  Appellant's  bank  statements  and
    doesn't suggest that her income doesn't reconcile with them".

5.   Judge Keane  in  granting  permission  considered  that  there  was  an
    arguable error of law as it  was  the  Respondent's  responsibility  to
    include Mrs Choudhary's bank statements in her bundle of documents  and
    as neither the Respondent nor the Home Office Presenting  Officer  were
    present at  the  hearing  submitted  that  the  income  record  in  Mrs
    Choudhary's bank statement was inconsistent with the claim as to a  net
    profit of �10,817 and  the  Judge  arguably  perpetrated  a  procedural
    irregularity failing to take into account  that  the  bank  statements,
    (albeit not before him) confirmed that her self employment as a painter
    generated a profit of �10,817 which was in accord with the statement as
    to a net profit  made  in  an  accountant's  report  submitted  to  the
    Respondent with the application.

6.   On 31st  March  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  provided  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24.  The Respondent  opposed  the  Appellant's  appeal
    stating that the Judge had noted at paragraph  22  that  there  was  no
    evidence of the self employment income declared on the tax return,  and
    that at paragraph 23 the Judge had noted that he did not have the  bank
    statements or final accounts.  Even if the bank statements were not  in
    the Respondent's bundle, the Judge  clearly  did  not  have  sufficient
    evidence before him to show that the  Appellant  had  a  self  employed
    income of �10,817.

7.   It is on that basis  that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  consider
    whether or not there has been a material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First Tier Tribunal.  In this instance, the Appellants appear in
    person, but rely on a detailed  submission  document  which  they  have
    prepared and which I have considered.  The Secretary of  State  appears
    by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr McVeety.

Submissions

8.   Mrs Choudhary submits that the decision  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    dismissed her appeal on three grounds, namely

     (i)  Her  professional  qualification  or  competency  in  painting  to
    undertake painting              business.

     (ii)     Invoices and bank statements not corroborating

      (iii)     The  expenses  incurred  for  purchase   of   material   for
    preparation and creating paintings.

     She then sets out, (and I have  given  very  careful  consideration  to
    criticisms  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge's  determination   at
    paragraphs 4 to 17 of her submissions), and concludes by stating

     "She has the necessary skills and qualifications to  meet  the  desired
    salary band as evidence from her previous Tier 1  visa,  but  that  she
    took up the self employment as an artist  as  she  wants  to  pursue  a
    living out of what she  enjoys  doing.   I  note  that  copies  of  her
    paintings are available within the bundle, and  I  have  no  reason  to
    doubt that she is an accomplished and experienced artist".

9.   Mr McVeety acknowledges that original  bank  statements  were  produced
    but considers the position as to whether or not the  evidence  provided
    was suitable, pointing out the important factor of whether or  not  the
    bank statements matched the invoices at the date  of  application.   He
    points out that if they were, then the question should be raised as  to
    why were they not considered by the Judge on the basis that they are on
    the file, and therefore the question arises as to whether or  not  this
    overcomes the evidential  burden.   He  accepts  that  there  has  been
    considerable documentation sent in with the application.  The  question
    still remains as to how much income the self  employed  income  of  the
    First Appellant is generating.  Having said that, he acknowledges  that
    the documents may not have been properly considered; albeit that may be
    through no fault whatsoever of the First Tier Tribunal Judge.

The Law

10.  Errors of legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  following  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions on  fact  or  evaluation  give  legally
    inadequate  reasons  for  the  decision  and   procedural   unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

11.  It is not an arguable error of law for an  Immigration  Judge  to  give
    too little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality
    is alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to  fail
    to deal with every factual issue of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story told is untrue.  If a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

12.  There is a procedural requirement  of  fairness  in  these  proceedings
    that fairness includes the proper and full  consideration  of  all  the
    evidence.  For reasons that have been set out  in  considerable  length
    both in the Notice of Refusal and previous determination as well as the
    grounds of appeal and  submissions,  documentary  evidence  as  to  the
    income generated by the First Appellant to  show  that  she  meets  the
    attributes section at  the  time  of  application  may  not  have  been
    properly before the Tribunal nor properly considered.  There are, I  am
    aware, a considerable number of bank statements.  Those statements  are
    not collated nor in order before me, so it is not possible to go on  to
    reconsider them.  However,  had  those  documents  been  available  and
    provided in  the  manner  in  which  they  should,  it  is  the  strong
    contention of the Appellant that  she  would  have  met  the  financial
    criteria.  That  is  the  only  issue  in  this  matter,  and  in  such
    circumstances, it seems appropriate to find that there  is  a  material
    error of law on the  basis  that  had  those  documents  been  properly
    considered, and before the Tribunal, then the  outcome  may  well  have
    been different and the matter to be remitted to the First Tier Tribunal
    to be heard on the first available date  so  that  the  Appellants  are
    given a final opportunity to show to the satisfaction of the  Secretary
    of State and the  Tribunal  that  they  meet  the  required  attributes
    section.  To that extent, I find that there is a material error  and  I
    set aside the decision of the First Tier Tribunal and I set out in  the
    decision section directions for the rehearing of this matter.



Decision

1)   The decision of the First Tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law and the decision is set aside and the appeal  is  remitted  to  the
    First Tier Tribunal for rehearing.

2)   The rehearing is to take place at the Manchester hearing centre and  to
    be before any First Tier Tribunal Judge (either salaried or  fee  paid)
    other than First Tier Tribunal Judge Matthews with an estimated  length
    of hearing of 1� hours.   The  hearing  to  be  listed  for  the  first
    available date 28 days hence.

3)   That the Secretary of State  do  produce  to  the  Appellants  and  the
    Tribunal at least 14 days pre hearing, a  bundle  of  those  statements
    that have been lodged with them and upon which they intend to  rely  at
    the hearing.

4)   That if there are any discrepancies between the bundle produced by  the
    Secretary of State and that produced by the Appellants they be entitled
    to respond by way of a contra bundle 7 days pre hearing.

5)   No interpreter required.

6)       The First Tier Tribunal Judge did not make an Order pursuant to
    Rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum     and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)
    Rules 2005.  No application is made to vary that Order and none is
    made.
