For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of America, born on 14 January  1983  appeals,
    with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Holder who in a determination promulgated on 21 June 2013 dismissed the
    appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State made on
    14 March 2013.  The appellant, who had lived in Britain  as  a  student
    between September 2005 and 31 December 2010 and thereafter as a Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Worker had applied on 7 February 2013 for leave to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system.

2.   The refusal, set out in a letter  of  14  March  2013  accepted,  under
    "Appendix A: Attributes " that the appellant  had  provided  sufficient
    evidence to demonstrate  that  she  did  have  access  to  the  �50,000
    required.  However she did not receive any points under that section of
    the Appendix  as it was not accepted that she was engaged  in  relevant
    business activity in an  occupation  which  appeared  on  the  list  of
    occupations skilled to National Qualifications  Framework  Level  4  or
    above.  It was however accepted that she was registered at  HM  Revenue
    and Customs, had registered a new business and was a director  of  that
    business.  It was stated that although she had  provided  a  job  title
    that was listed in the appropriate Appendix the only evidence  she  had
    submitted to demonstrate she was active in an occupation as part of her
    business was a contract to work on the morning  of  14  February  2013.
    The appellant was not  awarded  points  for  funds  held  in  regulated
    financial institutions or  that  they  are  disposable  in  the  United
    Kingdom because, the writer of the letter of refusal wrote:-

         "We have established that you have not demonstrated  that  you  are
         eligible to be awarded points under provision (d)  of  Table  4  of
         Appendix A of the Immigration Rules having access to �50,000."


3.   The judge found that the appellant was engaged in business activity  as
    claimed.  The judge stated, in paragraph 14 of the  determination  that
    this was demonstrated by  advertising for the appellant's  business,  a
    document outlining the business and other documents setting out various
    agreements between that business  and  other  organisations  for  which
    services were provided.

4.   However the judge stated in paragraph 16 that  the  appellant  had  not
    provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she had access  to  at
    least �50,000.

5.   The grounds of appeal referred to  the  letter  of  refusal  which  had
    accepted  that  the  appellant  had  provided  sufficient  evidence  to
    demonstrate that she had access to at least �50,000.

6.   On that basis permission to appeal was granted.

7.   Mr Melvin quite sensibly accepted that the judge had erred  in  law  by
    not following the fact that  the  respondent   had  accepted  that  the
    appellant  had the �50,000 required  and  that  it  appeared  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the  rules.    He  indicated  however
    that he considered it might be appropriate for the appeal to be  looked
    at by the relevant case worker at the Home Office  who  would  consider
    reversing the decision.

8.   I have considered the documentary evidence which included  evidence  of
    accounts held with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney  LLC
    as well as a letter from the appellant's mother's  attorney  confirming
    that those funds were available for the appellant,  that  letter  being
    countersigned by the appellant's mother.   I  am  satisfied  that  that
    documentary evidence was before the respondent when  the  decision  was
    made.

9.   I consider that there is a material error of law in  the  determination
    of the judge in that the judge did not take into account the  statement
    by the respondent that it was accepted that the appellant had access to
    �50,000 under provision (d) of Table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration
    Rules. I therefore set aside the  determination.

10.  I further consider that, as I have all relevant evidence before  me  it
    is appropriate for me to go on to re-make the decision.

11.  Taking into account the acceptance by the  respondent  that  the  money
    was available and  the finding, which has not been challenged,  of  the
    judge that the appellant was active in her business and further  taking
    into account the evidence  of  funds  and  their  availability  to  the
    appellant, I conclude that the appellant  does  qualify  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system
    and I allow the appeal on that basis.


Decision

12.  This appeal is allowed.

Fee Award

In the light of my decision allowing the appeal I  have  considered  whether
to  make  an  award  for  the  remittal  of  the  fee.   Having  regard   to
Presidential Guidance Note 2011 I remit the fee paid by  the  appellant.   I
do not  consider  that  the  appellant  was  responsible  for  the  negative
original decision.






Signed                                  Date
