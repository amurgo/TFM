Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Pretzell, Counsel instructed by M & K
Solicitors, Luton
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan whose date of birth is  recorded
    as 22 December 1943.  On or about 23 January 2013 she made  application
    for entry  clearance  as  an  adult  dependant  relative,  pursuant  to
    Appendix FM to the  Immigration  Rules.   The  sponsor  in  the  United
    Kingdom is Mr Atif Shaikh Iqbal whom the appellant claimed was her son.



 2. On 2 April 2013 a decision was made to  refuse  the  application.   The
    respondent did not accept the  parent/child  relationship  and  in  any
    event it was contended by the Secretary of  State  that  the  appellant
    could obtain the requisite care in her home country,  with  funds  sent
    from the United Kingdom to provide for it.  The appellant appealed  and
    on 13 January 2014 her appeal was heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Raymond sitting at Hatton Cross.  He dismissed the appeal.  He
    did not find that the relationship had been proved, principally because
    despite other evidence, it was his view that DNA  evidence  would  have
    settled the issue "unequivocally" and so that that ought to  have  been
    obtained and further because the appellant has a daughter living within
    reasonable proximity of  the  appellant  it  was  not  proved,  in  his
    judgment, that that daughter could not provide the care now sought.

 3. Not content with that determination, by notice dated 15 April 2014, the
    appellant made application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The grounds run to  20  paragraphs  but  in  essence  submit
    firstly that the judge applied too high a standard of proof in  respect
    of the relationship and secondly had misdirected himself in determining
    whether the appellant's  daughter  could  provide  the  requisite  care
    ignoring the respondent's own guidance at Chapter 8 Section 6  Annex  5
    which provides:

         "No other close relatives to turn to - however, it should be  noted
         that this will largely depend on their culture.   For  example,  in
         the Indian subcontinent, married women are unlikely to be  able  to
         provide support."

    It was the appellant's case that her daughter was not only married  but
    had her own children to look after as well as her mother-in-law.

 4. On 22 May 2013 Judge McDade granted permission thus  the  matter  comes
    before me.

 5. I am able to deal with the issues as  to  whether  or  not  there  were
    material errors of law in the determination of Judge Raymond relatively
    briefly because whilst  Ms  Isherwood  did  not  formally  concede  the
    points, equally she had little to say.

 6. At paragraph 11 of the determination Judge Raymond wrote:

         "The burden of proof is upon the appellant to the civil standard of
         the balance of probabilities.    I  have  taken  into  account  the
         relevant rules,  with  the  evidence  set  out  in  the  record  of
         proceedings and submissions.  I do not accept that in  the  context
         where substantial remittances can be seen to have been sent by  the
         sponsor to  Pakistan,  albeit  not  the  appellant  personally,  an
         expenditure has  been  undertaken  for  the  medical  care  of  the
         appellant during 2013, that the burden of proof can be seen to have
         been  discharged  by  reliance  at  the  hearing  upon  documentary
         evidence  submitted   with   the   application   on   the   claimed
         relationship, whereas a DNA test would have  unequivocally  settled
         the issue."
 7. The judge was clearly right to identify the standard of  proof  as  the
    civil standard.  In my judgment, however, he simply did not  apply  it.
    The approach taken by the judge was to  say  that  although  there  was
    documentary evidence, he  was  not  willing  to  accept  it  as  either
    sufficient or satisfactory in circumstances in which there was a better
    way for the appellant to have proved her  case.  Following  that  logic
    through the judge found the appellant to  have  failed  on  balance  of
    probabilities to have discharged the burden of  proof.   However,  that
    approach was flawed.  The reality of what the judge did was to say that
    where it is possible to prove a case to a  higher  standard  then  that
    should be done and good evidence will give way to that better  evidence
    so that an appeal will fail where that better evidence is not obtained.
    One has to ask rhetorically how much  documentary  evidence  would  the
    appellant have had to produce still  to  fail  in  her  appeal,  simply
    because she did not obtain DNA evidence?  In  the  ordinary  course  of
    events people do not prove their relationships with DNA  evidence.   Of
    course it can be obtained but a parent,  for  example,  in  the  United
    Kingdom claiming child support does not need to produce  DNA  evidence;
    documentary  evidence  will  do   provided   it   is   sufficient   and
    satisfactory.

 8. As to the finding that the care could be  found  and  provided  for  in
    Pakistan, Mr Pretzell provided a skeleton  argument  setting  out  that
    evidence which, in his submission, the judge appeared not to have taken
    into account, as to which I say rather more below, but very  fairly  Ms
    Isherwood conceded that the determination lacked  sufficient  reasoning
    given the evidence that was available. I agree.  In  the  circumstances
    the determination of Judge Raymond needs to be set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision - The appellant's case

 9. Mr Pretzell  took  me  through  the  appellant's  bundle  of  documents
    relevant to the issue of the relationship  of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor.  At page 24  of  the  appellant's  bundle  there  is  a  birth
    certificate.  It bears the sponsor's name showing him to have been born
    in Saudi Arabia.  The nationality of the sponsor's parents are shown as
    Pakistani and the appellant's name appears on the birth certificate  as
    the sponsor's mother.  Then at page 34  there  is  an  extract  of  the
    appellant's passport with the sponsor's name listed  under  "children".
    Further at page 31 there is a document  headed  "Heirship  Certificate"
    listing 3 heirs of the appellant's late husband.  The document is dated
    10 June 2013 and bears the names of  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor.
    Still further at page 76 there is a copy  of  the  sponsor's  Pakistani
    identity card (the sponsor is also a British citizen). The  reverse  of
    that document which appears at page 77 gives the sponsor's  address  in
    the United Kingdom and also an address in  Pakistan  which  corresponds
    with the  Heirship  Certificate  to  which  I  have  already  referred.
    Likewise,  the  appellant's  identity  card  appears  and  whilst   not
    translated, there is sufficient on that document in roman  numerals  to
    be corroborative of the address given to be the same as  in  the  other
    documentation to which reference is being made.

10. That the appellant is now a widow is evidenced by the death certificate
    which appears at P136 which  also  gives  the  sponsor  as  the  person
    "causing disposal of the body" and names the sponsor as the  deceased's
    son with the medical services certificate of  death  which  appears  at
    page 137 giving that same  address  that  has  appeared  in  the  other
    documentation.

11. The sponsor gave evidence before me.  He adopted his witness  statement
    which appears at pages 10 to 16 of the appellant's bundle and is  dated
    6 January 2014.  His evidence was that he is a British citizen with the
    appellant being his mother currently requiring  long  time  care  being
    provided as best as possible by his sister and his mother's neighbours.
     The appellant's sister is married with 2 children.  He is married with
    2 children.  It was in 1996 that the sponsor entered the United Kingdom
    as a student but later married and acquired  British  citizenship.   He
    has been supporting his parents since 2003. His father was a doctor but
    died on 13 September 2012.  The sponsor continues  to  send  money  via
    intermediaries for the benefit of his mother.  His mother  lives  alone
    and cannot manage her affairs.  The appellant has a brother but  he  is
    elderly and unable to look after  himself.   The  sponsor's  sister  in
    Pakistan visits their mother but she has the  commitments  of  her  own
    children, her husband and mother-in-law with the family income  of  the
    sponsor's sister in Pakistan, being relatively modest.  The appellant's
    sister is doing what she can but it is becoming an  intolerable  burden
    with children to take to different schools and the various  obligations
    which fall upon her.

12. The possibility of the appellant being placed in care has been examined
    but there are not adequate facilities.  Such institutions provide  only
    for the destitute.  There is no  regulation  of  such  institutions  in
    Pakistan and in any event  even  if  such  were  available,  there  are
    cultural imperatives, contends the sponsor which requires  him  as  the
    son to care for his mother.

13. The sponsor's evidence was  further  to  the  effect  that  his  mother
    suffers from a number of conditions affecting her ability to  care  for
    herself including diabetes and imbalance which has resulted in a number
    of falls.  Her health has more recently deteriorated and the care which
    the appellant's sister can provide is wholly inadequate given that  the
    appellant requires "round the clock care."

14. As to his own ability  to  provide  for  his  mother,  the  sponsor  is
    employed with Luton Borough Council as a  Senior  Chartered  Accountant
    with an income in excess of �40,000.  His wife is not currently working
    but is training to be a barrister.  They, that is to  say  the  sponsor
    and his wife,  own  a  4  bedroom  house  so  that  there  is  adequate
    accommodation for  the  appellant  should  she  arrive  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

15. The situation in Pakistan is that the  appellant's  sister  and  family
    live in a 2 bedroom flat inhabited by the appellant's sister,  husband,
    2 children and the sponsor's sister's mother-in-law.  The sponsor  told
    me that his sister would visit  their  mother  2  or  3  times  a  week
    spending about 2 hours in the morning or the  afternoon.   As  to  home
    care, the sponsor said that they did try a maid but with no man in  the
    house, the maid took advantage  of  the  appellant,  disappearing  with
    various chattels. Even when the sponsor's father was alive there were a
    number of robberies so that the appellant, on the sponsor's  case,  was
    now left without adequate protection.

16. So far as money transfers are concerned, in answer to the issue  raised
    by Judge Raymond to the effect that  there  was  inconsistency  in  the
    documentation because the monies were not being sent  directly  to  the
    appellant, the sponsor explained that the recipient  was  a  very  good
    friend of his, with whom he had lived when they were students. It would
    not be possible for money to be sent directly to the appellant  because
    she would not be able to collect it and it would be unsafe for her as a
    woman to be carrying money.

17. The sponsor was  cross-examined.   He  was  asked  what  steps  he  had
    actually taken  to  establish  whether  there  might  be  a  care  home
    available for his mother. He said that he had spoken to friends and his
    sister, as well as looking on the internet but could not find  anything
    satisfactory.  He did accept that there  was  a  degree  of  facilities
    available and said that he had not approached  any  of  the  particular
    institutions himself but his sister had  done  so.   The  sponsor  also
    explained that he had not seen his mother since  his  father  died  not
    because of an unwillingness to do so but because he had got  caught  up
    in this appeal process.  It was suggested to  the  sponsor  that  there
    were a number of inconsistencies in his account.  Firstly, the  sponsor
    was taken to one of  the  medical  reports  which  suggested  that  the
    appellant ate regularly whereas the sponsor was for saying that she did
    not eat properly.  He could not provide an answer as to why the medical
    report said what it did.  The sponsor's evidence was that sometimes his
    mother would simply eat food that had gone bad because his sister would
    leave food and might not be able to return the next day or so, so  that
    his mother would then eat what was available.  It was also pointed  out
    to the sponsor that whereas his  evidence  was  that  his  nephews  and
    nieces in Pakistan were going to school and being taken  there  by  his
    sister, his sister's own Affidavit spoke of tutoring. He explained that
    that tutoring was in addition to the  schooling  which  those  children
    received.  It was because of the  diabetes  that  his  mother's  mental
    functions were impaired.  When asked how many times  it  was  necessary
    for his mother to see a doctor, he  said  that  he  did  not  know  but
    thought it was about twice per week.  His mother previously had been  a
    midwife.

18. At page 139 of the appellant's bundle there is an  Affidavit  from  the
    appellant's daughter, Mrs Khan.  She provides an address for her mother
    consistent with the other evidence and speaks of her  mother  suffering
    from long term diabetes, arthritis, high blood pressure  and  recurrent
    urinary infection.  There have been a number of occasions also when her
    mother is said to have collapsed with, as at the time of the  Affidavit
    being sworn, 26 December 2013,  her  mother  having  had  a  number  of
    hospital admissions.  Mrs Khan states that she is unable to look  after
    her mother because of the other  commitments  to  which  reference  has
    already been made and that in Pakistan it is not acceptable for parents
    to live with married daughters.  Her obligation, that  is  to  say  Mrs
    Khan's obligation, is now to her mother-in-law.   Her  obligations  are
    transferred to her husband's family.  She, like the sponsor, says  that
    attempts have been made to employ a maid or care worker but this simply
    has not worked out given the dishonesty of the  people  who  have  been
    employed.

19. From page 102  onwards  there  is  medical  evidence  relating  to  the
    appellant.  Dr Ashfaq wrote a letter dated 14 December 2013.  He speaks
    of a history of recurrent urinary tract infections with last  admission
    to hospital on 8 September 2013.  There is also a history  of  diabetes
    and  a  history  of  multiple  falls.   She  is  described  as  getting
    insufficient rest and sleep though eating regularly but with knee joint
    pain and some loss of weight.  She is on medication.

20. That the crime  rate  in  Karachi  is  high  is  evidenced  by  various
    documents which have been placed within the appellant's bundle provided
    to provide support for the appellant's contention  that  the  appellant
    remains at risk as a woman without support.

The Respondent's case

21. Relying on the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter,  Ms  Isherwood  for  the
    Secretary of State submitted that there was no sufficient evidence that
    care had actively been sought in  Pakistan.   She  suggested  that  the
    evidence was essentially made up of bare assertions  contained  in  the
    Affidavit and the  sponsor's  evidence.   Further  whilst  the  sponsor
    understandably might want his mother to join him in the United Kingdom,
    it was not sufficient to say that the facilities in the United  Kingdom
    would be better than Pakistan: that simply would not be the test.   The
    evidence, Ms Isherwood submitted, was that they had tried one maid  and
    no more and that that maid had stolen from them but asked Ms  Isherwood
    rhetorically, "What  other  avenues  have  been  tried?"   Finally  the
    evidence did  not  suggest,  she  submitted,  that  the  appellant  was
    "totally" incapable.  The sponsor, she submitted, had  exaggerated  the
    evidence.

22. As to the issue of the  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor, Ms Isherwood made no submissions.

Burden and standard of proof

23. The burden is upon the appellant in this case to  satisfy  me  that  on
    balance of probabilities, as at the date of decision, the  requirements
    of the rule were made out.  The issues were somewhat narrowed  in  this
    case.  Ms Isherwood did not concede formally the  relationship  of  the
    appellant and the sponsor but as I have said made no submissions on it.
     Also she accepted that this case turned  on  whether,  if  established
    that the appellant and sponsor were related as  claimed,  the  required
    level of care in Pakistan was not available and there was no person  in
    that country who could reasonably provide it.  Reference therefore  was
    made to E-ECDR2.5 (a).

My findings

24. I make findings of fact having regard to the totality of the  evidence.
    The Immigration Directorate's  Instructions  which  were  provided  are
    dated June 1998 and relate to the provisions of paragraph  317  of  the
    Immigration Rules which is no longer applicable to cases such  as  this
    but in terms of the assessment of the particular issues in this appeal,
    it provides some helpful guidance.  It states, "if there is a  relative
    in the applicant's own country who is able and willing to support  [the
    applicant], then it would not be unreasonable to expect [the applicant]
    to turn to that relative for support, even if the sponsor in the United
    Kingdom is financially in a better position to do so."

25. The same directions go  on  to  make  the  point  that  in  the  Indian
    subcontinent married women are unlikely to be able to provide  support,
    though if there are several close relatives then the guidance  suggests
    that there is no reason why that should not be obtained.

26. Ms Isherwood accepted that this case was case sensitive  and  she  also
    accepted that the Affidavit of the appellant's sister, if  accepted  at
    face value without more, would in fact make out the  appellant's  case.
    It was simply Ms Isherwood's submission that the whole of the claim was
    being exaggerated without there being sufficient  evidence  to  support
    what was being contended for.

27. I found the sponsor to be an honest and reliable witness.  He gave  his
    evidence in a straightforward manner and made appropriate  concessions.
    He accepted that he had done no more in looking  for  care  homes  than
    look on the internet and rely on what his sister had had to say but  he
    explained why he had not been to Pakistan, having got caught up in  the
    appeal process.  Whereas Ms Isherwood was for saying that  the  sponsor
    had exaggerated the claim, it was not suggested by him that his  mother
    needed to visit the doctor on a daily basis, he reasonably said that it
    was from time to time that the difficulty was that she, the  appellant,
    simply could not be left alone.  As to  the  cultural  imperatives,  Ms
    Isherwood did not respond to that which  is  clearly  set  out  in  the
    grounds and which appears in the Immigration Directorate  Instructions.
    It was Ms Isherwood's suggestion that the de facto  position  was  that
    the appellant's daughter was providing  that  care  and  there  was  no
    reason for it to continue but I  have  to  decide  whether  it  is  the
    required level of care given the  wording  in  the  rule.   That  is  a
    finding of fact.  Ms Isherwood agrees.

28. In my judgment the evidence overwhelmingly points  in  the  appellant's
    favour.  Firstly I have no hesitation whatsoever in finding as  a  fact
    that the sponsor and appellant are related as claimed. The  documentary
    evidence all points in one direction.

29. What then is the required level of care?  I find as a fact that what is
    required for this elderly and increasingly infirm  appellant  is  round
    the clock care. This is a person who on the medical evidence speaks  of
    the appellant having  suffered  numerous  falls.   Clearly  she  cannot
    reasonably be expected to live alone.  There is the constant risk  that
    she might fall. Were she, for example, to break a hip she could be left
    both in pain and at mortal risk.  She cannot, I accept, manage her  own
    affairs.  The diabetes impairs her mental functioning.  I  also  accept
    that it is not reasonable, using the words of the  relevant  provision,
    to expect the appellant's daughter to  continue  to  provide  the  care
    which she does.  Firstly, the care is not adequate in my  judgment  and
    secondly she has  other  obligations,  recognised  by  the  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions  which  Ms  Isherwood  did  not  suggest  were
    inapplicable.  It seems to me that the provision in the rules  and  now
    under consideration  contemplated  precisely  this  kind  of  case.   I
    appreciate the submissions made  by  Ms  Isherwood  that  perhaps  more
    enquiries could have been made about what care might be  available  but
    in my judgment to ask more would be to fall into the same error as  the
    judge in the First-tier namely to require a higher  standard  of  proof
    than is necessary.  Indeed,  one  might  suggest  that  the  appellant,
    through the sponsor, could have enquired of every single care  facility
    in Karachi lest there be one that could provide the requisite level  of
    care but that is not the test.  The  question  for  me  is  whether  on
    balance of probabilities sufficient has being done  for  the  appellant
    through the sponsor to discharge the burden which is upon her.   I find
    as a fact that that has been done and I find that  the  level  of  care
    cannot be provided save by the appellant coming to join her son in  the
    United Kingdom by which I mean such care as is contemplated within  the
    requirement of the rule.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained  material  errors  of
law and is set aside.  In  remaking  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal the appeal is allowed and I make a full feel award in  the  sum  of
�140.
