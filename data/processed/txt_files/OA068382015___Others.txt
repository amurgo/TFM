Representation:

For the appellant:     Mrs Peterson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr Hans, Henry Hyams & Co

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant.

 1. I have made an anonymity order because  this  decision  refers  to  the
    circumstances of minor children.  ZT and RT (born in 1998) are the twin
    younger sisters of the sponsor.  AY (born in  2004)  is  the  sponsor's
    niece.  It is accepted the three respondents lived  together  with  the
    sponsor and her two children, prior to the sponsor leaving  Eritrea  to
    claim asylum in the UK in 2012.    They  now  reside  in  Addis  Ababa,
    Ethiopia.


 2. The sponsor is an Eritrean citizen, who has been granted refugee status
    in the UK.


 3. The SSHD has appealed against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bradshaw dated 26 January 2017 in which  it  allowed  the  respondent's
    appeals on human rights grounds.

Background history

 4. The respondent's appeals were first considered by Judge Bradshaw in  an
    earlier decision dated  13  September  2016.   In  that  decision,  the
    appeals of all five of the sponsor's dependents were allowed i.e. these
    three respondents and  the  sponsor's  own  two  children.   An  appeal
    against that decision was heard by the Upper  Tribunal  on  7  November
    2016.  The SSHD appears to have accepted there was no error of  law  in
    the decision relating to the sponsor's own  children  at  [4]  and  the
    appeals relating to them were dismissed.  The Upper Tribunal  indicated
    the hope that the SSHD would promptly issue entry clearance for them at
    [10].  I am told that these two children entered the UK in  March  2017
    with entry clearance, and have recently applied for indefinite leave to
    remain.


 5. The Upper Tribunal found that Judge Bradshaw made a material  error  of
    law when making her decision regarding these respondents, in particular
    there was a failure to take into account relevant matters, such as  the
    respondents'  ability  to  speak  English  and  the  likely   financial
    implications of their permitted entry to the UK  upon  the  tax  payer.
    The Upper Tribunal remitted the respondents' appeals to Judge Bradshaw.


 6. When the matter came before Judge Bradshaw on the second occasion on  3
    January  2017  there  were  therefore  only   three   appellants   (the
    respondents in these proceedings), whose appeals were allowed.


 7. In a decision dated 1 August 2017 the First-tier Tribunal  granted  the
    SSHD permission to appeal on this basis:


           "it is an arguable error of law to fail to deal  [with]  section
           117B, which is statute law, particularly  when  the  failure  to
           meet the Immigration Rules is on the basis  of  maintenance  and
           accommodation, the bills for both of which will,  in  effect  be
           picked up by public funds, if entry clearance is granted."


 8. The matter now comes before me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made an error of law.


Hearing

 9. At the hearing Mrs Peterson made brief submissions and  focused  solely
    on the financial burden issue.  She invited me to find that the  First-
    tier Tribunal failed to consider the financial  burden  that  would  be
    caused by the respondents' admission.  I pointed out  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had  taken  this  into  account  at  [27].  Mrs  Peterson
    accepted this but submitted that insufficient weight was given  to  the
    respondents' access to public funding.


10. Mr Hans relied upon a rule 24 notice and invited me to find  there  was
    no material error of law.


11. After hearing from both representatives, I reserved my decision which I
    now provide with reasons.

Error of law discussion

12. When the decision is read  as  a  whole,  I  am  satisfied  that  Judge
    Bradshaw applied section  117B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act') and  gave  adequate  reasons  for  her
    decision.


13. At [12] Judge Bradshaw made it explicit that she had taken into account
    section 117B and correctly summarised its effect.  She  was  well-aware
    that this is one of those cases as identified in SS Congo v SSHD [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387 in which the grant of entry clearance would give  rise  to
    "pressure on public resources" - see [27].   Judge  Bradshaw  expressly
    accepted that there would be pressure upon  public  resources  in  this
    case.  This must be viewed in context.   Judge  Bradshaw  was  provided
    with clear evidence on the financial implications for  the  state.   At
    all material times, the sponsor worked full time as a  care  assistant,
    but it was accepted that the additional entry of the three  respondents
    would lead to a shortfall of ï¿½84.75 per week  -  see  [16].   Only  one
    respondent remained of school age, as the twins are now 18.


14. I accept that it is regrettable  that  [31]  ends  with  an  incomplete
    sentence.  When the decision is read as a whole I am satisfied that  it
    is sufficiently clear  that  the  Judge  Bradshaw  concluded  that  the
    particular circumstances of the  case  "greatly  outweigh"  the  public
    interest considerations identified in section 117B of the 2002 Act,  as
    referred to at [12, 25, and 27].


15. Judge Bradshaw  was  entitled  to  find  that  there  are  serious  and
    compelling circumstances: the sponsor and  her  family  members  (these
    three respondents and her two children)  have  been  through  extremely
    challenging times over a long period of time.  They lived together as a
    family unit prior to and after the sponsor fled  Eritrea.   The  First-
    tier  Tribunal  was  entitled  to  attach   great   weight   to   these
    circumstances  provided  that  these  were  balanced  with  the  public
    interest considerations.  I am satisfied  that  an  adequate  balancing
    exercise was undertaken and the grounds of  appeal  amount  to  a  mere
    disagreement with the decision.


16. As Irwin LJ said in AS (Iran) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1539 at [26]:
        "The obligation on a Tribunal is  to  give  reasons  in  sufficient
        detail to show the principles on which the Tribunal has  acted  and
        the reasons that have led to the decision. Such reasons need not be
        elaborate, and do not need  to  address  every  argument  or  every
        factor which weighed  in  the  decision.  If  a  Tribunal  has  not
        expressly addressed an argument, but if there are grounds on  which
        the argument could  properly  have  been  rejected,  it  should  be
        assumed that the Tribunal acted on such grounds. It  is  sufficient
        that the critical reasons to the decision are recorded."
17. The reasons provided by the First-tier Tribunal are not  elaborate  but
    the critical balancing exercise has been undertaken  and  the  relevant
    public interest considerations taken into account.

Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  a  material
    error of law and is not set aside.
