Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D. Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Vokes, Counsel instructed by Lin & Co,
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in these  proceedings  is  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    ("ECO"). However, I continue to refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen of China, born on 6  February  1968.  On  17
    October 2013 she  applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  under
    Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  On  18  November  2013  the
    application was refused with reference to paragraph E-ECP.2.1(d) on the
    basis that the appellant's partner, whom  she  married  on  23  October
    2012, is not settled in the UK. He only has limited leave to remain.

 3. Her appeal against that decision came before a judge of the  First-tier
    tribunal ("the FtJ") on 16 October 2014 whereby the appeal was  allowed
    under Article 8 of the ECHR (although in his concluding  paragraph  the
    FtJ said that the respondent's decision was not in accordance with  the
    law and the Immigration Rules).

 4. Following a hearing on 28 January 2016,  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Mahmood ("the DUTJ") concluded that the FtJ had erred  in  law  in  his
    decision and he set the decision aside for the decision to  be  re-made
    in the Upper Tribunal.

 5. The error of  law  decision  can  be  summarised  as  follows.  It  was
    concluded that the FtJ wrongly referred to the decision of the Court of
    Appeal in Muse and Others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 10 as a decision of the High  Court  (although  I  note
    that the DUTJ gives an incorrect citation for the  case),  and  wrongly
    assessed the "status" and "reach" of that case. The FtJ, he found,  had
    wrongly concluded that the Court of Appeal held that a  person  in  the
    position of the appellant had every right to bring his or her spouse to
    the UK.

 6. The DUTJ concluded that the error of law referred to above was fatal to
    the FtJ's decision. In addition however, he concluded that the FtJ  had
    not given sufficient reasons as to why the sponsor  and  the  appellant
    could not live in China.

    Submissions

 7. The hearing before me proceeded by way of submissions  only.  Mr  Vokes
    relied on his skeleton  argument.  I  was  referred  to  the  grant  of
    discretionary leave to remain ("DLR") to the  appellant's  spouse,  the
    sponsor, on 20 April 2012. The letter evidencing that  grant  of  leave
    (page 41 of  the  appellant's  bundle),  states  on  page  2  that  any
    application for a spouse to join him will not  normally  be  considered
    until he had indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") but that an application
    for family reunion may be granted at an  earlier  point  if  there  are
    "compelling  compassionate  circumstances".  The  DLR  granted  to  the
    sponsor was on the basis of the 'legacy' process.

 8. Under the Immigration Rules the appellant would only  be  eligible  for
    entry (as a spouse) some time in  2019,  after  the  grant  of  settled
    status to the sponsor. I was referred to the Asylum Policy  Instruction
    on Discretionary Leave, dated 18 August 2015, and the stated  intention
    of the discretionary leave policy having been to prevent  a  breach  of
    Article 8.

 9. The sponsor was granted DLR on 20 April  2012,  before  the  Article  8
    Immigration Rules were introduced. Mr Vokes referred to section 10.1 of
    the  policy  which  states  that  those   granted   leave   under   the
    discretionary leave policy in force before  9  July  2012  (which  this
    appellant was), will normally continue to  be  dealt  with  under  that
    policy through to settlement.

10. It was submitted that the purpose of the policy was to  promote  family
    life generally. As to authority for the proposition  that  there  is  a
    duty to promote family life I was  referred  to  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in  R  (on  the  application  of  Quila  and  another)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45.

11. It was submitted that the sponsor, and thus the appellant,  were  in  a
    'half-way house' situation in that he is not a UK citizen  and  is  not
    settled yet others whose immigration status is more precarious, such as
    Tier 2 migrants or others under the points-based system, are allowed to
    bring spouses to the UK. They would  be  granted  leave  for  the  same
    duration as the UK-based migrant.

12. The decision in Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387 was relied on in terms of what was said about cases
    of a "particularly pressing nature". In this appeal, the Rules  do  not
    fully recognise the position of the appellant and the sponsor, in  that
    the unity of a husband and wife are at stake.

13. It was further submitted that there is an expectation  of  the  sponsor
    being able to settle in the UK. The grant of DLR is  a  recognition  of
    the fact that the sponsor's private life  is  situated  in  the  UK.  A
    (Afghanistan) V Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 825 was relied on in  relation  to  the  question  of  family  life
    between spouses even though they may not live together.

14. The requirements of s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 are not  adverse  to  the  appellant,  there  having  been  no
    contention that she does not meet the other requirements of the  Rules,
    for example, she has an English language certificate.

15. Although it would be possible for the  appellant  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance as a visitor, that would represent an incomplete family life,
    limited as it would be to short visits and requiring the  appellant  to
    making repeated visits over a period of a year say, which would not  be
    permitted.

16. It was conceded that no particular facts could be pointed to  in  terms
    of compelling compassionate circumstances except for the fact that they
    are apart.

17. Mr Mills submitted that it was clear to  the  sponsor  right  from  the
    start that he would not be able to bring a spouse to the UK during  the
    period  of  his  DLR  unless  there   were   compelling   compassionate
    circumstances. In that knowledge he went to China and got married.  The
    marriage was entered into in the  knowledge  that  they  could  not  be
    together in the UK any time soon.

18. The decision in A (Afghanistan) involved post-flight refugee marriages,
    which is an entirely different situation from that of  this  appellant.
    In this case there was no reason as to why the sponsor could not return
    to China and continue his family life there. When asked about  this  at
    the hearing before the FtJ he simply said  that  he  had  got  used  to
    living in the  UK.  I  was  also  referred  to  the  sponsor's  witness
    statement at [7]. This all suggested simply a preference for living  in
    the UK, it was submitted.

19. As to the reasons for the grant of DLR to the sponsor, the respondent's
    computer notes (produced at the hearing before me) indicated that  this
    was simply a pragmatic grant of leave, informed in part because of  the
    limited prospects of removal.

20. Although it is true that the sponsor's status is not as  precarious  as
    that, say, of a student, it is nevertheless precarious for so  long  as
    he requires a grant of further leave  to  remain.  There  is  a  policy
    justification for allowing  Tier  2  migrants  and  students  to  bring
    partners to the UK, so as to encourage those that the UK wish  to  come
    to the UK to do so, for example those who are  in  skilled  employment.
    That is different from a grant of DLR under the legacy process.

21. In reply, Mr Vokes highlighted  what  is  stated  on  the  respondent's
    computer notes which is that the decision to grant leave  was  made  on
    the basis of the sponsor's "exceptional circumstances".

    Conclusions

22. Given that this appeal is advanced with reference to Article 8  of  the
    ECHR, I adopt the structured approach set out in R (Razgar) v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department  [2004] 2 AC 368.

23. The appellant and  the  sponsor  have  family  life.  The  respondent's
    decision does represent an interference with (or lack of  respect  for)
    that family life. The  interference  will  have  consequences  of  such
    gravity as potentially to  engage  the  operation  of  Article  8.  The
    interference is in accordance with the law and represents a  legitimate
    aim, namely the economic wellbeing of the  UK,  expressed  through  the
    maintenance of an effective immigration control. The issue  is  one  of
    proportionality.

24. Under paragraph E-ECP.2.1, in order for the  appellant  to  be  granted
    entry clearance as a partner, the sponsor must be  a  British  Citizen,
    present and settled in the UK or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
    humanitarian protection.  The sponsor does not come within any of those
    provisions, only having DLR, now until 2018.

25. Certain of the propositions advanced on behalf of the appellant  by  Mr
    Vokes I  would  accept.  Thus,  I  agree  that  not  only  is  there  a
    requirement for the Secretary of State not  to  interfere  with  family
    life (subject to Article 8 justification) but there is also a  duty  to
    promote family life.

26. I would similarly agree that there can be family life  between  husband
    and wife where they are not (permanently) cohabiting, as here.

27. It is also the case that some in the categories of  temporary  migrants
    do have entry clearance granted to their dependants,  or partners, with
    leave granted for the same period as the  leave  granted  to  the  main
    migrant.

28. The grant of DLR to the sponsor in the first instance on 20 April 2012,
    as set out in the letter of grant of that date stated,  materially,  as
    follows under the subheading "Dependants":

         "If you are the principal sponsor and you are married  and/or  have
         children under the age of 18, the leave to  remain  you  have  been
         granted does not entitle your spouse or minor children (who  formed
         part of the family unit prior to you leaving your country of origin
         and  seeking  asylum)  to  join  you  in  the  United  Kingdom.  An
         application for them to join you will not  normally  be  considered
         until you have applied for, and been granted, indefinite  leave  to
         enter. In addition, the  normal  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules regarding support and accommodation of dependants would  have
         to be satisfied. However, an application for family reunion may  be
         granted at an earlier point if there are  compelling  compassionate
         circumstances."

29. Section 10.1 of the (discretionary leave) policy relied on on behalf of
    the appellant, so far as relevant, states the following:

         "10.1 Applicants granted DL before 9 July 2012

         Those granted leave under the DL policy in force before 9 July 2012
         will normally continue to be dealt with under that  policy  through
         to settlement if they continue to qualify for further leave on  the
         same basis as their original DL was granted (normally they will  be
         eligible to apply for settlement after accruing 6 years' continuous
         DL...".

30. The sponsor was granted DLR before 9 July 2012 and the  expectation  is
    therefore that he would continue to be dealt with under that policy.  I
    have not in fact been provided with a copy of the policy that  is  said
    to have governed the original grant of DL to the sponsor,  although  it
    is not disputed that the material effect of it is  that  the  sponsor's
    wife would only be permitted to join the sponsor in the UK (with  leave
    of the same duration as that of the sponsor) if there  are  "compelling
    compassionate" circumstances.

31. Therein it seems to me, lies the  flaw  in  the  argument  advanced  on
    behalf of the appellant. Mr Vokes was unable to advance any  particular
    facts in relation to compelling compassionate circumstances beyond  the
    fact of the appellant and the sponsor being married and that  they  are
    separated. It is not difficult to envisage the sorts  of  circumstances
    that  may  come  within  the  assessment  of  compelling  compassionate
    circumstances, such as for example the ill health of one  or  other  of
    the spouses, or indeed of some other person.

32. I do not consider that the fact that others in categories of  temporary
    migration are permitted to bring their partners to the UK is  relevant.
    As Mr Mills suggested,  there  may  be  good  policy  reasons  why  the
    respondent would permit entry clearance in such cases. It is true  that
    people in the position of the sponsor in this case are  on  a  path  to
    settlement which other temporary migrants may not be,  but  again  that
    does not seem to me to be material. The sponsor applied for asylum  but
    it was not granted. A range of factors were  taken  into  account  when
    deciding whether or not he should be granted DLR.

33. He was aware at the time that leave was granted  that  it  was  on  the
    basis that he would not be permitted to bring to the UK any partner  or
    dependants. The fact that he got married in  October  2012  (after  the
    leave was granted) is not in my view relevant only from the perspective
    advanced on behalf of the respondent before me, i.e. that he  chose  to
    get married despite knowing that a spouse would not  be  able  to  join
    him. The sponsor  and  the  appellant  were  in  fact  in  a  committed
    relationship  and  had  been  since  1987,  as  the  sponsor's  witness
    statement at [8] and the grounds of appeal to the FtT  reveal.  He  was
    therefore aware at the time of the grant of leave that it was not  only
    'a partner' that he would not be able to bring to the UK, but  that  he
    would not be able to bring the appellant, who was his  partner  at  the
    time.

34. In SS (Congo) it was said at [40] that the leave to  enter  Immigration
    Rules maintain, in general terms, a reasonable  relationship  with  the
    requirements of Article 8 in the ordinary run of  cases,  but  that  it
    remains possible to imagine cases

         "where the individual interests at  stake  are  of  a  particularly
         pressing nature so that a good claim for  LTE  can  be  established
         outside the Rules. In our view the appropriate general  formulation
         for this category is that such cases will arise where an  applicant
         for LTE can show that compelling circumstances exist (which are not
         sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to require  the  grant
         of such leave."

35. The policy under which the sponsor was granted DLR expressly refers  to
    the situation of spouses. It too refers  to  the  need  to  demonstrate
    compelling (compassionate) circumstances. There is  therefore  a  basis
    outside the Rules whereby a person in the  situation  of  this  sponsor
    would be permitted to have his partner join  him.  The  fact  that  the
    Rules do not cater for the appellant's and the sponsor's circumstances,
    simply as spouses wishing to be together in the UK, does not in  itself
    provide an answer to the enquiry as to  whether  there  are  compelling
    compassionate circumstances.

36. There are no relevant parallels to be drawn from  the  decisions  in  A
    (Afghanistan)  and  Quila   which   both   concerned   very   different
    circumstances.

37. Furthermore, I do consider that there  is  merit  in  the  respondent's
    argument to the effect that there is in fact no reason as  to  why  the
    sponsor cannot return to China to  enjoy  family  life  with  his  wife
    there. It is true that the grant of DLR recognised that he had been  in
    the UK for some years, and implicitly that he had established a private
    life here. I note what the sponsor says in his witness statement  about
    his life in the UK in terms of employment and his prospects were he  to
    return to China. However, it is a  matter  of  choice  for  him  as  to
    whether or not he remains in the UK or returns to China and family life
    with his wife. It is said  that  the  appellant  has  some  �21,000  in
    savings and that they have two adult children (as per  the  grounds  to
    the FtT). It is not the case therefore, that  the  sponsor  would  have
    nothing to go back to, quite apart from  the  fact  that  he  would  be
    reunited with his wife.

38. In all the circumstances,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  respondent  has
    established  that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance   is   a
    proportionate response to the legitimate aim pursued.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision having been set aside, I  re-make  the
    decision by dismissing the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.
