Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Ali of Counsel, instructed by Samad & Co
Immigration
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This has been a remote hearing which has not been objected  to  by  the
    parties.  The form of remote hearing was by video, using Skype.  A face
    to face hearing was not held to take precautions against the spread  of
    Covid-19 and as all issues could be determined by remote means.   There
    were technical difficulties for Ms Isherwood accessing the video  call,
    which were improved significantly by her  camera  being  switched  off,
    such that with the agreement of the parties, the hearing proceeded with
    her joining the video call orally.  The file contained the documents in
    paper format and in part available electronically.

 2. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Parkes promulgated on 4 February 2020, in which the
    Appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse his  application  for
    entry clearance to join his wife in the United Kingdom  dated  12  June
    2018 was dismissed.

 3. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on  4  July  1994,  who
    made an  application  for  entry  clearance  on  19  March  2018.   The
    Respondent refused the application the basis that the  requirements  in
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(c) of Appendix FM and paragraph S-EC.2.2(a)  of  the
    same were not met as the Appellant's partner was not genuinely employed
    as claimed.  As such,  there  was  an  issue  of  suitability  and  the
    financial requirement  had  not  been  met.   Further,  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of  entry  clearance.   An
    entry clearance manager reviewed and  maintained  the  decision  on  20
    September 2019.

 4. Judge Parkes dismissed the  appeal  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  4
    February 2020 on human rights grounds.  In essence, although the First-
    tier Tribunal found that the Appellant's partner was genuinely employed
    at the date of application as claimed, she had  still  not  established
    that she had met the minimum income threshold required of ï¿½18,600 based
    on her annual earnings information from HMRC.  In any event, the First-
    tier Tribunal had, in the context of a human rights appeal, to consider
    the circumstances at the date of  hearing  (rather  than  the  date  of
    application) and by that time,  the  Appellant's  partner  had  changed
    employment completely and there was insufficient evidence to show  that
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules were  met  for  the  required
    income at that date.  In particular, the Appellant's partner  had  only
    very recently commenced employment in a second job, with less than  six
    months' income and evidence  as  required  in  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Overall, the First-tier Tribunal took into account that the Immigration
    Rules had not been met and that there were no circumstances to  justify
    leave outside of them.

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals on three grounds as  follows.   First,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal materially erred in law in its calculation  of  the
    Appellant's partner's earnings at the date of application by failing to
    calculate her gross average income  from  the  accepted  employment  in
    accordance with paragraph 13  of  Appendix  FM-SE  to  the  Immigration
    Rules.  A calculation on this  basis  shows  that  the  minimum  income
    requirement was met at the date of  application.   Secondly,  that  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  materially  erred  in  law   in   assessing   the
    Appellant's partner's employment at the date of hearing by reference to
    the requirements of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE rather  than  making
    an independent assessment under Article 8 of the European Convention on
    Human Rights on the  balance  of  probabilities,  i.e.  without  strict
    application of the evidential requirements in  the  Immigration  Rules.
    On this basis, there was sufficient  evidence  to  establish  that  the
    minimum income requirement was met at the date  of  hearing.   Finally,
    that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred  in  law  in  failing  to
    undertake a proportionality balancing  exercise  for  the  purposes  of
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, failing to assess
    the impact of the refusal on the Appellant and his British partner.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Neville on 28 April 2020, albeit without access to  the  Tribunal
    file held electronically and only on the assumption  that  the  grounds
    were correct.  That is a matter of concern for the reasons given in SYR
    (PTA; electronic materials) Iraq [2021] UKUT 64  (IAC),  but  does  not
    affect the consideration of whether there was an error of  law  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision  and  there  is  no  suggestion  that  the
    grounds of appeal were anything other than factually accurate.

 7. Further to  the  grant  of  permission  to  appeal  and  further  to  a
    provisional view that this may be a case in  which  the  error  of  law
    issues could be  determined  without  a  hearing;  there  were  written
    submissions on behalf of the parties.

 8. On 31 July 2020, the Respondent opposed the appeal in a rule 24  notice
    on the basis that the relevant date  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    consider the circumstances was the date  of  hearing  and  the  primary
    issue being whether the Appellant could be supported  without  recourse
    to public funds at that date.  He could  not  in  accordance  with  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, in particular those in  Appendix
    FM-SE, as his partner's second employment  relied  upon  had  commenced
    less than two months before the hearing.  Further, even if  looking  at
    an earlier date, the evidence from HMRC showed that the minimum  income
    requirement had not been met in any previous financial years and  there
    was no reason to consider anticipated income at the date of application
    because as a matter of fact, the second employment at that  time  ended
    two weeks after the refusal of entry clearance.  In  any  event,  there
    were no factors identified which could have possibly led to the  appeal
    being allowed on Article 8 grounds.

 9. Written submissions were made on behalf of the Appellant on  5  and  22
    August 2020 which referred to the only live issue before the First-tier
    Tribunal being the genuineness of the Appellant's partner's  employment
    at the date of application and once that had been accepted, there being
    no dispute that Article 8 was engaged, that was  determinative  of  the
    appeal being allowed further to TZ (Pakistan) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.  In any event, on the correct
    calculation, the minimum income requirement was met  both  at  date  of
    application  and  date  of   hearing   and   the   refusal   would   be
    disproportionate for a couple married  in  2016.   A  number  of  other
    authorities were relied upon as well as the factors in section 117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 but none were  pursued
    at the oral hearing, it being accepted that these were not relevant  in
    an application for entry clearance.  For completeness, I add  that  the
    reliance on these additional points had in any event been appropriately
    challenged by the Respondent in a  further  written  response  dated  7
    December 2020.

10. At the oral hearing, on behalf of the Appellant, Mr Ali submitted  that
    there was only one live issue before the First-tier Tribunal which  was
    the genuineness of the Appellant's partner's second employment  at  the
    date of application; no issue having  been  taken  with  the  level  of
    earnings, such that once the First-tier Tribunal made  a  finding  that
    the employment was genuine, the appeal should have  been  allowed.   In
    any event, if the First-tier Tribunal had correctly  applied  paragraph
    13 of Appendix FM-SE to the employment, the threshold would  have  been
    met at the date of application.

11. Mr Ali accepted that this was a  human  rights  appeal  such  that  the
    relevant date was the date of hearing but submitted that  there  was  a
    delay in this case between the application being made on 19 March  2018
    and the appeal hearing  on  17  January  2020  in  which  there  was  a
    significant likelihood that circumstances could have changed.   At  the
    date of hearing,  the  Appellant's  partner  had  employment  with  two
    different employers, the second of which she was in  her  second  month
    of.  Mr Ali submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in
    assessing her income by reference to  the  evidential  requirements  in
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules in circumstances where  Article
    8 could not be qualified in that way but should have been considered as
    a standalone remedy, for which there was  sufficient  evidence  of  the
    required income level.  Mr Ali accepted that  there  was  only  limited
    evidence of the Appellant's partner's recent employment, consisting  of
    one payslip (supported by a corresponding bank statement) and  a  brief
    letter from an accountant; but that there was no issue taken  with  the
    genuineness of this employment.

12. In relation to the assessment of proportionality, Mr Ali accepted  that
    there was little evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  to  the
    impact of the refusal of  entry  clearance  on  the  Appellant  or  his
    partner.  However, it was known that  the  Appellant's  partner  was  a
    British citizen, settled in the  United  Kingdom  with  employment  and
    there was no evidence that she had ever had recourse to  public  funds.
    The couple had been married for five years so had had a long period  of
    separation already.   These  were  all  matters  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should have considered even in  the  absence  of  any  further
    detail or supporting evidence.

13. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Isherwood opposed  the  appeal  on  the
    basis that there was  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  Paragraph 3 of the decision correctly  identifies
    that the relevant date in a human rights appeal is the date of  hearing
    and the decision follows the requirements for consideration of  Article
    8, with consideration of whether a person meets the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules being a weighty but not determinative factor  in  the
    assessment.

14. As to the income requirements, Ms Isherwood noted that there  has  been
    no explanation of the application of paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE  to
    the  income  at  date  of  application  and  no  indication  that   any
    submissions were made to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  relying  on  this.
    There would in any event when considering income need to be a reference
    back to paragraph GEN.3.1.1 of Appendix FM that the  refusal  would  be
    unduly harsh.  The Appellant did not put his case  on  that  basis  and
    there is no evidence that the refusal would have any such consequences.



15. The First-tier Tribunal concluded in paragraph 12  that  the  Appellant
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the  date  of
    application or at the date of hearing  and  there  is  nothing  in  the
    decision to suggest that in those  circumstances,  the  refusal  was  a
    disproportionate interference with the Appellant's right to respect for
    family life.  Whilst the conclusion and  reasons  on  the  appeal  were
    relatively brief, they were sufficient on the facts before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Findings and reasons

 1. There is no material error of law on the first ground of appeal  as  to
    the First-tier Tribunal's calculation of the Sponsor's  income  at  the
    date of application for entry clearance, the matters  put  forward  are
    simply not material to the outcome of a human rights appeal  which,  as
    correctly identified by the First-tier Tribunal  and  accepted  by  the
    Appellant, concerns the situation at the date of hearing  and  not  the
    date of application.  In this case, the Sponsor's employment originally
    relied upon in the application ended in part only two weeks  after  the
    refusal of entry clearance and completely by the time  the  appeal  was
    heard.  Whilst it will often be the case that there has been  a  change
    of circumstances between application and any appeal hearing due to  the
    passage of time, that does not detract  from  the  Tribunal's  duty  to
    consider the circumstances at the date of hearing  in  a  human  rights
    appeal.  On the facts, whether or not the  minimum  income  requirement
    was met at  the  date  of  application,  however  calculated,  was  not
    relevant to the issue of whether it was met at the date of hearing  (to
    support the proposition that the Appellant met the requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules at the date of  hearing  such  that  there  would  be
    little or no public interest in the refusal of entry clearance and  the
    appeal should therefore be allowed on  human  rights  grounds)  as  the
    income relied upon was by then from completely different sources.

 2. There was  reference  to  a  significant  delay  between  the  date  of
    application and date of hearing, but nothing to suggest that  this  was
    in any way unlawful or due to the Respondent.  Only if it was could  it
    be even arguable that satisfaction of the Immigration Rules at the date
    of application may have been a relevant  consideration  when  assessing
    the public interest in the refusal of entry clearance.

 3. In relation to the second ground of appeal, the issue of calculation of
    the Sponsor's earnings at the date of hearing  was  raised  during  the
    hearing, as set out in paragraph 12  of  the  decision.   The  Tribunal
    noted that the requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE were mandatory and
    that, "As matters stand there is no evidence to show that the Sponsor's
    earnings yet meet the minimum required and the fact that they may do if
    both jobs are retained would support a future application  but  is  not
    sufficient for the position at the date of hearing.   In  addition  the
    evidence would [not] meet the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  and  the
    Appellant's case would fall on that basis too."

 4. The Tribunal found in paragraph 12 firstly, that the  Sponsor's  income
    did not yet meet the minimum income threshold and  secondly,  that  the
    evidence did not meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.   The  same
    findings are repeated in paragraph 14 of the decision.

 5. Although Counsel was unable before me to identity any authority for the
    proposition that in a human rights appeal the Tribunal should  adopt  a
    broader brush assessment of the income threshold rather than  assessing
    whether it is met by reference to all of the evidential requirements in
    Appendix FM-SE; there is at least some support for that in the  Supreme
    Court's decision in MM (Lebanon) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 10, see in particular  paragraphs  99  and  100.
    However, this does not assist the  Appellant  because  of  the  primary
    finding of the Tribunal that the  Sponsor's  income  did  not,  on  the
    evidence  before  the  Tribunal,  meet  the  minimum  income  threshold
    required and in addition, did not meet the evidential requirements.

 6. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal as to the Sponsor's  income
    at the date of hearing was that she was working 30 hours per  week  for
    World Duty Free with an annual salary of  ï¿½13,587.70  (which  does  not
    appear to have been in dispute) and that she had  commenced  employment
    in a second job on 1  December  2019.   The  evidence  of  that  second
    employment was very limited.  The Sponsor's written statement  includes
    the start date with Flower Wall Shop Ltd on a flexible hours'  contract
    and an annual salary of ï¿½7599.95.  There is a letter from SKN Chartered
    Accountants confirming a PAYE reference, start date and monthly  salary
    of ï¿½633.33 gross; supported by a single payslip for that amount  and  a
    corresponding bank statement showing receipt.  There is no contract  of
    employment, no detail of the hours worked or whether these  were  fixed
    per month and to the contrary, the  Sponsor's  evidence  was  that  the
    hours were flexible such that  it  was  at  best  unclear  whether  her
    monthly earnings would be consistent and not even two  months'  history
    to support regular earnings.  In  these  circumstances  and  where  the
    employment was very recent with only a single month completed,  it  was
    entirely open to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  find  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence to show that the minimum income threshold was met
    at the date of hearing.

 7. For these reasons there is no material  error  of  law  on  the  second
    ground of appeal  either.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    substance of the Immigration Rules in relation to  the  minimum  income
    was not met at the date of hearing, not solely because  the  evidential
    requirements for the same  not  being  met  (this  being  given  as  an
    additional reason for the requirement not being met) and  therefore  TZ
    (Pakistan) does not assist the Appellant.

 8. In relation the third  ground  of  appeal,  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    findings were brief, contained only in paragraph 14, which  essentially
    concluded that the Appellant does not meet the Immigration Rules, which
    was a significant factor and there were no circumstances to  justify  a
    grant of  leave  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Appellant
    identifies that the decision does  not  contain  any  consideration  of
    whether the couple could enjoy family  life  together  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom or what the impact of the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
    would be on them.  However, there was simply no  evidence  from  either
    the  Appellant  or  Sponsor  on  either  point  that  could  have  been
    considered in substance by the First-tier  Tribunal  on  either  point.
    The background facts that the Sponsor was settled in the United Kingdom
    and employed here fall far short of identifying any factors which would
    even arguably support a finding that the  refusal  of  entry  clearance
    would amount to a disproportionate interference with the Appellant  and
    Sponsor's right to respect for family life.  On the basis of  the  lack
    of evidence before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  brief  conclusion  on
    Article 8 in the context of an appeal pursued essentially on the  basis
    that the Immigration Rules had been met was  adequate  and  I  find  no
    error of law on the third ground.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to dismiss the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
