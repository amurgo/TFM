                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Owens, promulgated on 26 March 2019. Permission to appeal  was  granted
    by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey on 25 June 2019.



Anonymity

 2. Such a direction has been made previously and as this is  a  protection
    matter, is repeated below.

Background

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 28  March  2013,  having
    been granted leave to enter as a visitor. He overstayed after his leave
    expired on 21 September 2013. The  appellant  was  encountered  working
    without permission on 28 January 2016 and  shortly  thereafter  applied
    for asylum.

 4. The appellant's asylum claim was based on the appellant's fear that his
    late wife's parents would kill him because he had eloped with her.  The
    appellant's claimed circumstances  and  subjective  fear  was  rejected
    owing to inconsistencies and because he  had  provided  a  false  First
    Information Report (FIR) to the Home Office.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant was the sole witness  and  he  relied  on  a  substantial
    quantity of supporting documents. The judge did  not  accept  that  the
    medical evidence supported the appellant's  claim  of  past  trauma  in
    Pakistan. Nor did the judge accept the credibility of  the  appellant's
    claim that his wife, child and father had been killed by his in-laws or
    that the documentary evidence was reliable.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal argued that the judge made a  series  of  factual
    errors. Permission to appeal was granted on this basis with the proviso
    that "materiality must be argued to establish an arguable error of  law
    which is material to the decision upon credibility and real risks."

 7. The respondent's Rule 24 response, received on 8 August 2019, indicated
    that the appeal was opposed and  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    directed himself appropriately.

The hearing

 8. Mr Shahzad highlighted a series what he argued were factual errors made
    by the judge. Firstly, he drew my attention to [65] where he stated the
    judge erred  in  finding  that  the  appellant  commenced  proceedings,
    whereas  the  proceedings  were  issued  by  the  state  following  the
    complaint started by the father of the appellant's wife. At this  point
    I informed Mr Shahzad that the judge was clearly referring to the Court
    of Sessions proceedings which were started on his behalf.  He  made  no
    response.

 9. Secondly, at [66], Mr Shahzad contended  that  the  judge  stated  that
    there was no verification of the court documents or  detailed  evidence
    regarding the lawyer. He argued that this was not the case and  pointed
    to several instances of court documents being, ostensibly,  stamped  by
    court officials.

10. Regarding the evidence of the reliability of the lawyer's  letters,  Mr
    Shahzad asked me to note that  the  lawyer's  letter  at  p106  of  the
    appellant's bundle gave a licence number and mentioned that the  author
    was a member of Lahore High Court Bar Association.   In  addition,  the
    lawyer's details appeared on documents which had been  stamped  by  the
    District & Session Judge in Lahore (at  page  114  of  the  appellant's
    bundle).

11. Thirdly, Mr Shahzad contended that at [68] the judge was wrong to state
    that the appellant appeared to have little knowledge of  what  happened
    to the bail bond equivalent to approximately ï¿½15,000. Mr Shahzad boldly
    submitted that the judge had wrongly recorded this  evidence.  At  this
    juncture, I informed Mr Shahzad (who  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in this case) that if he wished to give evidence  as  to  what
    the appellant's testimony was he ought to have done  so  in  a  witness
    statement and at the same time separate  counsel  ought  to  have  been
    instructed,  HA (Conduct of hearing: evidence required) Somalia  [2009]
    UKAIT 00018 applied.

12. Fourthly, Mr Shahzad expressed disagreement with the judge's finding at
    [69] that it was not credible that he could leave the country if he was
    wanted for murder. Mr Shahzad submitted that the appellant  claimed  to
    have travelled to the UK on 8 March 2013 whereas the first warrant  for
    arrest was issued afterwards, in 2017. Therefore, he was able to travel
    on his passport despite the murder proceedings. Mr Shahzad referred  to
    the grant of bail, emphasising that there were no restrictions  on  the
    appellant leaving Pakistan.

13. Fifthly, Mr Shahzad argued that the judge was wrong to  state  at  [70]
    that the appellant ought  to  have  known  if  there  were  extradition
    proceedings. In any event, the authorities of Pakistan were  not  aware
    that the appellant was in the  United  Kingdom,  as  evidenced  by  the
    service of arrest warrants at his address in Pakistan.

14. In closing, Mr Shahzad described the appellant's account  as  plausible
    and consistent.

15. For the respondent, Mr Melvin relied on the Rule 24 response. He argued
    that the judge considered the  many  court  documents  at  [73-74]  and
    placed no weight on them given the appellant's deception and  the  ease
    with which forged documents could be obtained. Mr  Melvin  argued  that
    the judge considered all the relevant evidence going  to  core  of  the
    claim which was that the appellant was  accused  by  wife's  family  of
    murdering her. He argued that the judge was entitled to find  that  the
    ability of the appellant and his wife to live safely in Karachi, have a
    child  and  run  a  business  without  problems  for  four  years   was
    inconsistent with her family wanting to kill the appellant.  Mr  Melvin
    asked me to note the  judge's  findings  relating  to  there  being  no
    mention of the death of the appellant's wife when the appellant applied
    for a visa as well the  implausible  nature  of  his  failure  to  make
    enquiries regarding his  child,  despite  claiming  to  be  in  regular
    contact with lawyers in Pakistan [61-62].  He argued that the judge had
    agreed that the FIR  was  not  a  genuine  document  and  rejected  the
    appellant's explanation. Mr Melvin agreed that some of the evidence was
    confusing but argued that the points raised regarding the bail bond and
    extradition were not material to the core of the claim, which was  that
    the appellant's spouse had been kidnapped and murdered.

16. Mr Shahzad attempted to raise a new matter in  response  and  otherwise
    had nothing to add.

17. At the end of the hearing, I decided that the First-tier Tribunal  made
    no material error of law and upheld the decision. My  reasons  are  set
    out below.

Decision on error of law

18. Notwithstanding Mr Melvin's acceptance that some of  the  evidence  was
    confusing, I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  made  no  factual
    errors in reaching his findings.

19. It was argued that the judge was wrong  to  state  that  there  was  no
    independent verification of  the  court  documents  [66].  Indeed,  the
    appellant's current representatives had obtained an adjournment  at  an
    earlier stage to verify those documents. While a letter  from  Mr  Amir
    Butt had been obtained in support of the claim that the court documents
    were  reliable,  the  judge  rejected  this  for  sustainable   reasons
    including  that  the  letter  was  not  dated  and  that  the   alleged
    verification resembled the rest of the letters  produced.  That  letter
    does not amount to independent verification and Mr Shahzad  pointed  me
    to no other document in the bundle.

20. The judge was entitled to conclude that there was insufficient evidence
    that Mr Amir Butt was an advocate of the High Court. The judge  rightly
    notes that his letter lacks a "fax number, email or website, a copy  of
    his licence to practice or confirmation that  he  is  regulated  by  an
    appropriate body in Pakistan." The  inclusion  of  an  alleged  licence
    number and an assertion that he is a member of the  Lahore  High  Court
    Bar Association does not amount to reliable evidence that the author of
    the letter is who he claims to be.

21. Mr Shahzad made much of the judge's findings at [65] which  he  appears
    to have misunderstood.  The  judge  stated,  "I  agree...  that  it  is
    inherently implausible that the appellant would have been able to start
    proceedings at the Court of Session in Lahore relating to  a  FIR  that
    did not exist or was falsified..." Mr Shahzad's argument was  that  the
    judge did not realise that the appellant did not start the  proceedings
    but that these were commenced by the state.  The copy of the  Court  of
    Sessions petition shows that the appellant's mother is  the  petitioner
    and that she is responding to the  claims  made  in  FIR  04/2013.  The
    aforementioned FIR was verified by the respondent and  found  to  be  a
    false document and that conclusion was upheld by the judge. There is no
    challenge to that finding in the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.
    In these circumstances, the judge made no error and had  little  option
    but to reject the reliability of the Court of Session petition for  the
    reasons given.

22. Mr Shahzad informed me that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  say  that  the
    appellant "was not able to  state  if  or  when  (the  bail  bond)  was
    forfeited..." Despite representing the appellant at the hearing, he has
    not produced a statement or his own record of the appellant's evidence.
    This issue formed part of the grounds of appeal which were attached  to
    the application for permission to appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dated 9 April 2019. Therefore, Mr Shahzad, who drafted  those  grounds,
    ought to have been aware that he would be  required  to  reinforce  his
    arguments with evidence. There is no basis for disturbing  the  judge's
    conclusions regarding this  matter,  which  are  supported  with  sound
    reasoning.

23. Lastly, Mr Shahzad  claimed  that  the  judge  misdirected  himself  in
    finding that the appellant ought to have known whether  an  extradition
    order was made. This ground does not address the reasons the judge gave
    for this  finding,  those  being  that  it  was  inconsistent  for  the
    appellant to claim that he did not know about the extradition  when  he
    claimed knowledge of being wanted on murder charges.  Furthermore,  the
    judge notes that the appellant was  asked  about  this  matter  in  his
    asylum interview three years earlier and also claimed to have a  lawyer
    representing him in Pakistan and therefore if his account were true, he
    ought to have known whether an extradition order was made.

24. There are no errors of law in the judge's decision and it is upheld  in
    its entirety.



Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
