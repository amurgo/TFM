Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Z Nasim, Counsel, instructed by Whitefield
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are appeals by the four Appellants against the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Reid (the judge), dated 30 June 2016, in  which  he
    dismissed their first-instance appeals.

 2. The Appellants had applied for entry clearance as  family  visitors  in
    order to attend the wedding of  the  first  Appellant's  daughter  (the
    sponsor and sister of the three remaining Appellants), which was due to
    take place in March 2015.

 3. In refusing the applications by decisions dated 12 and 5 January  2015,
    the Respondent concluded that the requirements of paragraph 41  of  the
    Immigration Rules were not satisfied.  In particular it was  said  that
    the evidence did not support the contention that  the  Appellants  were
    genuine visitors or  that  they  would  leave  the  United  Kingdom  in
    compliance with the conditions of any leave granted.   In  addition  it
    was said that the first Appellant had practised deception  when  making
    the application. This allegation was based on  an  alleged  failure  to
    disclose a previous refusal of entry clearance in 2006 when  completing
    the application form in 2015.  As a result  paragraph  320(7A)  of  the
    Rules applied and this  provided  a  further  basis  for  refusing  the
    applications.




The judge's decision

 4. The Appellants' right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  limited
    in effect to whether the decisions breached Article 8.   In  addressing
    this issue the judge noted at paragraph  16  and  17  that  the  United
    Kingdom sponsor was an adult and was due to marry a husband in March of
    2015.  The sponsor was not dependent upon the first Appellant.

 5. The judge commented at paragraph 17 that "her new family  is  therefore
    in the United Kingdom with her husband though she still  has  relatives
    in Pakistan including her parents and younger siblings".

 6. At paragraph 18 the judge goes on to note  that  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing the wedding of the sponsor had already of  course  taken  place
    and the judge found the absence of an ongoing reason for  the  proposed
    visit was a relevant factor.

 7. In paragraph 19 he finds that the sponsor and/or her husband  could  go
    and visit the Appellants in Pakistan.

 8. Then at paragraphs 20 and 21 the  judge  concludes  that  the  decision
    under appeal did not have consequences of such gravity that  Article  8
    was engaged.  As a result of this, the judge's assessment of Article  8
    ceased at that point.  He did not go on to consider proportionality  or
    to what extent the requirements of paragraph 41 were in fact met.

 9. At paragraph 23, however, the judge does find in favour  of  the  first
    Appellant in relation to the allegation of deception.  He clearly finds
    that the first Appellant had not been dishonest in any way.

10. The appeals were all duly dismissed.




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

11. The grounds in general terms take issue with the judge's  treatment  of
    the Article 8 assessment. Included in the challenge is  the  fact  that
    the judge took into account matters arising after the date of  decision
    and failed to apply appropriate case law such as Mostafa (Article 8  in
    entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC).

12. Permission to appeal was granted by a Designated Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 25 November 2016.




The hearing before me

13. At the outset of the hearing both representatives drew my attention  to
    the Respondent's rule 24 response dated  6  December  2016.   With  his
    customary fairness, Mr Tarlow specifically directed me to paragraph  2,
    in which it is said:

             "It is arguable that a visit of parents to a daughter  for  an
             occasion such as a family wedding  could  engage  private  and
             family life but the Secretary of State leaves this matter  for
             the Upper Tribunal to determine whether in such  circumstances
             Article 8 is engaged".

14. Mr Tarlow indicated that  he  read  this  passage  as  amounting  to  a
    concession that Article 8 was in fact engaged, and that the  judge  had
    erred in concluding otherwise.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Nasim agreed
    with this analysis.

15. Mr Tarlow suggested that the only issue really remaining  was  that  of
    proportionality. He accepted that the judge had  failed  to  deal  with
    that issue whatsoever given his conclusion on Article 8(1).




Decision on error of law

16. I find that there is a material error of law in the  judge's  decision.
    In the first instance I base this upon what is in effect  a  concession
    made either in the Rule 24  response  itself  or  by  reference  to  Mr
    Tarlow's express interpretation of this at the hearing before me.

17. Alternatively, and in any event, I would conclude that the judge was in
    error on his analysis of the engagement of  Article  8.  There  was  no
    dispute as to the relationship between the Appellants and  the  sponsor
    in this case.  There was no dispute that a wedding was in fact  planned
    and that it was the primary purpose of the visit to attend this  event.
    Although of course the sponsor has at all material times been an  adult
    this does not of itself preclude the existence of family life. When one
    takes the case law as a  whole,  together  with  the  broad  scope  and
    purposes of Article 8, it is clear enough to me that Article  8  should
    have been engaged and the judge's treatment of  this  particular  issue
    was inadequate.

18. In addition, it is somewhat unclear as to what the judge  was  in  fact
    finding in respect of the Article 8 issue.  Whilst on the one  hand  he
    appears to be suggesting that there was in fact no family life at  all,
    on the other (having regard to paragraph 20 and 21) it might appear  as
    though he was finding that whilst there was family life  there  was  no
    sufficiently serious interference.  The lack of clarity on  this  point
    adds further support to my conclusions that the judge has erred.

19. It is obvious in this case that the error is material because the judge
    did not go on to consider proportionality at all, nor did he engage  at
    all with the requirements of paragraph 41 which as we know  from  cases
    such as Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT  00487  (IAC)  is
    something that should be done.

20.  A  further  material  error  is  that  the  judge  took  post-decision
    circumstances into account and relied on these when finding against the
    Appellants.

21. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set
    aside.




Remaking the decision

22. Both representatives were agreed that I should remake the  decision  in
    these appeals on the evidence before me.

23. For the Appellant, Mr Nasim submitted  that  all  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41 had in fact been  met.   The  first  Appellant's  ties  to
    Pakistan included her husband being there, the existence of  land,  and
    the fact  that  her  three  children  (and  co-Appellants)  were  well-
    established in school and had been given limited permission  to  attend
    the wedding.  There is evidence  contained  in  the  papers  before  me
    supporting each of these contentions.  It is undisputed,  submitted  Mr
    Nasim, that the purpose of the visit had  always  been  to  attend  the
    wedding, a specific and important family event. He also noted the  fact
    that the deception issue had been  decided  in  the  first  Appellant's
    favour.  This finding had not been challenged by the Respondent.

24. Mr Tarlow sought to rely  on  the  refusal  notices  and  urged  me  to
    consider the importance of effective immigration control.

25. Having assessed all of the evidence  before  me  I  conclude  that  the
    Respondent's decisions ultimately were disproportionate.

26. I make it clear that in light of the  Respondent's  position  in  these
    appeals, the relevant case law,  and  the  evidence  before  me,  I  am
    finding as a fact that there was as at the date of decision family life
    as between all of the Appellants and the sponsor.  I also find that the
    decision sufficiently interfered with that family life.

27. In respect of  my  assessment  of  proportionality,  I  first  turn  to
    paragraph 41 of the Rules.  I find that the  objections  taken  by  the
    Respondent in the refusal notices are misconceived.   On  the  evidence
    before me (in particular that contained in the  Appellant's  bundle)  I
    find as follows:

                  a) the first Appellant was in fact married  and  that  her
                     husband, remaining as he was in Pakistan, represented a
                     good tie to her country of origin;

                  b) the evidence also shows that there was  a  sufficiently
                     secure financial base in that  country  to  provide  an
                     incentive for her return;

                  c)  the  other  Appellants,  were  established  in   their
                     education  in  Pakistan  and  had  been  given  limited
                     permission to come to this country for the wedding  and
                     then to return to school.  This  provides  yet  another
                     and important  tie  to  Pakistan  both  for  the  first
                     Appellant and the other three;

                  d) all of the Appellants were genuine visitor applicants.

28. The significance  of  meeting  the  requirements  of  paragraph  41  is
    reflected in the decision of Mostafa (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)
    [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC), in which  it  is  said  that  compliance  with
    paragraph  41,  though  not  determinative   in   the   proportionality
    assessment, is nonetheless capable of being a weighty  factor.   In  my
    view that is precisely the case here.

29. There is no evidence of any other wrongdoing by any of the  Appellants,
    there is no issue in respect of accommodation or maintenance  once  the
    Appellants were in the United Kingdom, and of course, as at the date of
    decision, the wedding of the sponsor had yet to take place so that  the
    purpose of the visit remained valid.

30. The importance of maintaining effective immigration control is  a  very
    weighty factor on the Respondent's side of the scales, and it  is  only
    unusually that an Article 8 case will succeed in  a  visit  visa  case.
    However, here the evidence is credible, the purpose of the visit has  a
    strong bearing on the promotion of continuing family  life  (albeit  in
    relation to a specific event), and that the relevant Rules  for  family
    visits have been met.

31. In light of the above I allow all of the appeals on Article 8  grounds.





Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  material
errors of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

I remake the decision by  allowing  the  appeals  on  human  rights  grounds
(Article 8 ECHR).



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have  decided  to  make  whole  fee
awards of �140.00 in respect of each appeal. The Appellants have  won  their
appeals and there are no proper reasons for an award to be reduced.
