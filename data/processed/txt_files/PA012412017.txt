                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION CONTINUED)
                                                                  Respondent


                             NOTICE OF DECISION
                             Rule 17 withdrawal

1.    The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon who,  by
    a determination promulgated on 12 June 2017, allowed the appeal of  the
    appellant before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (the  respondent  in  this
    appeal) on Humanitarian Protection grounds.

2.    The Upper Tribunal received  correspondence  dated  04  December  2017
    from the Secretary of State saying that  she  wishes  to  withdraw  her
    case.

3.    Paragraph 17 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provides for a party to withdraw its case  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    only with the consent of the Tribunal. If the Tribunal does so  consent
    this amounts to a  final  disposal  of  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

4.    There does not appear to have been a cross-appeal  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appellant against Judge Moxon's decision to dismiss the appeal
    on Refugee Convention grounds.

5.    Subject to consideration being given  to  any  request  received  from
    either party to the contrary by 16.00 hrs  on  14  December  2017,  the
    Upper Tribunal consents to the Secretary of State withdrawing her  case
    before the Upper Tribunal. If no further representations are  made  the
    withdrawal will take effect from that date and time.

6.    The effect of the withdrawal will  be  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    shall stand and the Upper Tribunal will take no further action.
