For the Appellant:     Ms L Turnbull, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Whilst no anonymity direction has been made hitherto the  intimate  and
    person nature of the evidence in this appeal justifies  the  making  of
    such a direction.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the Ivory Coast who initially entered the
    United Kingdom in 2002 via a visit visa. In 2011 he applied  for  leave
    to remain on compassionate grounds. His application was refused and  he
    made further representations. Following  an  application  for  Judicial
    Review permission was refused and he was directed to apply for  asylum.
    This he duly did and on 14 October 2016 a decision was made  to  refuse
    his claim and to remove him from the United Kingdom. He  appealed  that
    decision on the basis that removal from the United Kingdom would  be  a
    breach of the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the  1951  Geneva
    Convention and a breach of his  protected  human  rights,  specifically
    Articles 2, 3 and 8 and Article 3 on medical grounds.

 3. His appeal was heard by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Rosemary
    Bradshaw who in a decision promulgated on 26 January 2017 dismissed  it
    on all grounds.

 4. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. On  9  May  2017  Designated
    Judge McCarthy granted that application. His reasons for so doing were:-



        "1.  The appellant applies in time for permission to appeal to  the
            Upper Tribunal against the decision and reasons statement of FtT
            Judge R Bradshaw that was issued on 26 January 2017.  The  judge
            decided the appellant is not a refugee from Ivory Coast or  that
            he otherwise needs international protection.

         2. The grounds of application allege that the panel erred  by:  (i)
            making  inconsistent  findings  by  accepting  the   appellant's
            evidence but findings he would not be at risk  on  return;  (ii)
            imposing a burden on the appellant  to  verify  documents  which
            could easily be verified by the  respondent,  (iii)  not  giving
            appropriate weight to the fact the appellant's family  had  been
            given refugee status in Ghana, (iv) making a  decision  contrary
            to Paposhvili v Belgium regarding the appellant's  very  serious
            medical condition, and (v) making contradictory findings  as  to
            how the appellant might support himself (e.g.  by  working  when
            the appellant is unable to  work,  by  charity  from  the  local
            church when the appellant is absent).

         3. All grounds are arguable. There appear to  be  inconsistent  and
            contradictory findings in the decision  and  reasons  statement.
            The approach to medical cases has changed because of  Paposhvili
            but that is not reflected by the  judge's  analysis.  The  other
            grounds are probably weaker but there is sufficient basis not to
            exclude them.

         4. As I find there are arguable legal errors, I grant permission to
            appeal."

 5. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 6. At the outset I shared with both representatives a letter the  Tribunal
    received from the Solicitors acting for the Appellant dated 26 May 2017
    within which it refers to  a  letter  from  Dr.  Debra  Joseph  to  the
    Appellant dated 21 March 2017 and which was described as "new evidence"
    which the Appellant received post-the decision of Judge Bradshaw.  That
    letter states:

         "For the purposes of your  immigration  appeal,  I  would  like  to
         answer the questions that you have posed:

        1) What was my genuine life expectancy without the treatment I have
           been given?

        You were diagnosed with high grade prostate cancer that had already
        spread to your lymph nodes and bone, in February 2016. We commenced
        androgen deprivation therapy and then chemotherapy. Without any  of
        these your life expectancy would likely have been in the  order  of
        months to a year.

        2) What  is  my  life  expectancy  now,  taking  into  account  the
           treatment I have received.

        You have had androgen deprivation therapy and  chemotherapy,  which
        you completed in July 2016. Unfortunately your PSA  didn't  respond
        as well as we would have hoped with the docetaxel and so soon after
        we started enzalutamide. Now your PSA is coming up again and it may
        be that we have to change treatments soon. Your life expectancy now
        would be in the order of about 12-18 months.

        I hope that his news isn't too upsetting for you.

        Yours sincerely,

        Debra Josephs".

 7. In the course of her submissions I asked Ms Turnbull  what  weight  she
    expected me to put on this letter. She appreciated that it  had  played
    no part in the decision now under  consideration  and  I  conclude  the
    Judge cannot be criticised for not dealing with evidence which was  not
    before her.

 8. Ms Turnbull  handed  up  a  skeleton  argument  and  the  authority  of
    Paposhvili v Belgium (App No.  4738/10).  Both  have  been  taken  into
    account by me.

 9. Arguing that the Judge had material erred in her decision  Ms  Turnbull
    put forward three strands of  argument  being  firstly  the  making  of
    inconsistent findings, secondly in relation to the Appellant's terminal
    medical condition and thirdly as to Article 8.

10. From paragraph 46 of her decision she argued that the Judge appeared to
    accept that "the background evidence confirms that  the  civil  war  in
    2002 led to widespread ethnic  and  general  violence  and  killing  of
    civilians. The fighting ended in 2004 with  continuing  tensions  until
    2006 with a peace agreement signed in 2007. Fighting  resumed  in  2011
    following the 2010 elections". Also at paragraph 47 the  Judge  accepts
    that "the evidence is consistent with the Appellant's wife and children
    fleeing Bangolo in 2002. They were safe there from at least  2007  when
    they re-established contact with the  Appellant  but  resumed  fighting
    caused them to flee to Ghana in 2011". The Judge states at paragraph 53
    of  her  decision  that  the  Appellant  has   "produced   certificates
    confirming the status of his wife and  the  3  young  women  as  asylum
    seekers in Ghana whose claims were being examined.  I  noted  that  the
    documentation which the Respondent has had the opportunity but has  not
    checked or verified but which at the very least indicate that they have
    registered claims and have status  in  Ghana  as  asylum  seekers".  Ms
    Turnbull then referred me to paragraphs 30 and 31 of the  authority  of
    PJ v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1011. They State:-

         "30.     Therefore, simply because a relevant document is
             potentially capable of being verified does not mean that the
             national authorities have an obligation to take this step.
             Instead, it may be necessary to make an enquiry in order to
             verify the authenticity and reliability of a document -
             depending always on the particular facts of the case - when it
             is at the centre of the request for protection, and when a
             simple process of enquiry will conclusively resolve its
             authenticity and reliability (see Singh v Belgium [101] -
             [105]). I do not consider that there is any material difference
             in approach between the decisions in Tanveer Ahmed and Singh v
             Belgium, in that in the latter case the Strasbourg court simply
             addressed one of the exceptional situations when national
             authorities should undertake a process of verification.

         31.      In my  view,  the  consequence  of  a  decision  that  the
             national authorities are in  breach  of  their  obligations  to
             undertake  a  proper  process  of  verification  is  that   the
             Secretary of State is unable thereafter to  mount  an  argument
             challenging the authenticity of the relevant  documents  unless
             and until the breach is  rectified  by  a  proper  enquiry.  It
             follows that if  a  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
             overturned  on  appeal  on  this  basis,  absent   a   suitable
             investigation it will not open  to  her  to  suggest  that  the
             document  or  documents  are  forged  or  otherwise   are   not
             authentic."

    She submitted that at paragraph 54 of her decision the Judge has stated
    that she has "no reason to question the authenticity of  the  documents
    nor what happened during the 2011 fighting". However, she goes  on  say
    "the basis of their flight to Ghana and their  claim  to  asylum  is  a
    matter for the appellant to demonstrate to  the  required  standard  if
    this is in support of his asylum claim". Having said at paragraph 54 of
    her decision that she has no reason to doubt the  authenticity  of  the
    documents nor what happened during  the  2011  fighting  the  Judge  is
    inconsistent in finding that the Appellant would  not  be  at  risk  on
    return as his profile was not such that it would attract attention.

11. She then took me to page 78 of the Appellant's bundle to the First-tier
    Tribunal and in particular a letter dated  27  October  2016  from  Dr.
    Rachel Bennett. She argued that whilst the Judge refers firstly to this
    letter and indeed other letters it  appears  that  she  has  not  fully
    appreciated the Appellant's condition is terminal. He is in receipt  of
    Palliative chemotherapy  and  medication.  Palliative  means  that  the
    treatment is to  alleviate  symptoms  only  (alleviating  the  pain  of
    symptoms without eliminating the cause). Palliative care  is  given  to
    patients with terminal illness. Ms Turnbull referred me to paragraph 65
    of the Judge's decision where  she  finds  that  although  the  medical
    evidence indicates the  Appellant  is  receiving  Palliative  care  the
    evidence does not in fact address  his  life  expectancy  although  his
    cancer has spread and the disease is still active and  is  significant.
    Neither does the evidence overall suggest that his illness in itself is
    at the critical stage such as to trigger Article 3. At paragraph 69  of
    her decision the Judge refers to Paposhvili and states that it  is  not
    binding on her but rather that it "is of persuasive value  and  I  note
    particularly paragraph 183 where the court considered that "other  very
    exceptional cases" within the meaning of the judgment in  N  should  be
    understood to refer to  situations  involved  with  the  removal  of  a
    seriously ill person in which substantial grounds have been  shown  for
    believing he, although not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real
    risk, on account  of  the  absence  of  appropriate  treatment  in  the
    receiving country or the lack of access to  such  treatment,  of  being
    exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in  his  state  of
    health resulting in intense suffering or to a significant reduction  in
    life expectancy". Then despite having considered this medical  evidence
    the Judge concludes at paragraph 70 of her decision,

         "70. That is not  what  the  very  extensive  and  helpful  medical
             evidence in fact indicates in this case".

    This Ms Turnbull submitted  is  a  material  error  as  the  Judge  has
    misdirection herself in respect of the case of Paposhvili.

12. Finally as to Article 8 it is surprising that the Judge finds that  the
    Appellant would be able to work and support himself upon return to  his
    country of origin notwithstanding the fact that he is suffering from  a
    very serious terminal illness. Alternatively  the  Judge  has  made  an
    unsubstantiated finding that his  church  congregation  in  the  United
    Kingdom would continue to financially support him should he be required
    to leave the United Kingdom. There are significant  obstacles  to  this
    Appellant integrating back into life in the Ivory Coast due to his very
    terminal disease. The  Judge  in  considering  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules states at paragraph 77 of her decision "it is not  on
    balance clear from the medical evidence that it is  inevitable  that  a
    difficult early and unpleasant death would follow  his  return  to  the
    Ivory Coast or that the continuity of his current medical treatment  is
    necessary to be viable given that his treatment  is  not  curative  but
    palliative".  Ms  Turnbull  submits  that  the  Judge  has  failed   to
    appreciate the seriousness of the Appellant's condition. He  is  a  man
    with  terminal  cancer  which  will  undoubtedly  get   worse   without
    continuation of the medical treatment he is currently receiving.  There
    is a serious risk that the Appellant will suffer deterioration  in  his
    health without treatment and he  will  suffer  a  difficult  early  and
    unpleasant death if he is removed from the United Kingdom.

13. Mr Clarke urged me to accept that there was no material  error  of  law
    within the Judge's decision. In paragraphs 47 to 54 the Judge  properly
    considered the issue of current risk and evidence  from  the  Appellant
    that was consistent with background material. The Judge was entitled to
    find at paragraph 48 of  her  decision  that  the  background  evidence
    regarding any risk to political oppositionists appears  to  be  limited
    and there was nothing found in the Appellant's  profile  to  place  him
    within a risk category. The Judge was equally entitled to find that  he
    would similarly not be  at  risk  consequent  upon  his  ethnicity.  At
    paragraph 92 of the Appellant's  bundle  is  the  "GRB  Asylum  Seekers
    Certificate" of the Appellant's wife which  the  Judge  deals  with  at
    paragraph 53 of her own decision. Contrary to the  Appellant's  grounds
    the Judge has not erred in her approach to this certificate in light of
    the authority of PJ v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1011. Paragraph  30  thereof
    states:-

         "30.     Therefore, simply because a relevant document is
             potentially capable of being verified does not mean that the
             national authorities have an obligation to take this step.
             Instead, it may be necessary to make an enquiry in order to
             verify the authenticity and reliability of a document -
             depending always on the particular facts of the case - when it
             is at the centre of the request for protection, and when a
             simple process of enquiry will conclusively resolve its
             authenticity and reliability (see Singh v Belgium [101] -
             [105]). I do not consider that there is any material
             difference in approach between the decisions in Tanveer Ahmed
             and Singh v Belgium, in that in the latter case the Strasbourg
             court simply addressed one of the exceptional situations when
             national authorities should undertake a process of
             verification. "

14. The "GRB Asylum Seekers Certificate" does not fall  into  the  type  of
    document PJ envisages. It is here no more than a certificate  that  the
    Appellant's wife is a national of the Cote d'Ivoire and  is  an  asylum
    seeker whose claim for refugee status is being examined  by  the  Ghana
    Refugee Board. Whilst the Respondent concedes that the Judge has  erred
    in her assessment of the medical evidence Mr Clarke submitted that such
    error was not material. He referred me to paragraph 186  of  Paposhvili
    which states:-

         "186.    In  the  context  of  these  procedures,  it  is  for  the
             applicants to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented,  they  would  be
             exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G.
             v. Sweden, cited above, � 120). In this connection it  should
             be observed that a certain degree of speculation  is  inherent
             in the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it  is  not  a
             matter of requiring the persons  concerned  to  provide  clear
             proof of their claim that they would be exposed to  proscribed
             treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi  v.  Belgium,  no.
             140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). "

    I will record here that on my enquiry of Ms Turnbull as to whether  any
    evidence  was  adduced  capable  of  demonstrating   that   there   are
    substantial grounds for believing that there was no evidence to support
    the Appellant's assertion that there was no  medical  services  of  the
    kind the Appellant requires available in  his  country  of  origin  she
    responded in the negative. Mr Clarke highlighted  the  above  mentioned
    letter from Dr. Rachel Bennett which amongst other things states "it is
    realistic to expect MK to be able to access the kind of  expertise  and
    treatments that he has been receiving on the  NHS  if  he  returned  to
    Africa". Finally at paragraph 36 of her decision the Judge  found  that
    the Appellant is working and also  at  paragraph  37  where  the  Judge
    accepted the evidence of a Mr Loba who confirmed financial support from
    the church members who support the Appellant even when he has been  too
    ill to play. The Judge was entitled to come to the conclusions that she
    did at paragraph 72 of her decision  in  the  overall  context  of  the
    evidence.  Paragraph 72 states:-

         "The appellant is still able to work and there is  no  good  reason
         why the Church and its members would not continue  to  support  the
         appellant as they have done to a very large financial  extent  over
         very many years unless of course he is a mere employee which  would
         undermine  what  the  appellant  and  Mr  Loba  said  in   evidence
         generally".

    It was open to the Judge to conclude that the  members  of  his  church
    would continue to support the Appellant even  if  he  left  the  United
    Kingdom.

15. The first thing to say is that this is an Appellant  for  whom  I  have
    considerable sympathy consequent upon his  diagnosed  terminal  cancer.
    However, I am not persuaded that  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to
    appeal identify  material  errors.  So  far  as  the  asylum  issue  is
    concerned the Judge was entitled to come to the  conclusions  that  she
    did. She made findings in relation to the Appellant's  credibility  and
    set those findings into the context of the background evidence.  In  so
    doing she was entitled to come to  the  conclusions  that  she  did  in
    relation to "oppositionists" and ethnic violence  and  in  general  the
    current risk that the Appellant might face were he to  be  returned  to
    his country or origin as at the time of the Judge hearing  the  appeal.
    The Judge has not erred in her approach  to  the  "GRB  Asylum  Seekers
    Certificate". It says no more than that  the  Appellant's  wife  is  an
    asylum seeker whose claim for refugee status is being examined  by  the
    Ghana Refugee Board. Any attempt to undertake a process of verification
    in relation to it would reveal no more than is said on the face of  the
    document which would not be sufficient to override the conclusions that
    this Judge came to in making her own decision.

16. Paragraph 67 of the Judge's decision states:-

         "The appellant asserts that there is no free health  care  at  all;
         that there is no proper treatment  for  him  in  the  Ivory  Coast;
         clinics are few, private and expensive. However,  he  has  produced
         nothing specific  about  medical  services  available  whereas  the
         respondent argues that background country evidence  indicates  that
         there is a health care system in the Ivory Coast albeit not as good
         as the UK's. Better facilities are available in Abidjan  but  at  a
         high cost".

    It was acknowledged by Ms Turnbull that there was  no  evidence  before
    the First-tier Judge from  the  Appellant  regarding  medical  services
    within Ghana. The burden of producing such  evidence  rested  with  the
    Appellant and accordingly the Judge cannot be criticised for coming  to
    the conclusion that she did. Paragraph 71 of the  Judge's  decision  is
    also relevant at this point. It states:

         "Mr Sharma submitted that medical facilities are  in  short  supply
         and traditional methods of healing are relied upon. The health care
         system is mainly private at a high cost. However as stated above no
         evidence was produced to corroborate this. Mr Sharma also submitted
         that the appellant cannot work sufficiently to pay for medical care
         and support from the Church is unlikely to continue".

    Even if the Judge has erred, as Mr Clarke seems to accept, at paragraph
    63 of her decision where she analyses the authority of N her errors are
    not material to the outcome of this appeal which would have  failed  in
    any event in light of the Appellant's failure to discharge  his  burden
    in relation to the absence of medical services within his home country.
    On the evidence before her the  Judge  was  entitled  to  come  to  the
    decision that she did in relation to the broader Article  8  issue  and
    the conclusions that she made were open to her  on  the  evidence  that
    fell to be considered.

17. I hope that the Appellant's position may be resolved by way of either a
    further application or  a  reconsideration  of  it  in  due  course  on
    compassionate grounds. However, on  my  own  analysis  of  the  Judge's
    decision there are within it no material errors.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
