                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Birk, promulgated on 15th October 2014, following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 3rd September 2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Mrs Gurmeet Kaur.  The  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of India who was born on 27th October
    1971.  She entered the UK on  2nd  May  2007  and  was  issued  with  a
    residence card on 3rd October 2007.  She then applied for  a  permanent
    residence card on 22nd October 2012, on the basis of  her  EEA  Sponsor
    spouse, namely  Mr  Baldev  Singh,  a  Netherlands  national,  who  was
    exercising treaty rights in the UK.

 3. By a refusal letter dated 23rd January 2014, the  Respondent  Secretary
    of State rejected the application on  the  basis  that  she  failed  to
    provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that her EEA national spouse
    qualified as a jobseeker under Regulation 6(2)(b)  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006.  This is because from 6th  April  2008  to  5th
    April 2013, the EEA Sponsor earned no more than ï¿½5,000 in any tax year.
     It was assumed that the majority of his income came from public funds.
     He was not in "effective and genuine" employment.  He ceased to have a
    right under Regulation 13(3).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed how the issue before the  Tribunal  was  the  period
    between 10th November 2008 and 25th  May  2010  when  the  Sponsor  was
    claiming he was a "jobseeker", but his earnings were so low, that  they
    were arguably "marginal and ancillary"  (see  paragraph  4).   This  is
    because in cross-examination it was accepted that between 2007 and 2012
    the Appellant claimed housing benefit, child benefit, and  her  husband
    claimed child tax credit, and working tax  credit  (see  paragraph  6).
    The Appellant's husband  himself  accepted  in  cross-examination  that
    between November 2008 and May 2010 he was looking for work.  He claimed
    benefits on and off between 2007 and 2012 (see paragraph 7).

 5. The judge went on to say that the Appellant's EEA Sponsor  "has  failed
    to show that he is a qualified person within the meaning of  Regulation
    6.  In these circumstances the refusal under Regulation  15(1)  was  in
    accordance with Immigration Rules and the law" (paragraph 16).

 6. The judge went on to say also that, "the appeal for the  Appellant  was
    not argued on any other basis under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    save for under Regulation 6" (paragraph 17).

 7. Consideration was then given to the Article 8 arguments with respect to
    the two children of the Appellant who are  EEA  nationals.   The  judge
    observed how there were two children aged 16 and 15

         "who are attending college to pursue their GCSE courses.  They  all
         live together in the same household and  they  are  the  biological
         children of both the Appellant and the EEA Sponsor.   The  children
         are nationals of the Netherlands.  I find that the evidence is that
         although the Appellant is their primary carer on a day-to-day basis
         in the sense of practical care because their father is at work that
         the reality is that the children are dependent upon both of them as
         their parents" (paragraph 23).

    The judge held that it was perfectly  feasible  for  the  Appellant  to
    return to India in these circumstances (see paragraph 24).

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in law by failing
    to give adequate weight to  the  fact  that  the  EEA  Sponsor  secured
    employment in 2010.  He had been in employment since that period.  This
    was  relevant  to  the  assessment  of  whether  the  EEA  Sponsor  was
    continuing to seek  employment  and  had  a  genuine  chance  of  being
    engaged.  It was also not the case that  only  Regulation  6  had  been
    relied upon.   Moreover,  the  judge  erred  in  law  by  relying  upon
    Regulation 13(3).  This  is  because  this  provision  relates  to  the
    initial right of residence and only provides a  three  month  right  of
    residence for an EEA national or family member.  The judge was wrong to
    apply that Regulation to the period between 2010 and 2013.

 9. On 9th April 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

10. On 27th April 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to the effect that the judge had adequately reasoned
    his findings at paragraph 14.  The Appellant had herself accepted  that
    she was not in work between 11th November 2008 and 25th May 2010.   The
    evidence of a claim for jobseeker's allowance  was  not  sufficient  in
    itself to show that a person is seeking employment.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 25th September 2015, Mr M D Hoare, who  had
    appeared below as the Appellant's solicitor, represented the  Appellant
    again in proceedings before me.  He relied fundamentally upon the First-
    tier Grounds of Appeal before Judge Birk.  Mr Hoare  pointed  out  that
    the Appellant was granted an EEA family permit on 20th January 2007 and
    again in October 2007.  In October 2012 she applied to  the  Respondent
    for a permanent residence card.  She had by this stage resided  in  the
    UK as a family member of a treaty rights exercising Netherland  citizen
    for the requisite five  year  period.   She  had  submitted  up-to-date
    evidence of the exercise of treaty rights in the form of pay slips  and
    tax and national insurance documents on  behalf  of  her  EEA  national
    husband.   However,  on  5th  May  2013  the  Respondent  refused   the
    application and  on  7th  May  2013  posted  them  to  the  Appellant's
    solicitor.  After the matter had been listed  before  the  Tribunal  at
    Stoke-on-Trent for 23rd October 2013, there  were  discussions  between
    the parties' representatives at the hearing, and the judge was informed
    of the discussions, and  then  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  authority
    advised the judge that the Respondent  withdrew  the  decision  in  the
    light of the evidence (see paragraph 6 of the Grounds of Appeal).   The
    Tribunal served a notice of withdrawal on 29th October 2013.  In  these
    circumstances, it was surprising that the Respondent then  went  on  to
    issue a further refusal letter for 23rd January 2014.

12. Furthermore the  Grounds  of  Appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    expressly argued "derivative rights" and in this case the Appellant was
    the primary carer  of  her  two  children,  both  of  whom  were  Dutch
    nationals, and on the "Zambrano principles" she had the right to remain
    here.  This is because the Home Office's own policy from  the  European
    Operational Policy Team,  on  the  subject  of  "Derivative  rights  of
    residence - Ibrahim/Teixeira cases revised", which was dated 8th August
    2012, made it quite clear that,

         "In the cases of Ibrahim and  Teixeira,  the  ECJ  ruled  that,  by
         virtue of Article 10 of Regulation 492/2011 (i) the children of  an
         EU citizen who works or has worked in the host  member  state  (who
         are in education in that state), and  (ii)  the  primary  carer  of
         those children, can claim a right of residence in that state.  UKBA
         has also decided that dependent children  of  such  primary  carers
         should also qualify for a right of residence where failure to  give
         such a right would have the effect of preventing the primary  carer
         from residing in the UK" (see paragraph 3).

13. Mr Hoare submitted that this document was an explicit  recognition,  in
    the Home Office's own policy documents, of the fact that, provided that
    the Appellant was the primary carer of her two children,  she  had  the
    right to remain here in circumstances where the failure  to  grant  her
    the right of residence would have an adverse impact upon her.

14. Mr Hoare submitted that this document was not considered by the  judge.
    The Grounds of Appeal did refer to this aspect of this  case.   It  was
    wrong to say that only Regulation 6 was  in  issue.   If  it  had  been
    considered then there was a very strong chance that  the  appeal  would
    have been allowed simply on this basis alone.

15. For his part, Mr Smart submitted  that  he  relied  upon  the  Rule  24
    response.  He would have to accept, however, that Regulation 13 did not
    apply and the judge was wrong to place reliance on it.  This  provision
    only applies to the first three months.   Nevertheless,  there  was  no
    material error of law.  Similarly, it was accepted that the  judge  was
    wrong at paragraph 17 to say that only Regulation 6 applied because the
    Grounds of Appeal make it quite clear that Regulation 15 is  in  issue.
    Again, however, the question here was whether  this  was  a  "material"
    error, and he would submit that there was not.   This  is  because  the
    Appellant still had to satisfy the Tribunal  that  the  employment  was
    genuine and not "marginal and ancillary".   This  particular  principle
    flowed from the recent ECJ case of Haralambidis [2014] EUECJ C-270/3.

16. In reply, Mr Hoare submitted that there was ample evidence of a  proper
    employment relationship between the Appellant and his  employers  where
    he was engaged as a "worker" with them and this evidence is clear  from
    2008 onwards.  Regulation 15(a) applied also.

Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as  follows.   First,
    the judge was wrong to conclude that, "the appeal for the Appellant was
    not argued on any other basis under the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    save for under Regulation 6" (see paragraph 17).  Mr  Smart,  appearing
    on behalf of the Respondent, accepted as much.  Second, the  judge  was
    equally wrong to apply Regulation 13(3) because this  only  applied  in
    circumstances where the EEA national had  been  in  the  UK  for  three
    months.  Third, Regulation 15 was  very  much  in  contention  but  not
    properly considered by the judge.  The failure  to  apply  the  correct
    legal provisions amounts to a material error of law and  this  decision
    is therefore set aside on this basis.

Remaking the Decision

18. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.

19. First, there is the obvious issue of the Appellant's  employment  being
    "real and genuine" and  not  "purely  marginal  and  ancillary".   This
    requirement is affirmed in the recent ECJ decision of  Haralambidis  at
    paragraph 28.  That very paragraph in the determination, however,  also
    goes on to say that, "according to the  case  law  of  the  court,  the
    essential feature of an employment relationship is that for  a  certain
    period of time a person performs services for and under  the  direction
    of another person in return for which he  receives  remuneration"  (and
    reliance is placed on the well-known  judgment  of  Lawrie-Blum).   The
    judgment goes on to say that, "it follows that  subordination  and  the
    payment of remuneration are  constituent  elements  of  all  employment
    relationships,  insofar  as  the  professional  activity  at  issue  is
    effective and genuine" (see paragraph 29).  The documentation, however,
    discloses precisely this, namely,  that  the  Appellant's  husband  was
    involved in  work  that  entailed  subordination  and  the  payment  of
    remuneration.  There is a P45 for 24th  August  2007.   There  are  pay
    slips for the period 7th January 2008 to 18th February 2008.  There  is
    a P45 for 4th March 2008.  There is another P45 for 1st  October  2008.
    In addition there is a letter from the Jobcentre of 25th  January  2013
    that confirms receipt of a benefit for which actively seeking work is a
    prerequisite.  Moreover, there is  an  Inland  Revenue  self-assessment
    return and statement for 22nd January 2009 and  10th  March  2009.   At
    page 60 of the Appellant's bundle there is  a  P60  for  2010  to  2011
    showing that the Appellant earned ï¿½4,152 for that  tax  year.   In  his
    witness statement (at pages 72 to 73) the Appellant's husband makes  it
    clear that he worked all hours that he could but that  his  income  was
    not high "owing to the  difficulties  in  the  economic  climate"  (see
    paragraph 13 at page 73).

20. Second, the Appellant also succeeds on the basis of the  Home  Office's
    policy in the "Derivative rights of residence - Ibrahim/Teixeira  cases
    revised".  This makes it clear that if the  Appellant  is  the  primary
    carer of EEA national children, she can claim the  right  of  residence
    and that UKBA has also decided that dependent children of such  primary
    carers should also qualify.  The judge's determination at paragraph  23
    makes it clear that, "I find that the evidence  is  that  although  the
    Appellant is their primary carer on a day-to-day basis in the sense  of
    practical care because their father is at work that the reality is that
    the children are dependent upon both of them as their  parents".   This
    suffices to meet the requirement of the Rules.  For all these  reasons,
    this appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  This appeal is allowed.

22. No anonymity order is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
