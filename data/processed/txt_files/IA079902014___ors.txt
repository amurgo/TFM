                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka.   Their  appeal  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Widdup  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  26th
    September 2014.  The  Appellants'  appeals  were  dismissed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Appellants lodged  Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Mark  Davies  refused
    permission to appeal on 20th May 2015.   The  Grounds  of  Appeal  were
    renewed and those grounds  came  before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Mahmood on 28th July.  It is clear from the reading  of  those  reasons
    that Judge Mahmood refused permission to appeal.  Unfortunately in  the
    head note it states  that  permission  to  appeal  is  granted.   I  am
    satisfied that is a typing error.

 2. In such circumstances I am further satisfied that there is consequently
    no extant appeal before me.

 3. However in addition to that I am provided with copies of correspondence
    from the Appellant's previously instructed solicitors Nag Law.  In that
    correspondence they note that the Appellants have voluntarily left  the
    UK on 26th August 2015  and  that  they  are  without  instructions  to
    represent them.  In such circumstances in any event I would  find  that
    the Appellant's appeal is abandoned pursuant to Rule 17(a) of the Upper
    Tribunal Procedure Rules.

 4.  This  decision  is  consequently   provided   for   the   purpose   of
    clarification.

Notice of Decision

(1)  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal having been refused both  by
    the First-tier Tribunal and by the Upper  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  it  is
    recorded that there is no valid appeal extant before me.

(2)  That in recording that the Appellants have voluntarily left the  UK  on
    26th August 2015 the Appellants' appeal from the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal is treated as abandoned.

No anonymity direction is made.
