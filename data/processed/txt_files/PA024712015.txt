                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me following a hearing on 3 October  2016
    which resulted in my  finding  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FTT") should be set aside for error of law.

 2. The further background to the appeal and the context within  which  the
    decision of the FTT is to be re-made can be seen from the error of  law
    decision which is set out in full as follows:

                          "DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

         1.   The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 25  March  1987.
             She arrived in the UK on 28 February 2015.  On 21 March 2015 a
             referral was made on  her  behalf  to  the  National  Referral
             Mechanism ("NRM") in order for the Competent Authority to make
             a decision as  to  whether  the  appellant  was  a  victim  of
             trafficking.

         2.   A decision was made on 5 October 2015 that she was a victim of
             trafficking.  She had earlier, on 7 May 2015, made a claim for
             asylum.

         3.   Although it was found that she was a  victim  of  trafficking,
             her asylum claim was refused in a decision  dated  27  October
             2015.  Her human rights claim was also refused.

         4.   The appellant appealed against that decision  and  her  appeal
             came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  O'Keeffe  ("the  FTJ").
             The  FTJ  dismissed  the  appeal   on   asylum,   humanitarian
             protection and human rights grounds.

         5.   The grounds of appeal before me are three-fold. It is first of
             all asserted that the FTJ failed to make findings in terms  of
             the risk to the appellant from the person who  trafficked  her
             to the UK, whom I shall identify as A.  Secondly, it is argued
             that the FTJ failed to make a finding in relation to the  risk
             of harm from the appellant's  family,  having  regard  to  the
             expert evidence on the issue.  Thirdly, it is  contended  that
             the FTJ failed to take into  account  the  appellant's  mental
             health when assessing the extent to which she would be able to
             cope on return to Albania, as a vulnerable person.

             Submissions

         6.   In submissions Ms Fielden relied on the grounds.  She  pointed
             out that the appellant had expressed a fear of the  trafficker
             but this was not something that had  been  considered  by  the
             FTJ, that is to say the risk from him.  The  same  applies  in
             terms of the risk from the appellant's family.  The risk  from
             the trafficker was pertinent in the light of the fact that her
             cousin was murdered in Italy, having been  burnt  alive.   She
             was threatened by A that she would suffer the same fate if she
             did not do as he told her.

         7.   I was also referred to the expert evidence of Antonia Young to
             the effect that sooner or later A or his associates would find
             the appellant, given the  nature  of  Albanian  society.   The
             evidence from the witness called on behalf of  the  appellant,
             JS, also supported her account.

         8.   The expert evidence was also to the effect that  there  was  a
             risk of harm from the appellant's brother and father, a matter
             which was also raised in the skeleton argument  at  [17]-[19].
             This was an issue of 'family honour' as set out in the  expert
             report.

         9.   Mr Tufan submitted that there was nothing in  the  appellant's
             witness statement about any risk from her family, it  being  a
             matter that was mentioned almost in passing  in  the  skeleton
             argument.  It was not a matter that the FTJ had to  deal  with
             therefore.

         10.  So far as the risk from A is  concerned,  there  had  been  no
             trace of him when the Metropolitan Police had made  enquiries.
             In her witness statement at [57] the appellant said  that  she
             did not know if A is in the UK, or in Albania.  Any subjective
             fear that she has applied equally  to  the  UK.   Nothing  has
             happened to her in the  UK.   Her  subjective  fear  needs  to
             objectively verified.

         11.  I was referred to the decision in TD and AD (Trafficked women)
             CG [2016] UKUT 92 (IAC) in terms of the extent  to  which  the
             appellant would be able to have access to a  shelter  and  for
             how long.  Furthermore, the FTJ had found  that  there  was  a
             sufficiency of protection.

         12.  TD and AD considered the risk of re-trafficking, but  the  FTJ
             in this case said that there was no such risk.

         13.  As I understood Mr Tufan's further submissions, they  were  to
             the effect that there was insufficient evidence before the FTJ
             that the appellant had any mental health condition.

             The FTJ's findings

         14.  The FTJ referred to the fact that it had been accepted by  the
             respondent that the appellant was a victim of trafficking.  It
             was also accepted by the respondent that the appellant  had  a
             genuine subjective fear of return.

         15.  With reference to the appellant's claim that she  has  had  no
             contact with her family in Albania, and that  her  father  had
             been violent towards her, that she had been abused  physically
             by her elder siblings and sexually abused by her  father,  the
             FTJ noted that none of that was challenged on  behalf  of  the
             respondent.  She concluded that the appellant's  evidence  was
             internally consistent and she  found  her  to  be  a  credible
             witness.  She concluded that the appellant would not be  in  a
             position to access any family support on return to Albania.

         16.  At [30], with reference to the evidence of JS, she  said  that
             the appellant would not have a support network,  in  that  she
             would not have the support of her family.  She noted  however,
             that the appellant is relatively well-educated, had  completed
             the first year of university and had completed a  hairdressing
             course which lasted three months.  The appellant had been able
             to support herself as a hairdresser in Albania.

         17.  With reference to the decision in TD and  AD,  the  FTJ  noted
             that it was said there that as long as there was  funding  for
             shelters in Albania, there would be capacity  and  that  there
             would be basic, safe accommodation offered  to  any  returning
             victim of trafficking who wishes to avail herself of it.

         18.  The FTJ also referred to  the  appellant  being  eligible  for
             assistance offered through the International Organisation  for
             Migration, and she would be able  to  receive  the  assistance
             offered by the Albanian government through  the  operation  of
             the NRM which could include  referral  to  a  shelter.   Again
             referring to TD and AD, she noted that  it  had  been  decided
             there that other basic  amenities  such  as  food,  drink  and
             heating were provided in  the  shelters.   A  basic  level  of
             healthcare was  also  available  there,  although  there  were
             concerns about the quality and extent of it,  particularly  in
             relation to mental health treatment.  She further  noted  that
             it was said in TD and AD that any  counselling  available  was
             limited to  shelter  staff  who  had  no  formal  training  in
             psychiatry or psychology.

         19.  At [33], referring to the expert report of Antonia Young dated
             15 March 2016, she said that the extensive background material
             referred to by Ms Young had to be read in  the  light  of  the
             findings and guidance in TD and AD.  At [34],  with  reference
             to [119(f)] of TD and AD the FTJ quoted what  was  said  there
             about once leaving a shelter, a victim of trafficking is  able
             to live on their own.  She  further  quoted  that  some  women
             would have the capacity to negotiate the challenges of stigma,
             isolation, financial hardship, a sense of physical  insecurity
             and subjective fear but that there would be other  victims  of
             trafficking with characteristics such  as  mental  illness  or
             psychological  scarring  for  whom  living  alone   in   these
             circumstances would not be reasonable.

         20.  At [36], again referring to the report of Ms  Young,  the  FTJ
             said that she could not see any basis for the  assertion  that
             the appellant had all the more reason to fear being  found  by
             her trafficker in Albania, as she had shared  her  story  with
             the police.  The FTJ said that  the  appellant  had  told  the
             police in  the  UK  about  what  had  happened  to  her.   She
             concluded that the evidence suggested that the police  in  the
             UK were unable to find any trace  of  the  trafficker  or  his
             whereabouts, notwithstanding the undoubted assistance  of  the
             appellant.

         21.  The FTJ said at  [37]  that  it  was  not  disputed  that  the
             appellant left Albania voluntarily with a man,  A,  with  whom
             she had been in a relationship.  She referred to the appellant
             believing that they were in a genuine  relationship  and  were
             going to marry.  The appellant had said that A was never short
             of money  and  was  always  telling  her  that  he  was  well-
             connected.  He had said that he was graduating in law  without
             actually going to school, which was not possible unless he was
             well-connected.  Reference was made to  the  appellant's  oral
             evidence that there was an occasion when he had behaved like a
             "gangster" and had also used some police equipment in his  car
             which meant that he would never be stopped and that the police
             would assume he was one of them.

         22.  Following on from this, at [38] the FTJ said as follows:

                  "I accept that the appellant genuinely believes  that  she
                  is at risk from her former trafficker."

         23.  The FTJ referred to the assessment in TD and AD to the  effect
             that it seemed unlikely that women under the active protection
             of the shelters and the police would be those who are most  at
             risk.

         24.  The  FTJ  referred  to  the  appellant  having  completed  her
             secondary education and commenced a degree course in order  to
             become a teacher.  She said that although  the  appellant  had
             been duped in the past, she considered it  unlikely  that  she
             would be duped in the future.  She had been  willing  to  seek
             help  from  the  authorities  in  the  UK,  and  although  the
             appellant  may  initially  be   hesitant   to   approach   the
             authorities in  Albania  for  help,  she  concluded  that  the
             appellant would be able to access support in Albania.

         25.  In relation to the appellant's  mental  health,  at  [42]  she
             referred to the  medical  evidence  that  had  been  provided,
             including from her GP, which stated  that  she  was  suffering
             from anxiety which was affecting her wellbeing.  She  referred
             to the appellant having  undergone  six  sessions  of  talking
             therapy but had found them difficult and  had  not  wished  to
             consider drug therapy for  her  anxiety.   Evidence  from  the
             Steps to Wellbeing programme indicated that the appellant  did
             not  wish  to  continue  with  her  programme   of   Cognitive
             Behavioural Therapy ("CBT").  Although the appellant had  said
             that she was still suffering from depression and anxiety,  she
             had decided that further therapy would not be helpful.

         26.  Again, referring to the appellant's  education  and  the  fact
             that she had previously set up a business, she concluded  that
             the appellant had been able to support herself with the  funds
             from the business when she was in Albania.  At [44]  she  said
             that although the appellant had been  diagnosed  as  suffering
             from depression and anxiety, she herself  had  chosen  not  to
             continue with any treatment for those conditions whilst in the
             UK.  She found that:

                  "The concerns as to the quality and  extent  of  available
                  mental health treatment are not  therefore  a  significant
                  feature in this case."

         27.  At [45] there is reference to the last piece of evidence  from
             the Steps to Wellbeing, being dated 16 March 2016 which states
             that by then the appellant was still suffering from depression
             and anxiety but declined a full assessment, preferring to  use
             existing coping  strategies  and  not  to  engage  in  further
             therapy with the Steps to Wellbeing at that time.

         28.  Again, in relation to the appellant's life in  Albania  before
             she came to the UK, the  FTJ  said  that  notwithstanding  the
             abuse that the appellant received from  her  father,  she  was
             able to live a relatively independent life in Albania compared
             to what would be the norm for other young Albanian women.

         29.  The FTJ said at [48] that she accepted that the appellant  was
             a victim of trafficking who was ill-treated by A who assaulted
             her and threatened her.  Although the appellant was not forced
             into prostitution, the FTJ accepted that that was  the  likely
             fate for her had she not escaped from A when she did.  In  the
             next paragraph it was concluded that the  appellant  would  be
             able to access support in Albania and would be able to  access
             the reception  and  reintegration  programme  for  victims  of
             trafficking.   She  concluded  that  the  appellant  had   not
             demonstrated "that she has any particular vulnerabilities such
             as physical or mental health difficulties."   It  was  further
             concluded that the option of taking advantage of the reception
             and reintegration programme for victims of  trafficking  could
             not be said in her case to be unreasonable.   She  found  that
             although the appellant is genuinely fearful of  return,  there
             was a sufficiency of protection available to her, taking  into
             account her particular circumstances.

         30.  Lastly, she  concluded  that  the  appellant  would  have  the
             capacity to face the significant challenges of living  on  her
             own in Albania without undue  hardship,  taking  into  account
             that  she  had  earned  her  own  living  in  the  past  as  a
             hairdresser and lived  a  reasonably  independent  life.   She
             concluded that it was not demonstrated that it  would  not  be
             reasonable to expect her to live alone.  She  found  that  the
             appellant had not demonstrated that she was  at  risk  of  re-
             trafficking.  She was an educated, resourceful woman  who  was
             unlikely to be duped again in the future.




             My conclusions

         31.  As I pointed out at the hearing, there is no  indication  from
             the appellant's witness statement or from  her  oral  evidence
             that she has any fear of her family as a result  of  what  has
             happened to her.  It is true, as Ms  Fielden  submitted,  that
             the skeleton argument at [17]-[19] refers to the risk of  harm
             from the appellant's family, as does the expert report  of  Ms
             Young.  However,  this  has  never  been  a  feature  of   the
             appellant's account in terms of her fear of return to Albania.
              It is not in her witness statement and is  not  mentioned  in
             her oral evidence.  In  the  asylum  interview  in  answer  to
             question 114, she said specifically that she did not fear  her
             father on return to Albania.

         32.  Notwithstanding the submissions made in reliance on the expert
             report of Ms Young, I am not satisfied that there is any error
             of law in the FTJ's having failed to make an assessment of the
             risk to the appellant from her family.  The appellant  is  the
             one best placed to know  whether  she  is  at  risk  from  her
             family, or whether she has any subjective fear of  them.   She
             has not expressed such a fear and the FTJ's lack of assessment
             of that issue does not involve any error of law.

         33.  However, I am satisfied that the FTJ erred in law  in  failing
             to make any finding about the risk to the  appellant  from  A.
             It seems to me that what the FTJ was focussing on was the risk
             of  re-trafficking,  as  is  clear  from  my  summary  of  her
             decision.  At  [38]  she  said  that  she  accepted  that  the
             appellant genuinely believes that she is at risk from A.   She
             did not go on to make an assessment of whether that  risk  was
             objectively well-founded.  She could have,  if  that  was  her
             view, gone on to conclude that the appellant would be able  to
             seek the protection of the authorities.  She could  also  have
             addressed  the  appellant's  fear   in   terms   of   internal
             relocation, assuming that such could not be said to be  unduly
             harsh or unreasonable.  There is however, no finding in  terms
             of the actual risk from A.  Despite  what  Mr  Tufan  said  in
             submissions about his whereabouts being unknown,  that  it  my
             view is no answer to the complaint about there being a lack of
             assessment by the FTJ in that respect.

         34.  Similarly, I am satisfied that the FTJ erred  in  law  in  her
             conclusions in terms of the appellant's  mental  health.   She
             concluded at [49] that the appellant had not demonstrated that
             she has any "particular vulnerabilities," including  in  terms
             of mental health.  That conclusion was part of the  assessment
             of the extent to which the appellant would be able  to  access
             the  reception  and  reintegration  programme.   It  is   also
             relevant to issues of internal relocation, undue hardship  and
             reasonableness in that respect.  It  is  further  relevant  to
             that part of TD and AD that the FTJ  quoted  at  [34]  of  her
             decision, to  the  effect  that  there  would  be  victims  of
             trafficking with characteristics such  as  mental  illness  or
             psychological  scarring  for  whom   living   alone   in   the
             circumstances described would not be reasonable.

         35.  The FTJ referred to the most recent  evidence  from  Steps  to
             Wellbeing dated 16 March 2016.  The appellant reported to  the
             author of the letter that things remained unchanged  in  terms
             of her depression and anxiety symptoms.  None of that evidence
             was disputed.  It  could  not  be  said  therefore,  that  the
             appellant  was  someone  who  does  not  have  any  particular
             vulnerabilities in terms of mental health.  The fact that  the
             appellant preferred not to engage in further therapy does  not
             necessarily mean that she was free  from  the  symptoms  of  a
             mental health condition.

         36.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that  the  decision  of
             the FTJ must be set aside for error of law.  Although  it  was
             suggested by both parties that if I came to that view  it  was
             appropriate for the matter to be remitted to  the  FTT  for  a
             fresh hearing, I do not consider that that is  an  appropriate
             course of action.  That is largely because the FTJ has made  a
             number of findings of fact which are not infected by the error
             of law.  The nature and extent of the fact-finding exercise is
             not such  as  to  require  a  hearing  de  novo.   The  Senior
             President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2 does not  seem
             to me to militate in favour of a remittal  to  the  First-tier
             Tribunal.

         37.  Accordingly, the re-making of the decision will take place  in
             the Upper Tribunal.  To that end,  the  parties  are  to  have
             regard to the directions set out below.

                                 DIRECTIONS

             (1)  Any further evidence to be relied on by either  party  is
                  to be the subject of  a  comprehensive  witness  statement
                  drawn in sufficient detail to stand as  evidence-in-chief,
                  such that there is no need for any further examination-in-
                  chief.  This direction must be strictly complied with.

             (2)  The parties must be in a position at the next hearing  to
                  make submissions as to what findings of fact made  by  the
                  FTJ should be preserved."

 3. At the resumed hearing further evidence was adduced on  behalf  of  the
    appellant in the form of a further bundle of 8 pages, being  a  further
    witness statement from the appellant and medical  evidence.  There  was
    also an additional witness statement from Ms  Julie  Shanley  from  the
    Medaille Trust, who is responsible to the safe running  of  three  safe
    houses for victims of trafficking. The appellant herself gave evidence,
    as did Ms Shanley, who adopted  her  witness  statement,  but  was  not
    further examined in-chief, and was not cross-examined. I set out below,
    a summary of the appellant's evidence.

    The appellant's oral evidence

 4. The appellant adopted her most recent witness statement in examination-
    in-chief. In cross-examination she was asked about  the  occasion  that
    she referred to in her witness statement dated 4  March  2016  at  [20]
    when her ex-boyfriend ('A') was stopped by the police in Albania and he
    showed them a fake insurance document. She said that as they drove away
    from the police he told her that it was false. Their  car  had  English
    number plates and the policy was written in English. She did not accept
    the  proposition  that  was  put  to  her  to  the  effect  that   this
    demonstrated that he had no influence with  the  police,  stating  that
    every car needs insurance and he had a policy that  was  written  in  a
    different language, and which he had not paid for.

 5. She was also referred to what she said in that statement  about  how  A
    would use a police sign on the dashboard of his car  when  outside  the
    city in which he lived. She said that he would always carry  that  sign
    with him to avoid the police as he did not want to  have  trouble  with
    them.

 6. In relation to what she had said in her  witness  statement  about  A's
    family in Albania being wealthy and his influence, she  said  that  she
    believed that she had told the police about that. With the help of  her
    solicitor she had tried to  verify  that  his  uncle  was  the  General
    Director of a particular energy company. They  tried  searches  on  the
    internet but the photograph that they found did not match  (the  person
    who was introduced to her as his uncle).

 7. As to whether A had lied to her about his uncle's position, she did not
    believe that he had any reason to lie about that.  She  could  see  the
    lifestyle that he had and the people he associated  with.  The  meeting
    with that paternal uncle was just a chance meeting when the  uncle  was
    passing. The only thing that made an impression on  her  on  that  day,
    which she did not think much about at the time, was that after he shook
    her hand he said to A that he seemed to have won the lottery.

 8. In relation to the two friends of A in Germany that they  stayed  with,
    and whether she had any reason to believe that they were criminals, she
    said that from the moment she got into a relationship with  "this  man"
    she was simply a girl from a remote place who had seen nothing  of  the
    world. He was well-travelled and everything he told  her  she  took  at
    face value. That is why at that time she had no reason to believe  that
    those two men were criminals. What he said to her 'went'.

 9. As to her having said in the witness statement that he had  two  mobile
    phones, she said that she did not know who he spoke to or what he spoke
    about. His phone would ring and he would speak for  a  long  period  of
    time. "Work, work" he would say.

10. She was asked whether she saw anyone else when in the UK,  kept  inside
    and beaten. She said that one day a male turned up although she did not
    see him. She could only tell by his voice. Otherwise she  did  not  see
    anyone apart from A. At the police station she was asked her about  any
    knowledge of other people at that property. She said that she had tried
    to remember details of anyone else there.

11. She accepted that she did not know whether or not he was  working  with
    anyone else. As to whether he worked as part of a gang, she  questioned
    as to how  she  would  know  that.  She  was  waiting  for  the  police
    investigation to point out his part and to know who he really was.

12. As to whether the police had found him, or any gang that  he  might  be
    part of, she said that the thing that she could not understand was that
    no matter how hard she tried to establish the truth,  the  police  told
    her that these people do not only use one name, but it was important to
    emphasise again the detail that she gave to the police right  from  the
    start. In relation to her flight from Greece to Germany,  she  provided
    all the flight details. Although she  did  not  remember  the  specific
    location of the house (she was kept in) she remembered  the  area.  The
    police had told her that there were laws that meant that they were  not
    permitted to search every house.

13. She had recently started treatment in the UK. That was not to help with
    her appeal. As to whether she had invented thoughts of suicide to  help
    with her appeal, she said that despite the fact that she was  a  victim
    of abuse and beaten up time after time she kept on telling herself that
    she is still alive. At this point the appellant appeared to become very
    upset and distressed. She went on to say that she kept telling  herself
    "Don't do this" and that all those things would one day  go  away.  She
    would like to live and to enjoy  life.  The  suicidal  thoughts  are  a
    matter of a split-second; you do it or you don't. The  reason  she  had
    not done it so far was the thoughts about the future and that  one  day
    these things would go away.

14. As to her friend in Albania who was a hairdresser and  whether  she  is
    still there, there was a distinction between  hairdressing  in  Albania
    and in England. Her small business in the  room  was  providing  barely
    enough to survive. She was still in touch with her.  What  had  brought
    her close to her was that her family history was similar  in  that  her
    father was abusive and violent towards her and was an alcoholic. As  to
    whether she would be able to help the appellant on return  to  Albania,
    that friend is struggling to have a life for herself at home  with  her
    parents.

15. Returning to the question of suicidal  thoughts,  she  said  that  when
    living with an abusive parent  two  thoughts  run  through  your  mind,
    either to kill yourself or the abusive parent, to bring the whole thing
    to an end.

    Submissions

16. Mr Clarke submitted that the appellant had to  demonstrate  that  there
    was an objective basis for her fear of return. She had  to  demonstrate
    that there was "influence and intent" on the part of anybody  that  she
    fears.  There was no evidence that A had such influence and intent. The
    evidence was that he had to resort to  tactics  to  trick  the  police.
    Furthermore, despite the research undertaken by the appellant  and  her
    solicitors, A's uncle had not been found. There was no evidence that he
    was part of a gang, and the police had not been able to find  any  gang
    members.

17. In relation to the most recent medical evidence from Solent  NHS  Trust
    in relation to the appellant's suicidal thoughts, that runs counter  to
    the evidence given by the appellant. In 2015 she was said not to be  at
    risk in that regard. What is said in the report dated 22 November  2016
    about suicide was clearly related to the outcome of the last appeal.

18. It was conceded on behalf of the respondent that  the  appellant  would
    have to go and live in a shelter, and so internal  relocation  was  the
    issue. However, it would not be unreasonable nor unduly harsh to expect
    her to do so. The medical evidence was  not  sufficient  to  bring  the
    appellant within the guidance in TD and AD (Trafficked women) CG [2016]
    UKUT 92 (IAC) in relation to the unreasonableness of expecting  someone
    to live in a shelter because of mental health issues.

19. Ms Fielden in submissions pointed out that it was found as a fact  that
    the appellant was a victim of trafficking. She was told that she  would
    suffer the same fact as her cousin who was  burnt  to  death.  She  had
    established a subjective fear. That is part of the  mental  state  that
    she would be in in the area of relocation. Whether or not he  would  be
    able to find  her  there,  she  is  very  afraid  that  he  would,  and
    presumably he would be in Albania at least some of the time.

20. Ms Shanley's evidence was that the threat from A  needed  to  be  taken
    seriously. A trafficker would have the means to find her. The  evidence
    of Antonia Young and Ms Shanley was consistent in terms of  information
    being passed on by word  of  mouth.  According  to  Ms  Young,  if  the
    appellant wanted to avoid leading an isolated life she  would  need  to
    register under the civil registration system, leading to  a  risk  that
    she would be found.

21. Their evidence in terms of the corruption in the police also  needs  to
    be taken into account in terms of a  consideration  of  sufficiency  of
    protection. There is a reasonable chance that her fear is  well-founded
    even though the police had not been able to find A.

22. Even if the appellant did have the benefit of being able to live  in  a
    shelter, that is not a permanent solution. Eventually she would have to
    leave and manage on her own. The access to help that she would have  in
    the shelter would be by unqualified people. I was referred  to  aspects
    of the medical evidence. That evidence explained why there was a  break
    in the treatment. Some of the counselling evidently did not  help  her.
    The medical evidence showed that she needed a period of  stability  and
    requires long term therapy. However, Ms Fielden said that that no claim
    was advanced in relation to the  risk  of  suicide  with  reference  to
    Article 3 of the ECHR.

23. Ms Fielden relied on TD and AD in terms of the  difficulties  a  person
    would have in managing on their own (after leaving a shelter).

    Conclusions

24. As is clear from the error of law  decision,  various  factual  matters
    have been resolved in the appellant's favour. It has been  accepted  by
    the Competent Authority that the appellant is a victim of trafficking.

25. The FTJ found that the appellant had given a credible account of having
    no contact with her family in Albania, and that  her  father  had  been
    violent towards her, that she had been abused physically by  her  elder
    siblings and sexually abused by  her  father,  and  none  of  that  was
    challenged on behalf of the respondent at that hearing.  She  concluded
    that the appellant's evidence was internally consistent and  she  found
    her to be a credible witness.  She concluded that the  appellant  would
    not be in a position to access any family support on return to Albania.

26. She also accepted that the appellant had a subjective fear of return in
    terms of risk from A  who  had  ill-treated  and  threatened  her.  She
    accepted  that  although  the  appellant  had  not  been  forced   into
    prostitution, that was her likely fate had she not managed to escape.

27. In relation to the evidence that the appellant gave before  me,  I  too
    found her to be a credible witness. Apart from the suggestion in cross-
    examination that the appellant had invented thoughts of suicide to help
    her appeal, it was not contended in submissions that the appellant  was
    not credible. In response to the suggestion of invented  'thoughts'  of
    suicide, the appellant gave a reasoned, thoughtful and credible answer.
    For the avoidance of doubt, I do not consider that there is any  aspect
    of the appellant's account that has been manufactured or invented.

28. It is accepted on behalf of the respondent that the appellant would not
    be able to return to her home area, Mr Clarke conceding  that  internal
    relocation was the issue to be considered. It is in any event  implicit
    from the decision of the FTJ that she found that  the  appellant  would
    have to relocate to be away from her home area.

29. For the reasons I gave in the error of law decision, there was no error
    of law in the FTJ's failure to have come to a conclusion in relation to
    the risk to the appellant from her family. The matters I referred to at
    [31] and [32] of my decision mean that I am not satisfied that she  has
    any such fear, that not being a matter that the appellant had  hitherto
    referred to. There is what I consider to be a passing reference in  her
    most recent witness statement at [8] to a fear that if her brother knew
    that she was in Albania he would beat her for  bringing  shame  on  the
    family, but this is not the fear that she expresses in  her  concluding
    paragraph of that statement.

30. I note what is said in the  short  additional  report  from  Dr  Louise
    Dubras of Solent NHS Trust dated 21 November 2016 about her fear  of  A
    and "possibly her family". However, that was  not  a  matter  that  the
    appellant gave evidence about before me, and I  do  not  consider  that
    this represents a real fear that she has, as distinct from a  basis  of
    argument relied on on her behalf but without the evidential  foundation
    to support it. Lastly, it is to be noted  that  the  skeleton  argument
    prepared for this hearing does not advance argument  in  terms  of  any
    subjective fear or any objectively based risk from her family.

31. Even if the appellant does have a concrete fear of her family, there is
    no evidence that they have expressed any intention of finding her,  and
    more importantly, notwithstanding the evidence about the  size  of  the
    country and the closeness of communities, no evidence  that  they  have
    any reach or contacts beyond their home area, and no such  argument  is
    advanced. It is also to be noted that the evidence did not support what
    the appellant was told about a person said to be  A's  uncle  having  a
    senior position in an energy company.

32. In relation to whether the appellant's fear of A is well  founded,  the
    arguments on behalf of the appellant and the evidence relied on seem to
    me to be based on the proposition that any victim of trafficking  would
    be at risk from the trafficker on return. Reliance  is  placed  on  the
    evidence of Ms Shanley and Ms Young in this respect.

33. However, whilst I accept the proposition that the  appellant's  refusal
    to accede to A's demands to become involved  in  prostitution  and  her
    escape would be 'bad for business' as it has been described,  there  is
    little objective justification for the conclusion that she would be  at
    risk from him. Whilst the appellant has given a credible account of his
    boasts about his influence, and of his lifestyle and the wealth of  his
    family, there is no evidence that any  influence  that  A  has  extends
    beyond his home area. Indeed,  it  is  apparent  from  the  appellant's
    account that outside his home area he had to resort to deception in his
    dealings with the police.

34. I also bear in mind that it appears that the police have not been  able
    to trace A, and his whereabouts are unknown. No  gang  associates  have
    been identified. The extent  of  any  influence  or  'reach'  of  A  is
    unknown, and thus not established.

35. There is  nothing  to  indicate  that,  'in  principle',  a  victim  of
    trafficking would be at risk from the trafficker in any and  all  areas
    of relocation, and in particular in one of the shelters provided by the
    authorities in Albania as  part  of  the  reception  and  reintegration
    programme. Such was not found to be the case in TD and AD and  none  of
    the evidence before me revealed any basis for  coming  to  a  different
    view. At [95] the Tribunal said that:

         "There is however a complete lack of  data  on  the  phenomenon  of
         women  being  abducted  from  or   nearby   shelters   by   waiting
         traffickers. We have no doubt that  had  there  been  instances  of
         women disappearing from shelters over the past few years this would
         feature in the evidence. What evidence we have about re-trafficking
         would appear to be confined to the risk once  the  VOT  leaves  the
         shelter..."

36. The refusal letter  suggests  that  the  appellant  would  be  able  to
    relocate to Vlor�. It was accepted in submissions before me  on  behalf
    of the respondent that the appellant would have to go to a shelter, and
    the evidence from the Mary Ward Loreto Foundation report is that one of
    the four shelters in Albania is in Vlor�, although it is  suggested  in
    the report that one of the two  shelters  in  Tirana  would  be  safer.
    Furthermore, the appellant's evidence is  that  Vlor�  is  one  of  the
    cities that she visited with A and  even  for  that  reason  I  do  not
    consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to relocate there.

37. The evidence is that the  appellant  suffers  from  "moderately  severe
    reactive depression" (report 27 September 2016 from Dr Dubras) and PTSD
    (report 22 November 2016 from Rose Dekowski, a High Intensity Therapist
    at Steps to Wellbeing, part of Dorset Health Care NHS  Trust).  She  is
    receiving treatment for PTSD, anxiety and depression.

38. All the medical evidence describes the appellant's  vulnerability.  She
    is described as being hopeless and  petrified  of  return  to  Albania.
    None of this evidence was disputed on behalf of the respondent. I  have
    already given my  view  on  the  suggestion  of  the  appellant  having
    invented thoughts of suicide to assist with her appeal.

39. In the error of law decision I said as follows:

    "26. ...  At [44] [the FTJ] said that although the appellant  had  been
         diagnosed as suffering from depression and anxiety, she herself had
         chosen not to continue with  any  treatment  for  those  conditions
         whilst in the UK.  She found that:

         'The concerns as to the quality  and  extent  of  available  mental
         health treatment are not therefore a significant  feature  in  this
         case.'

    27.  At [45] there is reference to the last piece of evidence from  the
         Steps to Wellbeing, being dated 16 March 2016 which states that  by
         then the appellant was still suffering from depression and  anxiety
         but declined a full assessment, preferring to use  existing  coping
         strategies and not to engage in further therapy with the  Steps  to
         Wellbeing at that time."

40. I went on to state at [34] that:

         "Similarly, I am satisfied  that  the  FTJ  erred  in  law  in  her
         conclusions  in  terms  of  the  appellant's  mental  health.   She
         concluded at [49] that the appellant had not demonstrated that  she
         has any "particular vulnerabilities," including in terms of  mental
         health.  That conclusion was part of the assessment of  the  extent
         to which the appellant would be able to access  the  reception  and
         reintegration programme.  It is also relevant to issues of internal
         relocation, undue hardship and reasonableness in that respect.   It
         is further relevant to that part of TD and AD that the  FTJ  quoted
         at [34] of her decision, to the effect that there would be  victims
         of trafficking with  characteristics  such  as  mental  illness  or
         psychological scarring for whom living alone in  the  circumstances
         described would not be reasonable."

41. Finally, I said at [35] in relation to Steps to Wellbeing letter  dated
    16 March 2016 that:

         "The appellant reported to the author of  the  letter  that  things
         remained unchanged in terms of her depression and anxiety symptoms.
          None of  that  evidence  was  disputed.   It  could  not  be  said
         therefore, that the appellant was someone who  does  not  have  any
         particular vulnerabilities in terms of  mental  health.   The  fact
         that the appellant preferred not to engage in further therapy  does
         not necessarily mean that she was  free  from  the  symptoms  of  a
         mental health condition."

42. The evidence before the Tribunal in TD and AD, and part of its  country
    guidance, was that victims of trafficking are able to stay in a shelter
    on arrival and may be able to remain for up to two years. At [119]  the
    guidance is that:

         "...


         e)   There is now in place a reception and reintegration  programme
             for victims of trafficking. Returning victims  of  trafficking
             are able to stay in a shelter on arrival, and in 'heavy cases'
             may be able to stay there for  up  to  2  years.  During  this
             initial  period  after  return  victims  of  trafficking   are
             supported and protected. Unless the individual has  particular
             vulnerabilities such as physical or mental health issues, this
             option cannot generally be said to be unreasonable; whether it
             is must be determined on a case by case basis.


         f)   Once asked to leave the shelter a victim  of  trafficking  can
             live on her  own.  In  doing  so  she  will  face  significant
             challenges including, but not limited to,  stigma,  isolation,
             financial  hardship  and  uncertainty,  a  sense  of  physical
             insecurity and the subjective fear of being  found  either  by
             their families or former traffickers. Some women will have the
             capacity to negotiate these challenges without undue hardship.
             There  will   however   be   victims   of   trafficking   with
             characteristics,  such  as  mental  illness  or  psychological
             scarring, for whom living alone in these  circumstances  would
             not be reasonable. Whether a particular appellant  falls  into
             that category will call for a careful assessment  of  all  the
             circumstances."

43. At [101] in TD and AD the Tribunal concluded that that  there  remained
    concerns about the quality and extent of mental  health  treatment  and
    that  on  the  evidence  before  it,  such  care  is  limited  to   the
    prescription of anti-depressants and where  available,  counselling  by
    shelter staff who have no formal training in psychiatry or psychology.

44. I note that in the report from Dr Dubras dated 27  September  2016  she
    states that the appellant  is  a  "strong  and  determined  woman"  who
    prefers to manage her problems alone  and  not  to  admit  weakness  to
    others, and that it has been hard for her to "open up".

45. I also bear in mind in terms of the ability of the appellant to live on
    her own after she leaves a shelter, the fact that  she  was  previously
    able to live relatively independently in  Albania,  had  completed  her
    secondary education and started a degree course. She  appears  to  have
    earned a living as a hairdresser.

46. However, all that was before she  became  the  victim  of  trafficking,
    although after the abuse she suffered from  her  family.  Nevertheless,
    she is now suffering from PTSD, depression and anxiety for which she is
    receiving treatment. She has a very powerful subjective fear of  return
    to Albania, with recurrent thoughts of suicide. It  is  not  reasonably
    likely that she would receive  appropriate  treatment  for  her  mental
    health conditions on return to live in a shelter in Albania.

47. Applying the guidance in TD and AD, I am satisfied that  the  appellant
    is a person with particular vulnerabilities  in  terms  of  her  mental
    health making it unreasonable to expect her to relocate to live in  one
    of the shelters in Albania. In addition, I am not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant would be able to face the significant challenges  that  would
    arise after she  left  the  shelter  in  terms  of  stigma,  isolation,
    financial hardship and uncertainty, a sense of physical insecurity  and
    the subjective fear of being found by A. She is a victim of trafficking
    with characteristics of mental illness and psychological  scarring  for
    whom living alone in these circumstances would not be reasonable.

48. It is also to be borne  in  mind  that  it  has  been  found  that  the
    appellant would not be able to rely on  any  family  support  from  any
    family member, for obvious reasons. I do not consider that  the  friend
    that the appellant referred to in evidence could provide any meaningful
    support in the light of the appellant's evidence  about  that  friend's
    situation.

49. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the appellant has established  to  the
    required standard that she has a well-founded fear of persecution for a
    Convention reason, namely as a member of a particular social  group.  I
    am not satisfied that the evidence establishes that there is  available
    to her a place of internal relocation to which it would  be  reasonable
    to expect her to go.

50. No separate argument was advanced in relation to Article 3 of the ECHR,
    and as already indicated, it was specifically said that no argument  in
    relation to any risk of  suicide  was  relied  on.  That  is  a  matter
    therefore, that does not require distinct consideration.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. Its decision having been set aside,  I  re-make  the
    decision, allowing the appeal on asylum grounds.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
