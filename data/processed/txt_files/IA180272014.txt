For the Appellant:     Mr Schwenk, Counsel instructed by CM Fortis
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria date of birth 20th January 1978.
    He appeals with permission[1] the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Foudy[2] to dismiss his appeal against the Respondent's decision[3]  to
    refuse to vary his leave to remain  and  to  remove  him  from  the  UK
    pursuant to s47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.
    That  decision  had  followed  the  Respondent's   rejection   of   the
    Appellant's application for leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepeneur)
    Migrant.


 2. There were two grounds of refusal. The first  was  that  the  Appellant
    had, without good reason, failed to attend an  interview.  That  matter
    was resolved in the Appellant's favour  by  Judge  Foudy  who  accepted
    medical evidence that he was unwell at the time. There is no  challenge
    to that finding and it is preserved.

 3. The second ground for refusal was that it was  not  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was a genuine entrepreneur. Judge Foudy heard  evidence  that
    the Appellant had set up a business called 'Elec-Telec  Ltd'  which  he
    described as delivering "telecommunications and networking  solutions".
    The company had been incorporated but at the date of appeal it had  not
    yet commenced trading. It was the Appellant's stated intention that  it
    would do so in the near future. Judge Foudy had regard to the  evidence
    before her and made a number  of  findings  rejecting  the  Appellant's
    claim to have invested, or to intend to invest in,  this  company.  She
    found:

        i) That the Appellant was "very vague" about what services he would
           actually provide and "exhibited a poor ability  to  explain  his
           business plans";
       ii) In his oral evidence the Appellant appeared  to  be  relying  on
           stock phrases such as "to user specification" without being able
           to explain what they actually meant;
      iii) The documentary evidence  gave  very  little  detail  about  the
           business;
       iv)  The  Appellant's  market  research  was  "rudimentary  in   the
           extreme", consisting of drawing up a list of other IT  companies
           in the Bolton area. Judge Foudy rejected  as  not  credible  the
           claim that some of these businesses had been prepared to talk to
           the Appellant about their work and observed that the list  could
           just as conveniently have been found in  telephone directory;
        v) That the Appellant admitted that his financial projections  were
           aspirations  rather  than  realistic   figures.   The   complete
           inadequacy of these projections is illustrated by the fact  that
           he had estimated the  costs  of  providing  cabling,  computers,
           routers etc to a potential customer as "zero".


 4. At paragraph 14 the Tribunal found it "highly  surprising",  given  the
    evident failings in the Appellant's business plan, that he  had  won  a
    contract from a friend of his, a Mr Oteri of Nelson  Consultants.   The
    Appellant said that he would provide services to Nelson Consultants and
    that Mr Oteri would in turn pay him �15,000. Judge Foudy commented that
    it was a pity that Mr Oteri had not been called to give evidence  since
    there were a number of matters arising from  the  contract  which  were
    left "opaque". These included the pricing structure and the duration of
    the contract. Judge Foudy found it "quite incredible" that these  vital
    items were omitted from the contract. She then said this:
         "Moreover, if Nelson Consultants Ltd is a  successful  company,  Mr
         Oteri may have been able to explain why his latest company accounts
         show a net worth of only �121 for his  company.  If  the  Appellant
         ever actually believed that Mr Oteri would have  paid  him  �15,000
         for an unspecified amount of work over  an  unspecified  period  of
         time I find that the  simplest  of  internet  searches  would  have
         revealed to him that Mr Oteri's business is probably not capable of
         honouring such a contract...."


 5. It is this paragraph  that  has  led  to  this  appeal.  The  Appellant
    alleges, and the Respondent accepts, that this paragraph  reveals  that
    Judge Foudy conducted post-hearing internet research and then used this
    to  attack  the  Appellant's  credibility  as  a  witness,   and   more
    importantly as a Tier 1 (Entrepeneur).


 6. I am unable to say with certainty whether Judge Foudy did in fact  look
    Nelson Consultants up on the internet after the  hearing.  The  parties
    are in agreement that she must have done, since no-one  can  say  where
    the figure of �121 came from otherwise. If that was what happened, that
    would, in these circumstances, be an error,  since  the  Appellant  was
    deprived of an opportunity to respond to  the  point  made:  EG  (post-
    hearing internet research) Nigeria [2008] UKAIT 00015.

 7. Mr Harrison argues however, that any error is immaterial, since  it  is
    evident from the remainder of the decision that the Tribunal had  found
    comprehensively against the Appellant.

 8. Mr Schwenk relies on the authority of MM (Unfairness: E&R) Sudan [2014]
    UKUT  00105  (IAC).  He  submits  that  where  there  is  a  procedural
    impropriety such as this, the appellate court should  exercise  caution
    in concluding that the outcome would have the same even  if  the  error
    had not occurred. He points to the dicta from R v  Chief  Constable  of
    Thames Valley Police ex  parte  Cotton  [1990]  IRLR  344,  cited  with
    approval in MM: "it is sufficient if an applicant  can  establish  that
    there is a real, as opposed to purely  minimal,  possibility  that  the
    outcome would have been different".

 9. I am satisfied that in this case there is no real possibility that  the
    outcome would have been any different had Judge Foudy not conducted  an
    internet search on Nelson Consultants Ltd. That was because  she  found
    absolutely nothing in the evidence to support the contention  that  the
    Appellant knew  anything  about  IT,  was  capable  of  running  an  IT
    business, or indeed had a  genuine  intention  to  do  so.    She  made
    numerous well-reasoned findings that were all supported by the evidence
    before her. Although I exercise caution in finding that the  procedural
    impropriety was not such that the decision should be set aside, that is
    my finding.






    Decision


10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error
    of law such that it should be set aside.


11. I make no direction as to anonymity.
