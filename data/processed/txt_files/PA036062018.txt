Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A J Bradley, of A J Bradley & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The  appellant  is  a  citizen  of  Vietnam,  born  on  15  June  1985.
    Designated  FtT  Judge  Murray  dismissed  her  appeal  by  a  decision
    promulgated on 23 July 2019.  She applied to the  UT  on  13  September
    2019 for permission to appeal on grounds set out at [1  -  11]  of  her
    application.  UT Judge Kebede granted permission on 3 October 2019.

 2. The respondent conceded  that  there  was  merit  in  the  grounds;  in
    particular, on the point focused in the grant of permission, of relying
    unduly on a negative trafficking decision, rather  than  assessing  all
    the evidence in the round.  The outcome was agreed.

 3. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 4. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 5. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Murray.

 6. (It is for parties to consider whether the trafficking decision  should
    be placed before the FtT, and what significance it should carry.)

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
