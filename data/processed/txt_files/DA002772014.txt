Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss E Cantor, Counsel instructed by Norton Folgate
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Nightingale   who,   in   a
    determination promulgated on 7 August 2014, allowed the appeal  of  the
    respondent against the decision of the Secretary of  State  to  make  a
    deportation order against him.  The  respondent  shall  hereinafter  be
    referred to as the claimant.

2.   The claimant is a citizen of Vietnam  born on 26  December  1978.    He
    claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom illegally  in  June  2005.
    He was convicted on 17 February 2009, for a fraud offence and sentenced
    to six months' imprisonment.  Deportation was not pursued, but  he  was
    placed on reporting restrictions, and the  Secretary  of  State  claims
    that he absconded.  Notwithstanding his alleged absconding, he made  an
    Article 8 application for leave  to  remain  on  4  August  2010.   His
    application was successful and on  31  October  2011,  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain until 30 October 2014.

3.   On 19 April 2013 the claimant was convicted of production of a Class  B
    controlled drug (cannabis) and sentenced to  20  months'  imprisonment.
    He was served with a notice of liability to automatic deportation on 25
    May 2013 and made representations to the Secretary of State with regard
    to his family life with his  British  partner  and  his  three  British
    children aged 3, 5 and 6.  He also argued that he had a private life in
    the United Kingdom.

4.   In deciding this appeal, the judge had regard to  the  applicable  law,
    which she set out at pages 9 to 15.  They were sections 32  and  33  of
    the UK Borders Act 2007, The Human Rights Act 1988, Article  8  of  the
    European Convention and Section 117 of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 (as amended)  which  provides  the  factors  which  the
    Tribunal must  have  regard  where  the  Immigration  Rules,  found  at
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE, reflecting the respondent's Article 8
    obligations do not apply.

5.   The judge concluded as follows:

         "62.  Considering  all  the  evidence  before  me,  including   the
             compulsory considerations at Section 117, in the round, I find
             that the appellant has established  that  the  effect  of  his
             deportation on his British partner and British children  would
             be unduly harsh. Section 117C(3) now makes it abundantly clear
             that where exception (2) applies, the public interest does not
             require deportation.  Whilst I am not entirely certain that  I
             would have come to the same conclusion absent the requirements
             now set down in Section 117 of the 2002 Act, I am mindful that
             the respondent has now taken  the  decision  to  set  down  in
             statute factors to which the  Tribunal  must  have  regard  in
             assessing her obligations.  I may not, therefore, ignore those
             factors and find on balance that Section 117C(5)  applies  and
             deportation is  not  required  in  these  circumstances.   The
             exception found at Section 33(2)(a) applies and I am therefore
             bound to find that the decision is not in accordance with  the
             law.


         63.      This decision has been reached, in part, on the basis that
             the appellant is remorseful and has made  a  genuine  decision
             never to offend again in view of the hurt he  has  caused  his
             British family.....


6.   The Secretary of State appealed on two grounds; first,  it  was  argued
    that the Tribunal erred by failing to give genuine and proper regard as
    to the Government's view on what are unduly harsh effects on a  partner
    or child.  The ground identified  parts  of  the  claimant's  evidence,
    which in their view showed that  the  consequences  of  the  claimant's
    deportation would not result in unduly harsh effects on his partner  or
    children and that the Tribunal failed to identify why the effects would
    be genuinely harsh. The ground relied on D Lee where it was  held  "The
    tragic consequence is that this family, short-lived  as  it  has  been,
    would be broken up forever because of the  appellant's  bad  behaviour.
    That is what deportation does".  In light of AD Lee it was argued  that
    the claimant's circumstances would  not  result  in  consequences  that
    would be unduly harsh and any separation has not only  been  caused  by
    the claimant's own actions, but that it is proportionate to deport him.
     There are no factors in the claimant's case which set it apart from an
    ordinary family life claim. The Tribunal in effect has found  that  the
    claimant's  assistance  is  preferable  and  in  the  children's   best
    interests, but this would not led to unduly harsh consequences and  the
    claimant's circumstances are not very strong  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in line with the case law of SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550.

7.   The second ground argued that the  Tribunal  failed  to  give  adequate
    consideration to the Secretary of State's public interest policies  and
    that given the  severity  of  the  offence  committed,  the  Tribunal's
    findings were inadequate. Mr Avery relied on the appellant's grounds.

8.   Section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended) which the judge relied  on  to  allow  the  claimant's  appeal
    provides as follows:

         "Article 8: Additional considerations in  cases  involving  foreign
             criminals.


              (1)      The deportation of foreign criminals  in  the  public
             interest


             (2)  The more serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                  criminal the greater is the public interest in deportation
                  of the criminal.


             (3)  In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not  been
                  sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  four  years  or
                  more, the public interest requires C's deportation  unless
                  Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.


             (5)  Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and  subsisting
                  relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and
                  subsisting parental relationship with a  qualifying  child
                  and the effect of C's deportation on the partner or  child
                  would be unduly harsh."

9.   In this case the judge recorded at paragraph 55 the evidence  that  the
    Secretary of State accepted.  She accepted  that  the  claimant  has  a
    genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  three   British   citizen
    children, one of whom  is  a  stepchild  and  the  other  two  are  his
    biological children. There is no indication that the eldest  daughter's
    biological father plays any rose  in  her  life.  The  claimant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting with his British citizen partner.   With  regard
    to  her  duty  under  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship   and
    Immigration Act 2009, the Secretary  of  State  acknowledged  that  the
    claimant and his partner  were  the  primary  carers  for  their  three
    children and that it would be unreasonable to expect the three  British
    citizen children to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.   It  would  be  more
    difficult for the witness to raise and care for  their  three  children
    without the claimant being physically here to help  and  support  them.
    The claimant's absence will be to  the  children's  disadvantage.   The
    deportation of the claimant  is  likely  to  result  in  some  negative
    emotional impact on the three British children and may have a financial
    impact on the family.  The contact between the claimant and his  family
    from Vietnam would not be of the  same  quality  as  remaining  in  the
    family home or even living separately but in the same  country.   There
    is resulting interference with  Article  8  rights  by  virtue  of  the
    claimant's deportation.

10.  At paragraph 56 the judge directed herself correctly  that  with  these
    factors accepted by the Secretary of State, the question  which  arises
    under the new Section 117C(5) is whether or  not  the  effect  of  this
    claimant's deportation on his  partner  or  children  would  be  unduly
    harsh.

11.  Mr Avery submitted, and I accept, that the unduly harsh test is a  high
    one.  I find that the test is one of proportionality which involves the
    balancing of the claimant's circumstances against  the  effect  of  his
    removal on the British partner and the British children.  I also accept
    his submission that it is the  circumstances  of  the  claimant's  case
    which determine whether the effect of the  claimant's  removal  on  the
    partner and their children would be unduly harsh.

12.  I accept Counsel's submission that  the  judge  took  as  her  starting
    point  the  judge's  sentencing  remarks.  The  judge  said  that   the
    sentencing remarks indicate that it was accepted to  some  extent  that
    the claimant has been  na�ve and fallen into offending as a result. The
    judge also noted that the claimant has in the past been  convicted of a
    previous offending involving  the  use  of  a  false  driving  licence.
    However the appellant was well aware of this offending when she decided
    to grant him discretionary leave to remain on  Article  8  grounds.   I
    find contrary to Mr. Avery's submission that the judge was entitled  to
    take this evidence into account.

12.  With regard to his production of cannabis in his home for which he  was
    sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment, the judge regarded the claimant's
    offending as serious, not least his apparent reluctance to accept  that
    he knew he was doing anything wrong, which he did not  accept  entirely
    the view of the judge's sentencing remarks, but also the fact  that  he
    used his family home where children were living in order  to  cultivate
    cannabis. The judge was in no doubt that this is a serious offence  but
    took into account that this is not an offence involving  violence,  sex
    or  the  invasion  of  another  individual's  home.   Nevertheless  she
    regarded the nature of this offence was such that the  public  interest
    in deportation was considerable.

13.  I  do  not  find  that  the  judge  was  attempting  to  undermine  the
    seriousness of the claimant's crime when she said it was not an offence
    involving violence, sex or the invasion of another individual's home or
    by her finding that whatever the truth of the  matter,  the  claimant's
    offending has been linked to his desire to provide financially for  his
    partner and his children.  It was clear from the determination that the
    judge regarded the claimant's offence as  very  serious  and  that  the
    public interest in his deportation was considerable.  The judge did not
    at any time lose sight of the seriousness of the claimant's offence.

14.  The judge  considered  that  the  claimant  presented  as  a  genuinely
    remorseful man, who regrets bitterly the effect of his offending on his
    partner and daughters.  In  view  of  his  genuine  commitment  to  his
    British family, the judge found it unlikely  that  the  claimant  would
    risk further criminal convictions knowing, as he now  does,  that  this
    may well separate him from his family forever.  The judge had no  OASys
    Report or NOMS report before her and, in the circumstances I find  that
    it was reasonably open to the judge to draw her own conclusion from the
    totality of the evidence that he represents a low risk  of  reoffending
    at the present time.

15.  The judge also considered that the Secretary of State's lawful aim  has
    aspects to it beyond the  protection  of  society  from  an  individual
    reoffending.  She said there are also the  further  aspects  of  public
    revulsion and the  need  to  deter  others  from  undertaking  criminal
    activity. Along with the other factors set out in the new Section 117C,
    the judge gave these facets of the respondent's aim considerable weight
    in the balancing exercise.  She came back to  the  wording  of  Section
    117C(3) and noted that by statute public  interest,  although  she  had
    given it considerable weight, did not  require  deportation  where  the
    effect of the deportation on the  partner  or  child  would  be  unduly
    harsh.   She found that the  effect  on  both  the  claimant's  British
    partner and three children would be unduly harsh.

16.  Her reasons for that finding can be found at paragraphs 60  and  61  as
    follows:

         "60.   I accept  the  appellant's  financial  contribution  to  the
         family household is not large, but I accept that he has, now, begun
         to learn some English and that he wishes  to  support  his  family.
         Everything he has done indicates that he does wish to  support  his
         family financially.  I accept that he is a committed  and  involved
         parent and, also, that his daughter  wish  him  to  return  to  the
         family unit and household.  The appellant was keen to  shown,  with
         out inconsiderable pride, the colourings and card his children have
         sent him whilst he has  been  detained.   I  accept  the  witness's
         evidence that she is suffering considerable stress  managing  as  a
         single mother with three children whilst the appellant is detained.
          Not lease, she describes fielding continual questions  from  these
         three young girls as to the whereabouts of  their  father  and  the
         timing of his return home.  I also accept, as set out at  paragraph
         8 of the witness's statement that the appellant's involvement  with
         his children goes beyond the mere emotional and into the practical.
          I accept that he is involved in helping  with  homework,  dropping
         them at school and assisting his  partner  in  running  the  house.
         Deportation does not simply remove the appellant  from  the  United
         Kingdom, but prevents him from applying to re-enter for a number of
         years until that order is revoked.  The effect of  the  appellant's
         deportation is that three British children will grow up in a single
         parent household without the presence of the father who raised them
         from birth.  Their contact with their father  will  be  limited  to
         telephone calls, email and, possibly,  very  occasional  visits  to
         Vietnam.  I also find it highly unlikely that this  household  will
         ever be able to become financially self-sufficient if their  mother
         is left to raise three daughters single-handedly.  The implications
         of deportation go beyond  the  emotional  and,  I  find,  into  the
         practical and financial.

         61.   The witness impressed me as a woman doing her best to cope in
         difficult circumstances, but was clearly finding a  strain  on  her
         time and her ability to manage the three children and her household
         chores alone.  The letter  from  the  appellant's  neighbour,  Mrs.
         Patricia Richardson-Jones,  indicates  that  the  family  have  had
         difficulties in the appellant's absence.  She also attests  to  the
         close relationship between the appellant and his children  and  his
         role as an involved father.  I have no doubts that the  effects  of
         deportation on both the witness and children would be considerable.
          The question is whether they would be "unduly" harsh.   This  will
         obviously depend upon the weight to be given  to  the  respondent's
         lawful aim which, in turn, amounts to whether those  harsh  effects
         are "due" on the basis of the offending.   I  have  found,  on  the
         evidence before me, that the appellant does not pose a high risk of
         reoffending and, also,  whilst  I  consider  his  offending  to  be
         serious, it is non-violent offending it has been as a result of his
         desire to support his family.

17.  I find that the factors identified by the judge cumulatively  meet  the
    unduly harsh test. I find no error of law in the judge's decision.

18.  The judge's decision allowing the claimants appeal shall stand.
