                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant was born in C�te  d'Ivoire  on  27  September  1982.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2011 and claimed asylum  two
    days later on 4 January  2011.   His  application  was  refused  on  21
    January 2011.  He appealed but his appeal was dismissed on 16 May 2011.

2.   He made further submissions by post on 22 November 2011 and  in  person
    on 8 April 2013.  His submissions were refused  on  13  May  2015.   He
    appealed and his appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana,
    who dismissed his appeal on 29 October 2015.  He appealed against  this
    decision on 12  November  2015  and  on  24  November  2015  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Zucker granted permission and on  1  December  2015  the
    Secretary of State filed a Rule 24 response.

3.   As was said by Counsel for the Appellant, the task faced  by  a  second
    First-tier Judge reviewing  findings  made  by  an  earlier  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is challenging.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana  was
    obliged to take the decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel as her
    starting point. But when doing so she had to take into account the fact
    that she had been provided with fresh evidence, which  was  not  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel. In particular, she had to give proper
    weight to this fresh evidence, which was  contained  in  a  psychiatric
    report by Professor Katona, a scarring report  by  Dr.  Joyce  and  the
    document from the Helen Bamber Foundation, which  confirmed  that  some
    three years later the Appellant was still receiving treatment from  the
    Foundation.

4.   At first blush  it  appears  that  Judge  Chana  had  directed  herself
    correctly to this  evidence.  For  example,  at  paragraph  45  of  her
    decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana said:
         "I am mindful that a decision maker must deal with a medical report
         as an integral part of the findings on  credibility  and  must  not
         artificially separate that evidence from the rest of  the  evidence
         and reach conclusions as to credibility without reference  to  that
         medical evidence."

5.   But in paragraph 44 of her decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana
    also said in relation to Professor Katona's  psychiatric  report:  "His
    report is based primarily on what the  Appellant  told  him  about  his
    circumstances, although he took into account other documents as set out
    in the report.  There is no updated report."   She  does  not  actually
    explain in any detail what she gained, if anything, from his report  or
    what weight she had given to it when considering the  totality  of  the
    evidence.  In  addition,  by  commenting  that  his  report  was  based
    primarily on what the Appellant  had  told  him,  she  was  not  giving
    sufficient  weight   to   Professor   Katona's   professional   skills,
    observations and experience as a psychiatrist and was implying that, if
    she found the Appellant's account not to be credible,  she  would  give
    little weight to Dr. Katona's report. She  also  failed  to  take  into
    account the fact that some three or four years after being referred  to
    the Foundation, the Appellant was still receiving treatment there.

6.   This was of particular concern as she had  copied  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuel's earlier findings into paragraphs 32 to  34  of  her  own
    decision without indicating whether  she  was  going  to  review  these
    findings on the Appellant's credibility  in  the  light  of  the  fresh
    evidence now before her.

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana also had a scarring report by Dr  Joyce
    before her, which was not before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Manuel.  In
    paragraph 42 of her decision she stated that she place no  reliance  on
    this report. However, in his report, Dr Joyce was careful to make clear
    that, at best, there were three scars which were  consistent  with  the
    account given by the Appellant of being beaten and  tortured.   He  did
    not seek to go any further than that and made quite clear that  he  did
    not believe that there was any evidence to show that the hernia  was  a
    result of beating. (Furthermore, at the time of his  report,  case  law
    had  not  required  scarring  reports  to   explicitly   consider   the
    alternative causes of any scars.) Nevertheless, the fact that he  found
    the three scars to be consistent indicates that he did  not  disbelieve
    the Appellant's account for on medical grounds.

8.   The findings in the scarring report are also arguably  consistent  with
    the report by Professor Katona and the fact that the Appellant is still
    undergoing treatment for trauma. In my view, it was  also  unreasonable
    to  expect  the  Appellant  to  provide  medical  reports  which   were
    contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous to the beatings  and  torture
    he said he had suffered. I also note that the report was obtained a few
    months after the Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom.

9.   The fact that First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana gave  no  weight  to  Dr.
    Joyce's report and very little, if any, weight  to  Professor  Katona's
    report does not suggest that she properly looked at the totality of the
    evidence  before  her  before  making  the  same  adverse  findings  of
    credibility as First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuel.

10.  Furthermore, it appears  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chana  also
    failed to take into account evidence in the Appellant's Bundle, about a
    new conflict in C�te d'Ivoire between the people in the North  and  the
    South of that country and between members  of  different  religions.  I
    have also noted that the Appellant did not say that he  was  afraid  of
    members of the previous regime in Cote d'Ivoire. Instead,  he  said  he
    was afraid of supporters of the previous regime who had been  armed  by
    them.  Therefore, if  there  is  renewed  conflict,  there  may  be  an
    objective basis for his fears.

11.  As a consequence, I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana did  make
    material errors of law in her decision.

Notice of Decision

12.  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.

13.  The Appellant's appeal is remitted  to  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,
    other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana, for a de novo hearing.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
