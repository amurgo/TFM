Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Akindele, instructed by A&A Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, Adebisi Oyindamola Famakinwa, date  of  birth  17.4.63,
    and her son, David Oluwadara Famakinwa,  date  of  birth  18.9.00,  are
    citizens of Nigeria.

 2. These are their linked  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Ghani  promulgated  2.4.15,  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decisions of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  30.4.14,  to
    refuse their applications made on 6.3.14 for leave to remain in the  UK
    on the basis of private and family life, and to remove them from the UK
    pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
    2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.3.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on 6.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Ghani should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    appellant has two children, a daughter born in 2002 in Ireland, and the
    second appellant, born in 2000 in Canada. The first appellant's husband
    passed away in 2006. She is well educated with a  Master's  degree  and
    worked for 3M in Nigeria before leaving that employment to come to  the
    UK in 2014. The  daughter  experienced  developmental  and  behavioural
    problems and had an initial diagnosis of ADHD in 2009. Friends  of  the
    first appellant offered to help, and suggested bringing the daughter to
    the UK, which happened in December 2011. The daughter was placed  in  a
    private fostering arrangement, but that did not work out and the  first
    appellant's friends were  unable  to  cope  with  the  daughter  beyond
    December 2013. According to the respondent, the first appellant came to
    the UK on 25.1.14 as a visitor,  accompanied  by  her  son  the  second
    appellant. The grounds of appeal suggest she came in September 2013. In
    any event, she has remained here since that time  and  on  6.3.14  made
    application for leave for her and her son to remain  on  the  basis  of
    private and family life.

 7. It is common ground that the appellants cannot meet the requirements of
    either Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules,  but
    sought to rely on article 8 ECHR. The judge went on to consider article
    8, making an assessment of the best interests  of  the  children  as  a
    primary consideration and pursuant to  section  55  of  the  2009  Act.
    Ultimately, the judge reached the conclusion that the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was proportionate to the rights  of  the  appellants
    and the first appellant's daughter.

 8. In essence, the grounds of appeal submit that the judge  made  mistakes
    of fact material to the outcome of the appeal, including the COI report
    findings on care of people with  autism  in  Nigeria,  when  the  first
    appellant's daughter does  not  have  autism  but  ADHD  and  a  severe
    learning disability. It is also asserted that the judge failed to  take
    material  evidence  into  account  and  failed  to  reconcile  apparent
    conflicts of evidence. Further, it is argued that the judge  failed  to
    take account of the concession by  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the
    daughter, who is not a party to the appeal, does not have to leave  the
    UK because she is a citizen of Ireland and therefore a citizen of an EU
    member state.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Reid found it,  "arguable  that
    the judge did not make adequate findings in respect of the  immigration
    status of the first appellant's daughter and failed to demonstrate  the
    factors which he had taken into account in assessing the complex  needs
    of the child and her best interests. It is arguable  that  the  judge's
    findings were unclear. The grounds disclose no arguable error of law."

10. The Rule 24 response, dated 16.7.15, assert that there is no  merit  in
    the grounds of appeal. The reliance by  the  judge  on  autism  is  not
    material as severe learning difficulties and ADHD are both co-morbities
    that exist on the Autism Spectrum Disorder scale.  I  agree  with  this
    submission. Whilst Mr Akindele  suggests  that  there  is  no  evidence
    before the Tribunal to this effect, it is also true to state  that  the
    appellant has adduced no evidence to demonstrate  that  the  judge  was
    factually wrong. In the circumstances,  the  appellant  has  failed  to
    demonstrate that there is an error of law in this regard.

11. It is the contention of the appellant, set out at  �3  of  the  grounds
    that there was a concession by the Secretary of State's  representative
    at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing that as the daughter is an EU
    citizen (Ireland) there is no requirement for her to leave the  UK  and
    thus no removal directions were issued for her.

12. This concession is not referred to in the decision of Judge Ghani,  but
    is addressed in the Rule 24 response, which submits that the concession
    of the Secretary of State that EEA children will not be removed, except
    on public policy grounds,  does  not  change  the  law  that  they  may
    reasonably be required to leave the UK with their parents and thus does
    not affect the outcome of the appeal.

13. I was unable to obtain any clarity at the error of law  hearing  as  to
    the nature of the concession. It was not clear  to  me  that  what  was
    being referred to was a specific concession at the hearing, or  whether
    reference was being made to a concession of the Secretary of State that
    EEA children will not be removed.  It  seems  more  likely  to  be  the
    former.

14. At �16 the judge stated that the daughter was entitled to come  to  the
    UK as an EU citizen. However, if it is the case that  the  daughter  is
    exercising Treaty rights in the UK as a student (regulation  6  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006), and cannot  be  removed,  that  is
    highly relevant to both the assessment of the  best  interests  of  the
    child and to the proportionality of removing the  mother  and  sibling.
    Clearly, the best interests of the child are to remain with her  mother
    and sibling in the family unit and the mother and sibling will  not  be
    removed if the child is remaining in the UK.

15. There are situations where the reasonableness of expecting a  child  to
    leave the UK is considered theoretically for the purpose  of  assessing
    whether a parent should be removed. For example, under  regulation  15A
    consideration is given as to whether a British citizen child would have
    to leave the UK if a non-EEA primary carer is to be removed. Under both
    section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act and  paragraph  276ADE,  there  is  the
    identical assessment as to whether it would be reasonable to  expect  a
    qualifying child to leave the UK, where qualifying means a child who is
    a British citizen, or one who has lived in the UK for at least 7 years.
    Similarly, there may be an assessment as to whether it is reasonable to
    expect a British citizen or settled partner to leave the UK to continue
    family life with the non-British or settled  partner  outside  the  UK.
    However, even though there was not a  EEA  application  or  appeal,  it
    appears to me to be inappropriate to assess either the  best  interests
    of that child pursuant to section 55, or indeed the proportionality  of
    the removal decision in respect of the two  appellants  without  taking
    account of the status of the child. Not only was that not done  by  the
    First-tier  Tribunal,   but   the   best   interests   or   exceptional
    circumstances consideration in the decisions of the Secretary of  State
    made no reference  to  the  nationality  or  residence  rights  of  the
    daughter of the first appellant.

16. In the circumstances, I find that there  were  errors  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that it must be set aside.  In
    remaking that decision, I find that the decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State was flawed and not in accordance with  the  law  for  failure  to
    consider as part of the best interests of the children  the  daughter's
    nationality and the implications of removal of the parent  and  sibling
    where the child could not be removed.

17. I am further concerned that the decision of the Secretary of State  did
    not  carry  out  an  adequate  best  interests  consideration  of   the
    daughter's circumstances consistent with section 55. I  have  carefully
    considered the decisions of MK and JO  and  others  (section  55  duty)
    Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC). MK held that  the  burden  is  on  the
    appellant to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that there has
    been a breach of section 55 by the Secretary of State, and  this  issue
    was not raised by the appellant at all. As stated  in  Zoumbas  v  SSHD
    [2013] 1WLR 3690, it is important to have a clear  idea  of  a  child's
    circumstances,  and  what  is  in  a  child's  best  interests   before
    considering whether the force of other considerations  outweighs  those
    interests. There is no substitute for  a  careful  examination  of  all
    relevant factors when the interests of a child are involved.

18. Further, I am concerned as to whether the decision of the Secretary  of
    State was taken with the statutory guidance in mind. JO held  that  the
    duty imposed by section 55 requires the decision maker to  be  properly
    informed of the position of a child affected by  the  discharge  of  an
    immigration function. "Thus equipped, the decision maker must conduct a
    careful examination of all relevant information and factors."

19. It is not clear to me that the Secretary of  State  was  alive  to  the
    issue of the EEA state nationality of the daughter. It may be  that  it
    was not raised in the application, but I can see that it did form  part
    of the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and  thus  by  that
    stage at least the Secretary of State was on notice.

20. In the circumstances, the appropriate course in remaking  the  decision
    in the appeal is to allow the appeal to the  limited  extent  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State is not in accordance  with  the  law
    and that it remains for the Secretary of State to make a decision which
    is compliant with the law.

Conclusions:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I allow the appeal to the limited extent that I find the
                    decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance
                    with the law and that it remains for  the  Secretary  of
                    State to make a decision that is in accordance with  the
                    law.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal is allowed only to the limited extent that the  decision
of the Secretary of State is not in accordance with the law. The  appellants
may well bear responsibility for not informing the  Secretary  of  State  of
the issue of the child's nationality and EEA status prior to the  making  of
the decision.
