                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bart-Stewart, promulgated on  16th  November  2016,  following  a
    hearing at Birmingham, Sheldon Court on  3rd  November  2016.   In  the
    determination, the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon
    the Respondent Secretary of State subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria, who was born on 4th June
    1985.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent Secretary  of
    State dated 21st September 2015 refusing leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom, on the basis that he had not met the eligibility  requirements
    at E-LTRPT.2.2. under the 5-year Rule and Appendix  FM  R-LTRP.1.1.(d).
    The Secretary of State did not accept that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the Appellant's family life with  his  partner  continuing
    outside the UK.  It was not considered that there were very significant
    obstacles to his return to his home country.  His parents and  brothers
    were in Nigeria and they can help him to reintegrate.   There  were  no
    exceptional circumstances raised in the application.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he had made an application for  leave  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of his private life when on June 2014  he
    applied for a variation of leave as a spouse, and this was rejected due
    to the payment transaction  being  declined  on  5th  July  2014.   His
    representatives wrote to the Respondent on 11th July  2014  questioning
    the rejection.  There was a reply that was received on 20th August 2014
    stating that the transaction had been declined.  A further  application
    was then submitted on 9th September 2014 which was beyond the  28  days
    for being treated as in time.  This was refused and there was no  right
    of appeal on the basis of  this  being  out  of  time.   The  Appellant
    appealed and the appeal was heard on 2nd  February  2015  and  remitted
    back to the Secretary of State as the provisions of Basnet [2012]  UKUT
    00113 had not been complied with and he was unable  to  show  that  the
    initial application was invalid.   Moreover,  the  Respondent  had  not
    served a full bundle of documents.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge noted how the application of the Appellant with  the  payment
    not having been taken, was returned to the Appellant's solicitors  with
    a letter  dated  5th  July  2016.   This  letter  stated,  "your  fresh
    application should be returned to the address given on the  application
    form".  The representative responded (see page 161 of the main bundle).
     They returned the application.  They did not state this  was  a  fresh
    application.

 5. The judge observed that,

         "Whilst the Appellant in oral evidence said he completed and signed
         a fresh application form his partner was clear that she only signed
         two forms".  As Sponsor she would have had to sign the  application
         form.  Having regard  to  her  evidence  and  the  wording  of  the
         solicitor's letter I consider that the likelihood is  that  it  was
         the rejected application that was resubmitted with the photocopy of
         the payment card.  It was not a fresh application and moreover  the
         signed authorisation to take the fee would no longer  be  available
         (see Basnet).  It is unfortunate that the Respondent then took more
         than six weeks to reply by which  time  the  28  days  to  make  an
         application which  would  be  treated  as  in  time  had  expired."
         (Paragraph 14).

 6. The appeal was allowed.

The Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge  failed  to  apply  the
    appropriate threshold for a consideration of appeal  under  Article  8.
    The Court of Appeal judgments in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387  and  R
    (Agyarko) [2015] EWCA Civ  440  were  material.   Moreover,  the  judge
    wrongly assessed that  the  Appellant  would  face  undue  hardship  in
    relocating in  Nigeria.   The  assessment  of  proportionality  in  the
    decision in the light of the  Appellant's  employment  record  and  the
    partner's earnings was flawed.

 8. On 3rd April 2017 permission to appeal was granted.

 9.  On  20th  April  2017  the  Upper  Tribunal  determined  that  it  was
    unnecessary to hold an oral hearing because the  application  could  be
    dealt with on the papers.

Submissions

10. Appearing for the Respondent Secretary of State, Mr Mills, argued  that
    the judge had failed, in her brief determination, to give consideration
    to the issue of proportionality, at paragraph 22 of her decision  where
    Sections 117A to D of the NIAA 2002  fell  to  be  applied.   This  was
    important in the context of whether the  Appellant  could  satisfy  the
    ï¿½18,600 financial threshold test.   The  issue  here  was  whether  the
    Appellant could, without undue hardship, relocate to  Nigeria  and,  in
    this respect the assessment of proportionality  by  the  judge  in  the
    light of the Appellant's employment record and his partner's  earnings,
    was significant because it did seem that the Appellant had  ceased  his
    employment on expiry of his student visa, and the partner earned  below
    the minimum threshold level.

11. Second, the judge was plainly wrong  in  stating  that,  "it  has  been
    established that the test here  is  not  exceptional  circumstances  or
    insurmountable obstacles"  (at  paragraph  20).   This  observation  is
    ameliorated by the recognition in the same paragraph that,  "where  the
    Rules and the learning on Article 8 were in harmony the answer given by
    the Rules might render further enquiry unnecessary, unless  there  were
    exceptional circumstances." (Paragraph 20).

12. The Supreme Court judgments now see ([2017] UKSC  10  and  11)  in  the
    cases of MM (Lebanon) and Agyarko do, submitted Mr  Mills,  uphold  the
    requirement that there have be "exceptional circumstances" and it  must
    be shown that there are "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  the  Appellant
    finding it possible to enjoy a family life in her home  country.   Yet,
    if one looks at paragraph 20 of the judge's determination, it is  plain
    that the requirement of "exceptional  circumstances  or  insurmountable
    obstacles" is indicated by the judge to be not the correct test.   This
    was an error.  Furthermore, if one then considers how the assessment is
    undertaken by the judge  (at  paragraph  22),  it  is  plain  that  the
    Appellant could not have succeeded because the application had  expired
    by more than 28 days when the decision was undertaken on it.

13. For his part, Mr Sarwar submitted that ultimately, no matter which  way
    one phrases it, the test is one of "proportionality" and that  this  is
    clear from the Supreme Court judgment in Agyarko.

14. Firstly, if one looks at the treatment  of  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    undertaken in Agyarko (at paragraph 42) the Supreme Court is clear that
    in Jeunesse, the Grand Chamber identified, "a number of factors  to  be
    taken into account in assessing the proportionality under Article 8  of
    the removal of non-settled migrants."   (Paragraph  42).   It  is  then
    stated that:

         "Relevant factors were said to include the extent to  which  family
         life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties  in  the
         contracting state, whether there were 'insurmountable obstacles' in
         the way of the family living in the country of origin of  the  non-
         national concerned, and whether there were factors  of  immigration
         control ...."  (Paragraph 42).

15. Second, the Supreme Court went on to explain how,

         "It  appears   that   the   European   Court   intends   the   word
         'insurmountable obstacles' to be  understood  in  a  practical  and
         realistic sense, rather than as referring solely to obstacles which
         make it literally impossible for the family to live together in the
         country of origin of the non-national concerned".

16. It is then explained how in the previous case law references have  been
    made  to  "major  impediments"  or  to  "the  test  of   insurmountable
    obstacles" or whether the family could "realistically" be  expected  to
    move.  The Supreme Court explained that "it is a stringent test".

17. Third, the Supreme Court goes on to say that,

         "If that test is not met, but the refusal of the application  would
         result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, such that refusal would
         not be proportionate, then leave would be granted outside the Rules
         on the basis that  there  are  'exceptional  circumstances.'"  (See
         paragraph 48).

18. Fourth, when consideration is given to "exceptional circumstances"  the
    Supreme Court makes clear that, "the European Court has said  that,  in
    cases concerned with precarious family life, it is 'likely' only to  be
    in exceptional circumstances  that  the  removal  of  the  non-national
    family member will constitute a violation of  Article  8."   (Paragraph
    58).

19. However, the court then goes o to say that, "the European  Court's  use
    of  the  phrase  'exceptional  circumstances'  in  this   context   was
    considered by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192
    (paragraph 56).

20. Nevertheless, having considered all of this, the court goes on  to  say
    that,

         "Ultimately, is has to decide whether the refusal is  proportionate
         in the particular case before it, balancing  the  strength  of  the
         public interest in the removal of the person  in  question  against
         the impact on private and family life.  In doing so, it should give
         appropriate weight to the Secretary of State's policy, expressed in
         the Rules and instructions, that the public interest in immigration
         control can be outweighed,  when  considering  an  application  for
         leave to remain brought by a person in the  UK  in  breach  of  the
         Immigration Rules, only where there are 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         or 'exceptional circumstances' as defined." (Paragraph 57).

21. Finally, the court goes on to say that,

          "The Secretary of State has not imposed a test  of  exceptionality
         in the sense that the  case  should  exhibit  some  highly  unusual
         feature,  over  and  above  the  application   of   the   test   of
         proportionality.   On  the  contrary,  she  had  defined  the  word
         'exceptional', as already explained, as  meaning  circumstances  in
         which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for
         the individual such that the refusal of the application  would  not
         be proportionate." (Paragraph 60).

22. On this basis, submitted Mr Sarwar, the judge  was  entirely  right  to
    have  allowed  the  appeal.   The  decision  was  in  accordance   with
    established jurisprudence.  The judge was clear that, "there is nothing
    to suggest that the Appellant will not have met the other  requirements
    of Appendix FM and whilst  there  was  a  chance  of  refusal  and  the
    Appellant having to leave I do not consider this  a  likely  scenario."
    (Paragraph 21).

23. After this the judge then considered  whether  there  was  a  good  and
    arguable case for the appeal to succeed outside the  Immigration  Rules
    and at paragraph 22 allowed the appeal on the basis of proportionality.



24. All in all, therefore, the correct test was applied.

25. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that proportionality was a process and not
    a test and it was for the judge to demonstrate that Article 8(2) of the
    HRA had been given due consideration.  The judge does not expressly ask
    herself the question whether the decision is proportionate.

No Error of Law

26. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    amount to an error of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that  I
    should set aside the decision and remake the decision.

27. First,  the  judge  makes  it  quite  clear  at  paragraph  14  of  the
    determination that the application was not a fresh application but  was
    a existing application which had been resubmitted with the photocopy of
    the payment card and that, "it is unfortunate that the Respondent  then
    took more than six weeks to reply, by which time the 28 days to make an
    application,  which  would  be  treated  as  in  time,  had   expired."
    (Paragraph 14).  That is an entirely material fact which it was  proper
    for the judge to have at the forefront of her mind.

28. Second, the judge  does  not  misdirect  herself  in  relation  to  the
    requirement of "exceptional circumstances or insurmountable  obstacles"
    because there is recognition of it being necessary to show  that  there
    were "exceptional circumstances" (paragraph  20),  and  the  judge  has
    indeed practically applied that test to the facts of this case.  Third,
    the jurisprudence now clarified in MM (Lebanon)  and  Agyarko  confirms
    that the approach of the judge was the correct approach.

29. Finally, the relevant factors in relation to  proportionality  are  set
    out by the judge in that the wife is a UK national, her  family  is  in
    the UK, she has never been to Nigeria, she has a  very  real  worry  of
    relocating to Nigeria, she would not be able to support  her  partner's
    entry clearance application on her low  income,  and  that  she  speaks
    English and is in employment  here.   The  judge  also  makes  the  not
    insignificant observation that whilst "little weight should be given to
    a private life established by a person at  a  time  when  the  person's
    immigration status is precarious" this did not, nevertheless, mean that
    she should attach no weight to  it  and  that  "there  is  an  implicit
    distinction with family life."  (Paragraph 22).

30. This Tribunal can only intervene in a decision below if the decision is
    plainly irrational or "perverse" and I cannot  conclude  that  this  is
    such a case.

Notice of Decision

31. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

32. No anonymity direction is made.
