For the Respondent:          Mrs M S Ababo, Sponsor in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge A E Walker in which she allowed the appeal
    of AKD, a citizen of Ethiopia, against the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision to refuse leave to enter and settle in the United  Kingdom  as
    the adult dependent relative of the Sponsor. I shall refer  to  AKD  as
    the Applicant, although she was the Appellant in the proceedings below.


 2. The Applicant is the mother of the Sponsor who holds refugee status  in
    the United Kingdom. On 15 January 2014 the Applicant applied for  entry
    clearance to enable her to join the Sponsor in the United Kingdom.  The
    application was refused on 5 February 2014 by reference to paragraph EC-
    DR.1.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC395).  The  Applicant
    exercised her right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  This is  the
    appeal which came before Judge Walker on 21 November 2014 and dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules but was allowed on  human  rights  grounds.
    The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The application was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Levin on 4 March 2015 on the basis that the Judge  arguably  failed  to
    take into account the public interest considerations  by  reference  to
    section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  and
    failed to have regard  or  sufficient  regard  to  the  general  public
    interest considerations.




 3. At the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Richards  appeared  to  represent  the
    Secretary of State and the Sponsor appeared on behalf of the Applicant.
    As the Sponsor did not have legal representation I explained to her the
    nature of the hearing and the procedure to be followed.


Background


 4.  The  history  of  this  appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  facts,  not
    challenged, are that the Applicant was born in  Ethiopia  on  20  March
    1958. She was widowed in 2008 when her husband died in prison.  At  the
    date of the application she was living with the Sponsor's  husband  and
    her grandson but they had been granted permission to join  the  Sponsor
    in the United Kingdom and would shortly be leaving  and  the  Applicant
    would then be alone. The Sponsor had always lived  with  the  Applicant
    and  her  family  in  Ethiopia  until  she  left  the  country  fearing
    persecution arriving in  the  United  Kingdom  on  15  May  2013.   The
    Applicant suffers from various  medical  conditions  including  asthma,
    high blood pressure  and,  she  claims,  debilitating  depression.  The
    Sponsor's husband and son joined the Sponsor in the United  Kingdom  by
    way of family reunion on 3 April 2014 and since then the Applicant  has
    lived alone. The Applicant is financially dependent on the Sponsor  who
    sends a sum equivalent to ï¿½137.40 every month despite being reliant  on
    public benefits including job seekers allowance and housing benefit.


 5. In dismissing the appeal by reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules  the
    Judge found that the evidence  from  the  Applicant's  doctor  did  not
    corroborate the Applicant's account of being disabled or to suffer from
    depression (paragraph 33) and that the Sponsor's concern for her mother
    had caused her to exaggerate the Applicant's needs (paragraph 34).  The
    Judge  also  noted  that  the  Sponsor  was  reliant  on  public  funds
    (paragraph 36). These factors caused the Judge  to  conclude  that  the
    Applicant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


 6. The Judge went on to allow the appeal by reference to  Article  8  ECHR
    finding that  the  Applicant  had  strong  emotional  ties  to  and  an
    emotional dependence upon the Sponsor  and  her  family  and  that  the
    family life that the Applicant enjoyed with the Sponsor  could  not  be
    enjoyed other than in the United Kingdom.


Submissions


 7. On behalf of the Secretary  of  State  Mr  Richards  said  that  little
    elaboration was needed on the grounds of appeal. The  Judge  refers  to
    her statutory duty to take into account section 19 of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014 (introducing sections 117A and 117B of the 2002 Act) early  on
    in her decision and sets out its terms. The Judge then goes on to  find
    that the Applicant does not qualify under the Rules but goes on to find
    in relation to  Article  8  that  the  Applicant's  exclusion  was  not
    proportionate to the aim of effective immigration control. She fails to
    carry out the duty she had earlier referred to. Section  117B  includes
    reference to the ability to speak English and to  be  self  sufficient.
    There are however no findings in this regard. Earlier in  the  decision
    when considering the Immigration Rules the Judge finds that the Sponsor
    is reliant on public  funds  and  supported  the  Applicant  from  this
    country. Whilst the Judge makes a finding concerning legitimate aim she
    makes no finding in relation to public interest. In these circumstances
    the Judge has failed to adequately  reason  her  findings.  This  is  a
    material error of law.


 8. The Sponsor said that in her opinion the Judge made the right decision.
    The Applicant will be under the Sponsor's responsibility. Her inability
    to speak English will not be a  problem  in  these  circumstances.  The
    Applicant has no one in Ethiopia. The Sponsor is her only daughter. The
    Sponsor is trying to improve her English she is looking  for  work  and
    she is trying to fit into society. Even now  she  takes  responsibility
    for the Applicant and it costs her more money than it would if she were
    here - it would be easier for everyone if she were here. This  is  very
    serious, the Applicant has no one. She is not well. She  is  suffering.
    The Applicant had never been separated from her children before and has
    never lived alone. The Sponsor feels selfish when she  knows  that  the
    Applicant is suffering.


 9. I reserved my decision and said that if I found an error of law I would
    go on to remake the decision. The Sponsor submitted  various  documents
    including telephone cards  showing  her  continuing  contact  with  the
    Applicant and a letter written in Amharic that  the  Sponsor  said  was
    from a neighbour who said that she  could  not  help  and  support  the
    Applicant any longer.


Decision - Error of law


10. The grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  are  straightforward
    asserting that the  Judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the  public
    interest and adequately reason her proportionality findings.


11. The facts of this appeal have been detailed above. The Judge found that
    the Applicant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
    This finding has not been challenged and indeed there can be  no  basis
    upon which it  could  have  been  challenged.  Having  found  that  the
    Applicant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  the
    Judge goes on to consider the impact the refusal has on the Applicant's
    family life and being satisfied that prior to the  Sponsor's  departure
    for the UK the Applicant was part of the family  unit  finds  that  the
    refusal does interfere with the Applicant's family life. In making this
    finding the Judge properly self directs to ZB (Pakistan) v SSHD  [2009]
    EWCA Civ 834 in assessing why family life between a  parent  and  adult
    children could be considered for Article 8 purposes.  This  finding  is
    entirely consistent with the reasoning of the Court of  Appeal  in  the
    recent decision in Singh & Anor v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 630.


12. The Judge then goes on to make  further  findings  including  that  the
    Applicant has strong emotional ties to and an emotional dependence upon
    the Sponsor and her family, that she has no one to whom  she  can  turn
    for such support in Ethiopia and  that  the  Sponsor's  refugee  status
    means that this family life can only be enjoyed in the United  Kingdom.
    The Judge then goes  on  to  make  her  proportionality  assessment  as
    follows

        "I  conclude  that  the  refusal  is  an  interference   with   the
        appellant's family life and  that  this  interference  although  in
        pursuit of the legitimate aim of effective immigration  control  is
        not  proportionate  to  that  aim  so  that  the  refusal  of   the
        Appellant's application is sufficiently serious as to amount  to  a
        breach of the fundamental right protected by Article 8."




13. In my judgement it is plain that this is not a properly  considered  or
    adequately reasoned proportionality balancing exercise. Having detailed
    the 'positive' matters in the proportionality balance the Judge  merely
    recites the words 'effective immigration control' as an acknowledgement
    of the  public  interest.   There  is  no  self  direction  as  to  the
    provisions of section 117B of the Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 other than the reference at paragraph 12 to the requirement to
    take into account its provisions. The Judge is considering this  appeal
    under Article 8 ECHR with this being the only live  issue  before  her.
    Section 117A of the 2002 requires the Judge in all cases to have regard
    to the provisions of section 117B when considering the public  interest
    question and section 117B mandates that the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration control is in the public interest. The  decision  does  not
    show that the Judge has considered the public interest question or  had
    regard to the provisions of  section  117B  in  doing  so.  This  is  a
    manifest and material error of law. If the  Judge  had  regard  to  the
    provisions of  section  117B  the  following  findings  would,  on  the
    evidence before her,  have  been  made  and  taken  into  account  when
    considering the public interest.

          i) The Applicant does not speak English (117B(2))


         ii) The Applicant  is  not  financially  independent  being  wholly
             reliant  upon  her  family  in  the  United  Kingdom  who   are
             themselves reliant on public funds (117B (3)).


14. The decision does not show that the Judge  has  considered  the  public
    interest question in  accordance  with  section  117B  and  that  is  a
    manifest error of law. The decision does not show that  the  Judge  has
    adequately reasoned her findings. That also is an error  of  law.  Both
    are material to the decision to allow the appeal.  The  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State is therefore allowed and the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside.


Remaking the decision


15. I said that if an error of law was found I would  remake  the  decision
    based upon the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal and the
    additional evidence submitted by the Sponsor.


16. In remaking the decision I accept firstly that the  Applicant  and  the
    Sponsor lived in the same household as a family unit until the  Sponsor
    left for the United Kingdom and that the Applicant  continued  to  live
    with the Sponsor's husband and child until they too left  to  join  the
    Sponsor in the United Kingdom. I accept that this is a family unit with
    interconnecting family lives and that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision interferes with the maintenance and development of that family
    unit. I note the Judge's  finding  of  strong  emotional  ties  and  an
    emotional dependence and in my judgement this is  something  more  than
    the  normal  love  and  affection  between  parent  and  adult  sibling
    justifying a finding of family life for the purposes of the Convention.
    In this respect I have considered the judgement of Sir Stanley  Burnton
    in Singh and Anor (see above). I accept that the Respondent's  decision
    will cause an interference in the Applicant's family life of sufficient
    gravity to engage the Convention.


17. The Applicant does not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    in these circumstances the  Respondent's  decision  is  lawful  and  in
    pursuance of the legitimate  aim  of  immigration  control.  The  issue
    becomes one of proportionality.


18. On the positive side of the proportionality balance I take into account
    the positive findings of the First-tier Tribunal. The Applicant is a 57
    year old widow who has lived alone in  Ethiopia  since  her  daughter's
    departure in 2013 and the departure of her son-in-law and grandchild in
    2014.  She  suffers  from  chronic  asthmatic  bronchitis,  high  blood
    pressure treated with amlodopine, rheumatism and  menopausal  syndrome.
    The  report  from  Dr  Shemsu  presented  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    concludes


        "For the above problems she  was  put  on  amlodopine,  celestamine
        (short course), seretide inhaler, selbutamol syrup  and  analgesic.
        Patient adviced (sic) to avoid triggering conditions  and  to  have
        regular follow up."

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not accept  that  the  Applicant  was
    disabled or that she suffered from debilitating depression.


19. The Judge found that the Applicant had strong emotional ties  with  the
    Sponsor and her family and an emotional dependence  upon  them  as  her
    only family. She has no other family to whom she can turn in Ethiopia.


20. Against the above must be balanced the  public  interest  in  effective
    immigration control. In this respect the Immigration Rules provide  for
    the admission of adult dependents and it is  axiomatic  that  effective
    immigration control dictates that in normal circumstances a person  who
    does not meet the requirements of the rules will not be  admitted.  The
    Applicant does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  She
    does not meet those requirements because on the findings of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge she does not require  long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks and she does not meet the financial requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.


21. In my judgement the  reasons  why  the  Applicant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  are  important  factors  in  the
    Article 8 proportionality balance. Whereas she is emotionally dependent
    upon the Sponsor and her family the Judge did not accept (paragraph 37)
    that no help could be obtained for her  and  indeed  in  the  past  the
    family have had the help of a paid maid. The fact  that  she  does  not
    meet the financial requirement of the Immigration Rules means that  she
    is not financially independent so  no  credit  can  be  given  in  this
    respect by virtue of section 117B.


22. Taking account of all  of  the  above  it  is  my  judgement  that  the
    proportionality  balance  is   overwhelmingly   weighed   against   the
    Applicant. The Applicant is a 57 year old widow who  suffers  from  the
    normal medical complications of late middle age. Having spent the first
    55 years of her life with her family around her she  now  lives  alone.
    Many people of the Applicant's age live alone and the Applicant has the
    benefit of financial support from the Sponsor  to  help  to  ameliorate
    some of the difficulties that she may otherwise face. I have  no  doubt
    that living alone for the first time in her life has been and continues
    to be difficult for her particularly because  of  her  close  emotional
    ties to her daughter and family but  given  her  failure  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and the clear public interest  in
    effective immigration control these  are  not  sufficiently  compelling
    reasons for entry clearance to be  nevertheless  granted.   Her  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision is dismissed.


  Summary


23. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I allow the Secretary of State's appeal and  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


24. I remake the decision and I dismiss the Applicant's appeal against  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision to refuse leave to enter.
