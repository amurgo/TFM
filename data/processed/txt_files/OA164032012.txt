                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Background

 1. On 26th  March  2014  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  White  gave
    permission to the appellant to  appeal  against  the  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal I  Ross  in  which  he  dismissed  the
    appeal against the decision of the respondent  on  26th  July  2012  to
    refuse leave to enter as a spouse in accordance with the provisions  of
    paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.   The  sole  issue  before  the
    judge was whether or not the parties intended to live permanently  with
    each other and the marriage was subsisting.

 2. With reference to the grounds of application  Judge  White  thought  it
    arguable that Judge Ross had erred in failing to take into  account  or
    make adequate findings with regard to evidence listed in sub-paragraphs
    (vi) to (vii) of the grounds.  In particular it was contended that  the
    judge had made no reference to 30 pages of photographs of  the  parties
    together in Albania, had failed to give reasons for not  accepting  the
    sponsor's claim to have visited his wife in Albania and failed to  take
    into account Skype records showing lengthy telephone calls between  the
    parties.

Error on a Point of Law

 3. Mr McVeety reminded me that a response had been  submitting  contending
    that the judge had directed himself appropriately and  made  reasonable
    sustainable findings.  However he frankly indicated  that  the  judge's
    negative conclusions in paragraph  11  of  the  determination  appeared
    problematic in view of the significant number  of  photographs  of  the
    parties together.  He also conceded that, although the  telephone  text
    messages had not been translated for the purpose of the hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal  they  were  still  capable  of  showing  large
    numbers of communications  between  the  parties.   In  concluding  his
    submissions Mr McVeety added that, in the light of the grounds, he also
    had to concede  that  the  findings  of  the  judge  were  inadequately
    reasoned.

 4. Ms Shaw confirmed that the appellant relied upon the grounds which  she
    did not seek to repeat.

 5. After considering the matter for a few moments I announced that  I  was
    satisfied that the determination showed errors on points  of  law  such
    that it should be re-made.  My reasons for that conclusion follow.

 6. The judge was faced with a considerable amount of evidence  capable  of
    supporting the claim that the parties were in a subsisting relationship
    on the basis explained in Goudey (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan
    [2012] UKUT 00041(IAC).  This included evidence of  Skype  phone  calls
    and a very significant number of photographs of the  parties  together.
    Yet the judge does  not  give  adequate  reasons  for  dismissing  this
    evidence before concluding that the parties were not  in  a  subsisting
    relationship.  The judge reaches two conclusions in paragraph 11 of the
    determination which can be regarded as irrational in the  legal  sense.
    First he dismisses the sponsor's frequent visits to  Albania  from  May
    2011 as evidence of the relationship on the basis that the sponsor, now
    a British citizen, still has ties to Albania  when  such  visits  could
    count as  clear  evidence  of  the  subsistence  of  the  relationship.
    Second, the judge regards it as a factor pointing to incredibility that
    the settlement application was made within two weeks  of  the  marriage
    when  such  an  application  would  normally  be  regarded  as   highly
    supportive of the relationship.

 7. Perhaps of greater significance is the judge's rejection of  the  Skype
    telephone conversations simply because they had  not  been  translated.
    The records clearly show to whom the calls were made and the  frequency
    of such calls.  This information is given in English.   The  judge  has
    not adequately explained why such evidence had to be rejected in  these
    circumstances.  The  determination  also  makes  no  reference  to  the
    numerous photographs showing the parties together in several  different
    locations.  The appellant is recognisable from  her  visa  application.
    As it is well established that such evidence is capable  of  supporting
    the existence of a relationship, the judge's omission of  reference  to
    this evidence is material.

 8. The errors I identified lead me  to  conclude  that  the  determination
    cannot stand and should be re-made. I so stated

Re-making the Determination

 9. After reaching the above conclusion I continued by hearing  very  brief
    submissions from both  representatives.  Mr  McVeety  made  no  further
    submissions save to agree that it would be appropriate for me to  allow
    the appeal in the light of the evidence submitted.  Ms Shaw concurred.

10.  Prior  to  the  hearing  before  me  representatives   had   submitted
    translations of the Skype telephone messages along with a  printout  of
    further  messages  taking  place  between  the  parties   and   further
    photographs.  The translation  clearly  showed  the  use  of  terms  of
    affection between the parties. It would be difficult  to  dismiss  such
    evidence on the basis that it did not show  a  subsisting  relationship
    between husband and wife.  There was also evidence in  the  form  of  a
    money transfer receipt and pay  information  for  the  sponsor  showing
    annual earnings in excess of ï¿½21,000 per year although maintenance  was
    not an issue in the respondent's refusal.

11. Having regard to the original evidence  in  statement  and  documentary
    form before the First-tier Judge and the fresh  evidence  submitted  to
    show the circumstances appertaining at the  time  of  the  respondent's
    decision, I was able to conclude, without difficulty, that the  parties
    met the relevant provisions of paragraph 281 of the Immigration  Rules.
    I therefore allowed the appeal  on the basis that the  parties  are  in
    are in a subsisting relationship and intend to  live  permanently  with
    each other as spouses and can  meet  all  the  relevant  provisions  of
    paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules in force  at  the  time  of  the
    respondent's decision.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal showed errors on points of  law
such that it should be re-made.  I re-make the determination by allowing  it
on immigration grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity order nor  do  I  consider
one to be appropriate, it not having been requested.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Ms Shaw suggested that a fees order could be made.  However I  do  not  make
such an order as it  is  my  view  that  it  is  only  with  the  additional
information now put before me that the respondent would  have  been  obliged
to approve the application.
