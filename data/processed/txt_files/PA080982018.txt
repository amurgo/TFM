                            DECISION AND REASONS
The background

   1. The appellant is an Iranian Kurd. He made a claim for protection on
      the basis he and his brother had been involved with the KDPI.Etellat
      came to their home and arrested his brother and other family members.
      He managed to escape and made his way across Europe. En route he
      converted to Christianity and began attending a church, initially in
      Manchester and then Liverpool.

   2. His claim for protection, made on 15 December 2015, was refused on 9
      May 2016 on credibility grounds. His appeal was heard by First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Moxon on 7 February 2017 and dismissed in a decision
      promulgated on 14 February 2017. At that stage the appellant said he
      had been baptised on 26 July 2016. The judge heard evidence from 2
      members of the Christian church he attended. Again, the judge did not
      find the appellant's account credible.

   3. On 25 April 2018 further representations were made on his behalf.
      These referred to his ongoing Christian beliefs and sur place
      activities on behalf of the KDPI. The latter included attending
      demonstrations and Facebook activity. A letter dated 8 July 2017
      confirming his membership of the KDPI and involvement was submitted.

   4. Protection was again refused on 3 May 2018. Reference was made to the
      earlier findings in relation to credibility by First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Moxon. Little weight was attached to the letter on 8 July 2017
      and the respondent did not accept his sur place activities would not
      bring him to the adverse attention of the Iranian authorities.

   5. His appeal against that decision was heard by First-tier Tribunal
      Judge A.R. Hudson on 13 August 2018. In a decision promulgated on 28
      August 2018 his claim was again dismissed. The judge heard from 2
      different church members. Again, the judge did not find the appellant
      to be a credible witness. The judge referred to the earlier decision
      of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon and the Devaseelan principle.

   6.  The judge accepted the appellant had been attending church and had
      been baptised. The 1st judge had said his attendances were for the
      purposes of his claim or else to socialise with other Iranians at the
      church and did not accept he was a genuine Christian convert. Before
      First-tier Tribunal AR Hudson he said he had begun evangelising. The
      judge accepted his account of involvement but questioned his motives.
      The judge accepted the church witnesses gave their evidence truthfully
      but that they offered little insight into the appellant's true
      motives.

   7. The judge then dealt with the appellant's Facebook entries which
      disseminated Christianity and KDPI taglines. The judge concluded the
      postings were entirely self-serving made for the purposes of his
      claim. Regarding the demonstrations the judge concluded that his
      presence would not have been noted by the Iranian authorities.

   8. The judge had also found that if the appellant had left Iran illegally
      this in itself would not give rise to real risk of persecution. The
      judge had found he had no political profile. The judge acknowledged
      being Kurdish was an exacerbating factor but not sufficient to place
      him at real risk.

The Upper Tribunal

   9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis it
      was arguable the judge erred in law in the approach taken towards the
      supportive evidence of the church members. This was in light of the
      guidance given by the Inner House in TF and MA [2018] CSIH 58. That
      decision also concerned Iranian nationals claiming protection on the
      basis of conversion to Christianity after their arrival in the United
      Kingdom as well as anti-regime activities and a claim of being Gay.
      The genuineness of those conversions as well as the other aspects of
      their claims had not been believed.

  10. The Inner House made the point that the fact an individual may have
      lied about some aspects did not necessarily mean they were lying on
      all matters. The Inner House gave guidance as to the status of
      evidence from church leaders about the religious conduct of the
      individual and their opinion as to their sincerity. The court took the
      view that in some respects the evidence of the church witnesses could
      be considered as expert evidence. There was a generalised discussion
      about the nature of faith and beliefs.

  11. At hearing, Mr Tan accepted there was merit in the grounds advanced
      for which permission was granted, particularly from paragraph 5
      onwards. He also made the point that time had now passed, meaning
      there was a greater opportunity by the church members to observe the
      appellant over an extended period.

Conclusions

  12. The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge A.R. Hudson has been
      carefully prepared and sets out the claims made and the evidence put
      forward in support. The judge had the benefit of the earlier decision
      of First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon. The decision reflects a scepticism
      about the genuineness of the claims being made.

  13. The genuineness of the claimed conversion is extremely difficult to
      determine. The judge had accepted the appellant was dutiful towards
      the church and its members but suggested this was motivated by a wish
      to promote his claim. The genuineness of the appellant also impacts
      upon the likelihood of him wanting to evangelise if returned to Iran.

  14. The judge did not have the benefit of the views of the Inner House on
      this issue and its consideration of the previous jurisprudence. In
      considering the error of law question I am required to have regard to
      things as they are now understood. Albeit with this hindsight, an
      error of law has been accepted by the presenting officer in relation
      to how the judge dealt with the church witnesses. In the interests of
      justice I find this a fair concession by the presenting officer. It
      was also accepted there was merit in the points made in the grounds in
      relation to the Facebook activities.


Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge A.R. Hudson materially errs in
law and is set aside for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly

Directions

   1. Relist in the First-tier Tribunal at Manchester for a de novo hearing,
      excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Moxon and  First-tier Tribunal
      Judge A.R. Hudson.
   2. The hearing should focus upon the appellant's claimed conversion to
      Christianity. Related to this, is his claim of a wish to proselytise.
   3. There has been no challenge to the rejection of the appellant's
      account as to why he left Iran. Rather, the focus at the relisted
      hearing should be upon his sur place activities in relation to the
      KDPI, including his Facebook activity.
   4. The parties should also consider the risk to the appellant on return
      simply for being Kurdish if he left the country illegally.
   5. A hearing time of 2 ï¿½ hours is anticipated. The appellant intends
      giving evidence and at least 2 witnesses from the church may attend.
   6. The appellant's representative has indicated a  Farsi rather than
      Kurdish Sorani interpreter is required.
