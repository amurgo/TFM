For the Appellant:         Mr C Timpson (Counsel, instructed by Whitefield
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:      Mr C Bates (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellants, who are all over 21, are siblings and are nationals of
   Pakistan, they are the adult children of the Sponsor, their father who is
   an Italian national. They had applied under the EEA Regulations 2006 as
   the adult dependent relatives of an EEA national in the UK exercising
   treaty rights. The applications were refused for the reasons given in the
   Refusal Letters of the 12th of July 2016.

2. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. The appeals were
   heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne at Manchester on the 19th of
   June 2017 and dismissed in a decision promulgated on the 17th of July
   2017. The Appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
   which was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman on the 22nd of
   December 2017 leading to the hearing on the 9th of March 2018.

3. The findings of Judge Thorne start at paragraph 32 of the decision. He
   found that the Sponsor is an EEA citizen in the UK exercising treaty
   rights. The Judge went on to find that there were a number of serious
   inconsistencies in the evidence which undermined the claim to be
   dependent on the Sponsor. The Judge found that they had been inconsistent
   with regard to the time they lived in Italy without the Sponsor and very
   limited evidence of financial dependency, there being evidence of only 2
   Moneygrams. There was no evidence that the Appellant's were not capable
   of work or that they had problems that as adults would make them
   dependent on the Sponsor.

4. With regard to the UK it was accepted that they live together with the
   Sponsor but again the evidence was inconsistent with regard to how they
   were dependent on the Sponsor. The suggestion that the Second and Third
   Appellants were dependent on the Sponsor was rejected. Of the First
   Appellant the Judge said "In relation to A1, it may be that she does not
   work, but it is clear to me that she chooses not to." The Judge went on
   to find that the Sponsor's earnings were such that it was highly unlikely
   that he was able to support all of his children and his wife.


5. The grounds of application argue that the Judge erred in the approach
   taken to the dependency of the Appellants on the Sponsor and applied the
   wrong test that being of factual dependency. The reasons for dependency
   being irrelevant. The findings in relation to the earnings of the Sponsor
   were also flawed as the Sponsor had additional income in the form of tax
   credits and that was not an issue that had been raised in the Refusal
   Letter. It is also argued that the consequences of the decision would be
   disproportionate requiring the Appellants to return to Italy or Pakistan.




6. At the hearing the representatives made submissions in line with their
   respective positions. These are set out in the Record of Proceedings and
   are referred to where relevant below.


7. The Judge was clearly unimpressed with the evidence of the Appellants
   with regard to their personal circumstances both in Italy and the UK. The
   Judge rejected the evidence in relation to the Second and Third
   Appellants' circumstances in the UK. The findings in respect of the First
   Appellant are ambiguous in paragraph 35 finding that "it may be that she
   does not work, but it is clear to me that she chooses not to." I read
   that as a finding that if the First Appellant does not work it is by
   choice. However it is not an unequivocal finding that the First Appellant
   does not work and it appears that that was a matter on which the Judge
   was not satisfied that the burden of proof had been discharged.


8. That is not a material point given the findings in paragraph 35 where
   the judge found that the evidence did not show that the Sponsor was
   financially able to support all of his children and his wife. The
   evidence of the Sponsor's earnings is set out in paragraph 29 where it
   appears that the Sponsor earned up to �1,400 a month with tax credits and
   child benefit for his 2 youngest children.


9. The full figures are not given but it is clear that the funds coming
   into the household from the Sponsor are limited out of which it is
   claimed that he is supporting 5 adults and 2 children. With rent of �575
   a month and council tax of �80 a month it is clear that the resources
   available are very limited.


10. As the evidence was led before the Judge and he referred to it the
   evidence was directly relevant to the issue of dependency which was the
   issue to be decided. The findings made in paragraph 36 were in the
   context of the rejection of much of the other supporting evidence that
   had been considered by the Judge. Taking the evidence overall, and given
   the central importance of the ability of the Sponsor to provide support
   this was an issue that the Judge was entitled to consider in the context
   of the balance of probabilities.


11. The complaint about the consequences of the decision is irrelevant.
   There was no section 120 Notice and article 8 issues do not arise in EEA
   appeals. If the Appellants wish to have their circumstances considered on
   a different basis then they would have to make a separate paid
   application under the Immigration Rules.


12. The decision has to be read as a whole. On a fair reading of the
   decision whilst some of the phrases employed might have been more tightly
   drawn it is clear that the Judge rejected the Appellants' case that they
   were dependent on the Sponsor. The judge also rejected the claim that the
   Sponsor was in a position to support the Appellants. Those findings were
   open to the Judge on the evidence that was presented and considered by
   him. The grounds work on the basis of a narrow textual analysis which is
   an approach deprecated by the by the Court of Appeal and do not disclose
   that the Judge erred. The decision of Judge Thorne stands as the disposal
   of this appeal.


CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.


Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.

Signed:


Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
