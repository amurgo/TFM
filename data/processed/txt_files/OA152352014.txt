                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Pakistan  date  of  birth  11  April  1988,
    applied for entry clearance as the partner of the Sponsor, Mr  Mohammed
    Qasim Shakeel, a United Kingdom citizen.  The application  was  refused
    on 5 November 2014 on the basis that the Claimant had failed to provide
    the required document, namely a bank  statement  that  showed  payments
    into the account  of  cash  earnings  which  he  had  received  from  a
    particular part of his employment with a bakery.

3.   The Claimant in making representations to the  ECO  had  not  explained
    the lack  of  the  specified  evidence,  namely  the  bank  statements,
    evidencing the receipt of those earnings.  Similarly in the grounds  of
    appeal against the ECO's decision the document submitted to  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager had done no more than say that there  had  been  non-
    compliance with the specific evidence because  it  was  regarded  as  a
    waste of time for the Sponsor to pay into his bank account cash in hand
    payments and then take them out again. It was not suggested at the time
    that the Sponsor could not have a bank account because of a poor credit
    record.

4.   What is clear is that ultimately bank  statements  were  produced  much
    later which went to show that a relative of the Claimant  had  had  the
    bank  account  which  ultimately  was  put  into  the  Sponsor's  name.
    However, the continued problem was that the bank account did  not  show
    the necessary level of income from the Sponsor's bakery  activities  as
    an  employed  person.   In  the  circumstances  the  evidence  was  not
    sufficient to show that taken with his self-employment  activities  the
    Sponsor had the combined  financial  income  threshold  of  �18,600  as
    evidenced by the specified documents required.

5.   That position remained so before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Stott  who,
    in his decision of 31 March 2015 allowed the appeal on the  basis  that
    other information had been provided which demonstrated the Sponsor  did
    have the necessary earnings in total.

6.   A factual error is to be found in paragraph 7 of the  decision  but  it
    makes no material difference to the point as to when the Sponsor had  a
    bank account because he did not have on the evidence,  showing  through
    the account, sufficient moneys to meet the  financial  threshold  under
    the Rules.

7.   In a Rule 24 response from Counsel, Mr Pipe, and in submissions  by  Mr
    Bradshaw, the point was generally put that the Secretary of State had a
    discretion under the guidance on Appendix FM-SE specified  evidence  as
    at 5 November 2014 to waive  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  in
    particular reference was made to paragraph D(e) which states

         "Where the decision maker is satisfied there is a valid reason  why
         a specified document cannot be supplied, e.g.  because  it  is  not
         issued in a particular country or has been permanently lost, he  or
         she may exercise discretion not to apply the  requirement  for  the
         document(s) or to request alternative or additional information  or
         document(s) be submitted by the applicant."

8.   In this case two things are  evident.   Firstly,  this  issue  was  not
    raised before the ECO nor was it raised  as  part  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal considered by the ECM, and simply there was nothing to  indicate
    why discretion should be exercised, nor that there was evidently  other
    documentation highlighted which would demonstrate  the  required  issue
    that the necessary funds were passing through a  bank  account  at  the
    material time.

9.   Therefore it does not seem to me that the matter  was  highlighted  for
    the exercise of discretion.  Similarly it seemed to me that as a matter
    of law the judge was wrong to embark upon such a course which  was  the
    primary function of the Secretary of State to exercise.  It is accepted
    in the submissions made by Mr Bradshaw  that  those  matters  were  not
    argued before the judge whether or not there was a discretion  open  to
    him to exercise to show that the Appellant, notwithstanding he had  not
    met the requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  could  put  together  other
    evidence to show the financial threshold was met even if that  did  not
    inevitably follow from the documents that were before  the  judge,  the
    ECO or the Entry Clearance Manager on review.

10.  In these circumstances therefore I have considered the case of  Sultana
    and Others (Rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT  540
    (IAC). It seemed to me that it was not  for  an  Immigration  Judge  to
    exercise discretion when the Secretary of State has not done so.

11.  I find the judge in exercising the discretion he  did,  notwithstanding
    the Sponsor could not meet the specified documents required  under  the
    Rules, was in error of law that could  not  be  remedied.  In  any  the
    purpose of a bank statement being required is to avoid the problems  of
    false receipts/payslips or lack of evidence of  actual  payments  being
    made. In this case the only reason the Sponsor did not bank  his  wages
    from  the  Bakery  was  his  choice:  He  regarded   the   Respondent's
    requirement as irrational (witness  Statement  paragraph  2,  dated  18
    March 2015) because he would deposit the  cash  and  "...  withdraw  it
    instantly."  Yet had he done so there would have been  no  problem  and
    the specified evidence established. I have considerable doubts  whether
    D(d) or D(e) of Appendix FM-SE would apply as a valid reason  from  the
    Sponsor of why the specified document could not be supplied:  A  matter
    for the Secretary of State.

12.  The Original Tribunal's decision can not stand.

13.  In the light of the judge's findings of  fact  it  is  plain  that  the
    Claimant/ Sponsor  could  not  meet  the  relevant  specified  document
    requirements under Appendix FM of the immigration rules. The  following
    decision is substituted.

Notice of Decision

14.  The appeal of the Claimant is dismissed.

Anonymity

15.  No anonymity order was sought nor was one appropriate or necessary.

Fee Award

16.  A fee of �140 was paid.  The appeal has failed  and  therefore  no  fee
    award is appropriate.
