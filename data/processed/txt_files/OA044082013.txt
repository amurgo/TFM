For the Appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Hussain instructed by Legal Justice Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1.  This  determination  concerns  a  resumed  hearing  of  this   appeal.
    Following the earlier hearing, on 10th  June  2014,  I  set  aside  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha by which  he  had  allowed
    under Article 8 ECHR the appeal of Matloob Sarfraz against  refusal  of
    entry clearance as a spouse.  My decision in that regard is annexed  to
    this determination and is incorporated into it.   As  indicated  in  my
    earlier decision in the interests of continuity I continue to revert to
    the parties as they were described before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Judge Sangha had dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and
    there had been no appeal against that decision.  At the commencement of
    the hearing before me it was confirmed that the only issue arose  under
    Article 8.  Judge Sangha had found that as  at  the  date  of  decision
    under appeal (7th December 2012) the gross income of the  Sponsor,  Mrs
    Sabir Sadia, the wife of the Appellant, was �15,600  per  annum.   That
    figure was not in dispute.  The representatives were in agreement  that
    the hearing should proceed by way of submissions only.

 3. Ms Hussain for the Appellant accepted that Judge Sangha had  relied  on
    the judgment in MM  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)  the  relevant
    elements of which have now been overturned by the Court of Appeal in MM
    (Lebanon) and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  It was accepted  that
    the Appellant did not meet the threshold of having an income  available
    from his Sponsor of �18,600 as at the date of  decision.   However  she
    submitted that there were now compelling reasons to  allow  the  appeal
    under Article 8 ECHR.  The Appellant was separated from  his  wife  and
    from his young child, both of whom were British.  The circumstances had
    strengthened since the date of  decision  as  the  Sponsor's  financial
    situation had improved and she could now meet the financial  threshold.
    It was unreasonable to expect the Sponsor and their child to go to live
    in Pakistan, which would involve  the  British  child  in  leaving  the
    United Kingdom and leaving the European Union.  The Appellant  had  met
    the income threshold indicated  by  Mr  Justice  Blake  in  MM  in  the
    Administrative Court and had legitimately relied upon that.

 4. Mr Smart in response relied upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
    MM which he said answered every aspect of the Appellant's  case.   That
    judgment found that it was lawful for the Immigration Rules  to  set  a
    threshold on income at �18,600 for a single adult.  The  Appellant  had
    tried to rely on third party support (albeit the offer  had  only  been
    made after the date of decision) but that was also dealt  with  in  MM.
    He referred in particular to paragraphs 152 and 153 of  that  judgment.
    With regard  to  the  best  interests  of  the  child  he  referred  to
    paragraphs 161 to 163.  It was the child's welfare which was a  primary
    consideration and there was no evidence that the child in this  country
    was at any risk in the care of  the mother.  There were  no  compelling
    circumstances such as to engage Article 8 as at the date  of  decision.
    If the Appellant could now meet the Immigration Rules he should make  a
    fresh application.   The prospect of relying upon public funds  weighed
    heavily in the balance.  He referred to the Court of Appeal judgment in
    AAO v ECO [2011] EWCA Civ 840.

 5. Finally in response Ms Hussain submitted AAO had been decided under the
    old Rules, which rely on income support levels as the yardstick and  it
    was not necessarily the case that this Appellant would become dependent
    on public funds on the basis of the Sponsor's income as at the date  of
    decision.  Having heard those submissions I reserved  my  determination
    of the appeal which I now give.

 6. It is quite clear that the relevant date, both  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and under Article 8 ECHR, is the date of decision.  This  is  put
    beyond doubt by the judgment of the House of Lords in  AS  (Somalia)  v
    SSHD [2009] UKHL 32.  The fact that the Sponsor may now be able to meet
    the requirements of the Rules as to income has no bearing on the issues
    either under the Rules or under Article  8.   Similarly  the  offer  of
    third party support upon which the Appellant sought  to  rely  was  not
    made until after the date of decision.   Third  party  support  is  not
    permitted under the Rules but even  under  Article  8  that  particular
    offer is not potentially admissible as it was made after  the  date  of
    decision.

 7. The guidance in Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 00640 and Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin)  indicates
    that if an Appellant does not meet the requirements of the Rules  there
    need to be good grounds shown for going beyond the  Rules  to  consider
    issues under Article 8 and only if there are  compelling  circumstances
    or the result would be  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  should  the
    appeal be allowed on that basis.  That approach has  been  approved  by
    the Court of Appeal in Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

 8. In order to ascertain whether the  Appellant  has  potentially  a  good
    arguable case under Article 8 which might  entail  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences as a result of the decision  or  compelling  circumstances
    for allowing the appeal I have had regard to the approach to Article  8
    approved by the House of Lords in Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27  and  in
    particular the series of steps suggested by Lord Bingham  at  paragraph
    17.

 9. The Appellant is married to the Sponsor and the  couple  have  a  young
    child now aged 3 years.  There  is  undoubtedly  family  life  and  the
    decision under appeal potentially interferes  with  that  in  that  the
    couple wish to change the terms of the family life  so  that  they  are
    living together in this  country.   Turning  to  the  second  question,
    whilst  the  parties  to  the  marriage  clearly   entered   into   the
    relationship in full knowledge that the Sponsor resides in  the  United
    Kingdom and the Appellant in Pakistan having regard to the judgment  of
    the Court of Appeal in AG (Eritrea) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  801  the
    interference is more than merely technical or academic and Article 8 is
    potentially engaged.  The decision is in accordance with the law  being
    made under the terms of  Statute  and  Immigration  Rules  approved  by
    Parliament and is in pursuit of a legitimate aim, fair  and  consistent
    immigration control which would come within the ambit of prevention  of
    disorder or crime,  maintenance  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the
    country and protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

10. Turning to the final question of proportionality the Sponsor and  child
    are living in this country.  There is no evidence that the  welfare  of
    the child is being adversely affected by those circumstances and it was
    the parties to the marriage who agreed to  run  their  relationship  on
    this basis until the Appellant could obtain  entry  clearance.   Whilst
    ideally the best interests of the  child  may  be  to  live  with  both
    parents there is no pressing need apparent from the evidence that  this
    is a matter of any urgency or  that  the  child  is  suffering  in  the
    meantime.  As at the date of decision the child was aged only 1.  It is
    clear from the judgment in AAO that  the  ability  of  the  parties  to
    maintain themselves is a significant factor in proportionality and this
    Appellant does not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This requirement has now been endorsed by Statute in Section 117B(3) of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002- that  economic  self-
    sufficiency is in the public  interest.   The  couple  have  maintained
    their relationship at a distance.  There is a route available for  them
    under the  Immigration  Rules  (and  it  is  asserted  that  if  a  new
    application were made the Appellant would now succeed).  I perceive  no
    compelling circumstances or unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  flowing
    from the decision.  In short  the  decision  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aims pursued.

11. The Appellant's appeal against the initial decision therefore fails.

12. There was no request for an anonymity order and I  saw  no  requirement
    for one to be made.

13. The judge at first instance made a fee award.  As the appeal now stands
    dismissed no fee award is appropriate.

Notice of Decisions

I have already set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow
the appeal.  I have now remade the decision and  for  the  reasons  set  out
above the appeal is dismissed on all grounds.

The fee award made by the judge at the first instance is also set aside.
