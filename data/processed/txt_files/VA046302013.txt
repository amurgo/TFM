For the Appellant:     Mrs Violet Otti (Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Uganda  born  in  1959.   She  appealed
    against a decision of the ECO, Nairobi  made  on  10  January  2013  to
    refuse entry clearance as a family visitor under paragraph  41  of  the
    Immigration Rules. She wishes to visit her son,  daughter  in  law  and
    family here.

 2. The ECO had asked for details of the Appellant's  income.   She  stated
    that this was the equivalent of �43 a month.  She also supplied a  bank
    statement but this did not show a regular income of �43 a  month.   The
    ECO was not satisfied that the statement was a  genuine  reflection  of
    the Appellant's income.

 3. In her statement the Appellant was able to show she had �728  available
    for her trip but it was noted that  �685  was  paid  into  the  account
    between 31 December 2012 and 4 January 2013.  This equated  to  sixteen
    times her monthly income.  No explanation was provided. As such the ECO
    did not consider that the funds were genuinely available to her.

 4. As a result the  ECO  had  reason  to  doubt  the  genuineness  of  the
    Appellant's intent.  It was  noted  that  she  is  single  and  has  no
    dependent family in Uganda.  What family ties she has  appeared  to  be
    her son and family in the UK.  The ECO considered that there was little
    to encourage the Appellant to return to Uganda after her visit.

 5. She appealed.  No oral hearing was sought.  The case was dealt with 'on
    papers' by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fox.   In  a  determination
    promulgated on 21 October 2013 he dismissed the appeal.

 6. His findings are at [16 - 20], At [16] the judge  stated  that  a  full
    explanation had been  given  about  the  lodgement  of  cash  into  the
    account, namely that she is a subsistence  farmer  and  her  income  is
    calculated by  dividing  the  total  yearly  income  by  twelve.   This
    reflects a monthly income of �43.

 7. As for the lodgement of �685 no explanation had been provided [17].

 8. At [18] the judge concluded that the Sponsor was not able  to  maintain
    the Appellant during her stay here.

 9. The judge concluded (at [19])  that  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    financial  records  produced  gave  an  accurate  reflection   of   the
    Appellant's circumstances.

10. Finally, (at [20]) the judge appeared to accept that the Appellant  has
    family members in the Uganda but considered that there  was  inadequate
    evidence of a commitment to return home at the end of her visit.

11. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by a  judge
    on 29 January 2014 who stated:

         '...

         2.   The grounds amount, for the most part, to a disagreement  with
             the judge's findings but also complain that the  judge  failed
             to give adequate reasons.

         3.   The judge has not provided cogent reasons for the facts found.
              There is an arguable case that the determination  contains  a
             material error of law .'

12. At the error of law hearing before me I sought to  assist  the  Sponsor
    who attended in the absence of a legal representative.

13. The grounds are lengthy but can be summed up thus: the judge failed  to
    note that an explanation for the �685 credit  had  been  provided;  the
    judge failed to consider evidence before him about significant  savings
    held by the Sponsor; the judge failed to consider evidence  before  him
    from the Appellant from which the judge might have concluded  that  she
    had good reason to return to Uganda; the judge's determination showed a
    lack of care: the reference to an appeal from Dhaka rather than Nairobi
    was noted.

14. I concluded that the determination showed material error.

15. The determination regrettably shows a lack of care in  its  preparation
    and proof reading.  At [2] the judge referred to the  High  Commission,
    Dhaka when the appeal is against a decision made in Nairobi.  In itself
    that would not necessarily be anything other than an unfortunate lapse.
     However there are other more serious concerns.

16. As indicated the judge's brief conclusions are at  [16]  to  [20].   At
    [16] he noted the 'full explanation' given for the  Appellant's  income
    namely that the figure of �43 a month income is  got  by  dividing  the
    total  yearly  income  by  twelve.   Although  the  judge   noted   the
    explanation he reached no finding on it.

17. At [17] regarding the credit of �685 he stated that 'no explanation has
    been provided'.  He failed to note that an explanation had  been  given
    in a letter produced with  the  Notice  of  Appeal,  namely,  that  the
    Sponsor had provided it.  A further problem is that the judge wrote:

         'With regard to the lodgement of �685 I note  that  no  explanation
         has been provided.  The Appellant's occupations out of a fire (sic)
         and the deposit could have had many sources or one.  No explanation
         has been provided.'

18. Such only emphasises the lack of care taken by the judge.

19. At [18] the judge considered that having examined the  bank  statements
    of the Sponsor  he  found  them  to  be  insufficient  leading  to  the
    conclusion that the maintenance requirement was not satisfied.

20. There are two problems with this.  First the ECO  took  no  issue  with
    maintenance.  Whilst the judge was entitled to raise it  if  it  was  a
    matter of  concern  to  him  as  an  applicant  must  satisfy  all  the
    provisions of the rule,  in  my  judgment  fairness  required  that  he
    allowed the Appellant the opportunity to comment on it, if necessary by
    setting the  matter  down  for  oral  hearing.   Further,  the  general
    statement that he was not satisfied by the bank statements simply shows
    no analysis of the financial evidence  before  him  which  as  well  as
    statements included payslips and some evidence of savings.

21. Paragraph [19] merely states that the judge was not  satisfied  on  the
    financial evidence produced that it showed a  true  reflection  of  the
    Appellant's assets.

22. Finally, at [20] he wrote:

         'I accept that the Appellant may  have  ties  to  Uganda  by  where
         family members (sic).  Of  themselves  this  may  not  be  adequate
         evidence of a commitment to return upon the  end  of  her  proposed
         visit, to her home country.'

23. Such lack of coherence merely adds to concern about the determination.

24. I concluded that the determination showed material error due to a  lack
    of adequate reasoning.  Mr Tarlow agreed.

25. By consent the determination was set aside.  I proceeded immediately to
    remake it.

26. In brief evidence the Sponsor's wife and Appellant's daughter  in  law,
    Mrs Otti, said that  the  Appellant  was  a  respected  member  of  the
    community.  She does volunteer work for a  health  centre  as  well  as
    earning an income as a farmer.  She has various children all but one of
    whom are adults.  She no longer has financial  responsibility  for  the
    youngest who is 17.  He lives with other family  members  although  she
    looks after him during holidays.

27. She said the Appellant's work is seasonal.  She grows food for  herself
    and sells the excess.  She owns the  land  on  which  she  farms.   The
    credit of �685 was provided by herself (Sponsor) for the  Appellant  to
    buy the ticket to the UK.

28. The Sponsor said the Appellant would return home after the visit.   She
    has her extended family there, and also her  mother  for  whom  she  is
    responsible.  If granted a visa her older children would look after her
    mother during the visit.

29. The Sponsor said that as a British citizen, who is law abiding and in a
    good job as a human resources manager at a major supermarket chain, she
    would ensure that the Appellant returned.  The Sponsor has other family
    in Uganda who might like to visit in future.  If the Appellant breached
    the terms of her visa it would endanger the prospect for them.

30. Mr Tarlow in his submission simply noted the  refusal  letter  and  had
    nothing to add. No issue was taken with maintenance or any other aspect
    of the rule.

31. The ECO's decision was made under paragraph 41 of the Rules.

    Paragraph 41(i) requires that the applicant 'is genuinely seeking entry
    as a visitor for a limited period as stated by her'.

    Paragraph 41(ii) requires that she 'intends to leave the United Kingdom
    at the end of the period of the visit as stated by her'.

32. I can deal with this matter fairly briefly.  The  ECO's  concerns  were
    about the Appellant's financial situation.  I may say that I found  the
    Sponsor to be an impressive and patently truthful witness.  She did not
    seek to exaggerate  the  Appellant's  modest  financial  circumstances,
    namely, that she is a subsistence farmer on land she owns who  supports
    herself by growing crops, and selling some if there is surplus.  I  see
    no reason to doubt the claim that her modest  monthly  income  (c�43  a
    month) is calculated by dividing her yearly income by twelve.

33. I accept the explanation that the �685 paid into the bank account prior
    to the application was from the Sponsor to pay for her flight.  Such is
    mentioned in the Grounds of Appeal.  It  is  also  alluded  to  in  the
    application form (Q70f) where the Appellant  stated  that  the  Sponsor
    would meet her travel costs.  It is a little unfair  to  criticise  her
    for not giving an explanation for it when she was  not  asked.  I  find
    that the funds are genuinely available to her.

34. I found persuasive her comment that with other family members in Uganda
    who she might wish to invite to visit  she would not want  to  endanger
    their prospects by not ensuring that her mother obeyed the terms of her
    visa.

35. I am of course required to consider the credibility  not  just  of  the
    Sponsor but principally of the Appellant.  I see no reason  not  to  do
    so.  None of it was challenged at the hearing. I accept  that  she  has
    several adult children in Uganda and one aged 17  who  lives  with  his
    father but who she cares  for  during  holidays.  Also,  that  she  has
    responsibility for her mother and that there is a large extended family
    there.  I accept also that she has had a respected role  in  the  local
    community for many years as a  volunteer  and  counsellor  at  a  local
    government health centre offering counselling services to HIV patients,
    pregnant women and others.  This was mentioned in the application (Q56)
    and there was paperwork to that effect before the ECO. It has not  been
    challenged.

36. In conclusion, I find that the Appellant has good reason to  visit  the
    UK namely to see her son and other close family members.  Also that she
    has good reason to leave to return to Uganda at the end of  her  visit,
    namely, her mother, her children and  extended  family,  her  voluntary
    work and her life generally there.

37. The Appellant, on the balance  of  probabilities,  satisfies  paragraph
    41(i) and (ii) of the Immigration Rules.  The appeal succeeds.

Decision
