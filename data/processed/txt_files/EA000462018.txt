Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bazini, Counsel instructed by JJ Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)


      1. I  now  remake  the  decision  concerning  an  appeal  against  the
         respondent's  decision  dated  24  October  2016   in   which   the
         appellant's application for a residence  card  was  refused.   This
         decision follows my 'error of law decision' dated 6 November  2020,
         in which I found that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         ('FTT') sent on 23 March 2020, dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
         contained an error of law and would be remade in the Upper Tribunal
         ('UT').



Issue in dispute

      2. The issue before the FTT was whether or not  the  appellant  was  a
         "family member who has retained  a  right  of  residence"  for  the
         purposes of regulation 10 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006
         ('the 2006 Regulations').  At the beginning of the resumed  hearing
         before me both representatives agreed that the  FTT  accepted  that
         all  the  requirements  of  regulation  10(5)  were  met  save  for
         regulation  10(5)(c),  by  reference  to  regulation  10(6)(b),  in
         particular:

               a) The appellant's ex-husband ('H') is a French and therefore
                  an EEA citizen; they married on 20 September 2008  when  H
                  was a "qualified person" because he  was  working  at  the
                  time, and the appellant ceased to be a family member of  H
                  on the termination of their marriage on 30 December 2010.

               b) The appellant was residing in the UK  in  accordance  with
                  the 2006 Regulations as of 30 December 2010, when she  was
                  working as a care assistant.

               c) The appellant is not an EEA national (she is a citizen  of
                  Ghana) but she has been a worker in the UK at all material
                  times.

               d) The appellant was a victim of  domestic  abuse  while  the
                  marriage was subsisting.

      3. Both parties accepted at all material times during  the  course  of
         the UT proceedings (including  at  the  beginning  of  the  resumed
         hearing) that there is a single issue in dispute: whether or not  H
         was a "qualified person" i.e. working or self-employed at the  time
         that divorce proceedings were initiated on 2  June  2010.   I  also
         note for completeness that it is agreed that the parties  separated
         before this i.e. H left the matrimonial home in August 2009.

      4. I pause to note that both representatives submitted that the  older
         2006 Regulations apply because of the vintage  of  the  application
         and decision in this matter.  In any event, given the narrow  ambit
         of the issue in dispute,  it  matters  not  which  version  of  the
         Regulations apply.  The issue before me remains  a  straightforward
         one: was H in employment or self-employed in June 2010.

Evidence

      5. The appellant relied  upon  a  consolidated  bundle  containing  an
         updated witness statement from  her  dated  3  February  2021,  her
         divorce petition, a letter from solicitors dated 18  November  2008
         and a witness  statement  from  Ms  Gregory.   Shortly  before  the
         hearing the appellant filed and served a further witness  statement
         (the March 2021 statement) which she confirmed  together  with  her
         previous statements to be true at the hearing.

      6. The appellant was cross-examined by Mr Bates.  Although there  were
         initial  technical  difficulties,  these  were  resolved  and   the
         appellant was able to fully answer the questions asked by Mr Bates.
          Both representatives expressed satisfaction  that  although  there
         were difficulties, the hearing proceeded fairly.

Submissions

      7. Mr Bates relied upon a position statement dated 9  March  2021  and
         made helpful comprehensive submissions in  support  of  the  SSHD's
         contention that the appellant was unable to displace the burden  of
         proof upon her to establish that H was exercising Treaty rights  at
         the relevant time.  I refer to Mr Bates' submissions in more detail
         below when making my findings.  Mr Bazini invited me  to  find  the
         appellant a credible witness  and  that  she  had  done  enough  to
         establish it was more likely than not that H continued to  work  in
         the UK at the relevant time.

      8. After hearing submissions from both representatives, I reserved  my
         decision which I now provide with reasons.

Findings

      9. The burden of proof remains upon the appellant to satisfy me that H
         was exercising Treaty rights in June  2010,  and  was  therefore  a
         "qualified person"  at  the  time  that  divorce  proceedings  were
         initiated.  The appellant faces obstacles in displacing the  burden
         of proof.  First, she entirely  accepted  that  after  H  left  the
         matrimonial home in August  2009,  she  had  no  contact  with  him
         whatsoever, and could not say with certainty that he  continued  to
         work.   Second,  all  this  happened  over   10   years   ago   and
         corroborating documentary evidence is  very  limited.   Third,  the
         evidence available from HMRC, as set out in  a  statement  from  Mr
         Richards dated 10 April 2019, confirms that H was not in  any  form
         of PAYE employment other than for a short time in a period  between
         October to November 2008, when he earned ï¿½660,  and  there  was  no
         record of any self-assessment or national insurance number for him.
          It is important to record that like Ms Aboni before him, Mr  Bates
         acknowledged on behalf of the respondent, that  the  HMRC  evidence
         did not necessarily mean that H was not  employed  informally.   He
         may of course have been paid 'cash in  hand'.   However,  Mr  Bates
         submitted  that  there  was  no  credible  evidence   of   informal
         employment for the period December 2008 to June 2010.

     10. The most significance evidence that  H  may  have  been  informally
         employed comes from the appellant herself.   I  note  as  Mr  Bates
         reminded me that when she married H she was an unlawful overstayer.
           I  accept  that  this  reflects  adversely   upon   her   general
         credibility.  However it is important to note that the FTT accepted
         her evidence as credible.  This included her claim that she was the
         victim of domestic abuse.  I was  impressed  with  the  appellant's
         evidence before me.  She provided  consistent  and  straightforward
         responses to the questions asked.  She conceded that  she  did  not
         have as much information as she  wished  but  was  adamant  in  her
         consistently articulated belief that when they were living together
         she always believed H to be working.  In my judgment the  appellant
         has provided cogent and credible reasons for holding that belief: H
         left the home  early  and  returned  late  each  day  in  a  manner
         consistent with employment; they shared household  expenditure;  he
         worked in a restaurant before changing his job to work at a company
         "dealing with electrical parts"; when  they  first  applied  for  a
         residence card H had to show  his  payslips  to  solicitors.   That
         account is consistent with the HMRC and SSHD  records  that  H  was
         employed for a period of time at the end  of  2008.   There  is  no
         documentary evidence to confirm H's employment after this time  but
         the appellant carefully and robustly explained in her statement and
         oral evidence that she would not have married a  man  who  did  not
         work or was not prepared to work, and he always worked.   I  accept
         the appellant's evidence that H gave her  every  indication  during
         the time they shared a home that he was  in  full-time  employment.
         She had no concerns that he  was  not  contributing  his  share  of
         household expenditure.  As Mr Bazini observed, the  daily  routines
         described by the appellant were consistent with H's  lawful  albeit
         'informal' employment.  I accept the appellant genuinely believed H
         to have been working during the time that they lived  together  and
         that belief is more likely than not to be well-founded.

     11. The period after H left the matrimonial home up to the date divorce
         proceedings were  initiated  is  more  difficult  to  assess.   The
         appellant has been consistently candid  as  to  this  part  of  the
         chronology.   She  entirely  accepted  that  after   H   left   the
         matrimonial home in August 2009, she no longer had any contact with
         H.  She however stated in her February  2021  statement  that  when
         filing his response to the divorce  proceedings,  H  confirmed  his
         occupation as "delivery driver",  and  this  is  reflected  in  the
         divorce petition.  She explained that this was consistent with  his
         ambition to become a delivery driver, as articulated  to  her  when
         they lived together.  In his position statement, Mr Bates submitted
         that the divorce petition contains no signature from the  ex-spouse
         confirming the accuracy of this information nor any  indication  as
         to whether the occupation was current or historical at the date the
         form was completed. Mr Bates observed that it is  not  unusual  for
         occupations to  be  recorded  even  where  the  individual  is  not
         presently economically active.

     12. In her March 2021 statement the appellant  sought  to  clarify  her
         evidence.  She repeated that she had no personal knowledge  of  H's
         occupation after he left the matrimonial home  and  confirmed  that
         she was only able to speculate that the information concerning  H's
         occupation being as 'delivery driver' in the divorce petition  must
         have come from information obtained by her family  solicitors  when
         liaising with H or his legal representatives at the time.  Mr Bates
         invited me to find  that  this  constitutes  pure  speculation  and
         little weight should be attached to this.

     13. The divorce petition was clearly prepared on the appellant's behalf
         by the family solicitors named within the petition  itself.   I  do
         not accept that they would have engaged  in  guesswork  as  to  H's
         circumstances.  They were able to provide H's full  London  address
         at the time.  There is no reason to believe this to be  inaccurate.
         Indeed the divorce decree was made on 5 October 2010 and  completed
         on 30 December 2010.  It would have been difficult for  the  decree
         to have been lodged on 5 October 2010 in  the  absence  of  correct
         contact details for H.  I am satisfied that it is more likely  than
         not that the family solicitors confirmed H's address and occupation
         with him.  There was no reason for H to lie about his occupation in
         the divorce petition.  The occupation provided must also be  viewed
         in the context of  the  appellant's  own  evidence,  which  I  have
         accepted to be credible  including  the  following:  H  had  always
         worked; he had articulated a desire to be a delivery driver to  her
         during their marriage; she understood from a  friend  that  at  the
         date of the divorce itself H was still working.

     14. I bear in mind that Mr Bates checked Home Office  records  but  was
         unable to find any indication of any subsequent application from  H
         since the sponsorship of the appellant's application.   He  invited
         me to  find  that  particularly  curious  given  the  incentive  to
         regularise 'settled status' on the part of EEA citizens in the  UK.
         In my view the absence of more recent Home Office records does  not
         shed any bright light on H's circumstances so  many  years  ago  in
         2010.

     15.  I  am  satisfied  that  when  all  the  circumstances  are  viewed
         holistically, H was living in the UK and  employed  as  a  delivery
         driver at the relevant date in 2010, as  set  out  in  the  divorce
         petition.  I entirely accept that this  is  inconsistent  with  the
         HMRC evidence.  However, I am satisfied that it  is  more  probable
         than not that after his PAYE employment ended in November 2008,  as
         the appellant claimed H remained in the UK employed on an  informal
         and continuous basis until  the  date  of  the  divorce  decree  in
         October 2010.

Conclusion

     16. Having resolved the sole issue in dispute in the appellant's favour
         I conclude that the respondent's decision under appeal breaches the
         2006 Regulations.

Decision

     17. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under the  Immigration
         (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
