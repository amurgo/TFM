                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born 12 December 1984.  He  appealed
    against a decision of the Respondent dated 8 July  2015  to  refuse  him
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom  and  to  remove  him  by  way  of
    directions under section 47 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2006.  His
    appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 9 April 2018. The Respondent appealed with leave against
    that decision and the Respondent's appeal came before me at Field  House
    on 5 September 2018. I found a material error of law in the decision  at
    first instance and set it aside. I directed that the  rehearing  of  the
    appeal would be before  me  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Annexed  to  this
    determination is my decision dated 17th  of  September  2018  finding  a
    material error of law and setting the earlier decision aside.


 2. The Appellant was granted  leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  on  8
    September 2006 valid until 31 October 2009. He studied an English course
    for one year in 2008. On 15 January 2010  his  application  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) student  was  refused  but  on  21
    April 2010 he was granted further leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    as a student valid until 14 January 2011. This  was  extended  until  30
    April 2014 but on 10 August 2012 his leave was curtailed until 9 October
    2012. The day before that curtailed leave was due to expire,  8  October
    2012, the Respondent granted the Appellant further leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom valid until 3 February 2015.   On  16  May  2014  his
    application for further leave to remain as an entrepreneur  was  refused
    and on 18 June 2014 the Appellant's leave to remain  as  a  student  was
    curtailed to expire on 22 August 2014. On that day the Appellant made  a
    further application for leave to remain as a  student  and  it  was  the
    refusal of that application on 8 July 2015 that gave rise to the present
    proceedings.

Documentation Considered

 3. On the file was the Respondent's  bundle  which  comprised:  immigration
    information on form PF1; witness statements  of  Home  Office  officials
    Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings; report  by  Professor  French  20
    April 2016 and statement from Sonia Poulter 18  November  2016;  Project
    Fa�ade documentation; CAS details; ETS invalid  test  analysis;  refusal
    letter; IELTS certificate dated 29 May 2014.

 4. For the hearing the Appellant submitted a bundle which comprised:  first
    statement of the Appellant dated 15 November 2016 and  second  dated  12
    November 2018;  statement  of  the  witness  Harvinder  Bhuie  dated  12
    November 2018; e-mail correspondence with  ETS;  test  certificates  and
    educational documents

Explanation for Refusal

 5. The Appellant made a number of  applications  for  leave  as  a  student
    during the time he has been in the United Kingdom but two in  particular
    led to the Respondent refusing the August 2014  application.  The  first
    application was on 8 October 2012 and the second on 12 December 2012  in
    both of which the Appellant submitted a TOEIC certificate from Education
    Testing Services (ETS). The Respondent was satisfied that the  Appellant
    had  obtained  that  certificate  fraudulently.  There  was  significant
    evidence that the certificate was obtained by the use of  a  proxy  test
    taker and the Appellant's test was therefore invalid. ETS had  a  record
    of the Appellant's speaking test and using voice  verification  software
    they had  concluded  that  the  language  certificate  was  fraudulently
    obtained by the use of a proxy test taker. ETS declared the  Appellant's
    test to be invalid for that reason and cancelled the scores.


 6. The Respondent refused the application on the general grounds  contained
    in paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules. Paragraph 322(2)  provides
    that  leave  to  remain  should  normally   be   refused   where   false
    representations have been made or there has been a failure  to  disclose
    any material fact for the purpose of  obtaining  leave  to  enter  or  a
    previous variation of leave or in order to  obtain  documents  from  the
    Respondent or a third party required in support of the  application  for
    leave to enter or a previous variation of leave. The Appellant's sponsor
    had withdrawn the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)  and  the
    Appellant did not therefore obtain any points under appendix  A  of  the
    Rules. He could not satisfy paragraph 245ZX (a) of the rules.

 7. The Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  there  was  a
    complete absence of any evidence of dishonesty. The Appellant had failed
    part of the ETS course and then had to complete it  at  another  centre.
    The grounds wrongly stated that the Appellant had taken a test at Thames
    Graduate School in Gants Hill on 21 August 2012. In fact, he  had  taken
    it at South Quay College, which  as  will  be  seen  hereunder  was  the
    subject of an investigation by the Respondent. The grounds continued  by
    saying that the Appellant later took the speaking and writing module "in
    another test centre". This was a reference to Eden College in East  Ham,
    London which was also the subject of an investigation.

 8. If the Appellant had been making a dishonest  application,  the  grounds
    continued, there would have been no need for him to  go  elsewhere.  The
    Appellant spoke excellent English, he  had  an  IELTS  score  of  6  for
    speaking and writing. He submitted his certificate  dated  15  May  2014
    confirming these scores to the Respondent on 6 June 2014. The Respondent
    should have given the Appellant a period of 60 days within which to find
    another college.

The History of the Proceedings

 9. The Appellant's appeal initially came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Aziz sitting at Hatton Cross on 21 November  2016.  He  allowed
    the Appellant's appeal. At [24] and [25] he summarised  the  Appellant's
    evidence concerning the day the  Appellant  took  the  test.  The  Judge
    described the Respondent's evidence of a proxy test taker as generic and
    he was not persuaded that it was significant.  The  Respondent  had  not
    discharged the evidential burden placed upon him. The  Appellant  should
    have been awarded 60 days leave in order to find a new sponsor when  his
    college lost its licence.


10.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that   the
    withdrawal of the CAS was a matter for the Appellant's sponsor  not  the
    Respondent. The Respondent's evidence in  relation  to  the  proxy  test
    taker allegation was wrongly rejected. Permission to appeal was  granted
    and at an error of law hearing before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Latter
    on 14 August 2017 a material error of law was found such that the appeal
    was ordered to be remitted to the First-tier  to  be  reheard.  Although
    there was no material error of law in allowing the appeal on  the  basis
    that the Respondent had failed to give the Appellant 60  days  leave  to
    find a new sponsor, the Judge had  not  correctly  applied  the  3-stage
    approach identified in the Upper Tribunal  authority  of  SM  and  Qadir
    [2016] UKUT 229.

11.   The  first  stage  was  whether  the  Respondent  could  satisfy   the
    evidential burden of showing that there  was  evidence  to  justify  the
    assertion of fraud or dishonesty;  the  second  stage  was  whether  the
    Appellant was able to raise an innocent explanation and  thirdly  if  so
    whether the Respondent could discharge the legal burden of showing on  a
    balance of probabilities that the assertion of fraud or  dishonesty  was
    made out. Judge Latter found that Judge Aziz had  focused  only  on  the
    first stage, whether the evidential burden  was  discharged.  There  was
    evidence that the Appellant's test taken at Eden college was  identified
    as invalid. The generic evidence was sufficient to provide  an  adequate
    basis for an inference that the test was invalid because it was taken by
    proxy.

12. There was specific evidence relating to the test  taken  at  South  Quay
    college which was capable of supporting a finding that the test at  Eden
    college was taken by proxy. There was an  article  from  Project  Fa�ade
    setting out the percentages of those taking the test at Eden college and
    South Quay college. They formed part of  the  background  against  which
    evidence of an innocent explanation could be assessed. Judge Latter also
    found that the Respondent only had to  produce  sufficient  evidence  to
    discharge the evidential burden (at stage I) not significant evidence as
    Judge Aziz had stated.

13. In consequence of the remittal the  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  Adio.  He  allowed  the  appeal  finding  that  the
    Respondent had not been able to discharge the legal burden of  proof  as
    there was  no  voice  evidence  to  compare  the  test  taker  with  the
    Appellant. He noted that the Appellant's command of the English language
    was very good and the Appellant  had  academic  qualifications.  He  was
    willing to give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt that the lack  of
    documents such as the paperwork  which  would  have  been  sent  to  the
    Appellant before he went to the test centre  did  not  necessarily  mean
    that the Appellant did not himself take the  tests.  The  Appellant  had
    shown himself to be a capable student. The Judge was satisfied with  the
    Appellant's oral evidence and found the  Appellant  had  discharged  the
    evidential burden of raising a satisfactory explanation for the  matters
    advanced by the Respondent. The appeal was allowed a second time.
14. The Respondent again appealed arguing that the test was not whether  the
    Appellant could speak English well  now  but  whether  he  had  employed
    deception in the past. The Tribunal it was argued  had  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons when holding that a person who  clearly  spoke  English
    would  therefore  have  no  reason  to  secure  a  test  certificate  by
    deception. Properly read the Respondent's  evidence  submitted  in  this
    case  showed  that  the  Appellant's  English  language  test  had  been
    invalidated because of evidence of  fraud  in  the  test  taken  by  the
    Appellant.

15. Permission to appeal was granted to the Respondent and the  matter  came
    before me. I set the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  aside  and
    ordered that the matter be reheard. There needed to be further  evidence
    from the Appellant about the circumstances in which he took the test and
    the Respondent should try to obtain  any  original  voice  recording  if
    available. At the conclusion of the error of law hearing I indicated  to
    both parties that I would consider my decision in this case and that  if
    I found there was a material error of law  I  would  to  set  aside  the
    decision and make directions for the further hearing of the  appeal.  If
    there was not a material error  of  law,  then  the  decision  at  first
    instance would stand. There were no representations made to  me  at  the
    conclusion  of  the  hearing  as  to  further   disposal   and   in   my
    determination, I directed that the matter should be  reheard  before  me
    for the reasons I gave.

The Preliminary Issue

16. My decision finding a material error  of  law  was  promulgated  by  the
    Upper Tribunal on 29 September 2018. On 18  October  2018  the  Tribunal
    gave notice to the parties that the resumed hearing would take place  on
    14 November 2018, that is four weeks  after  promulgation  and  6  weeks
    after sending out my decision on a material error of law. The day before
    the rehearing, on 13 November 2018, the Appellant's solicitors wrote  to
    the Upper Tribunal applying to set aside my decision and asking for  the
    case to be adjourned.

17. The basis of the application was that the Appellant should  be  afforded
    the opportunity of explaining why an appeal should be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier for rehearing rather than  retained  in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    following an error of law hearing. The application  for  an  adjournment
    came before an Upper Tribunal lawyer who refused to adjourn the hearing.
    The application itself was described by the lawyer as unreasonably  late
    and the matter could not and should not be dealt  with  without  hearing
    submissions from the Respondent.

18.  The normal approach to redetermining appeals where an error of law  had
    been found was for the Upper Tribunal to remake  the  decision  even  if
    further fact-finding was necessary. If there  was  an  issue  about  the
    Upper Tribunal retaining the case and not remitting  it  to  the  First-
    tier, those representing the applicant should  have  raised  it  at  the
    hearing or certainly earlier than a day before the case was listed. Rule
    2(4) of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules placed an obligation  on  the
    parties to help the Upper Tribunal to further the  overriding  objective
    and this had not been done. The matter remained in the list.

19. At the  hearing  before  me  counsel  renewed  his  application  for  an
    adjournment and/or to set aside my decision. It was argued that  by  not
    remitting the case to the First-tier Tribunal  the  Appellant  had  been
    deprived of a right of appeal to the Upper Tribunal. When  the  decision
    of Judge Aziz was overturned the case had at  that  time  been  remitted
    back to the First-tier Tribunal and thus come before Judge Adio. Counsel
    also took issue with my findings of a material error of  law  and  noted
    that voice recordings from ETS had now been obtained. I  pause  to  note
    here that I had directed the Respondent to use his  best  endeavours  to
    obtain such recordings.

20. It transpired that the voice recordings from Eden college were  not  the
    Appellant's voice. It was argued that the Appellant would need  time  to
    consider the implications of this development. This was  said  to  be  a
    very exceptional case justifying the setting aside of an  error  of  law
    decision. The Appellant had satisfied the evidential burden in this case
    of producing some evidence in support of the fact in  issue.  There  was
    said to be no legal error in the First-tier Tribunal's determination.

21. In oral submissions counsel accepted that there was no good  reason  why
    the application to adjourn and set my decision aside was made so late in
    the day. The Presenting Officer argued that retaining the  case  in  the
    Upper Tribunal did not deprive the Appellant of a fair hearing. Two sets
    of voice  recordings  had  now  been  obtained  one  of  which  was  the
    Appellant's voice and the other which was not.

22. I indicated that I was not prepared to adjourn the case or set aside  my
    decision that found a material error of law. I indicated  that  I  would
    proceed with the rehearing. The argument that  I  had  given  inadequate
    reasons for finding a material error of law was a mere disagreement with
    my decision. There were unfortunately certain errors in the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal particularly the comment that the Project Fa�ade
    investigation related to a period after  the  Appellant  had  taken  his
    test. It did not, the Project Fa�ade investigation  covered  the  period
    when the Appellant was said to have taken the test at Eden college. This
    error had infected the Judge's assessment of  the  Appellant's  innocent
    explanation. The arrangements made  for  the  test  and  what  the  test
    consisted  of  had  not  been  adequately  assessed  in  the  First-tier
    decision.

23. In relation to the decision to keep the case in the Upper  Tribunal  and
    not remit it, the matter was adequately covered by the decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal lawyer. There was nothing exceptional in this  case  that
    meant that the normal rule should not be followed, the normal rule being
    that following the finding of an  error  of  law,  the  case  should  be
    retained in the Upper Tribunal. The directions that were sent out to the
    parties prior to the error of law hearing before me specifically  stated
    at paragraph 4 "there is a presumption that in the event of the Tribunal
    deciding that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is to be set aside
    as erroneous in law, the remaking of the decision will take place at the
    same hearing."

24. In this case in order to be fair to both parties I gave  directions  for
    further evidence, the voice recordings, to be obtained. These could  not
    have been provided at the hearing before me in any event and even  if  I
    had made my error of law decision at the conclusion of that hearing,  it
    would have required a further hearing. The standard directions sent  out
    by the Principal Resident Judge also reminded  both  parties  that  they
    should, at least five working  days  prior  to  the  scheduled  hearing,
    contact the Tribunal for the purpose of confirming that all bundles  and
    any other materials were available for distribution to the  Judge.  That
    had clearly  not  been  done  in  this  case  (the  written  submissions
    requesting an adjournment being sent the day before the hearing).  There
    was no good reason why the standard directions had  not  been  followed,
    this was a matter of some importance, despite counsel's submissions that
    the delay was not important. To adjourn the case very much at  the  last
    moment would not have furthered the overriding objective as  substantial
    public  resources  would  have  been  wasted.  Neither  party  had  made
    representations to me at the close of the error of law  hearing  when  I
    indicated that if I found an error of law I would make direction for the
    rehearing. Several weeks had elapsed  since  my  previous  decision  and
    nothing further had been said.

25. After the indication that  I  was  proceeding  with  the  case,  counsel
    invited me to adjourn the  hearing  for  the  Appellant  to  review  the
    position regarding the Eden College voice recordings which were not  the
    Appellant's  voice.  These  had  been  obtained   by   the   Appellant's
    representatives not the Respondent.  The  Presenting  Officer  explained
    that it was not possible for the Respondent to obtain  voice  recordings
    from ETS because of data protection requirements. I indicated that since
    it was not in dispute that one set of voice recordings, the  test  taken
    by the Appellant at South Quay College, was of  the  Appellant  and  the
    other voice recordings were not, there was no  point  in  instructing  a
    joint expert to listen to the voice recordings since the result of  such
    investigation was already known.

26. The test of whether to adjourn is one of  fairness  but  in  this  case,
    fairness did not require an adjournment since no useful purpose would be
    served by an adjournment. Both the Appellant and the Respondent had  the
    South Quay voice recordings and  the  Appellant  had  the  Eden  College
    recordings and was aware that they were not his  voice.  The  issue  was
    still as summarised by Judge  Latter,  whether  there  was  prima  facie
    evidence that the Appellant had employed a proxy test taker, whether  he
    had an innocent explanation and whether in  all  the  circumstances  the
    Respondent had proved fraud. The case thereafter proceeded.

The Hearing before Me

27. I first heard the  evidence  of  the  Appellant  who  adopted  both  his
    witness statements in this case. He said that he had chosen to take  the
    second test at Eden college because  he  needed  to  obtain  a  language
    certificate quickly and Eden College had dates  available.  It  was  the
    only date received. He said his visa expired in November 2012 and he had
    to pass an English language test by then. His friend Mr Joshi  had  made
    the booking. When the Appellant arrived there for the  test,  he  saw  a
    small room with computers around  the  wall  and  there  were  about  10
    candidates. He could not now recall the pictures he was  shown  that  he
    had to describe because it was so long ago. He had taken a further  test
    two years later in 2014. The arrangements had again  been  made  by  his
    friend Mr Joshi. The result of that test was enclosed in his  bundle  of
    evidence and was dated 15 May 2014. It showed  that  the  Appellant  was
    awarded 6.0 in each of the categories.

28. In cross examination it was put to the Appellant that  he  had  taken  a
    test in August 2012 at South Quay College scoring 150  for  speaking  in
    130 for writing. By contrast by the time he came to  take  the  test  at
    Eden college his score had improved to 200  for  speaking  and  180  for
    writing. This improvement was in the course of 15 days and he was  asked
    how it could be that his scores would have improved so much  in  such  a
    short space of time unless he had in fact used a proxy  for  the  second
    test. The Appellant replied that there were different ways of taking the
    test but the reason why he had improved so much  in  two  weeks  was  by
    practising.

29. The 150 score he received at South Quay  College  was  equivalent  to  a
    band 6 but when he took the test at Eden college his score had increased
    to band 8. When he took the test in 2014 his score had  gone  back  down
    again to band 6. The Appellant repeated that he  had  practised  between
    the South Quay College test and the Eden college test.  The  results  of
    the Project Fa�ade report into Eden college were put to the Appellant by
    the Presenting Officer that there were almost 2000 tests that  were  not
    genuine. The Appellant replied that that only came out when the BBC  had
    exposed the scandal, before that no one knew about what was happening at
    Eden college.

30. He had let Mr Joshi book the test because it  was  more  convenient.  He
    paid Mr Joshi �150 in cash but did not ask for a receipt. Nor did he ask
    Mr Joshi for any documentation that he might need to take  to  the  test
    with him although he remembered taking his passport. He assumed that the
    second test at Eden college had been booked online by Mr Joshi  as  that
    was the only way one could book the test. He did not know how  in  those
    circumstances Mr Joshi would have paid for the test.
31. He proposed to call a witness at  the  hearing,  Mr  Bhuie,  who  was  a
    family friend he had known since childhood. Mr Bhuie had gone  with  the
    Appellant to the test centre at Eden college. The Appellant  had  driven
    to the test centre and coming back Mr Bhuie had driven. They went by car
    because Mr Bhuie was off work that day and to use public transport  they
    would have had to have gone via Ealing Broadway. He confirmed  that  the
    second set of recordings in relation to Eden college was not his  voice.
    The voice recordings of the test at South Quay were his voice.

32. In answer to questions from me the Appellant clarified that in  November
    2012 it was not that his visa was due to expire as it had been curtailed
    by the Respondent who had given him 60 days to find another college.  Mr
    Joshi had left the United Kingdom in 2016. Mr Bhuie had been present  at
    the hearing at first instance before Judge Adio who  was  told  that  Mr
    Bhuie was the Appellant's cousin when he was in fact  a  family  friend.
    The Appellant said he had told the Judge that  Mr  Bhuie  was  a  family
    friend. In re-examination the Appellant said that after the test at Eden
    college they had taken a photograph of him which was in the bundle.

33. I next heard evidence from the witness Mr Bhuie who  said  that  at  the
    time of the Eden college test he and the Appellant were  living  at  the
    same address. He drove the car back home  from  the  test.  His  witness
    statement was wrong at paragraph 11 where it  said  that  the  Appellant
    decided to drive the car back home. He attended the hearing in front  of
    Judge Adio although his name had been misspelt in the determination.  He
    was not the Appellant's cousin he looked on the Appellant as more like a
    younger brother. Judge Adio was told that Mr Bhuie was  the  Appellant's
    cousin because of the way he treated the Appellant.

34. Mr Bhuie had made his statement in support of the Appellant a week  ago.
    He had never met Mr Joshi. They had travelled over to the other side  of
    London for the test because the Appellant's visa was  expiring.  He  had
    not heard of Eden college before then. In  re-examination  he  confirmed
    that it was Judge Adio who had  asked  if  there  was  anyone  with  the
    Appellant when he went to take the test.

35. That concluded the oral testimony, but counsel indicated that he  wished
    to play to the Tribunal the audio recording of the South Quay test which
    the Appellant acknowledged he had taken. This  was  played  through  the
    Presenting Officers laptop. After hearing those  recordings,  I  queried
    whether there was any point in hearing the Eden college voice recordings
    (contained on the Appellant's mobile telephone) which it was agreed were
    not of the Appellant. At that stage counsel agreed with that  but  later
    on changed his position and indicated to me that he did wish me to  hear
    the Eden college voice recordings. Subsequently these were forwarded  to
    me and I confirm that I heard them. I agree  that  the  voice  on  those
    recordings is not the same as the Appellant's.
Closing submissions

36. In closing for the Respondent reliance was placed on the refusal  letter
    but matters had moved on since then. The Appellant was not  credible  in
    his evidence. He had employed a proxy. It was  not  plausible  that  the
    Appellant could have had such a dramatic  improvement  in  his  language
    skills between the South Quay College test on 21  August  and  the  Eden
    college test 15 days later on 5 September 2012. That represented a  jump
    of 2 levels.

37. The Appellant was now seeking to argue that  his  English  had  in  fact
    been good enough for him to pass the test at South Quay College  and  he
    should not have been failed on that day. ETS had responded  to  that  in
    correspondence passing between ETS and the Appellant's  solicitors.  ETS
    had said that the listening and reading test taken by the  Appellant  at
    South Quay College was not the kind of test that a test taker could pass
    or fail. The proficiency that the Appellant had obtained in relation  to
    that particular test was set out in the relevant report  that  had  been
    provided.

38. What was important was that the TOEIC result in  2014  showed  that  the
    Appellant was a competent user of the English language which  the  South
    Quay College test two years earlier  had  showed.  The  two  tests  were
    comparable in the way they were assessed. In any event  the  Appellant's
    English language even at  the  hearing  today  still  betrayed  a  thick
    accent, there had for example been difficulties over the Appellant's use
    of the word availability in oral evidence.

39. If one looked at the  Project  Fa�ade  document  the  report  into  Eden
    college showed that the period March 2012 to February 2014 had  examples
    of widespread fraud and that was the time when the  Appellant  took  his
    test. None of the tests taken during that period has  been  assessed  as
    genuine and the same could be said of the Appellant's. Cheating had been
    widespread at Eden college during that period.  No  supporting  evidence
    had been given in relation to Mr Joshi who had apparently gone to  India
    in 2016. There had been no attempt to contact  him  or  take  a  witness
    statement from him and there was nothing to confirm that he had made the
    booking arrangements. It was not  plausible  that  the  Appellant  would
    accept confirmation of his test on the say-so of a friend.

40. Although the test was booked online the Appellant had paid  in  cash  to
    his friend not at the test centre. Cash could often be  said  to  be  an
    indication of underhand and fraudulent transactions  to  avoid  a  paper
    trail in a case such as this. No adequate reason has been given why  the
    test had not been paid for online. What was more  likely  than  not  was
    that having failed to get sufficient marks at  South  Quay  College  the
    Appellant had sought to obtain a perfect score at Eden college  2  weeks
    later. Mr Bhuie had only made his witness statement recently. There  was
    some doubt as to his true relationship to the Appellant whether he was a
    friend or a cousin. That the Appellant was able to describe the  college
    did not mean that he had been there to take  the  test.  The  photograph
    simply placed the Appellant at the test centre at most. One had to  look
    at credibility in the round when deciding whether the Appellant had used
    a proxy.

41. The Appellant accepted that the voice recording from  Eden  college  was
    not his voice. The reason was because it was the voice of his proxy. The
    Appellant's case now was that in supplying this voice recording ETS must
    have muddled the Appellant's case up with someone else. It  was  correct
    that in the  case  of  MA  the  President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  had
    highlighted what the experts said about being able to link an  applicant
    with a voice file. There was a no inherent data in the voice  file  that
    could link  it  to  the  Appellant.  Nonetheless  the  veracity  of  the
    recording was not ruled out. On the balance  of  probabilities  ETS  had
    provided the Appellant's voice recording. When it suited  the  Appellant
    that the voice on a recording was his he accepted that and said that the
    voice recording from South Quay College was genuine.  However,  when  it
    did not suit him he said that ETS must have muddled up  his  voice  with
    someone else's.

42.  In closing for the Appellant it was argued that the  evidential  burden
    was that the Respondent should put forward sufficient  evidence  to  the
    appropriate standard of proof  that  could  persuade  the  Tribunal.  At
    paragraph 57 of MA the Upper Tribunal had  made  it  clear  it  was  not
    necessary to prove motive, that is why an Appellant would want to  cheat
    and the Upper Tribunal did not decide that an absence  of  a  reason  to
    cheat would tell in favour of the Appellant.

43. At paragraph 15 the Upper Tribunal  had  considered  the  issue  of  the
    continuity of the evidence and the  position  had  been  authoritatively
    stated there. There was no evidence in this case of  continuity  and  no
    evidence to link the Appellant to the allegation of a proxy test  taker.
    There was a gap in the evidence of how the frauds were perpetrated. Test
    centres were entirely responsible for the transmission of data and  they
    were very vulnerable to fraud.

44. In response to the submissions made by the Presenting  Officer,  counsel
    argued that the reason why there was such a dramatic improvement in  the
    2 test scores between South Quay College and Eden college was because it
    was not the Appellant's voice in the Eden  college  tests  and  not  the
    Appellant's test. The scores were infected by this error. At this  point
    counsel indicated that he did wish me to listen to the recordings of the
    Eden college test. I pointed out that I was not in a position to  decide
    what the correct mark should have been either for the South Quay College
    test which I had listened to during the course of  the  hearing  or  the
    Eden college test which was going to be sent on to  me.  Counsel  agreed
    that the matter could be dealt with on the basis that I would listen  to
    the Eden college test at a later date although he accepted that this was
    not the strongest point he could make.

45. The Appellant had given his evidence why he had paid Mr Joshi  in  cash.
    The Respondent's submission about payments in cash being a sign of fraud
    came from a decided case. Mr Bhuie was credible and consistent  and  the
    challenge to the timing of his statement was not a good  point.  He  had
    explained that he only realised his evidence was significant when  Judge
    Adio had asked whether anyone had  accompanied  the  Appellant.  In  any
    event a witness statement should only be  prepared  shortly  before  the
    hearing. There was no need to have prepared the witness statement before
    that it was only after the decision on the error of law was made.

46. The evidential burden had to be discharged by the Respondent. There  was
    no evidence in this case linking the voice recording to  the  Appellant.
    There was no  evidence  supporting  evidence  of  fraud.  The  Appellant
    explained why he had chosen TOEIC, it was because he was under  pressure
    after the South Quay test. It was not  a  proper  basis  to  reject  the
    Appellant's account on how Mr Joshi had made arrangements for the  test.
    The Appellant had provided a lot of detail about the test centre and had
    been consistent about who drove  the  car  to  and  from  the  test.  He
    described the number of invigilators and the type of questions.  It  was
    his photograph taken  after  the  test.  He  had  provided  an  identity
    document to prove who he was. The test centres  made  mistakes  but  the
    fact that the photograph was taken after the test showed that it was the
    Appellant. The Appellant's photograph indicated there was some mix-up in
    the data.

47. Both the Appellant and his witness were credible and were trying  to  do
    the best they could. The Appellant had obtained a certificate before  he
    came to the United Kingdom and had obtained academic qualifications  for
    his studies here. The Appellant's voice recordings at South Quay were of
    an English speaker who had read out a test perfectly. That  was  plainly
    indicative of a high level of English and it raised the question why  he
    had only got a score of 150 from South Quay. Something  had  gone  wrong
    with the marking. The  Appellant  had  taken  all  reasonable  steps  to
    respond to the Home Office allegations. He had gone out of his way to do
    the Respondent's job for him. He acknowledged when it was not his  voice
    because he was  an  honest  witness.  This  was  an  Appellant  of  good
    character who had done nothing wrong. He should have been given a second
    60-day period to find another college. It was not being suggested he was
    not a genuine student. The appeal should be allowed.

The Authority of MA

48. In this case the Upper Tribunal held that  the  question  of  whether  a
    person engaged in fraud in procuring a TOEIC  proficiency  qualification
    would invariably be intrinsically fact sensitive. The Tribunal  received
    evidence from three expert witnesses and  at  paragraph  15  highlighted
    certain matters arising from this evidence. The experts  said  they  did
    not know the processes by which the candidate's name was linked to  each
    test. If file responses were stored on a server  this  would  create  an
    opportunity for alteration by test centre staff but two of  the  experts
    thought this was unlikely. An opportunity for a mistake might  arise  if
    the registration on the ETS system was carried out by test centre  staff
    and not by the candidates themselves  creating  the  risk  of  the  data
    provided by the test centre to ETS mismatching the candidate  and  their
    tests. The naming  conventions  for  the  digital  files  of  the  voice
    recordings produced  did  not  provide  an  explicit  link  between  the
    candidate  and  the  recording.  The  system  assumed  that  the  unique
    registration code was reliably linked to the real candidate.  There  was
    no embedded meta data which might assist the enquiries.

49. At paragraph 44 the Tribunal noted that on a  general  level  there  was
    evidence of corruption at the test centre and at the specific level  the
    Tribunal had the certificates and  documentary  records  linked  to  the
    Appellant. In that case the Appellant had failed  to  provide  even  the
    most basic description of the car  journey  which  he  claimed  to  have
    undertaken to the college. At paragraph 51 the Tribunal stated that  the
    questions and doubts expressed by the experts focussed more on  the  ETS
    and test  centre  methodologies  rather  than  the  ETS  mechanisms  and
    processes for the analysis of the  computerised  files  holding  suspect
    speaking tests. The Tribunal later went on to consider  aspects  of  the
    Appellant's  evidence  as  to  whether  he  could  offer   an   innocent
    explanation for what had happened.

Findings

50. The allegation made against the  Appellant  in  this  case  is  that  he
    employed a proxy test taker on 5 September 2012  at  Eden  college.  The
    burden of proof of establishing this rests upon the Respondent and while
    the standard is the normal civil standard of balance  of  probabilities,
    because this is an allegation of fraud the more serious  the  allegation
    the more cogent the evidence must be to prove it.

51. The authorities establish that there is a 3-stage test.  First  of  all,
    the Respondent must discharge the evidential burden of showing that  the
    Appellant has a case to answer. Secondly the Appellant  must  show  that
    there is an innocent explanation for  what  has  happened.  Thirdly  the
    Respondent must then discharge the legal  burden  of  proving  that  the
    Appellant's innocent explanation cannot be relied upon and that there is
    cogent evidence to show that the Appellant has indeed employed  a  proxy
    test taker.

52. The Respondent's evidence to discharge the evidential burden was in  two
    main parts. The first was that the location and time of the  Appellant's
    test meant that it was a case which fell within  the  ambit  of  Project
    Fa�ade. I pause to note here  that  the  error  of  Judge  Adio  in  not
    recognising that the Appellant's case fell within the ambit  of  Project
    Fa�ade meant that he made a material error of law in his  assessment  of
    whether  the  Respondent  had  discharged  the  evidential  burden.  The
    Appellant's  test  taken  at  Eden  college  fell  within   the   period
    investigated by Project fa�ade which reported  that  77%  of  the  tests
    taken during the period in question were invalid  or  questionable,  the
    invalid outnumbering the questionable by more than three to one.

53. The second limb of the Respondent's argument was that the look  up  tool
    in this case produced by ETS showed that the Appellant's tests at  South
    Quay College were questionable but the test at Eden college was invalid.
    The issue of look up tools and their use was discussed at some length in
    MA. For the reasons given in that case I accept that the existence of an
    invalid test coupled with the Project Fa�ade  evidence  meant  that  the
    Respondent had discharge the initial  evidential  burden  and  thus  the
    Appellant was required to provide an innocent explanation.

54.  The  Appellant's  argument  breaks  down  into  the  following  points.
    Firstly, he says that the South Quay test which was  taken  by  him  was
    wrongly marked by ETS who only gave him a score of 154 speaking and  134
    writing. He says his English was much better  than  that  and  therefore
    there should have been no need for him to have taken a second test. This
    point appears to have been raised after the Appellant obtained the voice
    recordings from South Quay College. The  difficulty  for  the  Appellant
    with this argument is that the Appellant has been unable  to  show  that
    ETS diverged from the normal marking scheme in his particular  case.  In
    paragraph 51 of MA the Upper Tribunal noted that  the  experts  focussed
    more on test centre methodology than the mechanisms and processes for an
    analysis of the voice recordings. That the  Appellant  might  have  been
    disappointed  with  his  mark  does  not  mean  that  ETS  assessed  him
    incorrectly.

55. Secondly, the Appellant says that he is now able to give  a  description
    of the centre and details of his journey to and from the centre. He also
    says that there is a photograph of him taken after he took the  test  at
    Eden college. The Appellant gave very little indication to Judge Adio of
    the layout of the  test  centre.  The  Appellant's  description  of  the
    journey and what happened at the test centre  was  summarised  by  Judge
    Adio at [7] and [8] of the Judge's determination. The Appellant did  not
    say who drove to and from the test centre and this was a point on  which
    the Appellant and his witness disagreed in  their  statements.  In  oral
    testimony to me Mr Bhuie corrected his statement thus bringing  it  into
    line with the Appellant's statement.

56. The further evidence given by the Appellant  about  the  layout  of  the
    test centre (apparently not given to Judge Adio) sought to contrast  the
    layout of South Quay College with the layout of  Eden  college.  As  the
    Respondent  observed  in  closing  submissions  that  evidence  and  the
    evidence of the photograph  potentially  place  the  Appellant  at  Eden
    college but still had to be looked at in the round with  all  the  other
    evidence to decide whether the Appellant had in fact  taken  a  test  on
    that day as opposed to merely been at the centre.

57. I remind myself that the assessment  of  these  cases  is  intrinsically
    fact sensitive and I have to look at all the evidence in the round.  The
    Respondent's argument that the Appellant's innocent  explanation  cannot
    be accepted  is  to  point  to  the  extraordinary  improvement  in  the
    Appellant's scores between the South Quay test and the Eden college test
    taken 15 days later. The Appellant argues  that  that  this  discrepancy
    strengthens his case rather than undermines it because the Eden  college
    recordings are now shown not to be him. The Appellant argues through his
    counsel that there must have been a mistake somewhere by  ETS  who  have
    analysed somebody else's file voice recording and that is why  the  mark
    is so different two weeks later.

58. The problem with this argument is that that is not  what  the  Appellant
    himself said to me when he was being cross-examined. What he told me was
    that the reason for the dramatic improvement between the  two  tests  in
    the course of two weeks was because he had practised. If the tests  have
    been muddled up and what has been described as his test was not in  fact
    his test at all then the issue of whether he had or  had  not  practised
    intensely enough to raise himself by two levels would not arise.  It  is
    not plausible that an individual would improve so dramatically in such a
    short period of time and I have seen no evidence  to  indicate  that  it
    would be possible. If the Appellant seeks to argue that  his  mark  from
    South Quay should have been higher and therefore there  is  not  such  a
    jump from that to the Eden college mark, that is still not the  same  as
    saying that the Eden college mark should be disregarded because  it  has
    been muddled up by ETS who have sent somebody else's mark.

59. The Appellant in short is attempting to argue two  contradictory  points
    at the same time. The principal argument made by the Appellant  is  that
    the Eden college mark cannot be linked to the Appellant because of  poor
    record-keeping by ETS as outlined  in  the  case  of  MA  which  I  have
    summarised above. However, this is a  different  situation  to  the  one
    which the Upper Tribunal faced in MA for one important reason. ETS  have
    provided the Appellant with two sets of voice recordings. The first  set
    is indeed of the Appellant, he accepts it, I heard it  played  in  court
    and  whilst  I  do  not  put  myself  forward  as  an  expert  in  voice
    recognition, I have seen  nothing  to  indicate  that  it  was  not  the
    Appellant's voice for the South Quay  tests.  It  is  however  straining
    credulity to find that ETS  have  successfully  linked  the  Appellant's
    South Quay test with the Appellant but  the  Eden  test  (which  is  not
    conducive to the Appellant's case) has  somehow  been  muddled  up  with
    someone else's test. That is simply a coincidence too far.

60. The Upper  Tribunal  in  MA  were  not  laying  down  a  rule  that  the
    Respondent could never prove fraud in an English language  testing  case
    because of problems with the continuity issue and the linking  of  voice
    recordings  to  individual  Appellants.  They  were  pointing  out   the
    reservations expressed by experts in  the  evidence  to  them.  In  this
    particular case there is powerful evidence to suggest that it was indeed
    the Appellant's test at Eden college which was taken  by  someone  other
    than the Appellant and whose voice is on the voice  recordings  produced
    by ETS.

61. The Appellant argues that he has done the Respondent's job  for  him  by
    locating these voice recordings. It is correct that I indicated  at  the
    end of my determination on the error of law issue  that  the  Respondent
    should make efforts to obtain the voice recordings. It was explained  at
    the hearing before me  that  there  were  severe  difficulties  for  the
    Respondent to do this and in those  circumstances,  it  was  appropriate
    that the Appellant should obtain the recordings since he was the one who
    could authorise the disclosure of data relating to him.

62. My understanding of the timeline is  that  the  voice  recordings  which
    showed that it was not the Appellant's voice for the Eden  college  test
    arrived late in the day but before  the  application  was  made  to  the
    Tribunal to adjourn the hearing and/or set aside my decision. There  was
    no good reason for the very late application for  an  adjournment  which
    was made after the Appellant was  aware  that  the  Eden  college  voice
    recordings were not his. There were  other  evidential  difficulties  in
    this case including the involvement of  Mr  Joshi  which  has  not  been
    satisfactorily explained by the Appellant. Mr  Bhuie  appeared  to  know
    very little indeed about Mr Joshi. Since it was Mr Joshi's  arrangements
    that led to the Appellant taking two tests and being driving to and from
    the Eden college test it is extremely surprising that the  witness  knew
    as little as he did about the man who  apparently  instigated  the  test
    arrangements.

63. The Appellant's evidence of the test arrangements was noticeably  vague.
    The Appellant paid Mr Joshi a  sum  in  cash  and  no  paper  trail  was
    produced to show the booking made for the Eden college test. Mr Joshi  I
    am told left the United Kingdom in 2016. I note  that  the  decision  of
    Judge Aziz was 30 November 2016 and the refusal letter was the  previous
    year. The Appellant and his advisers would have had ample opportunity to
    take  a  statement  in  confirmation  from  Mr  Joshi  of  the   unusual
    arrangements made for the tests. That was not done and in  my  view  the
    Respondent was quite right in closing submissions to point to that.

64. I have to look at all the evidence  in  the  round  when  assessing  the
    credibility of the evidence given by the parties  in  this  case.  I  am
    satisfied that the Respondent has discharged the  evidential  and  legal
    burden upon him of establishing that the Appellant's test taken at  Eden
    college was taken by a  proxy  test  taker  and  not  by  the  Appellant
    himself. That explains why the mark increased significantly in the short
    space of 2 weeks. The proxy test taker was evidently too  good  and  was
    out of line with the Appellant's  English  language  skills  which  have
    remained remarkably consistent otherwise between the South Quay test  in
    2012 and the TOEIC test  in  2014.  I  do  not  accept  the  Appellant's
    argument that there is insufficient evidence of continuity to  link  the
    Appellant with the Eden college test. I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of India born 12 December 1984.  He  appealed
    against a decision of the Respondent dated 8 July  2015  to  refuse  him
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom  and  to  remove  him  by  way  of
    directions under section 47 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2006.  His
    appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 9 April 2018. The Respondent appeals with leave  against
    that decision.


 2. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2006 and studied an  English
    course for one year in 2008. At [3] to  [5]  of  his  determination  the
    Judge set out the reasons why the Respondent had refused the Appellant's
    application for further leave. The Appellant applied to  vary  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant.
    Prior to submitting that application,  the  Appellant  had  applied  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 student and a Tier 1 entrepreneur. For these
    applications the  Appellant  had  submitted  a  TOEIC  certificate  from
    Education Testing Services (ETS).

 3. The Respondent was  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  had  obtained  that
    certificate  fraudulently.  There  was  significant  evidence  that  the
    certificate was obtained by the use  of  a  proxy  test  taker  and  the
    Appellant's test was invalid. The scores were cancelled by ETS  and  the
    Respondent refused the application on the general grounds  contained  in
    paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules. The Appellant's  sponsor  had
    withdrawn the Confirmation of  Acceptance  for  Studies  (CAS)  and  the
    Appellant did not therefore obtain any points under appendix  A  of  the
    Rules.

The Decision at First Instance

 4. The Appellant told the Judge that a friend, Kushan Joshi, had booked the
    test for the Appellant as well as for himself.  The  Appellant  did  not
    have the proof of booking. Kushan Joshi had since gone back to India and
    the Appellant was not in much contact with him. There was  no  statement
    from Mr Joshi who had taken the  Appellant  to  the  test  centre  on  5
    September 2012 by car.  The  Appellant  described  the  outside  of  the
    building and stated he had had his speaking test on a computer for which
    he had to use a microphone. He  could  not  recall  all  the  questions.
    Around 15 days later after the test at South Quay  College  he  got  his
    result. He was later sent a letter saying the test was not valid, but he
    could attend another test which he booked at Eden college. The Appellant
    did not know why his friend Mr Joshi had chosen the Eden college for the
    second test. The Appellant did not do any research himself to look for a
    college. The Appellant described the speaking and writing test  he  took
    at Eden college.

 5. The Judge noted at [18] of the determination that the issue  he  had  to
    decide was whether the  Appellant  was  one  of  the  students  who  had
    employed a proxy test taker. The one aspect of the Appellant's  evidence
    which was slightly worrying was that he had asked Mr Joshi to  book  the
    test but did not get  the  confirmation  back  from  his  test.  It  was
    reasonable to expect the Appellant to have the  paperwork  sent  to  him
    before he went to the test centre. On the other hand,  the  Judge  noted
    the Appellant would have needed some form of identity  before  he  could
    take the test.

 6. The Appellant had  taken  his  test  before  a  period  covered  by  the
    Respondent's investigation "Project Fa�ade" which in  the  Judge's  view
    raised doubts about the evidence against the Appellant.  Project  Fa�ade
    was a criminal enquiry into abuse of the  English  language  certificate
    test at South Quay College and Eden college. The Appellant's command  of
    English  was  now  very  good.   The   Judge   noted   the   Appellant's
    qualifications and was willing to give the Appellant the benefit of  the
    doubt. The lack of documents sent to the Appellant did  not  necessarily
    mean  that  the  Appellant  had  not  presented  himself  to  take   the
    examinations.

 7. The burden of proof had not  been  discharged  by  the  Respondent  with
    regard to the allegation of  deception.  The  ETS  certificate  was  not
    obtained by fraud. There was no  voice  evidence  to  compare  with  the
    Appellant's voice. The Judge allowed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

 8.  The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that   the
    evidential  burden  fell  upon  the  Appellant  to  offer  an   innocent
    explanation which had not been adequately addressed by the Judge. It was
    not clear why the evidence from the Appellant would preclude the use  of
    a proxy test taker during the test. The Appellant  had  not  offered  an
    explanation why his  test  was  deemed  invalid  he  simply  denied  the
    allegation. This was insufficient to displace the accepted  evidence  of
    the Respondent. The Tribunal  had  relied  on  the  Appellant's  English
    language ability and other qualifications. The test was not whether  the
    Appellant spoke English but whether on the balance of probabilities  the
    Appellant had employed deception. A person who was able to speak English
    could nonetheless use a proxy candidate.


 9. The application for permission to appeal came on the papers before Judge
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pickup  on  17  July  2018.  In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote that it was arguable that  the  Judge  had
    failed to provide adequate  reasons  why  the  Appellant's  account  was
    sufficient to discharge the  evidential  burden  to  offer  an  innocent
    explanation. The Judge unduly relied on the Appellant's English language
    ability and qualifications rather than assessing whether he had employed
    deception. The Judge failed to appreciate that an account  of  attending
    the test centre was not inconsistent with having employed a  proxy  test
    taker.

10. The Appellant responded to the grant of  permission  to  appeal  arguing
    that Judge Adio's determination was well  reasoned.  The  Appellant  was
    simply required to provide an innocent explanation which  satisfied  the
    minimum level of plausibility.  The  Judge  had  noted  the  Appellant's
    demeanour as a witness and considered the Appellant's  explanation.  The
    Judge considered whether there existed any direct evidence involving the
    Appellant and employing deception. The Appellant's account  sufficiently
    discharged the evidential burden of offering an innocent explanation.

The Hearing Before Me

11. As a result of the grant of permission to appeal the matter came  before
    me to determine in the first place whether there was a material error of
    law such that the determination fell to be set aside. If there  was  not
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal would stand.

12. In oral submissions the Presenting Officer relied on the Upper  Tribunal
    decision of MA [2016] UKUT 450. The First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed
    to give adequate reasons. Once the Respondent had  established  a  prima
    facie case of deception the burden shifted onto the Appellant to give an
    innocent explanation. It was not  in  dispute  in  this  case  that  the
    Respondent had established a prima facie case. The error of law arose in
    the Judge's consideration of  the  Appellant's  explanation.  The  Judge
    relied on the  Appellant's  present  command  of  English  and  previous
    qualifications. At no point did the Judge consider the evidence  of  how
    the Appellant travelled to the test centres or the evidence of the  test
    itself. This approach was contrary to the approach of the Upper Tribunal
    in  MA  where  the  Upper  Tribunal  had  considered   the   Appellant's
    explanation how that Appellant had journeyed to the test centre and  the
    knowledge of the test itself as well as how the Appellant had  performed
    in giving evidence to the Upper Tribunal.

13. In response the Appellant's solicitor relied on his  rule  24  response.
    The Judge had taken evidence from the Appellant about how the  Appellant
    had booked the test centre and details of the building  where  the  test
    took place. The Judge's observations at [20],  that  the  Appellant  was
    able to understand  questions  very  well  and  engage  with  the  cross
    examination distinguished the instant case from the facts of MA. In that
    case the Appellant had been unable  to  raise  an  innocent  explanation
    because he had been completely unaware of the  test  centre  whereas  in
    this case the Appellant had  provided  full  details.  The  question  of
    whether there was fraud would invariably be fact sensitive. The Tribunal
    could consider whether it would be illogical for the Appellant  to  have
    cheated. The Respondent had argued in his grounds of onward appeal  that
    the Appellant's denial of the allegation and description of the  process
    was insufficient. That was not the test which the Appellant had to meet.
    The Appellant had to provide the  minimum  level  of  plausibility.  The
    Appellant had given more than  sufficient  explanation.  The  burden  of
    proof moved back onto the Respondent. This was not an article 8 appeal.


14. In conclusion the Presenting Officer noted that at the hearing at  first
    instance the Respondent had raised issues relating to the credibility of
    the Appellant's explanation. The Appellant failed to give evidence about
    the booking of the test and there was no explanation or  statement  from
    his friend Mr Joshi. The most important point was the lack of  knowledge
    of the contents  of  the  test  which  was  a  clear  challenge  to  the
    explanation offered by the Appellant. In reply the Appellant's solicitor
    noted that the Judge had considered the Respondent's submissions at [18]
    on whether the Appellant should have the paperwork for the test but went
    on to perform a balancing exercise considering  the  evidence  from  the
    Appellant.

Findings

15. The issue in this case was a  straightforward  one.  Had  the  Appellant
    discharged the burden upon him of showing that  there  was  an  innocent
    explanation for the complaint that he had used a proxy test  taker  when
    he obtained his English language test certificate in September 2012? The
    Judge heard the  Appellant  give  evidence  and  noted  the  Appellant's
    present command of English together with  previous  qualifications.  The
    Respondent complains that the  Judge  did  not  sufficiently  take  into
    account the Appellant's inability to explain how  he  got  to  the  test
    centre or what actually happened when he took the test. The case  of  MA
    relied upon by the Respondent was something of  an  extreme  case  given
    that the Appellant knew very  little  about  the  solicitors  who  would
    arrange the test for  him  and  was  inconsistent  about  where  he  had
    actually taken the test. He was vague about photographs taken after  the
    test  and  there  were  significant  gaps  in  the  Appellant's  witness
    statements which were detailed in the Upper Tribunal  Judgement.  It  is
    also worth noting that at paragraph 54 of  their  determination  the  up
    Tribunal referred to hearing  and  observing  the  Appellant  studiously
    during some 2 � hours.


16.  They  found  the  Appellant  surprisingly  hesitant.  They  would  have
    expected greater spontaneity in his evidence. The  Appellant  had  dealt
    with a repeated question in a wholly unsatisfactory way and they came to
    a radically different view of the Appellant's credibility  to  the  view
    formed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge. The  Appellant  had  manifestly
    failed to raise an innocent explanation of any element of  the  case  of
    deception established against him.

17. The relevance of MA for this appeal lies in the  illustration  it  gives
    of the sort of issues that need to be considered by  the  Tribunal  when
    assessing an Appellant's innocent  explanation.  Undoubtedly  the  Upper
    Tribunal in MA considered  the  issues  in  great  detail.  It  was  not
    necessary for the Judge in the instant case to set out  each  and  every
    piece of evidence upon which he relied in coming to his conclusions.  He
    was clearly influenced by three factors. The first was  the  Appellant's
    ability to  speak  English  in  the  court  room.  The  second  was  the
    Appellant's previous academic record and the third was that the  Project
    Fa�ade investigation into the two colleges where the Appellant had taken
    English language tests related to a period after the Appellant had taken
    his test. This  last  point  was  somewhat  undermined  by  the  Judge's
    reference at [17] that the complaint about invalid tests at Eden College
    did cover the period when the Appellant was said to have taken his test.



18. At [18] the Judge indicated that he considered the submissions  made  by
    the Presenting Officer and referred to one  aspect  of  the  Appellant's
    evidence as being "slightly worrying". This related to the  arrangements
    the Appellant made with Mr Joshi about  booking  the  test.  It  is  not
    entirely clear from the determination whether the Judge was referring to
    a submission by the Presenting Officer that this was  slightly  worrying
    or whether the Judge himself found it slightly worrying. What I find  of
    concern is that the Judge did not appear to  engage  with  the  evidence
    relating to the arrangements that were made for the test  and  what  the
    test actually consisted of. These are the crucial pieces of evidence for
    an Appellant to explain when putting forward his  innocent  explanation.
    The fact that the Appellant can now speak English  very  well  does  not
    indicate what his level of English would have  been  in  September  2012
    when a proxy test taker, it is alleged, was employed.

19. In giving reasons for a decision a Tribunal has to be able  to  show  to
    the losing party why they have lost. I can understand  the  Respondent's
    concern in this case that they do not fully appreciate  the  reason  why
    the Judge has decided as he has. Some explanation needed to be given  by
    the Appellant of what the arrangements were on the day of the test.  The
    Judge's reference  to  the  Appellant  describing  the  outside  of  the
    building did not take the matter significantly  further.  The  Appellant
    has given an explanation why he could  not  obtain  supporting  evidence
    from Mr  Joshi  but  that  does  not  absolve  the  Appellant  from  the
    requirement that he must explain what did happen both in  arranging  the
    test and in sitting it.

20. The Appellant's statement made for the First-tier hearing and  dated  15
    November 2016 was brief on details of the test.  Some  weight  could  be
    attached to an Appellant's ability to  speak  English  now  but  in  the
    context of this case the absence of other evidence leaves a gap. I  find
    that there is a material error of law in this determination  because  of
    the inadequacy of the reasoning for  the  Judge's  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant had not employed a proxy test taker.

21. In the case of Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009 it  was  said:  "The  evidence
    adduced by individual appellants in rebuttal will  obviously  vary  from
    case to case.  At a minimum they can be expected to give  evidence  that
    they did indeed attend the centre on  the  day  recorded  and  took  the
    spoken English test in person." I would expect for the rehearing of this
    appeal that  the  Appellant  will  provide  further  and  more  detailed
    evidence of the arrangements that were made  for  the  English  language
    test and what he recalls of the test itself. The burden of  proof  rests
    on  the  Appellant  to  provide  an  innocent  explanation.  It  is  not
    sufficient to say that the Appellant now speaks English well to indicate
    that he has provided a minimum level of plausibility as indicated in the
    case of SM [2016] UKUT 229 and see paragraph 57 of MA.

22. I bear in mind the detailed scrutiny given by the Upper Tribunal to  the
    Appellant's explanation in the case of MA as an indication of  the  type
    of issues which need to be considered before it can  be  said  that  the
    burden once again shifts  back  onto  the  Respondent.  It  is  for  the
    Appellant on advice to consider these  issues  and  address  them  in  a
    further statement which should be filed and  served  at  least  14  days
    before the rehearing of the appeal. The Respondent should use  his  best
    endeavours to obtain any original voice recordings of the test(s)  which
    the Appellant says he took. If  these  are  available,  they  should  be
    disclosed to the Appellant's solicitors at  least  21  days  before  the
    rehearing, to enable the Appellant to comment on them in  a statement if
    so advised.

23. This case has been remitted once before to the First-tier  Tribunal  and
    I do not propose that it should be remitted again. I set the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal aside and direct that the appeal will be reheard
    before me on a date to be arranged.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
    law and I have set it aside. I direct that the appeal be reheard  on  a
    date to be fixed before me with a time estimate two hours.

Respondent's appeal allowed to that limited extent.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
