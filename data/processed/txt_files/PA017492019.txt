                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I make an order prohibiting the disclosure  or  publication  of
       any matter likely to lead members of  the  public  to  identify  the
       Appellant. Breach of this order can be punished  as  a  contempt  of
       court. I make this order because the Appellant is an  asylum  seeker
       and so is entitled to privacy.

    2. This is an appeal against a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision  of   the
       Respondent refusing him international protection.

    3. Permission to appeal was given by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Finch  who
       identified a catalogue of arguable errors relating to fact finding.

    4. Directions were given with a view to determining the appeal  without
       a hearing.

    5. Both parties responded  to  those  errors.  In  a  letter  dated  18
       September 2020 for the Respondent signed by the  Specialist  Appeals
       Team the Respondent suggested that the  Upper  Tribunal  "remit  the
       appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for redetermination.

    6. The matter of main concern of  the  Respondent  was  the  First-tier
       Tribunal's failure to consider expressly a medical report.  This  is
       explained at point 7 of the Grounds.

    7. I am also concerned  at  language  suggesting  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal lost sight of the low standard of proof.

    8. As both sides have asked for the Decision  and  Reasons  to  be  set
       aside I see no point in a hearing. Given that nature  of  the  error
       then remittal is appropriate. The  Appellant's  case  has  not  been
       considered properly.

    9. Notice of Decision

   10. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set aside its decision and I
       direct that the appeal be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal.
