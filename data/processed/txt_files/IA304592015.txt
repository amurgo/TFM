Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr D Eteko, Iras & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 3 December  1971.  She
      appeals  with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge dismissing her appeal against the respondent's decision
      dated 23 June 2015 refusing her application for leave to remain in the
      UK.

   2. The appellant appeared in person before the First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      respondent was not represented.

   3. The Judge noted the appellant's application to remain in  the  UK  for
      her and her dependent son, D, who was born in the UK on 17 March 2007.
      He had lived for his whole life in the UK.

   4. The appellant claimed that she had married a man in Nigeria  in  1993.
      She was unable to conceive a child. She complained of  harassment  and
      threats by her former husband's family. She left her first husband  in
      2000.

   5. She had not paid back the dowry that  her  family  had  received.  Her
      husband also reclaimed the costs of  medical  treatment,  said  to  be
      ï¿½10,000. She then moved from Delta State to Lagos  to  get  away  from
      him.

   6. In 2001 she met Mr Monday Idogun and  began  to  live  with  him.  She
      became pregnant with his child. This occurred  outside  marriage.  She
      claimed that there were threats to her family from members of her  ex-
      husband's family.

   7. She came to the UK on 9 August 2006 as a visitor. Mr Idogun came  with
      her to the UK and stayed for about two weeks. The appellant wanted  to
      pay off the debt that she owed to  her  first  husband  so  she  could
      return to Nigeria with Mr Idogun. However, she was left in the  UK  by
      him and as at the date of  her  statement  he  had  another  wife  and
      children.

   8. Her son, D, was born in the UK on 17 March 2007. The appellant claimed
      that she would be unable to find work if she went back to  Nigeria  as
      she had no qualifications and nobody to look her son while she worked.
      She thought that D would be  unable  to  cope  with  life  in  Nigeria
      because of the darkness at night and an allergy  to  dust,  mosquitoes
      and heat. He had only known life  in  the  UK  and  would  have  great
      difficulty adjusting to life in Nigeria where schools barely  function
      for poor people like her.  She was accompanied at the hearing by D who
      was then nine years old.

   9. In her further statement she confirmed she had not left the  UK  since
      his birth. She said that she had been married to Mr Idogun in  Nigeria
      in December 2003 but was abandoned by him in the UK. He  divorced  her
      in June 2011.  She produced documents to that effect.

  10. She said her father was still living in Nigeria,  aged  about  89.  He
      lived with her elder sister. She is one of seven children.  Some  have
      died. Her father has retired. Her mother is now deceased.

  11. She claimed that she could not go back to  Nigeria  as  she  had  been
      threatened by the family of her first husband and was divorced by  her
      second who some time ago had threatened he would try to  take  D  away
      from her. Her second husband's family lived quite  close  to  her  own
      family. She would want to live in Lagos, however  although  she  would
      find  it  difficult  to  support  herself  and   her   son,   ensuring
      particularly that D had a good education [6-10].

  12. D is usually in good health. He has progressed well with his education
      at the primary school. He has one more full year at his current school
      before moving on to secondary school. D stated that he  goes  swimming
      and used to go to Cubs, which the appellant can no longer afford [10].

  13. She and her son were financially supported by her  elder  brother  and
      her church. She did not believe that either her brother or the  church
      would give her financial support if returned to Nigeria as they  would
      not be fully aware of her situation. She said she suffers from asthma.
      She had been advised to change medication [11].

  14. She claimed that it would not be reasonable for her son to go with her
      to live in Nigeria as she had too many problems from her first husband
      including her claim that she  should  repay  the  original  dowry  and
      hospital costs. She was scared of her first husband. Nor would she  be
      able to afford a good school for her son. The public school system  in
      Nigeria  is  of  a  very  poor  standard  without  equipment  such  as
      computers. She would be alone in Nigeria and liable to action  by  the
      family of her first husband [12].

  15. The Judge found that the appellant has a dependent son born to her  in
      the UK who was  now  nine  years  old.  She  had  a  genuine  parental
      relationship with him. He had lived in the  UK  for  more  than  seven
      years. Paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM applies [15].

  16. The respondent accepted that D had  never  been  to  Nigeria,  was  at
      school in the UK and had started to  put  down  his  own  roots.  That
      concession was found by the Judge to be even more true at the date  of
      hearing.

  17. He found that  the  central  part  of  the  appeal  by  the  appellant
      concerned the continuing education of her son, including  some  health
      concerns of her own arising from a diagnosis  of  asthma.  She  and  D
      access healthcare and education in the UK even  though  they  are  not
      technically entitled to them.  The  available  background  information
      showed that there is a system of healthcare in Nigeria, albeit not  of
      the same quality as provided in  the  UK  by  British  taxpayers.  The
      ability of the appellant to obtain funds for education  or  healthcare
      is not the determinative factor - [17].

  18. She had no evidence to suggest that  her  son's  allergy  would  be  a
      serious  problem.  Nor  was  there  evidence  to  confirm  her  claims
      regarding the asserted risk from the family of her ex-husband. Nor was
      there evidence that her ex-husband's family would  still  be  pursuing
      such a claim seventeen years after she left Nigeria.

  19. Nigeria, moreover, is a  large  and  populous  country.  There  is  no
      sophisticated system of citizen registration. She could  live  quietly
      without attracting that family's attention. She accepted that she  has
      family in Delta State although her father is very elderly. There  were
      wider family members so she is not a person  entirely  without  family
      support [18].

  20. The question of whether it is  reasonable  to  expect  D  to  live  in
      Nigeria has to be judged in the light of all the evidence, taking into
      consideration  his  best  interests.  The  appellant  herself  has  no
      exceptional circumstances [19].

  21. He found that it is clearly in the best interests of D to continue  to
      live with his mother and whilst the standard of education  in  Nigeria
      may not be as good as that available in the UK there is an educational
      system available for him. Balancing those factors together,  it  would
      not be unreasonable for the child to go to live in  Nigeria  with  his
      mother even though he had spent nearly ten years in the UK  [19].  The
      requirements of the exception in EX.1 had thus not been met. It  would
      not be unreasonable to expect her and the child  to  live  in  Nigeria
      where they are both nationals. There were no exceptional or compelling
      circumstances warranting an assessment outside the rules. Even if that
      had been the case the Judge was satisfied that any  interference  with
      the Article 8 rights was justified and proportionate [20].

  22. On 22 August 2017 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer  found  that  it  was
      arguable that the Judge failed to attach  significant  weight  to  the
      child's residence of over seven years pursuant to the guidance  of  MA
      (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 705. She accepted  that  that  point
      had not been identified in the grounds of appeal. It was however   'an
      obvious point'.

     Submissions

  23. Mr Eteko referred to Home Office guidance as to whether  it  would  be
      unreasonable to expect a British citizen child to  leave  the  UK.  He
      referred to SF and Others (Guidance,  Post-2014  Act)  Albania  [2017]
      UKUT 00120, and in particular to paragraph 11.2.3 of the  Home  Office
      policy set out in paragraph 7 of SF.  When  the  respondent  made  her
      decision on 23 June 2015, refusing the appellant's application the IDI
      - Family Migration - Appendix FM, s.1.0(B) "Family Life as  a  Partner
      or Parent and Private Life, 10 Year Routes" August 2015  Edition,  was
      not in force at the date of the decision under appeal but was in force
      at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing and the decision and is
      MA (Pakistan)still in force.

  24. Mr Eteko to paragraph [46] of MA, supra. The Court of Appeal held that
      even on the approach of the secretary of state, the fact that a  child
      has been here for seven years must be given  significant  weight  when
      carrying out the proportionality exercise. There was reference to  the
      guidance published in 2015 in  the  form  of  Immigration  Directorate
      Instructions in which it is  expressly  stated  that  once  the  seven
      years' residence requirement is satisfied, there  need  to  be  strong
      reasons for refusing leave.

  25. He accordingly submitted that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge was flawed as he failed to engage with the evidence and gave  no
      consideration at all to the material facts, and in particular  to  the
      approach mandated by the Court of Appeal in  MA  or  the  respondent's
      guidance.

  26. On behalf of the  respondent,  Mr  Clarke  referred  to  the  Rule  20
      response. The Judge  directed  himself  appropriately.  He  gave  full
      consideration to the appellant's claim. There was nothing  to  suggest
      that the argument relating to the policy guidance had ever been raised
      at the hearing.

  27. The child's best interests were properly considered. He referred to EV
      (Philippines) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 at [35] where  the  Court  of
      Appeal set out the factors to be considered in deciding what the  best
      interests of children are. The Judge did have regard  to  the  child's
      age, the length of time he had been here, how  long  he  had  been  in
      education and what stage his education had reached. He noted that  the
      child had not been to Nigeria and had lived here all his life.

  28. Mr Clarke submitted that apart from his lack of connection to Nigeria,
      and his schooling here, it is difficult to see what problems he  would
      have about integrating into Nigeria. The Judge took into  account  his
      linguistic and medical difficulties. He also  took  into  account  the
      difficulties in adapting to life in Nigeria. The appellant was not  at
      that stage a British citizen. He is still not a British citizen.

  29. Accordingly he submitted that the decision is  essentially  consistent
      with the case law. The findings were open to the Judge.

  30. In reply Mr Eteko submitted that EV (Philippines) is  distinguishable.
      That case dealt with children who had not been in  the  UK  for  seven
      years. In the appellant's case  the  Judge  had  to  assess  the  best
      interests of the child on the basis that he had  been  here  for  over
      seven years at the date of appeal.

  31.  In  the  circumstances  there  had  to  be  "strong  reasons"  before
      dismissing the appeal.

      Assessment

  32. As is evident from the grant of permission to  appeal,  the  appellant
      did not identify within the grounds of appeal lodged by the solicitors
      any reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan),
      supra. The grounds of appeal contended that the Judge made flawed  and
      perverse findings relating to the child's best interests being  served
      by his return to Nigeria with his mother. He had  not  identified  all
      the material facts and considerations.

  33. It was also contended that the Judge did not give adequate reasons for
      his findings that the  child's  best  interests  would  be  served  by
      returning him to Nigeria with his mother and why it was reasonable  to
      expect him to do so in the circumstances.

  34. The appellant attended in person before the First-tier Tribunal. There
      was no representative on behalf of the respondent.

  35. The Judge had regard to the fact that D had lived in the UK  for  more
      than seven years. He  stated  that  the  question  of  whether  it  is
      reasonable to expect the child to live in Nigeria must  be  judged  in
      the light of all the evidence and taking into consideration  his  best
      interests. He found that it was  clearly  in  his  best  interests  to
      continue to live with his mother. Although the standard  of  education
      may not be as good in Nigeria, there is  education  awaiting  him.  On
      balance it was not unreasonable to expect the  child  to  go  to  live
      there even though he had now spent nearly ten years in the UK [19].

  36. In MA, Elias LJ referred to the decision of Lord  Justice  Christopher
      Clarke in EV (Philippines), which  explained  how  a  Tribunal  should
      apply  the  proportionality   test   where   wider   public   interest
      considerations are in play, in circumstances where the best  interests
      of the child dictate he should  remain  in  the  UK,  as  set  out  in
      paragraphs 34-37.  He noted that EV  was not a seven year case but  on
      the wider  construction  of  s.117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act,  the  same
      principles would apply in such a case. The fact  that  the  child  had
      been in the UK for seven years would need  to  be  given  "significant
      weight" in the proportionality exercise because of  its  relevance  to
      determining the nature and strength of the child's best interests  and
      secondly, because it establishes as a starting point that leave should
      be granted unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary [49].

  37. It is accepted that the First-tier Judge did not have  regard  to  the
      decision in MA (Pakistan) which  as  noted  by  Judge  Plimmer  is  an
      "obvious point".

  38. In the circumstances, the fact that the child had been in the  UK  for
      more than seven years required the Judge to give significant weight in
      the proportionality exercise in determining the nature and strength of
      his best interests. Further, it establishes as a starting  point  that
      leave should be granted unless  there  are  powerful  reasons  to  the
      contrary.

  39. That exercise was not carried  out.  I  cannot  safely  conclude  that
      notwithstanding that omission the appeal was nonetheless bound  to  be
      dismissed.

  40. In the circumstances, I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point  of  law.   I  set
      aside the decision which will have to be re-made.


  41. I am satisfied that the extent  of  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
      necessary in order for the decision to be re-made,  is  extensive.   I
      have also had regard to the overriding objective and conclude that  it
      would be just and fair to remit the case.






 Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law. It is set aside.  The appeal is  remitted  to
      Taylor House for a fresh decision to be remade by another Judge.


      Anonymity direction not made.
