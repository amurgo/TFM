                                     and



               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appealed with permission against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M J Gillespie promulgated on 9 June  2015  in
    which he allowed the respondent's appeal against the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to revoke her residence  card  which  confirmed  her
    right of residence as the spouse of an EEA national  exercising  Treaty
    Rights here.  The judge  did,  however,  dismiss  the  appeals  of  her
    children, Fredaous Eniola  Ayoola  (IA/35280/2014)  and  Faiz  Mobolaji
    Ayoola (IA/33426/2014). There were no appeals against those decisions.

 2. On 21 January 2016 a decision by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge I A  Lewis
    was promulgated in which he gave reasons why the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law, and set it aside.
    A copy of that decision is attached.

 3. Subsequent to  that  decision,  the  judge  gave  directions  that  the
    remaking of the decision should be stayed  pending  resolution  of  the
    applications made by Ms Ahmadu's  children,  Fredasous  Eniola  Ayoola,
    Faiz Mobolaji Ayoola and  Mubarack  Mofotlation  Bamidele  Biobaku  for
    residence cards confirming their  right  of  residence  as  the  family
    members of an EEA national ( the appellant's husband).

 4. On 9  March  2016,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  children's
    applications. They have now  lodged  appeals  against  those  decisions
    which are pending before the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. These appeals, and the remaking of this appeal,  turn  on  whether  the
    appellant's husband is exercising Treaty rights.  In the circumstances,
    it is in the interest of justice that the files are  linked  and  heard
    together and it therefore follows, that this appeal must be remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be determined afresh at the same time as the
    appeals of the children.


SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involve the making of an error
    of law and it is set aside.


 2. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  decision
    on all issues.


 3. The appeal should be linked with and heard  with  the  appeals  of  the
    following who are the appellant's children:

    Fredasous Eniola Ayoola                 EA/03811/2016

    Faiz Mobolaji Ayoola                EA/03814/2016

    Mubarack Mofotlation Bamidele Biobaku   EA/03818/2016
