                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was not granted at an earlier stage.  We find  it  appropriate  to
do so as there are protection issues. Unless and until a Tribunal  or  court
directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify her or any member  of  her
family.   This  direction  applies  both  to  the  Appellant  and   to   the
Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.


 1. The appellant, a national  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  dated  4
    December 2015 to refuse her  application  for  asylum  or  humanitarian
    protection in the UK. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bart-Stewart  dismissed
    the appeal. The appellant now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

Background

 2. The background to this appeal is that the appellant arrived in  the  UK
    in September 2011 with entry clearance as a  Tier  4  student  and  was
    granted further leave to remain until July 2015. Her  leave  to  remain
    was curtailed on 10 February 2015 with no right of appeal.

 3. The appellant claimed  asylum  on  15  July  2015.  The  basis  of  her
    application was accepted by the Secretary of State in the  Reasons  for
    Refusal letter. It was accepted that she was  engaged  in  Pakistan  in
    relation to an arranged marriage. The appellant persuaded her family to
    allow her to come to the UK and study. The appellant met  someone  else
    in the UK and it was accepted that when she told her  fianc�  that  she
    was going to marry this man he threatened her over a period of four  to
    five months threatening to throw acid on her. The  Secretary  of  State
    accepted that the appellant had married an Iraqi national in the UK  in
    June 2013 and that they have a daughter together. It was also  accepted
    that the appellant had been disowned by her family for marrying someone
    not from her ethnic background and without  her  family's  consent.  In
    light of these conclusions the Secretary of  State  accepted  that  the
    appellant had a genuine subjective fear of return to  Karachi.  However
    the Secretary of  State  concluded  that  there  is  a  sufficiency  of
    protection in Pakistan and that there are areas of  Pakistan  to  which
    she could reasonably relocate.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the issue  of  sufficiency  of
    protection and concluded that there may be some risk to  the  appellant
    in her home area of Karachi [29]. In  considering  internal  relocation
    the judge had regard to the guidance in SM  (lone  women  -  ostracism)
    Pakistan [2016] UKUT 00067 (IAC) said at paragraph 30:

         "SM was considering a case where  the  appellant  had  remarried  a
         Pakistani man. Circumstances may have been different if her husband
         was  from  another  country.  In   light   of   the   evidence   of
         discrimination suffered by Pakistani women I  do  not  consider  it
         reasonable to expect that as a foreign national who does not  speak
         the language and has never lived in the country her  husband  could
         provide her with male protection described.  I  therefore  consider
         her as a lone woman who would be returning possibly with her  child
         and have to relocate to another city."

 5. The judge went on to find at paragraph  34  that  the  appellant  could
    relocate within Pakistan as a lone woman because;

         "The appellant is a 28 year old woman from a well off family who is
         part  privately  educated  in  her  home  country.  She   completed
         secondary education there and then completed a Level  6  course  in
         Hospitality and Management in the UK and started a level 7 course 2
         years ago. The guidance in SM is  that  it  will  not  normally  be
         unduly harsh for educated, better  off,  or  older  women  to  seek
         internal relocation to a city. This envisages a woman with a  child
         going on to say  that  it  helps  if  a  woman  has  qualifications
         enabling her to get well-paid employment and pay for  accommodation
         and childcare if required. The appellant has  provided  no  reasons
         why it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  her  to  relocate.  Her  only
         expressed fear is of the former fianc�. I do not finds it  credible
         to suggest that he is so focussed on the broken engagement he would
         pursue her all over Pakistan".

 6.  The  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant   could   seek   temporary
    accommodation in a shelter or rent  private  accommodation  in  another
    area. The judge said that she had regard to  section  55  but  did  not
    consider  "that  it  would  be  against  the  best  interests  of   the
    appellant's daughter who is only a year old and entitled to  return  to
    what is her country of nationality with  her  mother,  to  do  so."  In
    relation to the child's father the judge said that it  was  his  choice
    whether or not to seek permission to travel  with  or  join  them.  The
    judge dismissed the asylum appeal and  also  went  on  to  dismiss  the
    appeal under Article 8.

 7. The appellant contends in the grounds of appeal that the  judge  failed
    to properly apply the guidance in SM in considering whether it would be
    unduly harsh for the appellant  to  relocate  within  Pakistan.  It  is
    contended that the appellant is in an irregular situation  whereby  she
    has no familial support due to her love marriage to an Iraqi  Kurd  who
    is seeking asylum in the UK. It is further contended that  the  judge's
    findings  in  relation  to  the  best  interests  of  the  child   were
    unreasonable and that if the child's best interests had been considered
    properly the judge would have found it  unduly  harsh  to  require  the
    appellant's child to relocate in Pakistan. It is  also  contended  that
    the judge failed to consider that requiring the appellant and her child
    to return to Pakistan would have the effect  of  separating  the  child
    from her father or, if the child did not go, from  her  mother.  It  is
    contended in the second ground of appeal that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed to consider evidence relating to lack of  availability  of
    an entry route  for  the  appellant's  husband  into  Pakistan  as  the
    evidence shows that there are no provisions to  allow  the  appellant's
    husband to relocate to Pakistan. There is no challenge to  the  judge's
    conclusions in relation to Article 8.

 8. In her skeleton argument Ms Iteva relied on a number of  findings  made
    by the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  including  the  finding  that  the
    appellant does not have family support from family members  or  a  male
    guardian and cannot return to her family home [27, 29,  30];  that  she
    will not be able to avail herself of any short term support  facilities
    [28]; that she is not financially independent therefore  not  well  off
    [37]; and that she is in an irregular situation because of her marriage
    to an Iraqi national which will not be  recognised  by  the  state  and
    because of her child [30]. In the skeleton  argument  it  is  contended
    that the judge failed to apply the guidance in  SM  to  these  findings
    based on the appellant's circumstances.   The  skeleton  argument  also
    outlines the basis for the submission that the judge failed to consider
    the best interests of the appellant's  child  in  the  context  of  her
    findings and the background evidence before her.

 9. In her submissions Ms Ahmad accepted that the consideration  undertaken
    by the judge of the child's best interests  under  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  is  inadequate.  However
    she submitted that the guidance in SM does allow the judge to reach the
    conclusions she does given that she has considered all of the evidence.

10. In response Ms Iteva submitted that the section 55 issue  goes  to  the
    core of the asylum decision in this case.

Error of Law

11. In SM the Upper Tribunal gave the following guidance in relation to the
    return to Pakistan of lone female heads of households;

         "73.     Although we find that the circumstances of this  appellant
         are not that of a lone female head of family (see below),  we  have
         considered what country guidance we can give in relation  to  women
         who are such circumstances. We give the following guidance:


         i. Save as herein set out, the existing country guidance in  SN and
         HM (Divorced women - risk on return) Pakistan CG [2004] UKIAT 00283
         and in KA and Others (domestic violence - risk on return)  Pakistan
         CG[2010] UKUT 216 (IAC) remains valid.


         ii.      Where a risk of persecution or serious harm exists in  her
         home area for a single woman or a female head of  household,  there
         may be an internal relocation option to one  of  Pakistan's  larger
         cities, depending on the family, social and  educational  situation
         of the woman in question.


         iii.     It will not be normally be unduly harsh to expect a single
         woman or female head of household  to  relocate  internally  within
         Pakistan if she can access support from family members  or  a  male
         guardian in the place of relocation.


         iv.      It will not normally be unduly harsh for educated,  better
         off, or older women to seek internal relocation to a city. It helps
         if a  woman  has  qualifications  enabling  her  to  get  well-paid
         employment and pay for accommodation and childcare if required.


         v. Where a single woman, with or without children, is ostracised by
         family members and other sources of possible social support because
         she is in an irregular situation, internal relocation will be  more
         difficult and whether it is unduly harsh will be a question of fact
         in each case.


         vi.      A single woman or female head of household who has no male
         protector or social network may be able to use the  state  domestic
         violence shelters for a short time, but the focus of such  shelters
         is on reconciling people with their family networks, and places are
         in short supply and time limited. Privately  run  shelters  may  be
         more flexible,  providing  longer  term  support  while  the  woman
         regularises her social situation, but again, places are limited.


         vii.     Domestic violence shelters are available for women at risk
         but where they are used by women with children,  such  shelters  do
         not always allow older  children  to  enter  and  stay  with  their
         mothers. The risk of temporary separation, and the  proportionality
         of such separation, is likely to differ depending on  the  age  and
         sex of a woman's children: male children may be removed from  their
         mothers at the age of 5 and placed in an  orphanage  or  a  madrasa
         until the  family  situation  has  been  regularised  (see KA  and
         Others (domestic violence risk on return) Pakistan CG [2010] UKUT
         216  (IAC)).  Such  temporary  separation  will   not   always   be
         disproportionate or unduly harsh: that is a  question  of  fact  in
         each case.


         viii. Women in Pakistan are  legally  permitted  to  divorce  their
         husbands and may institute divorce proceedings from the country  of
         refuge, via a third party and with the help of lawyers in Pakistan,
         reducing the risk of family reprisals. A  woman  who  does  so  and
         returns with a new partner or husband  will  have  access  to  male
         protection and is unlikely, outside her home area, to be at risk of
         ostracism, still less of persecution or serious harm."


12. We consider it significant that Ms  Ahmad  conceded  that  the  judge's
    consideration of the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's  child  was
    inadequate. We agree with Ms Iteva's submission  that  this  assessment
    goes to the heart of the decision as to internal relocation. The  judge
    considered section 55 at paragraph 35 in the context of the decision as
    to internal relocation. The assessment as to whether it would be unduly
    harsh for the appellant to relocate within Pakistan has to take account
    of the best interests of the child in this case.  The  judge  found  at
    paragraph 30  that  the  appellant's  husband  could  not  provide  the
    appellant with male protection in Pakistan as he is a foreign  national
    who does not speak the language. The judge then went on to  conduct  an
    assessment  as  to  the  reasonableness  of  the  appellant's  internal
    relocation in Pakistan as a lone woman. However this  assessment  fails
    to take account of the effect on  the  child  of  separation  from  her
    father, should she return there with her mother, or her  mother  should
    she remain in the UK. The judge failed to consider whether returning to
    Pakistan  without  her  husband  would  be  unduly  harsh.  The   judge
    considered that the appellant came within paragraph iv of the  guidance
    in SM without looking at whether another of the categories might apply,
    for example v.

13. In our view the conceded error in relation to  the  assessment  of  the
    child's best  interests  under  section  55  along  with  the  lack  of
    consideration of all of the factors set out in the guidance in  SM  led
    to a material error in  the  judge's  decision.  The  nature  of  these
    material errors are such that the decision should be set aside.

14. There has been no challenge to the findings of fact, which are based on
    the matters accepted in the Secretary of State's  Reasons  for  Refusal
    letter and these findings shall stand. There is  no  challenge  to  the
    decision in relation to Article 8 therefore that decision shall stand.

Remaking the asylum decision

15. The Secretary of State accepted the appellant's account but  considered
    that there was a sufficiency of protection for her in Pakistan and that
    she could internally relocate. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that
    there may be some risk to the appellant in  her  home  area  [27]  thus
    accepting that there was no sufficiency of protection in her home area.
    On this basis and as the findings of fact still stand the only issue to
    be determined therefore is whether it would be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    appellant to internally relocate within Pakistan.

16. We heard submissions from Ms Ahmad and Ms Iteva in relation to remaking
    the decision based on the findings of fact.  Ms  Ahmad  asked  that  we
    consider the guidance in SM as to internal relocation. Ms Iteva  relied
    on her skeleton argument.

17. We firstly consider the best interests of the child. The child was born
    in the UK on 19 September 2015. She is therefore  just  over  one  year
    old. In the absence of evidence to the contrary we accept that it  must
    be in the child's best interests  to  remain  with  both  parents.  The
    evidence indicates that if returned to Pakistan  with  her  mother  the
    child may well face economic and social difficulties.

18. We consider the guidance in SM. We note that this applies to women  who
    will be returning to Pakistan as lone heads of households. In this case
    there is no evidence that the appellant's husband, an  Iraqi  national,
    would be granted permission to travel to or remain in Pakistan. If this
    appellant is returned with or without her child it will be without  her
    husband. In our view the appellant is in an 'irregular situation' as  a
    result of which she has been ostracised by her family. Whilst  she  has
    been educated there is no evidence that the appellant is  well  off  or
    that  her  qualifications  would  enable  her  to  obtain   well   paid
    employment. Significantly, the appellant's  return  to  Pakistan  would
    separate her from her husband, the father of her child.  In  our  view,
    applying the guidance in paragraph v of SM, all of these  factors  mean
    that in this case, internal relocation within Pakistan would be  unduly
    harsh.

19. Accordingly we allow the appellant's asylum appeal.
