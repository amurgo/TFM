                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

1) This appeal was brought with permission against a decision  by  Judge  of
   the First-tier Tribunal Morrison dismissing  the  appeal  under  the  EEA
   Regulations.

2) The appeal was listed for hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  in  Glasgow
   on 22 April 2015.  The principal issue before the  Tribunal  was  whether
   the judge had erred by not fully considering the appeal under  Article  8
   as well as under the EEA  Regulations.   The  hearing  on  22  April  was
   adjourned for the parties to prepare further submissions on the  possible
   application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

3) Following this hearing, on 14 May 2015, the  appellant  sought  leave  to
   withdraw her  appeal  because  she  had  been  granted  leave  under  the
   Immigration Rules by the respondent.

4) In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule  17,
   the Tribunal consents to the  withdrawal.   The  appeal  is  recorded  as
   withdrawn by written notice.

Signed                                             Date
