                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    EMM Smith, promulgated on  26th  June  2014,  following  a  hearing  at
    Bennett House, Stoke-on-Trent on 9th May and 13th June  2014.   In  the
    determination, the judge dismissed  the  appeal  of  Mrs  Kuldeep  Kaur
    Khera.  The  Appellant  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India.  She was born on 10th August 1984.
     She appeals against the decision of the Respondent Secretary of State,
    dated 25th March 2014, rejecting her claim to be entitled to remain  in
    the UK on the basis of her marriage with a British citizen, present and
    settled in the UK, namely, Mr Amarthpal Singh Khera.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that on 5th January 2013, she  was  introduced
    to Mr Khera's family in Leicester, and they became engaged and on  25th
    May 2013 they married and began living together.  She was at  the  time
    pregnant.  Her child was due on 5th September 2014.  The child has  now
    been born.  Mr Khera is in employment.  He has two jobs.  He works as a
    till operator and he also works with Industrial Personnel Services Ltd.
     There is a background  to  the  Appellant's  history.   She  initially
    arrived in the UK on 15th August 2009 on a working holidaymaker's visa.
     This was valid until 3rd August 2011.  She came to  join  her  fianc�.
    She lived with the fianc�'s family.  She  was  subjected,  however,  to
    verbal, physical and sexual abuse, at the hands of the fianc�'s family.
     In November 2009 she returned back to  India.   She  re-entered  on  a
    valid visa in March 2010 and lived near Birmingham.  Between March 2010
    and 15th August 2012 she lived at various addresses doing domestic work
    and it was at the Sikh temple in Leicester that she met Amarthpal Singh
    Khera, the person to whom she is currently married, and with  whom  she
    has founded a family.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge found the Appellant and her husband, Mr Khera to be  credible
    witnesses.  He held that, "I am satisfied that  Mr  Khera  married  the
    Appellant because he loved her and accept that he is  in  a  subsisting
    relationship  with  the  Appellant"  (paragraph  31).    However,   the
    Appellant had not mentioned her relationship with Mr Khera at the  time
    when she was interviewed or in  correspondence  thereafter.   When  the
    Appellant gave an explanation before the judge that her culture  frowns
    upon such a disclosure, the judge accepted this explanation  (paragraph
    31).  The judge rejected that there were  major  discrepancies  in  the
    accounts  of  Mr  Khera  and   the   Appellant.    As   he   explained,
    "discrepancies there were but in my  view  they  were  not  significant
    taking into account the facts of this case" (paragraph 31).  The  judge
    concluded that the appeal could only be resolved under  the  provisions
    of Appendix FM of the Rules.  Paragraph 276ADE was not applicable.  The
    asylum claim, which had earlier been made, was not being pursued.

 5. The nub of the judge's conclusions are as follows.   First,  the  judge
    held that, "I'm satisfied that  the  Appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a British citizen,  however,  what  is  in
    contention is whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
    with her husband outside the  UK"  (paragraph  37).   This  meant  that
    consideration had to be given as to whether the  Appellant  could  live
    outside the United Kingdom, that is to say in India, in order to pursue
    their genuine and subsisting family life  there.   This  leads  to  the
    second point.  Second, the judge made findings with respect to this  at
    paragraph 38 of the  determination.   As  he  observed,  the  Appellant
    returned to India in 2009.  She remained there for several months.  She
    remained with her family.  That family would support her.  However, the
    difficulty lay in relation to the husband.  He was a  British  citizen,
    born and brought up in the UK.

 6. As the judge recounted, "her  husband  had  made  enquiries  with  Moon
    Travel and an independent advisor as to  whether,  in  the  absence  of
    employment, he would obtain a visa to travel to India.  He was told  he
    would not".

 7. The judge was concerned, however, that the husband, Mr Khera,

         "has not communicated with the Indian High Commission and  has  not
         produced any evidence to support his contentions.  Whilst I  accept
         his evidence that he has been so advised I am  satisfied  that  the
         advice is the result of his lack of effort to see if employment  is
         available.  After all  I  have  found  him  to  be  a  resourceful,
         intelligent and articulate man.  Accepting as I do that he was born
         in the UK, his family live here and those relatives he has in India
         are distant relatives, I do note that his brother,  despite  having
         no close relatives in India, decided to marry there  four  to  five
         years ago which is when this witness last visited India" (paragraph
         38).

 8. Accordingly, given the "Appellant's husband's inability  or  desire  to
    making  any  enquiries  in  India  in   respect   of   employment   and
    accommodation" the  judge  could  not  be  satisfied  that  there  were
    "insurmountable obstacles" to the Appellant and her husband  relocating
    to India.  As he concluded, "there are no obstacles that the  Appellant
    and her husband cannot overcome .... the closest I  have  is  that  her
    husband has lived in the UK and she does not want to  return  there  to
    live" (paragraph 41).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that in adopting  the  "insurmountable
    obstacles" test the judge misdirected himself in  the  context  of  the
    reasonableness  of  relocation  for  the  Appellant's  British  citizen
    spouse.

10. On 11th July 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

11. On 23rd July 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered to  the  effect  that
    the judge had not erred in law in his approach to Appendix FM  and  the
    consideration of insurmountable obstacles.



Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on  19th  February  2015,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr F Khan,  who  provided  a  helpfully  short  skeleton
    argument summarising the case on behalf of the  Appellant.   In  brief,
    the appeal was being put on the basis that if the judge had before  him
    evidence  which  fulfilled,  as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing,   the
    requirements of "insurmountable obstacles", then the appeal should have
    been allowed as a matter  of  law.   The  judge  had  accepted  on  the
    evidence as at the date of the  hearing  that  the  Appellant's  spouse
    could not get a visa to  live  in  India.   At  the  hearing,  Mr  Khan
    submitted that the appeal should succeed for two reasons in  particular
    first, the judge did not reject the Appellant's husband's evidence that
    he had made enquiries at two different sources, both of whom  had  told
    him that he could not obtain a visa in the  absence  of  employment  in
    India.  Second, the fact was that the Appellant did not, as at the date
    of the hearing, have a visa.  Therefore, both these facts  amounted  to
    an  "insurmountable  obstacle"  facing  the  Appellant's   husband   in
    relocating to India.

13. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the judge read the requirement of
    "insurmountable obstacles" in the right  way.   At  paragraph  38,  the
    judge was concerned that proper enquiries had  not  been  made  by  the
    Appellant's husband.  In  particular,  the  judge  was  clear  that  no
    enquiries were made with the Indian High Commission and the Appellant's
    husband "has not produced any evidence  to  support  his  contentions".
    Second,  the  Appellant's  husband  did  nothing  to  look  for   work.
    Hypothetically, he could obtain a visa.

14. In reply, Mr Khan submitted that the Appellant's husband did not simply
    make enquiries with a travel agent, such as Moon Travel, but also  with
    an "independent advisor".  This is clear from paragraph 38.

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.

16. First, what is at issue here  are  the  rights  of  a  British  citizen
    husband, born and brought up in the United Kingdom, who has never lived
    in India, and has no desire to do so.  As the judge himself  explained,
    "the closest I have is that her husband has lived in  the  UK  and  she
    does not want to return there  to  live"  (paragraph  41).   The  judge
    failed to give this particular aspect  the  individuated  consideration
    that it deserved.  This is because in MM [2013] EWHC 1900,  Mr  Justice
    Blake made it clear that, "British citizens were in a  different  class
    to  foreigners  generally,  as  they  had  a  constitutional  right  of
    residence in their own country as well as a human right to marry, found
    a family have respect accorded to their  family  life"  (see  paragraph
    123).

17. Second, on this basis, and against the background  of  the  Appellant's
    husband having made enquiries from two different sources, namely,  from
    Moon Travel and an independent advisor, it was sufficient, on a balance
    of probabilities, to say that with no home and job, or family relatives
    in that country, the Appellant's husband would face  an  insurmountable
    obstacle in moving there.  The judge's contention  that  there  was  no
    such insurmountable obstacle, is based upon the  observation  that  the
    Appellant's husband is "resourceful,  intelligent,  and  an  articulate
    man" (paragraph 38).  This  does  not  deal  with  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's husband is a British citizen.

18. The  judge's  observations  were  also  based  on  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's husband's brother, despite having  no  close  relatives  in
    India, decided to marry there four to five years  ago  (paragraph  38).
    However, many people choose to marry  spouses  from  their  country  of
    ancestry without choosing to relocate there.  On the  whole,  in  fact,
    the trend is decidedly the other way, with the foreign spouse coming to
    the  UK.   There  was  no   evidence,   notwithstanding   the   judge's
    observation, of the Appellant's husband's brother having  relocated  to
    India himself.  Accordingly, in  all  the  circumstances,  it  was  not
    reasonable to expect the Appellant's husband, as a British citizen  who
    had never lived in India, to relocate to that country, when he  had  no
    job and no home there to go to.

19. Second, the  judge  did  deal  with  Article  8  ECHR  at  length  (see
    paragraphs 42 to 44).  Those submissions were made before me either  by
    Mr Mills or by Mr  Khan  with  respect  to  Article  8  ECHR.   If  the
    Appellant did not succeed under the Rules however,  then  consideration
    had to be given to whether she  could  succeed  under  Article  8  ECHR
    jurisprudence.  The position  is  that  where  the  relevant  group  of
    Immigration Rules, upon their proper construction, provide a  "complete
    code" for dealing with a person's Convention rights in the context of a
    particular Immigration Rule or statutory provision, such as in the case
    of "foreign criminals", then the balancing exercise  and  the  way  the
    various factors are to be taken into account in an individual case must
    be done in accordance with that code.  But if  the  relevant  group  of
    Immigration  Rules  is  not  such   a   "complete   code",   then   the
    proportionality test would be more at large, and it will be  guided  by
    the Huang tests and the UK Strasbourg case law.   Lord  Justice  Aikens
    has made it clear in  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,  that  the
    question is whether a party has an arguable  case  that  there  may  be
    "grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules".  If  that  is
    the case, as was the case here, then they will have to be determined by
    the relevant decision maker.  The judge failed to give consideration to
    such jurisprudence.

Re-Making the Decision

20. I have re-made the decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    original judge, and the submissions I have heard today.  I am  allowing
    this appeal for the reasons that I have set out above.

21. First, the judge was wrong to  conclude,  with  respect  to  a  British
    citizen husband who had never lived in India, and where  there  was  no
    evidence of his having a job or a  home  there,  that  because  he  was
    resourceful  and  intelligent,  that  there  were   no   insurmountable
    obstacles in his path to relocating there.  The  fact  that  he  was  a
    British citizen was a material  difference  and  consideration  in  his
    case.

22. Second, the Appellant's husband had made reasonable enquiries and on  a
    balance of probabilities these suggested that he would have  difficulty
    in procuring a visa without a job there.   As  a  British  citizen,  in
    order to go and work in India, he would have needed a specific visa for
    this purpose.

23. Third, and in any event, the appeal succeeds under Article  8  ECHR  on
    the  basis  of  the  Huang  and  Razgar  tests,  because  it  would  be
    disproportionate to expect a person properly settled in  this  country,
    having been born and brought up in this country, and the citizenship of
    which he holds, to relocate to India, where  he  has  a  constitutional
    right to remain in the state of which he is a national.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.   I  re-make  the  decision  as  follows.   This  appeal  is
allowed.

No anonymity order is made.
