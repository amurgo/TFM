                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Nepal who  was  born  on  22
    November 1986.  On 16 November 2009 she was granted leave to enter  the
    UK  as  a  student  until  31  July  2011  which  leave  was   extended
    subsequently until 24 November 2013.

 2. The background to this appeal is set out in a  decision  which  I  made
    following a hearing which was before the Honourable Mr Justice Jay  and
    myself on 27 February 2014 and I will set out within this determination
    the relevant facts as set out in that decision.

 3. The appellant was married at the time  she  entered  the  UK  but  this
    marriage broke down and while still married she met Mr Roshan who is  a
    British citizen and she formed a relationship with  him.   On  21  June
    2013 at a time when she was still married  she  applied  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK as Mr Roshan's partner. The  respondent  refused  this
    application for a number of reasons which it was not necessary  for  me
    to set out within my earlier decision and is not necessary  for  me  to
    set out in the  course  of  this  determination  either.   Amongst  the
    reasons  why  the  application  was  refused  was  that  the  financial
    requirements under Appendix FM of  the  Rules  were  not  met  and  the
    respondent also considered that there would not  be  a  breach  of  the
    appellant's Article 8 rights were she required now to return to Nepal.

 4. The appellant appealed against this decision and her appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha  sitting  at  Birmingham  on  5
    November 2013 but in a determination promulgated  on  3  December  2013
    Judge  Sangha  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal   both   under   the
    Immigration Rules and under Article 8.  In between the dates  when  the
    application was made and the hearing before Judge Sangha the  appellant
    had finalised a divorce from her first husband and on 1  November  2013
    which was four days before the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    the appellant and Mr Roshan had got  married.   Although  Judge  Sangha
    noted that there had been some discrepancies between the evidence given
    by the appellant and her husband and one or two inconsistencies between
    what the appellant had claimed with regard to her parents'  disapproval
    of her relationship with Mr Roshan  and  the  evidence  that  they  had
    nonetheless assisted her with the divorce proceedings from her previous
    husband  nonetheless  the  Judge  found  at   paragraph   21   of   his
    determination that despite any such discrepancies "I have come  to  the
    conclusion that [the appellant and her husband] are in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship".  He  also  accepted  that  Mr  Roshan  was  a
    British citizen who lived and worked in the UK  and  he  had  taken  up
    employment recently and was earning above the income threshold (ï¿½18,600
    per year) necessary under the Rules.  It  had  earlier  been  explained
    during the course of the hearing that because Mr Roshan  had  not  been
    able to find employment until relatively recently he could not  provide
    six months' payslips showing the required earnings which was  necessary
    in order to succeed under the Rules because at the time of that hearing
    he had only been working in his present  job  for  two  months.   While
    finding that the appellant in  fact  now  earned  about  the  threshold
    (albeit that he could not satisfy the requirements of the Rules at that
    point in time) and that the  marriage  was  genuine  nonetheless  Judge
    Sangha dismissed the appeal for the reasons which  he  set  out  within
    paragraph 21.  Essentially he found that:

         "There does not appear to be any valid  reason  why  the  appellant
         cannot return to Nepal as she originally intended in order to apply
         for entry clearance in order to join her husband here."

    He continued as follows:

         "Whilst there may be a degree of hardship for both of  them,  there
         does not appear to be any valid reason  why  the  appellant  cannot
         return to Nepal in order to apply for entry clearance and  why  she
         would not be able to gain  entry  clearance  from  Nepal  within  a
         reasonable period of time.  In my assessment, the  evidence  before
         me does not suggest that there are any insurmountable obstacles  to
         the appellant returning to  Nepal  in  order  to  apply  for  entry
         clearance and there was no evidence to suggest  it  will  have  any
         adverse effect on their continuing relationship.  ...  There is  no
         valid reason why the appellant cannot return to Nepal and apply for
         entry clearance which is likely to be granted within  a  reasonable
         period of time.  It is clear that the  appellant's  husband  is  in
         secure full-time employment and his income is above  the  financial
         threshold.  While  there  may  be  a  degree  of  hardship  in  the
         appellant having to return to Nepal to apply for entry clearance  I
         do not consider that it is  in  any  way  disproportionate  in  the
         circumstances of this particular case."

 5. As I noted in my earlier decision the appellant was  granted  leave  to
    appeal against this decision  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grant  on  17
    January 2014 and when setting out his reasons for  granting  permission
    to appeal Judge Grant stated as follows:

         "2.  ...  The  grounds  argue  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in
             dismissing the appeal under Article 8(2) because, in line with
             R  (NM)  ...  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin),  the  decision  was
             disproportionate even though the appellant's partner could not
             meet the financial requirements.

         ...

         4.    As  regards  (2),  the  judge  accepted  that  the   parties'
             relationship is a genuine one and that they had married a  few
             days before the hearing.  The judge  also  accepted  that  the
             sponsor's  income  exceeded  that  required  by   the   Rules.
             Nevertheless, the judge concluded that it was proportionate to
             expect  the  appellant  to  return  to  Nepal  to  seek  entry
             clearance.  That finding is arguably perverse and contrary  to
             the approach of the House of Lords  in  Chikwamba  ...  [2008]
             UKHL 40 - it would appear to amount to  an  interference  with
             the parties' family life in  order  to  enforce  a  procedural
             requirement for no good or sensible  reasons  (see  ...  Hayat
             [2013] Imm AR 15 at 30(b)) ..."

 6. The  Tribunal  (that  is  Mr  Justice  Jay  and  myself)  having  heard
    submissions  on  behalf  of  both  parties  considered  Judge  Sangha's
    determination had contained  material  errors  of  law  such  that  the
    decision must be  remade  and  our  reasons  are  set  out  within  the
    decision.  We noted that although Judge Sangha had stated at  paragraph
    21 that "there may be a degree of hardship for both of  them"  he  does
    not explore in his determination how much hardship there would be, nor,
    more importantly does he attempt to weigh  this  hardship  against  the
    need to enforce the Immigration Rules for the purpose of maintaining  a
    fair and effective system of immigration control, which is a legitimate
    purpose, necessary for the maintenance of the economic wellbeing of the
    country.  Far more importantly, we  considered  that  in  finding  that
    "there does not appear to be any valid reason why the appellant  cannot
    return to Nepal", especially in circumstances where she was  likely  to
    be  granted  entry  clearance  within  a  reasonable  period  of   time
    thereafter, the judge seemed to be  approaching  his  consideration  of
    proportionality on the basis that it was the  appellant  to  show  that
    there were not, as he put it, insurmountable obstacles to the appellant
    returning to Nepal in order to apply for entry  clearance  whereas  the
    Court of Appeal in Hayat, following the decision of the House of  Lords
    in Chikwamba, had made it clear that rather  than  considering  whether
    there was any reason why this appellant should not return to Nepal, the
    judge should rather have considered whether there was a sensible reason
    why she should.  The judgment at paragraph 30b) of Hayat sets  out  one
    of the effects of the various decisions which were summarised  in  that
    judgment as follows:

         "Where  Article  8  is  engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
         interference with family or private life to enforce such  a  policy
         unless, to use the language of Sullivan LJ [in MA (Pakistan) [2009]
         EWCA Civ 953], there is a sensible reason for doing so."

 7. We considered that Judge Sangha should have had  consideration  to  the
    decisions in   Chikwamba  and  Hayat  and  that  because  there  is  no
    reference in his determination  to  either  decision  when  considering
    whether removal would be proportionate in this case there was no  basis
    upon which it could be properly argued that he did  have  in  mind  the
    relevant guidance given in those  decisions.   We  considered  that  it
    could not be said with any certainty that had he done so  his  decision
    would have been bound to be the same.   The  Tribunal  at  the  earlier
    hearing directed that the hearing would be adjourned until today's date
    and that the hearing, which was to be before me  sitting  alone,  would
    proceed on the basis that the finding of the First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the appellant and her husband are in a genuine and subsisting  marriage
    would be preserved, as  would  the  finding  (which  was  confirmed  in
    further evidence placed before us) that  the  appellant's  husband  was
    currently employed and earned over ï¿½19,000 a year, unless by  the  date
    of the resumed hearing further evidence was put before us to  establish
    that this was no longer the case.  We also directed that  the  Tribunal
    would at  the  resumed  hearing  today  consider  whether  in  all  the
    circumstances of this case including whether or not at the date of this
    hearing the requirements under the Rules would be satisfied it would be
    proportionate to require the appellant to return to Nepal in  order  to
    make an application for entry clearance from that country in  light  of
    the guidance given by the House of Lords in Chikwamba and  subsequently
    by the Court of Appeal in Hayat.



The Hearing

 8. This appeal has now come  back  before  me  as  directed  and  I  heard
    submissions on behalf of both parties.  I was also referred to evidence
    of the appellant and her husband which had been put before the Tribunal
    at the last hearing in readiness  for  any  rehearing  which  might  be
    ordered.  Both the  appellant  and  her  husband  attended  for  cross-
    examination  although  in  the  event  Ms  Everett,  representing   the
    respondent, only cross-examined the appellant.  She  had  no  questions
    for the appellant's husband.

 9. I have recorded all the submissions which were  made  to  me  and  such
    evidence as there was in the Record of Proceedings and so I  shall  not
    refer below to everything which was  said  during  the  course  of  the
    hearing, but only to such material and submissions as is necessary  for
    the purposes of this determination.  Essentially the evidence  of  both
    the appellant and her husband is that they were married on  1  November
    2013 and are living together and intend to live the rest of their lives
    together.  The appellant's family in  Nepal  are  not  happy  with  the
    appellant's decision to marry Mr Roshan because they are from different
    cultures and countries of origin and although in time the  attitude  of
    her parents might change at present she might not be able to stay  with
    them.  Although the  appellant's  husband  has  now  secured  full-time
    employment their finances are tight and if she were to be  required  to
    return to Nepal in order to  make  her  application  this  would  be  a
    substantial strain on their financial resources and it would also  have
    a detrimental effect on the relationship as they are  relatively  newly
    wed and it is important to them to be together at this stage  of  their
    marriage.  As she also notes in her statement, she and her husband  had
    been going through a very difficult time because as  a  result  of  the
    difficulties her husband had in securing employment he had built  up  a
    large overdraft with the bank which they are still struggling to repay.
     If she had to return now to Nepal which would involve having  to  find
    money which she does  not  have  for  plane  fares,  application  fees,
    accommodation and other expenses this would be very harsh for her.   In
    addition of course as with any application of this sort the  period  of
    time it would take is open-ended and there is  no  guarantee  that  the
    application would be granted immediately without the need  for  her  to
    appeal.  It was submitted on her behalf that  in  these  circumstances,
    given especially that it is not suggested that there is any reason  why
    permission should not ultimately be granted it would be unduly harsh to
    require her to return for the purpose of making  her  application  from
    outside the UK.

10. On  behalf  of  the  respondent  Ms  Everett's  submissions  were  also
    commendably brief.  She submitted simply that the interference would be
    proportionate; the couple could not at the time of application meet the
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  also  it  had  been  the
    appellant's original intention to return and apply for entry  clearance
    from abroad.  There was no reason why she could not be supported by her
    husband and the hardship would be justified in this case by the need to
    enforce the Immigration Rules.   The  couple  knew  at  the  time  they
    decided to get married that  the  appellant's  immigration  status  was
    precarious and they had married in the knowledge of that status.

Discussion

11. There has been a considerable academic discussion as to the effects  of
    the  recent  changes  in  the  Immigration   Rules   with   regard   to
    consideration of whether or not to require the removal of an  applicant
    such as the appellant in this case would be in breach  of  his  or  her
    Article 8 rights.  I can  summarise  the  provisions  very  briefly  by
    stating that the effect of the new rules in a case such as the  present
    is that it will be in breach of an applicant's Article 8 rights if as a
    result of a requirement to return to his or her home country to make an
    application from abroad this requirement could be said  to  be  "unduly
    harsh".  The requirement  for  this  appellant  to  return  is  "harsh"
    because  it  will   greatly   inconvenience   her.    Whether   it   is
    "unjustifiably" or "unduly" harsh can only be assessed by balancing the
    adverse consequences to her against the need to  maintain  a  fair  and
    effective system of immigration control.  In my judgment the changes to
    the Rules do not substantively alter the guidance given by the Court of
    Appeal in Hayat which is as already noted above to the effect that in a
    case such as this where the only reason for requiring an  applicant  to
    leave the country to make an  application  from  abroad  is  to  ensure
    compliance  with  the  rules  for  their  own   sake   this   will   be
    disproportionate unless "there is a sensible reason for doing so".

12.  Of  course  the  Immigration  Rules  must  be  enforced   fairly   and
    consistently but this should be done by having regard in every case  to
    whether a  rigid  adherence  to  the  letter  of  the  rules  would  be
    proportionate.  In my judgement, on the facts of this particular  case,
    it would not.  The requirement for this appellant to return to her home
    country in order to apply from there for entry clearance  can  only  be
    for the purpose of ensuring technical compliance  with  the  rules,  it
    being accepted that the financial  and  other  requirements  under  the
    Rules are now satisfied (even though they were not at the time  of  the
    original application).  However (and I find) the consequences  to  this
    couple of being forced to disrupt their lives  to  such  a  significant
    extent,  with  such  large  financial   and   emotional   consequences,
    significantly  outweigh  the  benefit  to  the  public  of  the  strict
    enforcement  of  the  Rules   such   that   such   a   requirement   is
    disproportionate in this case.  In light of  this  finding  it  follows
    that this appeal must be allowed and I so find.



Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds Article 8.
