DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellants against the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Agnew after a hearing on 13 August  2014  which  dismissed
   the Appellants' appeals against a refusal of the first Appellant's  claim
   for asylum and the decision to remove the Appellants from the UK.
Background
3. The Appellant are a husband and wife and their daughter nationals of  Sri
   Lanka.
4. The Appellants are Tamils. The Appellant's claim was in essence that  his
   brother joined the LTTE in 1998 and he last  saw  him  in  2002.  Another
   brother joined the LTTE in 2002 and was actively involved  until  he  was
   killed in 2006. The  Appellant  was  a  Credit  Manager  for  a  bank  in
   Batticaloa and was privy to transactions involving loans paid to the LTTE
   from Tamil Rehabilitation  Organisation  funds.  The  Appellant  and  his
   colleagues at the bank provided details of this to the CID. The Appellant
   was promoted and was transferred to work in Dubai  from  2007  -2013  and
   travelled freely between the two countries and had no problems  with  the
   authorities. In 2013 the Appellant's grandmother was told his brother was
   still alive and contacted the Appellant who was in the United Kingdom  to
   return to find him which the Appellant did in October 2013. The Appellant
   was detained at his home and taken to another place where he was  beaten,
   abused and questioned  about  his  involvement  with  the  LTTE.  He  was
   detained for 6 days and beaten to his back and struck with a hot iron. He
   was released unofficially after his father paid ï¿½10,000 and had to report
   weekly to the Sri Lankan Intelligence HQ. The Appellant fled the next day
   to the United Kingdom and fears that he is at risk as someone believed to
   be a member of or involved with the LTTE.
5. On 31 October 2013 the Appellant applied for asylum.
6. On  30  April  2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter gave a number of  reasons  which  can  be
   summarised in this way:
   a) The Appellant's claim that his brother who had been a  member  of  the
      LTTE was missing was not corroborated by the document  produced  which
      was unreliable due to inconsistencies.
   b) The claim that his other brother died fighting for  the  LTTE  is  not
      supported by the documents produced which are inconsistent as  to  the
      cause of death.
   c) It is therefore  not  accepted  that  the  Appellant's  brothers  were
      members of the LTTE.
   d) The fact that the Appellant returned to  Sri  Lanka  on  10  occasions
      between 2007 -2013 was inconsistent with his claim to be  of  interest
      to the authorities.
   e) The Appellant's suggestion his friendship with a police officer  ,  an
      Inspector, protected him from national security  or  the  intelligence
      services was not credible.
   f) The fresh wounds to the Appellant's back and fading scars on his  arms
      when he was photographed after claiming asylum were not  supported  by
      medical  evidence  to  indicate  how  the  scarring  was  caused.  The
      Appellant also made no reference in his oral or  written  accounts  to
      damage to his arms while in captivity.
   g) The Appellant's claim to have only been questioned about his pre  2007
      activities is inconsistent with the CG case of GJ  and  Others  (post-
      civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT  (IAC)  which  suggests
      that the interest of the authorities is focused on the  current  Tamil
      diaspora who are  working  for  Tamil  separatism  and  therefore  the
      Appellant would not be of interest and he does not come within any  of
      the risk categories.
   h) The Appellant's account of how he left Sri Lanka is inconsistent  with
      the background material.
   i) The Appellant would not be of interest as  a  returned  failed  asylum
      seeker.


The Judge's Decision
7. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Agnew ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
   decision. The Judge found :
   (a)In determining whether the scars that the Appellant bore on  his  body
   were caused by torture as he claimed the  Judge  took  into  account  the
   medical report of Professor Lingam dated 11 August 2014 produced  by  the
   Appellant. She noted that the Professor acknowledged that  he  could  not
   differentiate between wounds inflicted deliberately and wounds  inflicted
   by torture.
   (b) She concluded therefore that she had to consider the possibility that
   the scars were so called 'self inflicted by proxy' (paragraph 26)
   (c) She noted that there was no evidence from the  hospital  who  treated
   the Appellant on  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  that  may  have
   identified  injuries  resulting  from  what  the  Appellant  claimed  was
   extensive beatings over a period of days and that the Professor  did  not
   identify any  other  injuries  resulting  from  what  the  Appellant  had
   described as an extensive beating over a series of  days  or  comment  on
   whether he would have expected to see such evidence. She did not find his
   report thorough or helpful.
   (d)She found that Dr Persauds psychiatric report and  diagnosis  of  PTSD
   was  underpinned  by  an  acceptance  that  the  Appellant  had  honestly
   recounted his history.
   (e)  She  found  that  although  the  Tribunal  had  directed  that   the
   Appellant's GP records should be provided none had been lodged.
   (f) In relation to documents produced the Judge identified  a  number  of
   discrepancies between the documents and the Appellant's  account  between
   Paragraphs 38-49 such that she seriously doubted the authenticity of  the
   document.
   (g) She identified other inconsistencies in his evidence at  50-52  which
   undermined the Appellant's credibility.
   (h) She did not find it credible that the Appellant would not know  where
   or how his father got the money to pay the bribe to  secure  his  release
   and was unable to evidence the existence and withdrawal of the funds.
   (i) She did not find it credible  that  the  Appellant  would  have  been
   brought from the United Kingdom  t  search  for  his  brother  given  the
   distance and his claim that his father had powerful  friends  who  helped
   secure his release from prison.
   (j) She did not find it credible that the  authorities  would  wait  till
   2013 to go after the Appellant when he had visited the country  regularly
   over the previous 7 years. She could find no basis for the authorities in
   viewing him as someone who presented a risk to  the  unitary  Sri  Lankan
   state or government and found that he did not fall into any of  the  risk
   categories of the country guidance.


8. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that  the  Judges  conclusion  that
   the scars were caused by SIBP was procedurally  unfair  and  was  not  in
   accordance with the guidance set out in KV (scarring - medical  evidence)
   [2014] UKUT 230 and he was denied the opportunity to address her concerns
   about  causation;  that  the  Judge  erred  in  her  assessment  of   the
   documentary evidence; that  the  Judge's  findings  on  credibility  were
   irrational; that the Judges assessment  of  the  psychiatric  report  was
   fundamentally flawed .
9. On 8 January 2015 Upper Tribunal Judge Coker gave  permission  to  appeal
   on all grounds.

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Paramjorthy on behalf of  the
   Appellant that :

   a) He relied on the grounds as drafted.

   b) The guidance of KV was that if there were  presenting  features  there
      could be a finding of SIBP.

   c) In the absence of such presenting  features  and  the  Respondent  not
      having raised the issue in the refusal letter or indeed in the hearing
      the Judge's concerns about SIBP should have been put to the  Appellant
      to enable him to discharge the burden of proof clinically or otherwise
      and it was procedurally unfair not to do so.

   d) This finding was such a pivotal issue in relation to  credibility  and
      risk on return and was so central to his claim that this error tainted
      the whole of the decision and he asked for the case to be remitted for
      re hearing.




11. On behalf of the Respondent  Ms Johnstone submitted that :

   a) Professor Lingam raised the issue of SIBP himself.

   b) The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant's scars had  occurred
      in the way he claimed.

   c) The Judge was entitled to reach the conclusions that she did.

   d) In relation  to  the  refusal  to  adjourn  the  Appellant's  had  had
      sufficient time to prepare the case.




Finding on Material Error

12. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made a material errors of law.

13. A central feature of the Appellant's claim to be at risk on  return  was
   that he had been the victim of torture at the hands  of  the  Sri  Lankan
   authorities shortly before his arrival in the United Kingdom  in  October
   2013. The refusal letter referred to the scars  but  made  no  suggestion
   that they were as a result of SIBP. At the hearing on 13 August  2014  it
   is accepted that neither the Judge nor the Home Office Presenting Officer
   suggested to the Appellant that his scars were as a result  of  SIBP  but
   that the Judge found as a fact at paragraph 68 that the scars were  as  a
   result of SIBP.

14. The Appellant produced an expert report from Professor Lingam  dated  11
   August 2014. The conclusion  of  the  report  was  that  the  scars  were
   diagnostic of burns  and at page 10 that he 'found no reason  to  dispute
   the history provided by the patient .' The only possible reference to the
   SIBP is at page 9 of the report where he states:

   "Secondly , I considered if these were caused  deliberately  to  mislead.
   There is no way  I  could  scientifically  differentiate  between  wounds
   inflicted deliberately from the wounds inflicted from the said  torture."



15. The case of KV was relied on by the Appellant in this  case.  The  judge
   purports to summarise the ratio of the case and does so in this way :

   "....Of course the facts were different (referring to KV) but  the  point
   is that it has been accepted and, if more than  a  fanciful  possibility,
   scares caused by SBIP have to be considered as a possibility."

16. I am not satisfied that this summary accurately reflects  the  ratio  of
   KV as the headnote  ,  following  what  is  said  in  paragraph  286  and
   following, states:
      "Where there is a presenting feature of the  case  that  raises  self-
      infliction by proxy (SIBP) as a more than fanciful possibility of  the
      explanation for scarring:-


   i) a medical report adduced on behalf of a claimant will be  expected  to
      engage with that issue; it cannot eliminate  a priori or routinely the
      possibility of SIBP; and


      (ii)  a judicial fact-finder will be expected to address  the  matter,
      compatibly with procedural fairness, in deciding whether, on  all  the
      evidence, the claimant has discharged the burden of proving that he or
      she was reasonably likely to have been scarred  by  torturers  against
      his or her  will. " (my bold)

17. In this case the medical report did not identify any presenting  feature
   that made SIBP more than a fanciful possibility. I am satisfied that that
   the Judge was entitled to  consider  SIBP  of  her  own  motion  had  she
   identified the presenting feature of the Appellant's account that led  to
   her consideration but given what is said at paragraphs 298 and 300 of  KV
   she was then obliged  to  allow  the  Appellant  to  address  this  as  a
   possibility:

   "298 So far as concerns tribunal judges dealing with appeals, we consider
   that the head note in RR recognises the importance, in order to guarantee
   a fair hearing, of ensuring that an appellant has an opportunity to  deal
   with allegations that an injury has been "not caused in the  way  alleged
   by the appellant but by a different mechanism

   300 We do not exclude either, subject to the parties being  given  proper
   opportunity to address the matter, that a tribunal might want to  explore
   with a claimant and the parties  the  possibility  of  SIBP  of  its  own
   motion. It follows from what we  have  said  earlier  that  this  is  not
   something a tribunal should do lightly: it would require there to be some
   presenting feature, as described earlier. "

18. I do not propose  to  address  the  remaining  grounds  advanced  by  Mr
   Paramjorthy because I  accept  that  there  is  a  possibility  that  the
   remainder of the Judges findings on  credibility  were  infected  by  the
   error relating to a central feature of his claim.

19. I therefore found that error of law have been established and  that  the
   Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set aside in its entirety.
   All matters to be redetermined afresh.

20. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal  Practice  Statement
   of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be remitted to the First  Tier
   Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:
    (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the First-
   tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that party's
   case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

   (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary
   in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that,
   having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to
   remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

21. In this case I have determined that the case should be remitted  because
   the Appellant did not have a fair hearing due to the failure to allow him
   to address teh issue of SBIP. In this case none of the findings  of  fact
   are to stand and the matter will be a complete re hearing.

22. I consequently remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal  sitting
   at Manchester to be heard on a date to be fixed by  the  Tribunal  before
   me.

23. I made the following directions for the resumed hearing:

       . The case is to be listed for 4 hours

       . A Tamil interpreter is required.

       . Any additional medical  evidence  relating  to  the  issue  of  the
         Appellant's treatment on arrival in the United Kingdom or  SBIP  to
         be served on all parties 5 days before the resumed hearing.
