Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kerr, Karis Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst this is an appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  for  convenience  I  will  refer  to  the  parties  in  the
    determination as they appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant, a  national  of  Albania,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 16 June 2014
    to refuse his application for leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his
    private and family life in the UK with his British citizen partner  and
    to remove him from the  UK.  A  First-tier  Tribunal  panel  comprising
    Designated Judge David Taylor and First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Manyarara
    allowed the  appeal  and  the  Secretary  of  State  now  appeals  with
    permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The panel  identified  the  issue  to  be  determined  as  whether  the
    appellant and his partner (herein the sponsor) had been living together
    in a relationship akin to marriage for at least two years and,  if  so,
    whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  relocation  to  Albania
    [8]. On the basis of the oral evidence before them the panel found that
    the appellant and his partner began a relationship in May 2010 and that
    they began to live together in a relationship akin to marriage  in  the
    sponsor's parents' home in January 2011, a period of almost four  years
    at the date of the hearing.  The  panel  accepted  that  the  sponsor's
    mother  has  health  problems,  that  the  sponsor  provides  her  with
    practical assistance which could not be provided  by  anyone  else  and
    that there  are  therefore  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
    between the appellant and the sponsor continuing outside  the  UK.  The
    panel therefore found  that  the  appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM with reference to Ex 1 and allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules. The panel also considered Article 8 and  found  that
    it would be a disproportionate interference with the appellant's family
    life to require the appellant to leave the UK to  make  an  application
    for entry clearance to return to the UK to join the appellant.

 4. The Secretary of State contends in the grounds of appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal that the panel erred in its consideration of Ex 1 of  Appendix
    FM in that the difficulties listed  by  the  panel  do  not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles. It is further contended that the panel  erred
    in consideration of Article 8 in that it failed to identify exceptional
    reasons for departing from the Immigration Rules. It is contended  that
    the panel further erred  in  failing  to  consider  the  provisions  of
    section 117A and 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 in weighing the public interest.

 5. Mr Melvin indicated that he did not challenge  the  findings  of  fact.
    However  he  submitted  that  the  panel  applied  the  wrong  test  in
    considering whether there are 'insurmountable obstacles' to the  family
    life between the appellant and his partner continuing  outside  the  UK
    under Ex 1 of Appendix FM. At the hearing before me Mr  Melvin  further
    submitted that the panel had erred in failing to make any finding as to
    whether the appellant met the eligibility requirements of  Appendix  FM
    in light of the fact that he does not have entry clearance.  Mr  Melvin
    submitted that the panel erred in its consideration  of  Article  8  in
    failing to consider section 117.

 6. Mr  Kerr  submitted  that  the  appellant  does  meet  the  eligibility
    requirements of Appendix FM.  He  submitted  that  the  panel  properly
    applied the test in Ex 1. He accepted that the panel did  not  set  out
    the conditions in section 117 in considering Article  8  but  submitted
    that this is not material given that the appeal was allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Error of Law

 7. The requirements for limited Leave to Remain as a partner are  set  out
    in Appendix FM paragraph R-LTRP.1.1 as follows;

         R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to  remain
         as a partner are-

             (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;

             (b) the applicant must  have  made  a  valid  application  for
             limited or indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either



             (c) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under  Section
             S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

                  (ii) the  applicant  meets  all  of  the  requirements  of
                  Section E-LTRP: Eligibility  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
                  partner; or

             (d) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under  Section
             S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

                  (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-
                  LTRP.1.2-1.12. and ELTRP.2.1.; and

                  (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.

 8. Ex 1 provides;

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

          a) (i) the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with a child who-

                      (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was  under  the
                      age of 18 years when the applicant was first  granted
                      leave on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                      (bb) is in the UK;

                      (cc) is a British Citizen or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least  the  7  years  immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

                  (ii) it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                  leave the UK; or

             (b) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are   insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

 9. Mr Melvin contended that in order to meet the eligibility  requirements
    the appellant had to have been granted entry clearance. He referred  in
    particular to E-LTRP1.12 which provides;

         "The applicant's partner cannot be  the  applicant's  fianc�(e)  or
         proposed civil partner, unless  the  applicant  was  granted  entry
         clearance as that person's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner".

10. However the appellant in this case does not claim to  be  a  fianc�  or
    proposed civil partner. He claims to be, and was found by the panel  to
    be, 'a person who has been living together  with  the  applicant  in  a
    relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at  least  two
    years prior to the date of application' within Gen 1.2 (iv). E-LTRP1.12
    was considered by the Secretary of State in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    letter after the Secretary of State found that the  appellant  had  not
    shown that he was living with the appellant in a relationship  akin  to
    marriage. The panel found that he had been living with the sponsor  for
    almost four years and accordingly the requirement at E-LTRP1.12 did not
    apply. Accordingly the panel did not err in its  consideration  of  the
    eligibility requirements.

11. In relation to Ex 1 the panel said at paragraph 44 that it  found  that
    there  are  'insurmountable  obstacles'  to  family  life  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor continuing outside the UK  because  of  three
    factors. These are the  level  and  nature  of  care  required  by  the
    sponsor's parents and their ongoing reliance on the sponsor;  the  fact
    that there is no-one the sponsor can turn  to  for  assistance  as  any
    alternative option is  not  without  difficulty;  and  the  significant
    issues that the sponsor's sister deals with  in  relation  to  her  own
    child's  mental  health  conditions  as  well  as  the  care   of   her
    grandchildren. The panel went on  to  conclude  at  paragraph  45  that
    'there are significant difficulties in relation to  the  sponsor  being
    able to follow the appellant to Albania, and this would thereby  entail
    hardship'. The respondent contends that this final  sentence  indicates
    that the panel applied the wrong  test.  However  this  sentence  is  a
    direct application of the wording of Ex 2 which defines 'insurmountable
    obstacles'. Further, the panel made a clear  finding  at  paragraph  44
    that there are insurmountable obstacles and gave the reasons  for  that
    finding. Paragraph 45 is simply a further explanation  of  the  reasons
    for that finding applying the definition in Ex 2.

12. I am satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  properly  considered  all
    relevant provisions of Appendix FM including Ex 1 and reached  reasoned
    findings which were open to the panel on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before it.

13. Mr Kerr properly accepted that the First-tier Tribunal  panel  did  not
    set out the considerations in section 117  in  considering  Article  8.
    However this is not a material error in this case as, having found that
    the appeal  was  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  was  not
    necessary for the panel to go on to consider Article 8 at all.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
