Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Peterson of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 6th January  1983.   He
    seeks to appeal against the respondent's decision dated 2nd  June  2013
    refusing to vary his existing leave to remain in the United Kingdom  so
    as to become a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His application was made
    on 27th March 2013.

2.   The appeal came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Fletcher-
    Hill on 4th November 2013.   The  appeal  was  dismissed.   Grounds  of
    appeal were submitted contending  in  particular  that  the  judge  had
    failed  to  apply  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  of   Rodriquez
    (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042  (IAC).   Leave  to  appeal  was
    granted on that basis.

3.   It is perhaps helpful to consider the refusal letter of 2nd June  2013.
     This perhaps highlights the areas of particular  concern.   The  first
    area is whether or not the appellant has provided correct evidence   to
    show access to funds of ï¿½50,000 being made available to him by a  third
    party.

4.   There is a letter from Alfalah Ltd; a declaration from Mr  Amir  Hassan
    and a letter from Mr Faisal Baloch.  It is said that the bank letter is
    not acceptable because it does not include the full  address  including
    the postcode of Mr Amir Hassan.   The  bank  statement  that  has  been
    provided is not acceptable because it is for  an  account  not  in  the
    appellant's name as required by paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(4) of Appendix A
    of the Immigration Rules.  It also said that  the  account  is  with  a
    financial institution not based in the United Kingdom and regulated  by
    the Financial Services Authority.

5.   A reply is made that it is apparent from the  bank  statement  that  is
    submitted with the letter from the Branch Manager that the  address  of
    Mr Hassan is clearly shown.  Issue was taken that  the  respondent  was
    incorrect to find that the  bank  was  not  one  that  was  within  the
    authorised banks.

6.    Reliance  is  placed   upon   the   evidential   flexibility   policy,
    particularly as now enshrined within paragraph 245AA of the Immigration
    Rules.

7.   It is said that that should apply to documents submitted where one  out
    of a sequence is missing or is in a wrong format or  does  not  contain
    all the  specified  information.   It  was  argued  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant that such admissions as identified in the financial documents
    fell well within the policy as envisaged.

8.   The next issue relates  to  the  documents  that  are  required  to  be
    provided as set out in particular by the Immigration Rules under 41-SD,
    in particular 41-SD(c) and following.  That requires  in  essence  that
    the appellant provide the following:-

    (1)  his job title;


    (2)   the  standard  occupation  classification  (SOC)  code   of   the
         occupation that the appellant is working in which  must  appear  on
         the  list  of  occupations  skilled  to   national   qualifications
         framework level 4 or above (codes of practice in Appendix J);


    (3)  one or more of the following documents including, in particular in
         this case,  advertising  or  marketing  material  which  shows  the
         appellant's name (and the name  of  the  business  if  applicable),
         together with the business activity; and


    (4)  one or more contracts showing trading.  The  contracts  must  show
         the appellant's name and name of the business, the service provided
         by the appellant's business and the name  of  the  other  party  or
         parties involved  in  the  contract  and  their  contract  details,
         including their full address, postal code,  landline  phone  number
         and any e-mail address.

9.   Ms Peterson, in her skeleton argument, seeks to argue  that  all  those
    documents and details were provided.  Unfortunately, the website  which
    was the matter dealing with advertising or marketing  material  was  in
    its early stages and did not contain as required the  appellant's  name
    or the business activity.

10.  Once again, she submits that that was a deficiency which was  corrected
    and had the respondent checked the website immediately prior to  making
    the decision, those details would be on it.   She  submits  once  again
    that it is a matterwithin the evidential flexibility policy  that  such
    detail could have been requested.  In any event  it  was  apparent  she
    submits from the other material that was submitted what  was  his  name
    and name of the business.

11.  Reliance is placed  in  particular  upon  the  contract  as  originally
    submitted.  It was not a particularly detailed contract.  It is  to  be
    seen within the respondent's bundle of documents.

12.  It makes it clear that Itravelz Ltd agreed to act as a sales  agent  to
    Noble Travel Ltd.  The purpose  was  to  provide  business  development
    support in purchasing and selling tickets  via  the  consultancy.   The
    contractor, that is Itravelz Ltd, would be paid commission for the sale
    of the tickets.  There was a restriction clause imposed  at  that  time
    that services would only be provided to Noble Travel Ltd, although that
    restriction was lifted in a subsequent version of the contract.

13.  Thus,  the  services  to  be  provided  were  said  to  be  consultancy
    services, consalidation  and sale of tickets.

14.  The appellant was described as a  Director  of  Itravelz  Ltd  and  the
    other contracting party being Noble Travel Ltd.

15.  The appellant gave his job description as Director of Finance.

16.   Thus  she  submits  that  he  has  provided   his   job   title,   his
    classification, the  advertising  or  marketing  material,  namely  the
    website and the contract that shows his name, the name of the business,
    the service provided and the name of the other parties involved in  the
    contract.

17.  She invites me to find therefore that so far as  the  purposes  of  the
    Rules are concerned that the appellant has done that which is  required
    of him.  The one shortcoming being the website and that  clearly  could
    have been the subject of clarification or request under the  provisions
    of paragraph 245AA.

18.  Mr Deller, who represents the  respondent,  indicated  that  it  was  a
    finely balanced position as to whether or not the omissions  that  were
    highlighted by the Secretary of State in the reasons for  refusal  were
    such that ought to have been the subject of the evidential  flexibility
    policy.  He invites my attention to the wording of paragraph 245AA  and
    to the requirement "may" rather than "must".

19.  He invites my attention however to the  decision  that  was  originally
    issued and to the indication that as the appellant was  applying  under
    provision (d) of Table 4 he is required to demonstrate that he met  the
    following additional criteria, namely:-

         (iv) is engaged in business activity, other than the work necessary
             to administer his business, in an occupation which appears  on
             the list of occupations  skilled  to  national  qualifications
             framework level 4 or above, stating the codes of  practice  in
             Appendix J provides the specified evidence in paragraph 41-SD.



20.  He said that the whole purpose of having an occupation code was for  an
    appellant to demonstrate a particular level of  occupation  and  skill.
    In this case, to demonstrate that he had not  only  the  job  title  of
    Director of Finance, but actually worked as such.  The reality in  this
    case he submits, as was accepted, is that the appellant  was  the  sole
    Director and/or employee of Iltravelz Ltd.  It was effectively his  own
    business and he provided the labour and experience for it.  He  invites
    me to find therefore that it is not appropriate  for  him  to  describe
    himself as Director of Finance, because  essentially  he  is  directing
    nothing but himself.

21.  In that connection it was relevant to note how SOC  code  1131  defined
    Financial Managers and Directors.  It defined it as follows:-

     "Example job tasks - participates in the formulation of  strategic  and
         long-term  business  plans,  assesses  the  implications  for   the
         organisation,   financial    mechanisms    and    oversees    their
         implementation,  plans  external  and  internal  audit  programmes,
         arranges for the collection and analysis  for  counting,  budgetary
         and  related  information,  and  manages  the  company's  financial
         systems; determines  staffing  levels  appropriate  for  accounting
         activities; assesses and  advises  on  factors  affecting  business
         performance."

22.  He submits that what is envisaged within  that  code  is  somebody  who
    manages the business and does not run it as a sole practitioner.

23.  Ms Peterson submits that although the  appellant  is  running  his  own
    business for himself, he is entitled to use the descriptions that  have
    been made.  He is not only an employee but he is  also  a  Director  in
    that he is directing the course of his business.

24.  She takes issue therefore with the finding of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge at paragraph 34 of the determination that the appellant  was  not
    engaged in the business activity at the required level.

25.  She submits that the appellant as an entrepreneur, by the  very  nature
    of being an entrepreneur, would be involved in running his own business
    or company.  She submits  that  his  involvement  in  establishing  the
    company was more than work necessary to administer his business.

26.  She submitted that a strict application of (1)(5) did not exclude  sole
    occupation but rather required a number of skills to  be  met,  one  of
    which she  invites  me  to  find  was  met  by  the  appellant  in  his
    description of Director of Finance.

27.  The statement is made within the reasons for refusal that no  reference
    was made to the appellant's role within the company or an  example  job
    task relating to the title and occupations listed.  Ms  Peterson  seeks
    to argue that was precisely what detail was provided by the  appellant.



28.  In many ways this is an appeal involving a number of technical  issues.
     The difficulty, having considered the  arguments,  is  the  extent  to
    which the issues have been crystallised by either parties.

29.  If the purpose of the coding  is  to  exclude  anyone  who  is  a  sole
    practitioner in the business,  then  perhaps  that  needs  to  be  more
    clearly stated.  Although the phrase:-

         "are engaged in business activity, other than the work necessary to
         administer his business, in an occupation which appears on the list
         of occupations skilled to national qualifications framework level 4
         or above"

     is stated in the decision, that does not seem to have been followed  up
    because the decision maker then talks about a lack of role  within  the
    company or job task.

30.  The Judge in the  determination  clearly  touches  upon  the  issue  in
    paragraph 34, then seems to expand upon  the  matter  in  paragraph  35
    speaking about income.

31.  So far as the evidential flexibility policy is concerned  as  enshrined
    in paragraph 245AA, it does not automatically follow  either  that  the
    appellant must be told where documents are in the wrong format  or  the
    authorities to request the correct documents.

32.  However, the matters as  set  out  in  245AA(d)  are  perhaps  of  some
    relevance.  It seems that even  if  the  specified  document  has  been
    submitted in the wrong format or does not  contain  all  the  specified
    information, if  the  missing  information  is  verifiable  from  other
    documents, the application may be granted exceptionally. In one  sense,
    although the address of Mr Hassan was missing from the letter,  it  was
    apparent from other documents.  It does seem  that  that  discretionary
    aspect of the Rule has not been considered as to whether or not it  has
    application.

33.  Looking at the decision letter it does seem to me that perhaps  various
    strands of this matter have not been approached quite with the  clarity
    of decision that might be expected, particularly in the light of 245AA.



34.  I find the Immigration Judge, although attempting to deal with  certain
    of the matters, has not perhaps dealt with others and that there  is  a
    lack of definition in the overall conclusions that  have  been  arrived
    at.  In those circumstances it seems that as a matter more of  fairness
    and justice I shall set the decision aside.

35.  I find that the original decision letter has significant  omissions  in
    it and lack of precision within it, such as not  to  be  safely  relied
    upon.  I find, therefore, that it is not in accordance  with  the  law,
    such that it should be reconsidered and if need be remade.

36.  In the circumstances therefore the appeal is  allowed  to  the  limited
    extent  that  the  appellant's  appeal  should  be  sent  back  to  the
    respondent for further consideration and decision upon it.
