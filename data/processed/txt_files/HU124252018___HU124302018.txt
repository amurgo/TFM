Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Alam, Counsel instructed by 12 Bridge
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent refused the application for leave to  remain  which  had
    been made by the Appellants on 24 May 2017.  They are a mother and son,
    the son now being almost 12 years old.   The  1st  Appellant's  husband
    came here lawfully for the purposes of work. There is an adult son also
    within the family who has a separate application for leave  to  remain.
    These Appellants had arrived in the United Kingdom on 8 October 2014 to
    join the 1st Appellant's husband.

 2. The appeal against the refusal of  the  application  was  dismissed  by
    Judge Aujla sitting at Taylor House on 8 January 2019.   Permission  to
    appeal against that decision was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Smith
    on 11 March 2019.

 3. The basis of the grant of permission was that it is arguable  that  the
    judge has erred in failing to consider the financial  position  of  the
    family as at the date of the hearing.  Judge Smith went on to say  that
    whilst this might not enable the family to meet the Rules based on  the
    date of application, it is arguably material to the overall  assessment
    outside the Rules (having particular regard to Section 117B).  She went
    on to  say  that  she  accepts  that  the  error  in  this  regard  (if
    established) may not be material because the 1st Appellant still  fails
    the English language requirement, but it is for  me  to  determine  the
    position as regards materiality.

 4. The Respondent did not file a Rule 24 notice.  Ms Jones placed reliance
    upon the decision and argued that the judge did not materially  err  in
    any respect.  As the English language requirement had not been  met  by
    the 1st Appellant, the case fell apart because the Rules were  not  met
    irrespective of income requirements.

 5. Mr Alam argued that the judge did err in not looking at the evidence as
    at the date of the hearing as this was a human  rights  appeal.  Whilst
    the 1st Appellant and her husband did not  have  adequate  income  when
    combined, they were placing reliance on the income of the adult son  to
    enable them to meet the relevant requirements.  The 2nd Appellant  does
    not have to meet the  English  language  requirements.  If  his  appeal
    succeeds, then that is relevant in relation to the 1st Appellant.   The
    Article 8 assessment was inadequate because of the  lack  of  reference
    to,  or  consideration  of,  s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship,   and
    Immigration Act 2009.

 6. Ms Jones in response argued that this  was  ill-conceived  as  the  2nd
    Appellant has only been here for 4 years.  He was 7 when he arrived and
    he is now  11.   He  is  not  a  British  citizen.   It  would  be  the
    expectation that he would stay with  his  mother.   There  was  nothing
    exceptional in this case.  There was sufficient within the decision  to
    show that s55 considerations were borne in mind because the  judge  was
    aware of the child's position.

Judge Aujla's decision

 7. It is noted at [12] that as regards  financial  requirements,  reliance
    was placed on the income of the 1st Appellant's adult son.   The  judge
    sets out the legal framework from [15  to  17]  and  notes  that  human
    rights issues are considered at the date of hearing. He makes  specific
    reference to s117 of the Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act  2002
    and the various considerations within that.  He notes  the  burden  and
    standard of proof in relation  to  human  rights  appeals.   The  judge
    summarises the financial information that was before him and  the  oral
    evidence and submissions.

 8. In the findings section, the judge notes at [27] that the Appellant did
    not challenge the calculations set out  in  the  Respondent's  decision
    letter which were based on the pay slips submitted by  the  Appellants.
    The judge went  on  to  identify  at  [28]  that  the  1st  Appellant's
    husband's weekly income fell short by ï¿½55.93 per week which meant  that
    the family would qualify for a contribution from Universal  Credit  and
    that therefore public funds were required.  At [29] the judge noted the
    reliance on the adult son to make up the shortfall.   The  judge  found
    that he was not part of the family unit, and his finances should not be
    taken into account as he was an independent adult and  not  responsible
    for maintaining his mother and sibling but only responsible for himself
    even though he lived as part of the  family.   The  judge  went  on  to
    therefore  find  that  the  Rules  were  not  met  as   the   financial
    requirements were not met.  The judge went on at [30] to  consider  the
    English language requirement and the lack of medical evidence  to  show
    that the 1st Appellant could not  undertake  the  relevant  test.   The
    judge therefore found that the Respondent's findings were open to  them
    on the evidence and were valid and sustainable at [31].

 9. At [32] the judge decided that there were no exceptional  circumstances
    to justify overlooking these requirements of the Rules.  He  said  that
    the family knew that they could only qualify for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain if they met the Rules.  The judge noted the requirements  to  be
    considered under s117 of the 2002 Act.  He noted that  the  ability  to
    speak English is a public interest consideration.

10. The judge at [33] noted that the English language requirement  did  not
    apply to the 2nd Appellant but  the  financial  requirement  did.   The
    judge dismissed the appeals.

Discussion

11. The judge was entitled to find that, in relation to the 1st  Appellant,
    the Rules were not met as the English language requirement had not been
    met and there was no cogent evidence of her inability to learn English.



12. I am satisfied that the judge  materially  erred  in  relation  to  the
    financial assessment of the family for the following reason. The  adult
    brother had always lived with the Appellants. Even though he  was  over
    18 (at the date of hearing he was 20), there is no bright  line  as  to
    when a young person is no longer to be  considered  part  of  a  family
    household.

13. In relation to the 2nd Appellant,  if  his  older  brother's  financial
    position was incorporated into the finances of the family  such  as  to
    mean the family would not be reliant on public funds, then he  met  the
    Rules and when looking at Article 8 through the prism of the Rules, his
    appeal could have been allowed.

14. The  fact  that  the  2nd  Appellant  may  have  met  the  Rules  is  a
    circumstance that should have been taken into account when  considering
    whether there were compelling circumstances such as to  mean  that  the
    1st Appellant's appeal could have been considered  outside  the  Rules.
    It was argued by Ms Jones that the 2nd Appellant should stay  with  the
    1st Appellant in the normal course of events.  I do not  agree  because
    if he met the Rules and wished to stay here with his father, then  that
    is a factor that should have been considered within the  assessment  of
    whether or not compelling circumstances existed for the  1st  Appellant
    to be able to stay as well.  There is no assessment anywhere within the
    decision of the impact on the 2nd Appellant of separation  from  either
    of his parents and possibly his brother.  I do not agree that  the  s55
    assessment in relation to the  2nd  Appellant  is  implied  within  the
    decision.  There  is  nothing  in  the  decision  that  looks  at  what
    circumstances he would face in Turkey.  I am  satisfied  that  the  s55
    assessment was inadequate as that is a factor that must  be  considered
    on the 1st Appellant's human rights appeal.

15. I am therefore satisfied that the judge materially erred in relation to
    the assessment of the family finances and the impact that  had  on  the
    2nd Appellant as to whether he met the Rules.  I am also satisfied that
    it also adversely impacted on the assessment as to  whether  compelling
    circumstances existed such as  to  mean  Article  8  could  be  met  in
    relation to both Appellants.  I am satisfied that these errors are such
    that they amount to material errors of law.

16. Having heard submissions from both representatives I am satisfied  that
    it is appropriate to remit the matter to the First-tier  Tribunal  with
    no findings being preserved as the core financial and  s55  assessments
    have not been done.

17. I direct that the matter be remitted to be heard at  Taylor  House  not
    before Judge Aujla.

18. No anonymity direction is made.
