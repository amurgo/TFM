                            DECISION AND REASONS


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. M Biggs, Counsel, instructed by ATM Law
Solicitors

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  The  respondent,  whom  I
    shall refer to as 'the claimant', has  previously  been  successful  on
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal in challenging a decision by  the
    Secretary of  State  to  refuse  to  grant  him  settlement  under  the
    Immigration Rules on article 8 (long residence) grounds.  The  decision
    of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Oliver ('the Judge')  was  sent  to
    the parties on 27 September 2019.

 2. By a decision dated 27  February  2020  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Canavan
    granted the Secretary of State permission to appeal on all grounds.

Remote hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at  Field
    House. The hearing room and the building were open to the  public.  The
    hearing and its start time  were  listed  in  the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in exactly the same way as if we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

 4. The  parties  agreed  that  all  relevant  documents  were  before  the
    Tribunal.  The   video   and   audio   link   connected   between   the
    representatives throughout the hearing. There was a short  period  when
    the link to Field House broke down. Upon the link being resumed between
    myself and the representatives I identified the point at which  contact
    had been lost and requested that submissions recommence from this point
    in time. At the conclusion of the hearing both parties confirmed at the
    hearing had been completed fairly.

 5. The claimant remotely attended the hearing. No  member  of  the  public
    joined the hearing remotely or attended Field House.

Anonymity

 6. The Judge did not issue an anonymity direction and no request was  made
    by either party for such direction to be issued.

Background

 7. The claimant is a national of India who is now aged 38. He  arrived  in
    this country as a student on 19 September  2007.  He  made  an  in-time
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study  Work)
    Migrant and was granted such leave, with subsequent variation until  14
    March 2016. On 10 March 2016 the claimant applied for indefinite  leave
    to  remain  ('ILR')  as  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.  Before   this
    application was considered by  the  Secretary  of  State  the  claimant
    varied the application on 31 October 2017 to a human rights application
    seeking ILR on the basis of long residence in the United Kingdom  under
    paragraph 276C of the Immigration Rules ('the Rules').

 8. By means of a decision dated 23 January 2018  the  Secretary  of  State
    refused the application under  paragraph  276D  of  the  Rules  as  the
    claimant was determined not  to  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    276B(ii)(c) and 276B(iii) of the Rules,  with  reference  to  paragraph
    322(5).

 9. The Secretary of State reasoned, inter alia:

         'In  considering  your  application,  information   regarding   the
         earnings you have claimed to  the  Home  Office  as  part  of  your
         previous  Tier  1  applications  were  compared  with   information
         provided by her Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs  (HMRC)  regarding
         earnings you declared to them for the 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12 and
         2012/13 tax years.

         You submitted a Tier 1 (General) Migrant application for  leave  to
         remain on  04  February  2011.  In  this  application  you  claimed
         �40,948.06 in earnings over  the  period  01  January  2010  to  31
         December 2010, and you were awarded points based  on  this  income.
         You claim that these earnings were from  salaried  employment  with
         PLV enterprises, �8,096.91 for the period 01 May 2010 to 31December
         2010, with Tesco Stores Ltd. �8,336.50 for the  period  01  January
         2010 to 31 December 2010 and with UHSU �4,966.65 for the period  01
         January 2010 to 31  May  2010.  You  also  claimed  self-employment
         earnings of �19,548.00 for the period 01 June 2010 to  31  December
         2010.

         Your application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant
         was supported by a covering letter dated 12 January 2011 written by
         your accountant, MSCO. In paragraph  two  and  three  of  the  said
         letter your accountant stated: 'A short set of accounts  have  been
         prepared, showing gross taxable income for the period 1  June  2010
         to 31 December 2010 to be �19,548.' 'Therefore, we can  state  that
         the  total  taxable  gross  income  for  the  last   seven   months
         (01/06/2010 to 31/12/2010) for the client is �19,548.'

         The claim period falls into the 2010/11 tax year.

         HMRC data shows that for the tax year 2010/11 your PAYE  income  is
         as you have declared.

         However, HMRC data shows that you declared on your  self-assessment
         tax return for 2010/11 that you had a  turnover  of  �2,000  and  a
         profit of �948.00,  but  you  declared  self-employment  profit  of
         �19,548.00 for the 7 months period 01 June 2010 to 31 December 2011
         when you applied for further leave to remain.

         You were invited to and attended an interview on 10 April  2017  as
         part of the consideration of your Tier 1 (General)  application  on
         10 April 2017. In response to question 37, you stated that due to a
         discovered discrepancy, in 2016 you submitted an amended tax return
         to  HMRC  for  the  tax  year  2010/11.  You  explained  that  this
         discrepancy was due to an entry error  by  yourself  and  that  you
         submitted the amended tax return after you had  had  your  previous
         tax returns checked by an accountant.

         When question further in this regard by the  interviewing  officer,
         you stated that the error was because you  had  completed  the  tax
         return yourself and it was a human error and that you  are  not  an
         expert in accountancy.

         Your explanation that  you  have  provided  for  your  amended  tax
         returns have not been accepted. As your self-employed earnings form
         part of your combined income, it is considered that she would  have
         ensured your documentation would have been accurate  in  order  for
         your tax return to be submitted.'

10. The claimant appealed against this decision to the First-tier  Tribunal
    and his appeal was initially allowed by a  decision  of  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal O'Garro, dated 18 October 2018.  The  Secretary  of
    State was granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal and  consequent
    to an error of law hearing the decision of JFtT O'Garro was  set  aside
    by a decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Parkes, dated  5  February
    2019. The claimant applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal and  this  application  was  refused  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Rimmington, whose decision is dated 25 March 2019.

Hearing Before the FtT

11. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Hatton Cross  on  8  August
    2019. The claimant attended the hearing and gave oral evidence.

12. Before the  Judge  the  claimant  detailed  in  relation  to  the  sole
    substantial issue in this appeal that he had not used  deception  in  a
    previous application. He explained that he settled a tax  liability  in
    the sum of �1123.40 on 31 January 2012 in the erroneous belief that  it
    related to self-employment and only became  aware  of  the  discrepancy
    after a review was undertaken by his accountants in 2016.

13. The claimant contends that he was aided in the completion of his  self-
    assessment tax return for the year ending 2010/2011 by his  immigration
    advisor, a man called Ishraque. He provided Ishraque  with  his  log-in
    details for the self-assessment online gateway to  enable  Ishraque  to
    file his tax return. He confirmed that  Ishraque  is  not  a  qualified
    accountant. The Tribunal further understands that Ishraque  was  acting
    as an unregulated immigration advisor.

14. At [9]-[10] of the decision, the  Judge  records  the  following  as  a
    summary  of  the  claimant's  evidence  as  detailed  by  his   witness
    statement:

         '9.  He went on in the witness statement to mention the  difference
             between declarations to HMRC, where figures  must  pertain  to
             the given 12 month tax year and those  under  the  immigration
             rules which allowed applicants to use any continuous 12  month
             period in the last 15 months from the date of application.  In
             2010 he  had  been  working  in  employment  on  weekdays  and
             weekends and in self-employment in the evenings. He  had  used
             his spare time to earn extra income  to  help  his  family  in
             India rather than sorting out his tax  affairs.  He  explained
             how he had been introduced to a man named Ishraque but did not
             know that he was not  a  qualified  accountant.  He  had  been
             unaware of the figures submitted by Ishraque to HMRC  and  had
             not check them. He had told the respondent that he  had  filed
             the tax return himself because Ishraque had told him that  the
             documents  were  presented  in  his  name  and  not  from  any
             accountancy firm. In effect, Ishraque had taken  control  over
             following his tax return. He later came to know that  Ishraque
             was not even a qualified immigration adviser.

         10.  He then explained how the error in his tax return had come  to
             his attention. He had been reading online  immigration  forums
             to help him to prepare his application and realised  that  tax
             returns were integral to the  process.  He  tried  to  contact
             Ishraque but learnt via WhatsApp that he had left the  country
             and gone to UAE and  could  not  help.  On  18  February  2016
             Ishraque emailed him the tax return which she had filed on the
             appellant's behalf. It was his new accountants who  noticed  a
             discrepancy. He had rectified the mistake immediately. His new
             accountant explained that such errors were very common.'

15. As to the claimant's oral evidence the Judge records,  inter  alia,  at
    [16]:

         '16. In cross-examination he maintained that Ishraque has filled in
             his tax return. He had  employed  Ishraque  for  the  previous
             nearly 4 years as his accountant. He denied that he had signed
             the tax returns. When he taxed  Ishraque  over  the  situation
             which had arisen, using Skype, Ishraque had accepted  that  he
             had made a mistake. He  accepted  that  he  had  said  in  his
             interview that he had done the returns himself, but  explained
             that this took place shortly after his mother died and pointed
             to his deteriorating health at the time. If he had  said  that
             Ishraque had filled it in, he did not think he would have been
             believed. He did not know if [Ishraque] had  been  allowed  to
             give immigration advice, but he had believed  that  he  was  a
             proper adviser after being introduced to him by a  friend  who
             had studied with him at university.'

16. In allowing the claimant's appeal the Judge found, inter alia, at [25]-
    [29]:

         '25. The central part of the appellant's explanation rests  on  his
             account of  his  dealings  with  Ishraque.  There  is  nothing
             unusual in the context of immigration law in the notion of the
             dishonest and/or unqualified adviser  or  accountant.  Because
             the respondent has  not  questioned  the  genuineness  of  the
             invoices in this case there is no necessary parallel with  the
             typical Operation Cudgegong cases where  the  applicant  is  a
             knowing participant. The bent so-called professional does  not
             need to keep his client  in  the  picture  but  can  advertise
             simply that he provides a seemingly good service.

         26.  Having considered all of the evidence I  find  that  I  cannot
             dismiss the appellant's account of his dealings with Ishraque.
             That is not the end of the matter, but provides the context in
             which he claims that he did not realise  the  falsity  of  the
             figures provided to HMRC.

         27.  One matter not mentioned in the refusal  letter  is  something
             more familiar to those who have experience of  self-employment
             than those in employment. The appellant has explained that  he
             placed his emphasis on maximising  his  earnings  rather  than
             concentrating on what was essentially paperwork. He  did  that
             not in the context of self-employment alone but while  holding
             down 2 other employed positions, working  during  the  working
             week and also at weekends and at night, in part to support his
             family in India. It is unclear precisely when his  tax  return
             was submitted, but the experience of panic when  the  deadline
             approaches is not unusual.

         28.  It is common, of  course,  for  those  facing  allegations  of
             dishonesty to blame their  accountant  and  highly  convenient
             when the accountant has  left  the  country  and  is  not  co-
             operating fully,  but  that  does  not  make  the  explanation
             untrue.  The  departure  of  the  accountant  may  simply   be
             explained by the fact that he wished to escape prosecution.

         29.  From my findings it  follows  that  I  have  made  a  positive
             credibility finding in view of what I find to be his plausible
             account. I have not found evidence of dishonesty which reaches
             the quality necessary for a finding of dishonesty.'

Grounds of Appeal

17. The Secretary of State filed grounds of appeal, which are  detailed  in
    full below:

          1. The Tribunal found 'It is common, of course, for those  facing
             allegations of dishonesty to blame their accountant and highly
             convenient when the accountant has left the country and is not
             co-operating fully, but that does  not  make  the  explanation
             untrue.  The  departure  of  the  accountant  may  simply   be
             explained by the fact that he wished  to  escape  prosecution'
             (28).

          2. It is respectfully submitted  its  unclear  how  the  Tribunal
             could reach that finding.

          3. The appellant blamed his accountants for  errors  in  his  tax
             returns and  the  Tribunal  accepted  this  explanation  (28).
             However, the Tribunal did not take account of the  appellant's
             own responsibilities. Before the tax  returns  were  submitted
             they would have been signed off by the appellant.  This  would
             have meant he was  aware  of  the  figures  relied  upon.  The
             Tribunal had no regard to this. If it had  done  it  may  well
             have considered the appellant's character differently.

          4. The Tribunal appears to have  adopted  an  unduly  sympathetic
             approach to this case. It  is  submitted  that  the  appellant
             eventually paid his taxes and he only did so when pressed.  If
             he had not claimed intended (sic) to apply for  ILR  he  would
             have continued to have avoided paying the correct sum of  tax.
             The Tribunal appears to have taken no account of this.

          5. The respondent relies in the case of  Abbasi  (rule  43;  para
             322(5): accountants' evidence) [2020] UKUT (IAC).

          6. 'We consider that particularly where, as in the present  case,
             and accountant's  letter  is  clearly  perfunctory  ('...   we
             inadvertently mixed earnings details of two clients  ...   The
             client was compensated ... Errors and mistakes can't be  ruled
             out'), the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal, as the  case
             may be, should expect the accountant in question to attend the
             hearing, having provided in advance a Statement of  Truth,  in
             order to explain in detail  the  circumstances  in  which  the
             error  came  to  be  made;  the  basis  of   nature   of   any
             compensation; and  whether  the  firm's  insurers  and/or  any
             relevant regulatory body have been informed. In the absence of
             such evidence, the tribunal is unlikely to be  able  to  place
             any material weight on letters of this kind' (64).

          7.  It  is  respectfully  submitted  that  the  position  of  the
             respondent in respect of these matters  is  aligned  with  the
             opinion of the President of the Upper Tribunal.'

18. In granting permission to appeal UTJ Canavan reasoned, inter alia:

         '2.  The grounds are poorly particularised but  raise  an  arguable
             point that justifies further consideration at a  hearing.  The
             judge had the opportunity to hear evidence from the  appellant
             many of his findings regarding the credibility of his  account
             were likely to be open to him to make. However, it is at least
             arguable that there may be some contradiction in  his  finding
             that the accountant might have wanted  to  escape  prosecution
             that was not adequately explored. The judge arguably failed to
             consider the inference that could be made  from  that  finding
             i.e. that the  accountant  might  have  left  the  UK  due  to
             unprofessional  or  fraudulent  activity.  If  there   was   a
             possibility that he was involved in fraudulent  activity  that
             could affect the  credibility  of  the  appellant's  evidence,
             especially considering his  admission  that  he  had  lied  in
             interview about who completed the tax return.'



Decision on Error of Law

19. At the commencement of the hearing, both  representatives  agreed  that
    unlike the term solicitor or independent financial  adviser,  the  term
    'accountant' is not protected. Consequently, an unqualified person  can
    hold themselves out to be an accountant. Further, both  representatives
    agreed  that  Ishraque  was  not  a  regulated   accountant,   but   an
    unregistered immigration adviser who had offered to help the  appellant
    as to his self-assessment tax return for the year ending 2010/2011.

20. Two of the grounds of appeal can be considered at the outset,  as  they
    possess no true merit.

21. Whilst not withdrawing the ground, Ms. Isherwood appropriately accepted
    that the respondent had difficulty in advancing the  'Abbasi'  argument
    identified at paragraphs 5 and 6 of the grounds of appeal, because  the
    decision expressly addressed the approach to be adopted in a  paragraph
    322(5) appeal where there is reliance upon an accountant's  letter.  In
    this matter no such letter from Ishraque was adduced, no doubt  because
    Ishraque was not a regulated accountant. I  further  observe  that  the
    representatives confirmed at the hearing before me that the  accounting
    information provided by professional accountants in this matter was not
    challenged. The expectation that an  accountant  attends  a  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing to give evidence, as identified  by  the  Tribunal  in
    Abbasi, is directed towards a qualified and regulated  accountant.  The
    author of the grounds, who did not represent the respondent before  the
    Judge, and is not Ms. Isherwood, appears to have misunderstood Ishraque
    to have been acting as  a  qualified  and  regulated  accountant.  Upon
    cursory  consideration  of  the  Judge's  decision,  and  indeed   upon
    consideration of the evidence submitted in this appeal, this is clearly
    not the case. Consequently, reliance upon the  decision  in  Abbasi  is
    misconceived and no material error of law arises.

22. Paragraph 4 is misconceived. The appellant was not 'pressed' to pay his
    taxes. His evidence, as accepted by the Judge,  is  that  he  belatedly
    became aware of the error in his tax return and  at  a  date  prior  to
    making his application for settlement  he  voluntarily  took  steps  to
    amend  the  error  and  repay  his  outstanding  tax  liabilities.  Ms.
    Isherwood appropriately did not positively advance this ground  at  the
    hearing.

23. In granting permission to appeal, UTJ Canavan's reasoning was  directed
    towards paragraphs 1 and 2 of the respondent's grounds of appeal.  Upon
    careful consideration, the Judge's observation at [28] of the  decision
    amounts to no more than an unwarranted musing and does not constitute a
    finding of fact. It is not helpful that by this stage of  the  decision
    the Judge has  changed  his  identification  of  Ishraque's  role  from
    unqualified  immigration   advisor   to   accountant.   However,   when
    considering the Judge's reasoning in this round such musing, though not
    to be expected in a judicial decision, does not by itself undermine the
    reasons  for  his  overall  conclusion  as  to  the  non-existence   of
    dishonesty which remains tolerably clear.

24. At the hearing the primary focus of  representatives'  submissions  was
    directed towards paragraph 3 of the Secretary of State's grounds, which
    I repeat:

         '3.  The appellant blamed his accountants for  errors  in  his  tax
             returns and  the  Tribunal  accepted  this  explanation  (28).
             However, the Tribunal did not take account of the  appellant's
             own responsibilities. Before the tax  returns  were  submitted
             they would have been signed off by the appellant.  This  would
             have meant he was  aware  of  the  figures  relied  upon.  The
             Tribunal had no regard to this. If it had  done  it  may  well
             have considered the appellant's character differently.'

25. Ms. Isherwood advanced several purported failures by the Judge  in  his
    reasoning with emphasis upon the failure  to  engage  with  documentary
    evidence confirming the appellant's  continued  contact  with  Ishraque
    consequent to the latter's relocation  outside  of  this  country.  The
    respondent contends that certain messages can be read as the  appellant
    seeking advice as to how to address inconsistencies  in  his  interview
    with the respondent and seeking information as to his tax affairs  that
    should be in his possession but appear to possessed by Ishraque several
    years after the self-assessment was filed. I acknowledge that on  their
    face Ms. Isherwood's concerns may  have  some  force  in  circumstances
    where the Judge's reasoning is limited in  scope  and  key  issues  are
    considered in brief terms.

26. However, Ms. Isherwood accepted that the submissions advanced were  not
    expressly detailed within paragraph 3 of the grounds of appeal. Rather,
    she requested that I conclude that they were implicit in the  sentence,
    '...  the  Tribunal  did  not  take  account  of  the  appellant's  own
    responsibilities.' She further accepted that if  her  submissions  were
    incapable  of  being  read  into  paragraph  3,  and  there  being   no
    application to amend grounds, then this ground of challenge must fail.

27. When considering grounds  of  appeal,  words  are  to  be  given  their
    ordinary natural meaning, and to be construed as they are understood in
    common language. No technical words are used in paragraph 3  and  I  am
    mindful that a word or phrase may have several ordinary meanings. It is
    appropriate to consider substance, not merely form.  Consequently,  the
    paragraph should properly be read as a whole, rather than one  sentence
    be considered in isolation.

28.  I  am   satisfied   that   'responsibilities'   is   the   plural   of
    'responsibility' and the natural meaning of the latter is the state  of
    being responsible - having a duty - over something  or  someone.  I  am
    further satisfied that the continuation of the paragraph is  consistent
    with this being the meaning adopted  by  the  author  of  the  grounds,
    '[b]efore the tax returns were submitted they would  have  been  signed
    off by the appellant. This would have meant he was aware of the figures
    relied upon. The Tribunal had no regard to this.'

29. On the application of the natural meaning of the words employed,  there
    is no merit in the ground expressly advanced because the Judge did have
    regard to the signing of the tax return. He accepted that the  document
    was signed by Ishraque and not the appellant. He further  accepted  the
    appellant's evidence as to the circumstances leading him to be  unaware
    of the figures submitted by Ishraque and as to why he had  not  checked
    them. The Judge considered such evidence in light  of  the  appellant's
    relevant responsibilities. Whilst others may reasonably have  concluded
    otherwise; it has  not  been  asserted  by  the  respondent  that  such
    decision is irrational on the evidence before the  Judge.  Rather,  the
    ground does not engage with the Judge's conclusion on  this  issue,  at
    [23], [26]. The author of the grounds simply proceeds  with  a  reasons
    challenge, and in so doing erroneously fails to engage with the reasons
    provided for the findings of fact made. Such approach could be said  to
    exhibit a lack of care, and with her usual adroitness Ms. Isherwood did
    not seek to  advance  the  contention  that  the  Judge  had  given  no
    consideration to the circumstances surrounding the signing-off  of  the
    self-assessment.

30. The remaining question for the  Tribunal  is  whether  Ms.  Isherwood's
    wider submissions can be read into paragraph 3. It is abundantly  clear
    that they cannot be. Paragraph 3 is a precise and narrow  challenge  to
    an identified issue namely a purported failure by the Judge to consider
    the appellant's application of his own  responsibilities  when  signing
    the self-assessment  tax  return.  It  cannot  reasonably  be  read  to
    encompass a wider challenge as to the Judge's consideration of messages
    between the appellant and Ishraque that post-date the  signing  of  the
    self-assessment, nor can it be read to encompass a general challenge as
    to the  failure  by  the  Judge  to  provide  sufficient  reasons  when
    accepting the appellant's honesty as  to  the  circumstances  in  which
    information  was  provided  to  the  Secretary  of  State   and   HMRC.
    Consequently, Ms. Isherwood's submissions cannot be read into paragraph
    3 and so this ground of challenge must be dismissed.

31. As  observed  by  UTJ  Canavan  the  respondent's  grounds  are  poorly
    particularised and as I have observed above  at  least  one  ground  is
    misconceived. Whilst I tentatively observe that there may  possibly  be
    several arguable challenges to the Judge's decision, particularly as to
    there being no express consideration of documents relied  upon  by  the
    respondent in a decision that primarily concentrates upon the  evidence
    advanced by the claimant, there was no application by the respondent to
    amend her grounds of appeal in this matter. Further, as accepted by Ms.
    Isherwood, the respondent  is  precluded  upon  seeking  to  advance  a
    'Robinson obvious' point: Miftari v. Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 481, per Maurice Kay LJ, at  [39].  In  such
    circumstances the Tribunal may only  consider  the  grounds  of  appeal
    advanced by the respondent upon which permission  to  appeal  has  been
    granted and for the reasons detailed above the grounds relied  upon  in
    this matter lack merit and are dismissed. Consequently, the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal therefore stands.
