Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer to the parties as they were referred to in the First Tier
    Tribunal that is Ms Zhao as the appellant and the Secretary of State as
    the respondent although the application for permission  to  appeal  was
    made by the respondent.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of China and born on 28th  June  1989.   She
    made an application on 25th September  2013  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant but  the  application  was  refused  on  11th
    November 2013 under paragraph 245(d) of  the  Immigration  Rules.   She
    could not meet the maintenance requirements under  Appendix  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules.     She  was  required  to  show  that  she  was  in
    possession of �5,425 for a 28 day period prior to the application.  The
    bank statements presented only showed funds between 6th September  2013
    and 25th September 2013 and did not cover the required  consecutive  28
    day period.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Dennis allowed the appellant's appeal on  1st
    April 2014 because the appellant had shown that she had ample funds and
    the respondent should have considered her Flexibility Policy.

 4. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    Judge had misdirected himself because the bank statements  subsequently
    produced  were  not  admissible  by  reason  of  Section  85A  of   the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.    In  other  words  the
    Tribunal may consider evidence submitted only if it  was  submitted  in
    support of and at the time of  making  the  application  to  which  the
    immigration decision related.

 5. Ms Everett submitted at the hearing before me that the appellant  could
    not comply with the Immigration Rules as she did not have the  required
    funds for the relevant period.  There were no 'missing documents'.   It
    was  not  incumbent  upon  the  respondent  to   search   out   further
    documentation.

Conclusions

 6. I am satisfied that the appellant was served with notice  of  the  date
    time and venue of the hearing before me but she failed to attend.

 7. The Immigration Rules specify that the appellant must demonstrate  that
    funds are available for the 28 day period prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application (Appendix C).  The end date of the closing balance must  be
    dated no earlier than 31  days  before  the  date  of  the  application
    Appendix C 1A (h).

 8. I find that the judge misdirected himself and made an error of  law  in
    his determination.  At paragraph 7 he stated

    'I am thoroughly satisfied she has very substantially in excess of that
    [�5425] throughout the period covered by the bank account and certainly
    over the twenty-eight day period prior to the decision. Given the  fact
    the Appellant's balance was very high from 10th  September  and  noting
    that she had already paid the  substantial  tuition  in  advance  I  am
    satisfied that this would have been an appropriate circumstance for the
    Respondent to have exercised that 'evidential  flexibi8lity'  available
    and to have sought clarification on this point'.

 9. The relevant date is the date  of  the  application  not  the  date  of
    decision. The bank accounts presented to the  Tribunal,  and  on  file,
    dated from 6th September 2013 to 8th October 2013 and showed  that  the
    appellant only had �1,588.78 in the account between 6th  September  and
    9th September 2013.  The appellant had to show she held the funds for a
    28 day period up to the date of the application (or at least held funds
    for a 28 day period which ended not more than  31  days  prior  to  the
    application) and she could not do so on the  bank  statements  provided
    from Barclays Bank. First she did not hold the required amount for  the
    period days she evidenced prior to the application and secondly did not
    show that she held the funds for the required  period.   There  was  no
    indication that the appellant held a second account and no  reason  for
    the Secretary of State to suppose that she held  any  other  funds  and
    thus call for further evidence.

10. SSHD v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ  2  confirmed  the  proposition  that
    'there is no unfairness in the requirement in the PBS that an applicant
    must submit with his application  all  of  the  evidence  necessary  to
    demonstrate compliance with the rule under which he seeks leave'.   The
    appellant did not at the date of her application demonstrate  that  she
    could comply with the Rules and nor did she demonstrate that after  the
    decision.

11. There was a reference to additional grounds that the  appellant's  long
    term goal was to be a piano teacher and she needed to show that she had
    a master's degree.  I am not persuaded that  this  was  effectively  an
    appeal further to Article 8 but even if it were, this does  not  engage
    any form of protected Article 8 right. Nasim  and  others  (Article  8)
    [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) confirmed that the use of Article 8 was limited
    where the case is far removed from the engagement of a  claim  relating
    to physical or moral integrity. That is the case here.

12. I therefore find that there was an error of law,  remake  the  decision
    and for the reasons above dismiss the appeal on all grounds.


Signed                                             Date  23rd June 2014


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
