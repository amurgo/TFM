For the Respondent:    Mr Z Nasim of Milestone Chambers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   We shall refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Judge
    rather than as they appear before us.  The appellant is a  national  of
    India.  He appealed to a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  against  the
    respondent's decision  of  10  December  2013  refusing  to  grant  him
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  He  had  arrived  in
    the United Kingdom on 13 September  2002  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student and obtained subsequent grants of leave to remain as a  student
    in time until 30 June 2009.  He was subsequently granted further  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 12 December 2011 and made
    a further application as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant which was  refused.
    He lodged an appeal on  16  April  2012.   The  original  decision  was
    withdrawn and he lodged a further in time appeal.

2.   His appeal was dismissed by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal after  a
    hearing on 28 February 2013.  His application had been refused  on  the
    basis that in the previous application of 24 November 2008 which led to
    the grant of leave on 12 December 2008 for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    Migrant he had submitted an employment letter  and  payslips  and  bank
    statements and the respondent was satisfied that these  documents  were
    false because an investigation by the  Metropolitan  Police  had  found
    them not to be genuine.  The application was  refused  under  paragraph
    322(2) of HC 395.  In the application which was considered by the judge
    in that appeal he had represented  that  he  had  not  previously  used
    deception when seeking  leave  to  remain  and  had  answered  "no"  to
    question D22 and had failed to disclose that  he  had  previously  used
    deception when seeking leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant.

3.   The appellant  was  not  represented  before  the  judge.   There  were
    representatives on file but they were not  in  attendance.   He  stated
    that he wished to proceed with the hearing.  The judge  noted  that  in
    the case of paragraph 322 the burden  of  proof  shifts  in  the  first
    instance to the respondent.  She noted the appellant's evidence both in
    relation to the appeal before  her  and  in  respect  of  the  previous
    application.  She also noted a witness statement from  DC  Laura  Curry
    which stated that a large number  of  Tier  1  Highly  Skilled  Migrant
    points-based visa applications has been received  containing  the  same
    bogus  documentation  including  Lloyds  Bank  statements,  bogus  bank
    letters, false employment  and  educational  details,  false  P60s  and
    payslips.  The appellant said that  he  had  sought  help  from  Harish
    Patel, whose house had been raided by the  police  and  colleagues  had
    advised him to seek help from Harish Patel.  He said that that was  the
    only reason why  Harish  Patel  had  the  documents  on  his  computer.
    According to DC Curry's witness statement Harish Patel's  home  address
    was entered on 3 August 2010 and  documents  and  computer  disks  were
    seized.  Mr Patel and his associate Ramesh Kumar  Patel  were  arrested
    and bailed and in addition to bank statements and utility  bills  there
    were two documents relating to instructions  on  how  to  create  bogus
    documents.  The suspects jumped bail and it appeared they had  fled  to
    India and extradition proceedings had not been initiated.

4.   There was a further witness statement from  a  Robin  Smith,  a  higher
    executive officer in the Temporary Migration Department  of  the  UKBA.
    He said that he had been sent a disk by DC Laura Curry with a statement
    and on the disk he found payslips from  Goldstone  Technologies  and  a
    salary confirmation letter from that company both confirming the salary
    of the appellant and also various  bank  statements  bearing  his  name
    covering the period of 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002.

5.   The judge said that she was satisfied on the balance  of  probabilities
    that the respondent had shown that the  appellant  had  produced  false
    documentation in relation to his application for leave to remain.   She
    said that the applicant submitted by the appellant was submitted by him
    in his own name and she found no reason  why  there  should  have  been
    documentation included in the possession of Harish Patel, who had  been
    arrested and investigated by the police in connection  with  fraudulent
    activity regarding a Tier 1 application.  The appellant had said at the
    oral hearing that he gave the original documents to  Harish  Patel  but
    the judge commented that this could not be the case  as  the  appellant
    had made his application.  She did not accept that Harish  Patel  would
    have had  these  documents  on  his  computers  if  the  appellant  had
    submitted the application himself and that  the  appellant  would  have
    given him the originals where he claimed that they still were,  as  the
    appellant had made his own application.   As  regards  the  appellant's
    claim that he had merely sought help from Harish Patel  and  had  given
    him the original documentation to submit to the  Home  Office,  as  the
    appellant's address was on the  Visa  Application  Form,  she  did  not
    accept this.  She  also  noted  that  there  was  no  further  evidence
    produced by the appellant in connection  with  his  claimed  employment
    with Goldstone Technologies.  With reference to contact  with  Mr  Anil
    Shah,  the  general  manager  of  Goldstone  Technologies,  about   the
    appellant's employment, the appellant said the company had  now  closed
    down and he had produced no email evidence to  show  he  had  contacted
    Anil Shah.

6.   The judge also noted that the appellant had claimed that  he  had  come
    from India where he was earning a salary of over �55,000  in  order  to
    study in the United Kingdom, and said that while this might be the case
    he had studied for four years on very basic courses when  according  to
    his application form he had a computer  science  degree  which  he  was
    awarded in the year 2000 and she  considered  that  this  rendered  his
    account unbelievable.  She did not consider it to be credible  that  he
    would come to the United Kingdom and earn �700  to  �800  a  month  and
    study basic courses if he, as he had claimed, had obtained  a  computer
    science degree in India and earned �55,000.  She went on to say that on
    this basis she found that the respondent had discharged the  burden  of
    proof in showing that the appellant had produced false documentation in
    the 2008 application and thus had made  false  representations  in  his
    current application.  She had assessed the  evidence  as  a  whole  and
    considered that the appellant had produced false documentation  in  the
    2008 application and relied on that false documentation in his  present
    application and the refusal was thus mandatory and the  respondent  had
    exercised her discretion correctly in relation to paragraph 322(2).

7.    The  First-tier  Judge  who  heard  the  appeal  in  2015  noted   the
    appellant's immigration history and the contents of  the  determination
    by the first judge, as we shall refer to her.  He said at paragraph  42
    that the starting point for his decision was the fact that there had to
    be new evidence or a clear error in the judge's  findings  of  fact  in
    line with the authority of Devaseelan.  He noted that it had  not  been
    pointed out to the first judge that the �55,000 earnings figure  was  a
    consequence of a 5.3 multiplier being applied to the appellant's salary
    and therefore her  assumption  that  he  was  earning  �55,000  a  year
    literally in India was clearly incorrect.   The  appellant  denied  the
    fact that he had ever used false representations  and  therefore  there
    was no reason for him to tick the box "yes"  in  the  application  form
    where he was accused of making false or misleading statements.

8.   The judge went on to say that there were  some  difficulties  with  the
    logic of the decision of the first judge, namely the fact  that  having
    seen the statement from DC Laura Curry as well as the information  from
    the UKBA chief executive officer,  there  was  no  evidence  that  just
    because the documentation was present on Harish Patel's computer did it
    necessarily follow that the appellant was party to that deception.   He
    said that he could find no  evidential  basis  that  would  permit  the
    learned judge to draw the inference that dishonesty  by  the  applicant
    was a reasonable inference to draw without  any  other  evidence.   The
    appellant's case throughout was that he gave the original documentation
    to the representative who had a fraudulent and  dishonest  history  and
    had since fled to India.  He said that there was no evidence before him
    that the appellant was party to the dishonesty or fraud perpetuated  by
    Harish  Patel  nor  that  he  was  party  to  the  creation  of   false
    documentation from Goldstone Technologies  in  his  name  or  the  bank
    account bearing the appellant's name.  The fact that his  documentation
    was found on the computer system of a convicted fraudster did not  mean
    he was  party  to  that  dishonesty.   The  appellant  had  given  this
    information genuinely to Mr Patel and there was no evidence to  suggest
    that the documents on the face of it were not genuine and had not  been
    validly given by the appellant and copied by Mr Patel.  He  found  that
    the evidence provided by the appellant was  persuasive  and  the  first
    judge's conclusion could not be followed by  him.   He  considered  the
    first judge's finding of adverse credibility was  clearly  key  to  her
    making a finding of fact against the appellant where she clearly had it
    in mind that he had literally earned �55,000 in India.   He  considered
    that the findings of credibility went to the heart of the  finding  and
    therefore, following the authority of Devaseelan, he felt able to  come
    to a conclusion that the appellant had not sought to exercise deception
    previously on the respondent and there was no reason for refusal  under
    paragraph 322(2).

9.   The judge having allowed the appeal,  the  respondent  sought  and  was
    granted permission to appeal on  the  basis  that  the  judge  had  not
    properly followed the Devaseelan guidance.

10.  In his submissions before us  Mr  Clarke  adopted  and  relied  on  the
    grounds.

11.  Mr Nasim argued that the judge had  correctly  applied  the  Devaseelan
    guidance.  There was new evidence in him saying in a witness  statement
    that he had not been represented at the earlier hearing having been let
    down by the representative on the day, and there  was  also  the  point
    about the �55,000 earnings and the judge's mistake.  There had been  no
    evidence to support the assertion about the use  of  false  statements.
    The  judge  had  been  entitled  to  make  his  own  assessment   after
    considering the relevant evidence.  That was  an  important  change  in
    circumstances and the  appellant  had  not  been  properly  represented
    before the first judge.  The burden of proof had not been discharged as
    regards fraud.

12.  Devaseelan did not say that the second judge was  bound  by  the  first
    judge.  It was a question of the fairness of proceedings.   The  second
    judge had to make his own independent  decision.   Devaseelan  was  not
    necessarily a relevant case where the burden is  on  the  Secretary  of
    State.  The first judge had not  said  how  the  detective  constable's
    evidence assisted.  The appellant had not relied on  that  evidence  in
    his present application.  It was accepted that Devaseelan was  relevant
    for immigration appeals as well as asylum and human right appeals.   It
    was argued that the facts were different, and Mr Nasim  made  reference
    to the �55,000 point.

13.  After consideration we concluded that the respondent's appeal would  be
    allowed and the detailed reasons which we provide below  would  follow.
    We also concluded, having heard submissions  on  the  point,  that  the
    appropriate course of action would be for the matter to be remitted for
    a full rehearing at Taylor House by a judge other than Judge Herbert.

Discussion

14.  It is important that at the outset we set out the  Devaseelan  guidance
    since it is a central issue in this appeal.

         "    d. Our guidelines on procedure in second appeals

         37.  We  consider  that  the  proper  approach  lies  between  that
             advocated by Mr Lewis and that advocated by  Miss  Giovanetti,
             but  considerably   nearer   to   the   latter.    The   first
             Adjudicator's  determination  stands  (unchallenged,  or   not
             successfully challenged) as an assessment  of  the  claim  the
             Appellant was then making, at the time of that  determination.
             It is not binding on the second Adjudicator; but, on the other
             hand, the second Adjudicator is not hearing an appeal  against
             it.  As an assessment of the  matters  that  were  before  the
             first  Adjudicator   it   should   simply   be   regarded   as
             unquestioned.  It may be built upon, and,  as  a  result,  the
             outcome of the hearing before the second  Adjudicator  may  be
             quite different from what might  have  been  expected  from  a
             reading of the first determination only.  But it  is  not  the
             second Adjudicator's role to consider  arguments  intended  to
             undermine the first Adjudicator's determination.

         38.  The second Adjudicator must, however be careful  to  recognise
             that the issue before him is not the issue that was before the
             first Adjudicator.  In particular, time has  passed;  and  the
             situation  at   the   time   of   the   second   Adjudicator's
             determination may be shown to be  different  from  that  which
             obtained previously.  Appellants may want to  ask  the  second
             Adjudicator to consider arguments on issues that were not - or
             could not  be  -  raised  before  the  first  Adjudicator;  or
             evidence that was not - or could not have been - presented  to
             the first Adjudicator.

         39.  In our view the second Adjudicator should treat  such  matters
             in the following way.

             (1)  The first Adjudicator's determination  should  always  be
                  the starting-point.  It is the authoritative assessment of
                  the Appellant's status  at  the  time  it  was  made.   In
                  principle  issues  such  as  whether  the  Appellant   was
                  properly represented, or whether  he  gave  evidence,  are
                  irrelevant to this.

             (2)    Facts   happening   since   the   first   Adjudicator's
                  determination can always be  taken  into  account  by  the
                  second  Adjudicator.   If  those  facts  lead  the  second
                  Adjudicator to the conclusion that, at  the  date  of  his
                  determination  and  on  the  material  before   him,   the
                  appellant  makes  his  case,  so  be  it.   The   previous
                  decision, on the material before the first Adjudicator and
                  at that date, is not inconsistent.

             (3)   Facts   happening   before   the   first   Adjudicator's
                  determination but having no relevance to the issues before
                  him can  always  be  taken  into  account  by  the  second
                  Adjudicator.  The first Adjudicator  will  not  have  been
                  concerned with such facts, and his determination is not an
                  assessment of them.

         40.  We now pass to matters that could have been before  the  first
             Adjudicator but were not.

             (4)  Facts personal to the Appellant that were not brought  to
                  the attention of the first Adjudicator, although they were
                  relevant to the issues before him, should  be  treated  by
                  the second Adjudicator with the  greatest  circumspection.
                  An Appellant who seeks, in a later appeal, to add  to  the
                  available facts in an effort to obtain a  more  favourable
                  outcome is properly regarded with suspicion from the point
                  of  view  of  credibility.   (Although  considerations  of
                  credibility will  not  be  relevant  in  cases  where  the
                  existence of the additional fact is beyond  dispute.)   It
                  must also be borne in mind that  the  first  Adjudicator's
                  determination was made at a  time  closer  to  the  events
                  alleged and in terms  of  both  fact-finding  and  general
                  credibility assessment would tend to have  the  advantage.
                  For this reason, the adduction of such  facts  should  not
                  usually lead to any  reconsideration  of  the  conclusions
                  reached by the first Adjudicator.

             (5)  Evidence of other facts - for  example  country  evidence
                  may not suffer from the same concerns as  to  credibility,
                  but  should  be  treated  with  caution.   The  reason  is
                  different from that in (4).  Evidence dating  from  before
                  the determination of the first Adjudicator might well have
                  been relevant if it had been tendered to him: but  it  was
                  not, and  he  made  his  determination  without  it.   The
                  situation in the Appellant's own country at  the  time  of
                  that determination is very  unlikely  to  be  relevant  in
                  deciding whether the Appellant's removal at  the  time  of
                  the second Adjudicator's determination  would  breach  his
                  human rights.  Those representing the Appellant  would  be
                  better advised to assemble  up-to-date  evidence  than  to
                  rely on material that is (ex hypothesi) now rather dated.

         41.  The final major category of case is where the Appellant claims
             that his removal would breach Article 3 for  the  same  reason
             that he claimed to be a refugee.

             (6)  If before the second Adjudicator the Appellant relies  on
                  facts that are not materially different from those put  to
                  the first Adjudicator, and proposes to support  the  claim
                  by what is in essence the same evidence as that  available
                  to the Appellant at  that  time,  the  second  Adjudicator
                  should  regard  the  issues  as  settled  by   the   first
                  Adjudicator's determination and make his findings in  line
                  with that determination rather than allowing the matter to
                  be re-litigated.  We draw attention  to  the  phrase  'the
                  same evidence as that available to the Appellant'  at  the
                  time of the first  determination.   We  have  chosen  this
                  phrase not only in order to accommodate guidelines (4) and
                  (5) above, but also because, in respect of  evidence  that
                  was available to the Appellant, he must be taken  to  have
                  made his choices about how it  should  be  presented.   An
                  Appellant cannot be expected to present evidence of  which
                  he has no knowledge: but if (for example) he  chooses  not
                  to give oral evidence in his first appeal, that  does  not
                  mean that the issues or  the  available  evidence  in  the
                  second appeal are rendered any different by  his  proposal
                  to  give  oral  evidence  (of  the  same  facts)  on  this
                  occasion.

         42.  We offer two further comments, which are  not  less  important
             than what precedes then.

             (7)  The force of the reasoning underlying guidelines (4)  and
                  (6) is greatly reduced if there is some very  good  reason
                  why the Appellant's failure to  adduce  relevant  evidence
                  before the first Adjudicator should not be,  as  it  were,
                  held against him.  We think such  reasons  will  be  rare.
                  There  is  an  increasing   tendency   to   suggest   that
                  unfavourable decisions by Adjudicators are  brought  about
                  by error or incompetence on the part  of  representatives.
                  New representatives blame old  representatives;  sometimes
                  representatives  blame  themselves  for   prolonging   the
                  litigation  by  their  inadequacy  (without,  of   course,
                  offering the public any compensation for  the  wrong  from
                  which  they   have   profited   by   fees).    Immigration
                  practitioners  come  within   the   supervision   of   the
                  Immigration Services Commissioner under part V of the 1999
                  Act.  He has power to register, investigate and cancel the
                  registration  of  any  practitioner,  and  solicitors  and
                  counsel  are,  in   addition,   subject   to   their   own
                  professional bodies.  An Adjudicator should be  very  slow
                  to conclude that an appeal before another Adjudicator  has
                  been materially affected by a  representative's  error  or
                  incompetence; and such a finding should always be reported
                  (through arrangements made by the  Chief  Adjudicator)  to
                  the Immigration Services Commissioner.

                  Having  said  that,  we  do  accept  that  there  will  be
                  occasional cases where  the  circumstances  of  the  first
                  appeal were such that it would be  right  for  the  second
                  Adjudicator  to  look  at  the  matter  as  if  the  first
                  determination had never been made.  (We think it  unlikely
                  that the second Adjudicator would, in such a case, be able
                  to build very  meaningfully  on  the  first  Adjudicator's
                  determination; but we emphasise that, even in such a case,
                  the first determination stands as the determination of the
                  first appeal.)

             (8)  We do not suggest that, in the foregoing, we have covered
                  every possibility.  By covering the major categories  into
                  which second appeals  fall,  we  intend  to  indicate  the
                  principles for dealing with such appeals.  It will be  for
                  the second Adjudicator to decide which of them is  or  are
                  appropriate in any given case."

15.  In our view the judge did not properly apply the  Devaseelan  guidance.
    The only differences before him were the appellant's statement that  he
    had not been represented at the previous hearing and the issue  of  the
    �55,000.  The former is not a matter  of  materiality  as  regards  the
    application  of  the  Devaseelan  guidance  (see  paragraph  39(1)   of
    Devaseelan).  Nor do we consider that it was open to the judge to treat
    the latter, insofar as he did so,  as  a  matter  that  could  properly
    justify him in coming to a different conclusion.  The first judge  made
    it clear, having assessed the evidence as a whole, that  the  appellant
    had produced false documentation in the 2008 application and relied  on
    that false documentation in his present application.   Although,  as  a
    consequence of the matter not having been put before her and  therefore
    not through her fault, she erred as regards the appellant's earnings in
    India, with regard to that as a relevant issue to  the  credibility  of
    the claim, it is clear from a proper reading of her determination  that
    the matter that persuaded her that the  appellant  had  produced  false
    documentation was the evidence that had been provided from DC Curry and
    from Mr Smith of the UKBA and  her  own  assessment  of  the  evidence,
    applying the correct burden and standard of proof.  As is  pointed  out
    at paragraph 37 of Devaseelan, it is not the second Adjudicator's  role
    to consider arguments intended to  undermine  the  first  Adjudicator's
    determination and he is not hearing  an  appeal  against  that  earlier
    determination.  It is also pointed out in that paragraph that the first
    determination as an assessment of the  matters  that  were  before  the
    first Adjudicator should simply be regarded as unquestioned  though  it
    may be built upon.

16.  Also there is the point at paragraph 41  that  the  second  Adjudicator
    should  regard  the  issues  as  settled  by  the  first  Adjudicator's
    determination and make his findings in  line  with  that  determination
    rather than allowing the matter to be  relitigated  before  the  second
    Adjudicator if the appellant relies on facts that  are  not  materially
    different from those put to the first Adjudicator.  As set  out  above,
    we consider that it was not open to the  judge  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant was relying on facts  that  were  materially  different  from
    those put to the first judge.  The same evidence about  the  fraud  was
    before him as before the first judge, and on a  proper  application  of
    the  Devaseelan  principles  he  should  have  followed   the   earlier
    determination.  It is not a case, as set  out  under  paragraph  42  of
    Devaseelan, where there is some very good reason  why  the  appellant's
    failure to adduce relevant evidence before the first Adjudicator should
    not be, as it were, held against him.   As  the  Tribunal  pointed  out
    there, an Adjudicator should be very slow to conclude  that  an  appeal
    before  another  Adjudicator  has  been  materially   affected   by   a
    representative's error or  incompetence.   In  this  case  it  was  the
    absence of a representative that the  appellant  complains  of  in  the
    witness statement, that is not a matter that has  been  linked  to  the
    failure to adduce relevant evidence before the first Adjudicator  other
    than with regard to the �55,000 earnings issue which, as set out above,
    was not a material issue in the  first  judge's  findings.   The  judge
    misdescribed the Devaseelan guidance in his brief paragraph 42, and his
    conclusions at paragraphs 48 to 57  are  not  in  accordance  with  the
    Devaseelan  guidance.   Effectively  he  allowed  the  matter   to   be
    relitigated when it was not open to him to do so, and as a  consequence
    he came to conclusions that were not open to him to reach.  Accordingly
    we allow the Secretary of State's appeal against the  judge's  decision
    and, as set out above, direct that the  matter  be  reheard  at  Taylor
    House before a judge other than Judge Herbert OBE.
