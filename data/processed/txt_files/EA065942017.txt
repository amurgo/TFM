For the Appellant:     Mr Ikegwuroka, instructed by Almond Legals

For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born on [~] 1985 and was granted
    permission to appeal against a decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Dineen, promulgated on 1st August 2018, which dismissed the appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  15th  July
    2018.  That decision identified that the appellant had  applied  for  a
    Derivative Residence Card as the primary  carer  of  a  European  Union
    national child (Portuguese) who is exercising Treaty Rights as a  self-
    sufficient person. The application was refused under Regulation  16(2),
    16(4)(a) with reference to 16(3)(c) and  20(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 because the applicant had not
    shown that her child (Ad) was a self-sufficient person  (or  indeed  in
    education).  The appellant had not provided evidence that she  and  her
    child had sufficient funding in the UK such that she would not become a
    burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom.

 2. The appellant had entered the United Kingdom as a visitor  in  February
    2012.   She  undertook  a  proxy  marriage  in  November  2012  with  a
    Portuguese national  but  her  subsequent  application  for  a  spousal
    residence permit was refused. She parted from her said partner prior to
    the birth of her first child (born on 23rd January 2016) but  a  second
    child  was  born  on  7th  September  2017.    Both   have   Portuguese
    citizenship.   The appellant not longer has  contact  with  her  former
    partner and there was no evidence in relation to him in the bundle  (or
    on whether he was still the United Kingdom).

 3. The appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  clearly  had  an  unusual
    procedural history. The judge recorded that  the  bundles  of  evidence
    relied upon had not been served on the Tribunal  and  respondent  until
    lunchtime on the day of the hearing and a skeleton was then served. The
    judge identified that the sole issue under challenge  was  whether  the
    child was self-sufficient for the purposes of the Regulation. When  the
    Tribunal reconvened at 2.30 pm counsel had been substituted  by  a  new
    counsel.  That counsel then himself  withdrew  and  the  appellant  was
    without representation.   The appellant produced  four  payslips  being
    from 15th April 2018 to 23rd June 2018.  She had net earnings of �1,901
    during that period.   Health insurance documents at  page  177  of  the
    bundle were also identified.  The EU national child also had  a  record
    with the NHS and as the judge recorded 'making it clear that the  child
    in question has been registered with a doctor and will  be  in  receipt
    when necessary of NHS care'.  The judge concluded that

         'it is clear that the mother  and  child  are  not  in  fact  self-
         sufficient in terms of medical care'.


 4. The judge also found at paragraph 21

         'Nowhere in the large appeal bundle is there any indication of  the
         outgoings of the family save for  the  medical  insurance  premiums
         which come to something over �700 per  annum.   In  particular,  no
         details are given of the accommodation available to the  mother  or
         child in question.  No details are given as to the  cost  of  their
         upkeep or their accommodation.  No details  are  given  as  to  the
         expenses which are incurred in the upkeep of the family and  it  is
         impossible in all the circumstances to make a finding on the  facts
         existing at the time  of  this  decision  and  on  the  balance  of
         probabilities  that  the  younger  child  is  self-sufficient.   It
         follows from that, no other grounds being advanced on behalf of the
         appellant, that the appeal must fail  under  Regulation  16(2)  and
         cannot succeed on any other basis'.


Application for Permission to Appeal


 5. The application for permission asserted the judge had

         (i)      misdirected himself as to  the  proper  interpretation  of
         self sufficiency under the Community Laws. Article 7(1)(b)  of  the
         Citizens' Directive creates a right of residence for those who have
         sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to
         become a burden on the social assistance system of the host  Member
         State during their  period  of  residence  and  have  comprehensive
         sickness insurance cover.  Article 8(4) sets out  a  definition  of
         'sufficient resources' such that


             'Member States may not lay down  a  fixed  amount  which  they
             regard as 'sufficient resources',  but  they  must  take  into
             account the personal situation of the  person  concerned.   In
             all cases this amount shall not be higher than  the  threshold
             below which nationals of the host Member State become eligible
             for  social  assistance  or,  where  this  criterion  is   not
             applicable higher than the  minimum  social  security  pension
             paid by the host Member State'.


         The grounds contended that although not possible to state what  the
         minimum level of self-sufficiency might be, it could not be  higher
         that the level of income  support  for  United  Kingdom  nationals.
         The appellant earned �1,264 per  month  and  she  did  not  receive
         public benefit.  She was not a burden on the social  assistance  of
         the host state.


         Kuldip Singh (Case C-218/14) considered potential sources of income
         and held that the necessary income could  derive  in  part  from  a
         spouse who was a third country national. The judge did not consider
         the range of income possibilities.


         ii)      The appellant and her daughter were  not  an  unreasonable
         burden on the state  resources.  Both  had  comprehensive  sickness
         insurance ('CSI') which the judge acknowledged.  The  existence  of
         the  CSI  fulfilled  this  aspect  of  the  requirements   of   the
         regulations and use of the NHS did not invalidate the  availability
         of the insurance.   The judge misdirected himself  when  concluding
         that the possession of additional NHS care for the child undermined
         the availability of the CSI.


    The judge made material factual errors which amounted to  an  error  of
    law.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Ford on the first ground only
    on the basis that it was arguable that as the judge found the appellant
    earned �316 per week.  There was no  evidence  of  reliance  on  public
    funds and it was arguable that the Tribunal erred as it should not have
    been found necessary to show anything more than income at the level  of
    income support which was shown.

 7. However, permission on the second ground was specifically not  granted.
    The grounds for permission had argued that  as  the  judge  found  that
    comprehensive health insurance (CSI) was available  for  the  appellant
    and her daughter and the fact that the child had access  to  additional
    NHS care when necessary should not have led the  Tribunal  to  conclude
    that the child did not have comprehensive health insurance.

 8. Judge Ford found this second ground was not arguable.  There  had  been
    shown reliance on public funds.

 9. At the hearing, Mr Ikegwuroka argued with reference to the CSI  but  as
    can be seen from above, permission to appeal was not  granted  on  that
    basis.  Permission was only granted in respect of the self  sufficiency
    of income. As Mr Deller contended there were in fact two components  in
    relation to  whether  the  child  was  self-sufficient  which  included
    whether there was comprehensive health insurance.  Further,  the  child
    was to be self sufficient but she could only rely on  the  earnings  of
    the appellant. These could only be relied only if the appellant was  in
    the United Kingdom lawfully.  I raised the question of  Alokpa  CJEU  C
    2013/645 and Mr Deller stated that the issue of  income  may  not  have
    been fully explored.  Mr Ikegwuroka argued that the appellant had  been
    granted a certificate of Application which enabled her to work and thus
    she was not working unlawfully. Mr Deller  fundamentally  opposed  this
    approach.   The Certificate of Application did  not  confirm  that  the
    appellant had a right to work.

    Conclusions

10. As established in the Secretary of State's decision letter and  at  the
    outset of the hearing before  me,  the  appellant  had  applied  for  a
    derivative right of residence as the primary carer of her child who was
    'self-sufficient'. The appeal was not put  on  any  other  basis.   The
    child was not in education.

11. Article 7 of Directive 2004/38/EU ('the Citizens' Directive), 'Right of
    residence for more than three months', is worded as follows:

         '(1)     All Union citizens shall have the right  of  residence  on
         the territory of another Member State for a period of  longer  than
         three months if they:


         (a)      are workers or self-employed persons in  the  host  Member
             State; or


         (b)      have sufficient resources for themselves and their  family
             members not to become a burden on the social assistance system
             of the host Member State during their period of residence  and
             have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member
             State; or


         (c)      -    are enrolled at a private  or  public  establishment,
                  accredited or financed by the host  Member  State  on  the
                  basis of its legislation or administrative  practice,  for
                  the principal purpose of  following  a  course  of  study,
                  including vocational training; and


             -   have comprehensive sickness insurance cover  in  the  host
                  Member State and assure the relevant  national  authority,
                  by means of a declaration or by such equivalent  means  as
                  they may choose, that they have sufficient  resources  for
                  themselves and their family members not to become a burden
                  on the social assistance system of the host  Member  State
                  during their period of residence; or


         (d)      are family members accompanying or joining a Union citizen
             who satisfies the conditions referred to in points (a), (b) or
             (c).


12. In Zhu and Chen [2004] ECR I-9925, the CJEU held, at �45, that:


         'A refusal to allow the parent, whether a national of a member
         state or a national of a non-member country, who is the carer of a
         child to whom art 18EC and Directive 90/364 grant a right of
         residence, to reside with that child in the host member state would
         deprive the child's right of residence of any useful effect. It is
         clear that enjoyment by a young child of a right of residence
         necessarily implies that the child is entitled to be accompanied by
         the person who is his or her primary carer'.


13. The child, however, must first be afforded an EEA right within the host
    member state (the child was a Portuguese national),  and  Regulation  4
    and 16 of The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 set
    out as follows:

         Worker",  "self-employed  person",  "self-sufficient  person"   and
         "student"


             4.- (1) In these Regulations-


                 (a) "worker" means a worker within the meaning of Article
                 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
                 Union(1);


                 (b) "self-employed person" means a person who is
                 established in the United Kingdom in order to pursue
                 activity as a self-employed person in accordance with
                 Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
                 Union(2);


                 (c) "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-


                       (i) sufficient resources not to become a burden on
                       the social assistance system of the United Kingdom
                       during the person's period of residence; and


                       (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the
                 United Kingdom;






         'Derivative Right to Reside


         16 (1)   A person has a  derivative  right  to  reside  during  any
             period in which the person-


                  (a)  is not an exempt person; and


                  (b)  satisfies each of the criteria in one or more of
                  paragraphs (2) to (6).


             (2) The criteria in this paragraph are that-


                  (a)  the person is the primary carer of an EEA national;
                  and


                  (b)  the EEA national-


                      (i)   is under the age of 18;


                      (ii)  resides in the United Kingdom as a self-
                      sufficient person; and


                      (iii) would be unable to remain in the United Kingdom
                      if the person left the United Kingdom for an
                      indefinite period...'


16. Permission to appeal was not granted on the basis that  the  child  had
    shown  self-sufficiency  on  the  grounds  of   the   availability   of
    comprehensive health insurance (under the  second  limb  of  Regulation
    16(2)(b) with reference to Regulation 4 (1)(c)).   The  judge  did  not
    accept that the health insurance was comprehensive because as he stated
    at paragraph 18

         'Notwithstanding the existence of the medical insurance  documents,
         at page 177 of the appeal bundle is a letter from the NHS making it
         clear that the child in question has been registered with a  doctor
         and will be in receipt when necessary of NHS care'.


17. There was no renewal of the application to appeal on that basis  before
    me. As that ground was not permitted the application  must  fail.   The
    child on whom the parent depended (was born  in  January  2016  and  as
    acknowledged in the  appeal  documentation  by  the  appellant  not  in
    education), was registered  with  and  had  used  the  National  Health
    Service.  There was no indication of any reimbursement of  that  system
    or registration as a private patient in order to access private  health
    care. (Indeed, there was no actual evidence of premium payments made).

18. Even if that were not the case, the  requirements  are  that  there  is
    comprehensive health insurance and that the EU citizen is not a  burden
    on the social assistance system.  To be self-sufficient there  must  be
    no burden on the social assistance  system.   I  emphasise  this  point
    because as the grounds for permission stated 'the point  of  the  child
    having comprehensive health insurance is to avoid  reliance  on  public
    funds. Registering with a GP for NHS care rather than registering as  a
    private patient does show reliance on public funds'.  It  is  not  just
    income which is the focus of the provisions regarding reliance  on  the
    public funds.

19. The social assistance system includes the National Health Service.   As
    set out in W (China) and X (China) [2006] EWCA 1494,

         '[the] fundamental reason for the insurance  requirement  that  was
         identified as the basis of the scheme of the Directive in Chen:  to
         prevent the presence of the EU citizen placing a burden on the host
         state. Use of free state medical services exactly  creates  such  a
         burden [on the host state]


20. As the child needed  to  have  both  health  insurance  and  sufficient
    resources, provided by her mother, not to become a burden on  the  host
    state and failed at both hurdles, she could not be classified as 'self-
    sufficient'.

21.  Mr  Deller  also  argued  that  the  appellant's  income  was  derived
    unlawfully as she had no leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

22. The guidance from the  Home  Office  entitled  'Free  Movement  Rights:
    derivative rights of residence' Version 4.0  published in February 2018
    (although not produced at the hearing) states at page 15

         'Income from the primary carer


         A child may show that they are self-sufficient by relying upon  the
         income of their primary carer. However, any work undertaken in  the
         UK  will  only  be  considered  acceptable  where  this  is  lawful
         employment. For example, if the primary carer currently  has  leave
         to remain  under  another  part  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
         entitles them to work, they can use any income from those  earnings
         to show they are self-sufficient'.


23. In relation to the income of the parent there has been a reference  for
    a preliminary ruling from the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Northern  Ireland
    (United Kingdom)  made  on  9  February  2018  in  Ermira  Bajratari  v
    Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  (Case  C-93/18)  (2018/C
    152/16) on the following basis.  'Can income from  employment  that  is
    unlawful under national  law  establish,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the
    availability of sufficient  resources  under  Article  7(1)(b)  of  the
    Citizens Directive (1)?'.

24. This question, however, was  previously  considered  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal in W (China) and X (China) [2006] EWCA Civ 1494) which addressed
    the arguments as to the lawfulness of the third-party national's  work.
    In that case it was asserted by the Secretary of State that  the  third
    party was  working  illegally  whilst  the  appellant's  representative
    advanced that the work was not illegal  because  as  custodian  of  the
    child the parent did not require leave to enter.  That was given  short
    shrift by the court at paragraph 16

         'for a general proposition that where the presence of a third party
         national was required  to  make  EU  rights  fully  effective  then
         domestic law cannot be enforced against that third party. The  case
         [Chen] is authority for no such thing. First,  it  depends  on  the
         establishment of the EU right before the  third  party  enters  the
         equation'


    and further that

         'the state is not obliged to adjust its domestic law  in  order  to
         make available to the EU citizen resources that would not otherwise
         be available to him, so that he can fulfil the pre-condition to the
         existence in his case of the article 18 right: the right which  has
         to exist before he can require the state to adjust its domestic law
         in deference to it.'


25. It has been argued that this should be read in  the  light  of  Alokpa,
    which held at paragraph 27 that there was  no  requirement  as  to  the
    origin of the resources of the child  upon  whom  the  appellant  would
    derive rights, as follows

         'it suffices  that  such  resources  are  available  to  the  Union
         citizens,  and  that  that  provision  lays  down  no   requirement
         whatsoever as to their origin, since they could be provided,  inter
         alia, by a national of  a  non-Member  State,  the  parent  of  the
         citizens who are minor children at  issue  (see,  to  that  effect,
         concerning  European  Union   law   instruments   pre-dating   that
         directive, Case C-200/02 Zhu and Chen [2004] ECR I-9925, paragraphs
         28 and 30).


26. That refers to  'origin'  of  funds  not  'the  lawfulness  of  funds'.
    Neither case states in terms that the income might include income which
    is unlawful.  The CJEU in Alokpa indeed  relied  on  and  substantially
    mirrored the case of Zhu and Chen.  That in turn was  analysed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in W (China) which rejected the notion of unlawful work
    establishing an avenue to resources for self-sufficiency by a child and
    further, pointed out that, first, the  EU  right  must  be  established
    before the third  party  (in  this  case  the  appellant)  'enters  the
    equation'. Indeed, the First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the  payslips
    emanated from April 2018.  There was no indication that any  right  had
    been established prior to April 2018 or evidence that the appellant was
    lawfully in the  United  Kingdom  prior  to  that  date.   Nor  does  a
    Certificate of Application render the work  of  the  appellant  lawful.
    There was no evidence as to the whereabouts of the father.

27. The Home Office guidance would therefore appear to follow the Court  of
    Appeal decision.   As such the appellant cannot rely on her  income  as
    it is  'unlawful'  and  further  she  has  not  established  the  prior
    existence of an EEA right by her child. (The appellant in fact has  two
    children but the rights as discussed herein are considered in  relation
    to the older child).

28. Even if, however, my reasoning is flawed in relation to the  assessment
    of the lawfulness of income such self-sufficiency was  not  effectively
    challenged in relation to the comprehensive  health  insurance  or  the
    finding that the appellant and child were not a burden  on  the  social
    assistance system of the host member state (the United Kingdom)  during
    their period of residence.

29. For the reasons given I find there is no material error of law  in  the
    judge's decision which incorporated adequately  reasoned  findings  for
    dismissing the appellant's claim. The First-Tier Tribunal decision will
    stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



Signed           Helen Rimington             14th November 2018

Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
