For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan date of birth 30th  January
         1981. He appeals with permission[1] the decision of the  First-tier
         Tribunal (Judge AR Hudson) to dismiss his appeal against a decision
         to refuse to grant him permanent residence  under  the  Immigration
         (European Economic Area) Regulation 2006.

      2. The Appellant's application was based on his assertion that he  had
         accrued five years' continuous residence  in  accordance  with  the
         Regulations, as the family member (spouse) of Dutch national  [AH].
         As such was entitled under Regulation 15 to a  grant  of  permanent
         residence.

      3. The Respondent refused the application on the 9th March 2016.   The
         Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant was entitled  to  a
         grant of permanent residence because she  was  not  satisfied  that
         [AH] had been exercising  treaty  rights  throughout  the  relevant
         period.  She was particularly concerned about the lack of  evidence
         relating to the period November 2011- April 2012. That then was the
         matter in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.

      4. Judge Hudson heard oral evidence from the Appellant  and  his  wife
         [AH].   He records the evidence of [AH] that she was employed until
         September 2011 when she left to go on maternity leave.   She stated
         that she had started an online trading business called 'GB  Pearls'
         but it had not at first gone well. She had found  it  difficult  to
         make sales on 'eBay' because she did not have ratings  yet  so  she
         had sold a couple of products on 'gumtree', a mobile telephone  and
         a 'TV kit'. She had registered her business for tax in  April  2012
         and this was confirmed by her  accountant  and  documentation  from
         HMRC.   Judge Hudson's assessment of  that  evidence  is  found  at
         paragraph 15 of the decision:

             "[AH] gave evidence before me in an honest manner but she  was
             wholly unable to give any specific evidence of  what  she  was
             doing in furtherance of her business at any  particular  date.
             She has no documentation from the period up to April 2012  but
             is not able to fill  in  the  gaps  in  the  evidence  through
             recollection. Although I  found  her  honest,  she  is  wholly
             unreliable in her history. I have seen evidence  that  on  1st
             November 2011 [AH] advertised a TV kit for sale  on  eBay  and
             sold it at auction. In February 2012 she bought  three  mobile
             phones for ï¿½368 from Marl Tech. Neither of these  transactions
             is suggestive of business trade.  Although  I  accept  that  a
             person need not be making  a  profit  in  order  to  be  self-
             employed, in the absence of any evidence to  the  contrary,  I
             conclude that [AH] began her business in April 2012 as  stated
             by her accountant and on her tax return".

      5. Accordingly Judge Hudson found there to be a gap in the  record  in
         respect of [AH]'s exercise of  treaty  rights,  and  dismissed  the
         appeal.

      6. The Appellant now  appeals  on  the  grounds  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal made apparently contradictory findings.  It  is  submitted
         that the finding that there  was no self-employed economic activity
         taking place during the relevant period cannot be squared with  the
         Tribunal's acceptance of [AH]'s evidence that she made two sales on
         'gumtree'.  The Tribunal accepted that  [AH]  need  not  have  been
         making a profit to be engaged in self-employment.

      7. In granting permission First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew found  that
         ground to be arguable and added a further point:  the  decision  of
         the First-tier Tribunal was in July 2017, some five years  and  two
         months after April 2012, when it was accepted that the business had
         been launched. At the date of the appeal hearing the Appellant  had
         therefore  been  residing  in  the  UK  in  accordance   with   the
         Regulations for a continuous period of five years  and  the  appeal
         should arguably have been allowed on that basis, regardless of  the
         findings on the period November 2011 to April 2012.

      8. Before me the parties agreed  that  Judge  Andrew  had  been  quite
         correct in her identification of the further ground. There  was  no
         obligation on Mr Qayyum to demonstrate that he had been residing in
         the UK in accordance with the Regulations in any  particular  five-
         year period. At the date of the First-tier Tribunal's decision, any
         five years would do. On  its  own  findings  such  a  period  arose
         between April 2012 and the date of the appeal in July 2017, and the
         appeal should have been allowed on that footing.  It follows that I
         need not deal with the grounds as originally drafted.

    Decisions

      9. The making of the First-tier Tribunal decision involved an error in
         approach such that the decision is set aside.

     10. The decision is remade as  follows:  the  appeal  is  allowed  with
         reference to Regulation 15 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2006.

     11. I was not asked to make an order for anonymity and on the  facts  I
         see no reason to do so.

                                                       Dated 21st March 2018
