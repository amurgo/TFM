                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
Appellant   Miss Singh, Counsel, instructed by Barnes, Harrild Dyer
Respondent  Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. Unless  and  until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
       Appellant is granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings
       shall directly or indirectly identify him or  any  member  of  their
       family.  This direction applies both to the  Appellant  and  to  the
       Respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead  to
       contempt of court proceedings.

    2. The appellant is an Iranian  national.  On  November  25,  2008  the
       appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  and  claimed  asylum.  The
       respondent refused his claim on March 26, 2010 and when  the  appeal
       came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Brunnen on May 19, 2010
       he refused the appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated  on  May
       25, 2010. His appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused.


    3. The appellant then submitted a fresh claim on April 26, 2013 but the
       respondent refused this on August 12, 2015 under paragraphs 336  and
       339D HC 395.

    4. The appellant appealed  that  decision  on  August  26,  2015  under
       Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
       and his appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal T  Jones
       (hereinafter referred to as "the Judge") on  July  18,  2016.  In  a
       decision promulgated on September 5, 2016 he refused the appellant's
       appeal on asylum grounds and human rights grounds.

    5. The appellant appealed the Judge's decision on  September  15,  2016
       and permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Hodgkinson on September 28, 2016.  He  found  that  it  was
       arguable that the Judge had failed to  have  regard  to  the  recent
       report of Professor Joffe when considering whether  to  depart  from
       the recent country guidance decision of SSH and  HR  (illegal  exit:
       failed  asylum  seeker)  Iran  CG  [2016]  UKUT  00308   (IAC).   In
       particular, he found  it  arguable  the  Judge  had  not  considered
       Professor Joffe's 2016 report when considering sur  plas  activities
       and the appellant's ethnicity. The Judge specifically referred to  a
       2012 report only but failed to engage with the skeleton argument  or
       the other documents.

    6. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  occasion  I
       heard brief submissions from both representatives.


    7. Mr Harrison reviewed the papers and conceded there was  an  arguable
       error in law because the Judge failed to consider the latest  report
       from Professor Joffe when he considered the appellant's case against
       SSH.


    8. Miss Singh invited me to find an error in law.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

    9. In granting permission to appeal Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Hodgkinson identified possible arguable errors in law.

   10. Mr Harrison very fairly accepted that whilst the Judge had attempted
       to apply the new CG decision of SSH he had unfortunately  overlooked
       the comments of Professor Joffe in  his  2016  report.  This  report
       suggested there were still risks but the report was not  before  the
       Tribunal. The evidence was therefore not considered by the Judge and
       whilst the outcome may be the same I  accept  the  joint  submission
       that the  Judge  should  have  dealt  with  that  report  and  other
       objective evidence before rejecting the claim.


   11. Whilst SSH does not suggest a successful outcome for the appellant I
       accept the evidence should have been considered  and  if  the  Judge
       still  felt  the  findings  in  SSH  and  the  earlier  case  of  BA
       (Demonstrator in Britain-risk on return) CG (Iran)  [2011]  UKUT  36
       (IAC) stood then it would have been open for him to say as much.

   12. In the circumstances I find there is an error in law.

   13. Both representatives agreed that the case should be remitted to  the
       First-tier Tribunal.

DECISION

   14. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

   15. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  these
       issues to be addressed hearing under Section 12  of  the  Tribunals,
       Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

   16. The matter should not be  listed  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal T Jones.

   17. A Kurdish Sorani interpreter is required.


   18. The case be listed in Bradford.


Signed:                                 Dated:
