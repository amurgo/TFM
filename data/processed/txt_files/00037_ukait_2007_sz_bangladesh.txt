For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


There is no general duty on the Tribunal to consider  whether  a  claimant's
case if differently  presented  or  if  made  the  subject  of  a  different
application might have succeeded on a different basis  from  that  on  which
the application or claim was made.  Although individual claimants cannot  be
expected to know the Immigration Rules, there can be no  complaint  if  they
receive  a  judgment  on  the  application  or  claim  as   they   put   it.
Exceptionally, however, the facts of a case or, in particular, the terms  of
a notice of decision may require the Tribunal to consider the  appeal  on  a
number of alternative bases.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who was born on  25  February
     1987.  On 9 November 2004, the appellant applied for  entry  clearance
     to join the sponsor in the United Kingdom as her adopted child.  On 12
     April 2005, the respondent refused her application and her  subsequent
     appeal was dismissed by Immigration Judge O'Garro in  a  determination
     sent on  6  January  2006.   The  appellant  sought  and  was  granted
     reconsideration of that decision on 17 February 2006.   As  a  result,
     the matter now comes before us.

  2. The sponsor is the appellant's aunt.  The appellant is the youngest of
     6 children of the sponsor's brother who lives in Bangladesh.   Because
     of the family's circumstances, the sponsor  began  looking  after  the
     appellant when she was 3 years of age.  In 1993, the  appellant  moved
     to the United Kingdom.  In 1996, she returned to Bangladesh and,  with
     her husband,  adopted  the  appellant  under  Bangladeshi  law  on  20
     September 1996.  The sponsor returned to the UK and the appellant  has
     since that time lived with, and  been  cared  for  by,  the  sponsor's
     husband (her adoptive father) and his sister.  Since the  adoption  in
     1996, the sponsor has visited the appellant in  Bangladesh  for  short
     periods in 1999 and 2000 and at the time of the application  in  2005.
     At the date of the decision,  the  sponsor  had  indefinite  leave  to
     remain in the UK and, at the hearing, we were told that she  became  a
     British Citizen in 2006.  These facts were not in dispute before us.

  3. Mr Fripp, who represented the appellant before us, did not take  issue
     with the Immigration Judge's decision in respect  of  the  immigration
     rules relied on before her.  He accepted that in dismissing the appeal
     the Immigration Judge had  correctly  applied  the  relevant  adoption
     rules in HC 395, namely paragraphs 310 (read with 309A)  and  316A  to
     the appellant's case.  He accepted that the  appellant's  adoption  in
     Bangladesh could not fall within paragraph 310 because it was not  one
     recognised in UK law and because the sponsor had lived in the UK since
     1996 she could not satisfy the definition of a de  facto  adoption  in
     paragraph 309A.  Likewise, he accepted that the  appellant  could  not
     satisfy the requirements for admission with a view to  adoption  under
     paragraph 316A.  At the date of decision, the appellant was an adult -
     she was 18 years of age - and hence could not be adopted  in  the  UK.
     Mr Fripp also did not challenge the Immigration  Judge's  decision  in
     respect of Article 8 of the ECHR.

  4. Instead, Mr Fripp submitted that the Immigration Judge  had  erred  in
     law in failing to consider the application of paragraph 297 of HC  395
     to the appellant's case.   He  submitted  that  the  sponsor  was  the
     appellant's  aunt  and  hence,  potentially,  came  within   paragraph
     297(i)(f) which, providing all the other requirements of the paragraph
     were met, allowed for admission where:

           "a relative is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom...and
           there are serious and compelling family or other  considerations
           which make exclusion  of  the  child  undesirable  and  suitable
           arrangements have been made for the child's care;..."

  5. Mr Fripp submitted that the facts should have  drawn  the  Immigration
     Judge's attention to this provision's  potential  applicability.   The
     Immigration Judge had a  duty  under  s.  86(3)  of  the  Nationality,
     Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to allow the appeal if the

           "decision against which the appeal is brought  ...  was  not  in
           accordance with the law (including immigration rules)".

  6. At first blush, Mr Fripp's submission is a  bold  one.   It  seeks  to
     found an error of law  on  a  failure  by  the  Immigration  Judge  to
     consider a paragraph of the Immigration Rules  which  was  not  raised
     before her by the representative (not Mr Fripp) who then appeared  for
     the appellant.  That does not necessarily mean that it  is  doomed  to
     fail.

  7. Does an Immigration Judge have a duty to consider whether an appellant
     meets the requirements of any of the immigration rules  even  if  they
     are not relied upon by  the  appellant?   That  is,  in  essence,  the
     question posed by Mr Fripp's submissions.  Neither  Mr  Fripp  nor  Mr
     Walker, who represented the respondent,  drew  our  attention  to  any
     relevant authorities.   There are, however, a number  of  cases  which
     may have some bearing upon the answer to this question.

  8. The correct starting point must,  in  our  view,  be  the  appellant's
     application for entry clearance or leave.  It is the basis upon  which
     that is made which must inform the decision-maker (and on  appeal  the
     Tribunal) of the appropriate immigration rule or rules which should be
     considered and applied.  This is not to say that  the  applicant  must
     identify and specify the rules upon which  he  or  she  relies.   That
     would often be to expect too much in practice and  would  be  uncalled
     for on any legal basis.  Nevertheless, it is the applicant's  duty  to
     set out the factual matrix for their application to enter the UK as  a
     spouse, an adopted child, a dependent relative, a student,  a  visitor
     and so on.   The decision-maker must then make an assessment  of  what
     immigration  rule  or  rules  that  application  engages  and  respond
     accordingly.  Thus, not only must the correct rule be  identified  and
     applied (CP Dominica [2006] UKAIT 00040), but also if  an  application
     (as presented) could  be  considered  under  alternative  parts  of  a
     relevant rule it will be the decision-maker's duty to do so (see,  IAT
     v Tohur Ali [1988] Imm AR 237 (CA)  and  Mohammed  Fazor  Ali  v  SSHD
     [1988] Imm AR 274 (CA)).   An  example  of  this  might  arise  in  an
     application by a dependent child under paragraph 297  or  a  dependent
     adult relative under  paragraph  317.   More  than  one  part  of  the
     relevant rule might  be  applicable  or  become  applicable  when  the
     decision-maker examines the evidence and determines the facts.

  9. Although, the authorities recognise that the decision-maker (including
     the Tribunal) must consider all the relevant parts  of  an  applicable
     rule, the duty to  consider  the  applicable  rules  is  not  an  all-
     embracing obligation to seek out and find any (or  every)  potentially
     applicable rule.  In Mohammed Fazor Ali v SSHD Mann LJ pointed out (at
     p. 282) it was not

           "any part of an immigration officer's duty to conduct  a  roving
           expedition through all the paragraphs to see  whether  a  person
           before him is eligible under any of them."

 10. Without  deciding  the  issue,  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  expressed
     scepticism as to whether the Tribunal  is  required  to  consider  the
     application of immigration rules  not  directly  relied  upon  by  the
     appellant (see Tohur Ali, especially per Balcombe LJ  at  p.  247  and
     Woolf LJ at p. 255).

 11. It is important to bear in mind that the Tribunal is not  the  primary
     decision-maker  in  immigration  cases.   It  hears  appeals   against
     decisions taken (see, EA Nigeria  [2007]  UKAIT  00013,  at  para  [7]
     clarifying the relevance in appeals of  post-decision  facts  and  the
     application of s.85(4) of the 2002 Act).  Consequently, the  focus  of
     enquiry by the Tribunal must  always  be  the  basis  upon  which  the
     application was made.  It is  that  application  which  leads  to  the
     decision which is the subject of any appeal before the  Tribunal.   If
     an appellant seeks to assert a different basis from that  put  forward
     in his application upon  which  he  should  have  been  granted  entry
     clearance or leave under the immigration rules,  that  is  properly  a
     matter for a fresh application or possibly a variation of the existing
     application.  It is not a matter for the Tribunal to  consider  on  an
     appeal against the decision made on the existing application.

 12. Thus, in Uddin v SSHD [1991] Imm AR 134  (CA)  it  was  held  that  an
     adjudicator did not err in law when dealing with an appeal  against  a
     refusal of leave on the basis of marriage when he failed  to  consider
     the application of a rule dealing with co-habitees  which  might  have
     been applicable when he held the  marriage  to  be  invalid.   Perhaps
     echoing the words of Mann LJ, quoted above, McCowan LJ remarked (at p.
     144):

           "...if one of the appellate authorities ... has  regard  to  and
           applies the rules applicable to the  decision  which  is  before
           him, he need do no more.  Indeed he ought not to embark  on  any
           roving expedition among the rules to see if  there  is  anything
           which might be of assistance to one side or another."

 13. Applying this  approach,  we  have  considerable  doubt  whether  some
     earlier IAT decisions which suggest that - even in the  absence  of  a
     specific application - the Tribunal should consider the application of
     the rules concerning fianc�(e)s where, on appeal from a refusal  under
     the marriage rules, it is decided that the marriage is for some reason
     invalid (see, e.g. Mohammed Ach-Charki v SSHD [1991] Imm AR 162).   We
     are not persuaded that an application based upon an existing  marriage
     can also be seen as  one  based  upon  prospective  marriage,  and  so
     require an immigration judge to consider the case on that  basis.   It
     seems to us that the proper approach to such cases is that the  appeal
     should be dismissed and the appellant should make a fresh  application
     as a fianc�(e).

 14. It follows that in the generality of cases it will be obvious from the
     application which immigration rule (or rules) must be considered.  The
     nature of the application, the statements  within  it  and  the  boxes
     ticked will indicate that the appellant is seeking entry clearance  or
     leave, for example on the basis of marriage, as a  family  visitor,  a
     dependent relative or as a student.  (This will be particularly so for
     in-country applications where a specific prescribed form must be  used
     depending upon the basis for  the  application:  see  the  Immigration
     (Leave to Remain) (Prescribed Forms and Procedures)  Regulations  2006
     (SI 2006/1421).)  As a result, the Tribunal's scope of enquiry will be
     circumscribed and focussed upon a clearly applicable rule (or  rules).



 15. It must always be borne in mind that the Tribunal is concerned with an
     appeal against a particular decision and that the  grounds  will  have
     been set out in the notice of appeal.   Whatever  may  have  been  the
     position under earlier  Procedure  Rules,  the  2005  Procedure  Rules
     envisage that, albeit subject to amendment, those grounds  define  the
     ambit of the appeal (rule 14).   That feature of  appeals  before  the
     Tribunal may itself be sufficient to delimit the  immigration  judge's
     task.

 16. However, there will occasionally be situations where the basis of  the
     application, or the scope of the decision, or the grounds  themselves,
     do require the Tribunal  to  consider  more  than  the  self-evidently
     applicable rule.  Where there is an obvious link or connection between
     another rule and the primary way in which the application  or  grounds
     are put it may be the obligation of the Tribunal to consider and apply
     another rule subject always  to  the  requirements  of  fairness.   In
     particular, if there is reason to suppose that the appellant may  want
     to challenge the decision on grounds other than those set out  in  the
     notice of appeal, there may in certain circumstances be an  obligation
     to consider whether the grounds of appeal should be amended.

 17. In this appeal, the appellant's primary case  was  that  she  was  the
     adopted child of the sponsor.  Her application also clearly raised the
     fact that she was the niece of the sponsor  and  dependent  upon  her.
     In substance, though not form, her application could, and we would say
     should, have been understood as also asserting a claim under paragraph
     297 as a dependent child.   Although it was not put in this way before
     us, it seems clear from the "Notice of Immigration Decision" that  the
     ECO thought so also.  Having considered the adoption  aspects  of  the
     application, he states:

           "I have also considered your application to join  [the  sponsor]
           in the UK under other paragraphs of the Immigration  Rules,  but
           as the niece of the sponsor  you  do  not  qualify.   I  am  not
           satisfied that there are any serious and  compelling  family  or
           other considerations which make your exclusion undesirable."

 18. The ECO makes no explicit mention of paragraph 297 but we  are  in  no
     doubt from the words used it was paragraph 297(i)(f) that  he  had  in
     mind.   The grounds  of  appeal  appear  to  have  been  drafted  with
     professional help but though copious are far from clear.   It  appears
     to us, however, that the passage that reads as  follows  is  referable
     only to the ECO's decision under para 297:

           "7. The ECO  failed  to  consider  properly  serious  and  other
           compelling considerations which make the  appellant's  exclusion
           undesirable."

 19.  For  that  reason,  the  Immigration  Judge  should  have  considered
     paragraph 297  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  not  raised  by  the
     appellant's then representative at the hearing because of her duty  to
     consider "any matter raised as a ground of appeal" under  s.  86(2)(a)
     of the 2002 Act.  In failing to do so, the Immigration Judge erred  in
     law.  However, we do not consider that her error was material  as,  on
     the evidence, the appellant was bound to fail under paragraph 297.

 20. Mr Fripp put forward a number of factors which,  he  submitted,  taken
     together  satisfied  the  requirement  in  paragraph  297(i)(f).   His
     submissions, in effect, rely upon the fact of  the  adoption  and  the
     continued separation as  amounting  to  the  "serious  and  compelling
     circumstances"  making  the  appellant's   exclusion   from   the   UK
     undesirable.  He reminded us that the appellant has been cared for  by
     the sponsor since she was 3 years old and even after the sponsor  came
     to the UK in 1993 when the appellant was  6  years  old  she  remained
     responsible.  The sponsor has taken  the  critical  decisions  in  the
     sponsor's life albeit largely from the  UK.   She  has  supported  the
     appellant financially and kept in contact by telephone and visits.  Mr
     Fripp submitted that, although the appellant was  now  an  adult,  the
     parental role continued and it was  undesirable  that  she  should  be
     separated from her mother in the UK.

 21. We accept the role that the sponsor has played since the appellant was
     3 years old.  It remains the fact, however, that since 1993  (some  12
     years before the date of decision) the sponsor has not lived with  the
     appellant who has been in the UK.  Since the  adoption  in  1996,  the
     sponsor has visited, so far as  we  can  tell,  on  only  3  occasions
     including at the time of  the  making  the  application  to  join  the
     sponsor in the UK.  The appellant is (and was at the date of decision)
     an adult.  Although her claim  cannot  fail  under  paragraph  297(ii)
     solely on that basis (paragraph 27), that does not make it  irrelevant
     in applying  the  words  of  paragraph  297(i)(f).   At  the  date  of
     decision, she was, in fact, no longer a child.   She  lives,  and  has
     lived for the last 10 years, with her adoptive father and his  sister.
     It has not been suggested that this has created any problems  for  the
     appellant apart from the fact that she is not with her other  adoptive
     parent, the sponsor, in  the  UK.   This  is  not  a  case  where  the
     appellant's  admission  is  necessary  to  unite  her  with  her  only
     responsible parent.   It is not suggested that the sponsor  has  "sole
     responsibility" for the appellant - no reliance is  placed  upon  that
     basis for admission in paragraph 297(i)(e).   If she came  to  the  UK
     she would still be separated from one of her adoptive parents - indeed
     the one she has lived with since 1996.  In  our  judgment,  given  the
     family situation and living arrangements of  the  appellant  with  her
     other adoptive parent and absent any evidence of any  hardship  beyond
     the separation from the sponsor, the evidence before  the  Immigration
     Judge came  nowhere  near  satisfying  the  requirement  in  paragraph
     297(i)(f) that there are  "serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
     considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable".





Decision

 22. Although, for the reasons we have given,  the  Immigration  Judge  was
     wrong not to consider the application of paragraph 297, that error  of
     law was not material to her decision.  The  decision  to  dismiss  the
     appeal under the Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the ECHR stands.
