     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer to  the  appellant  as  "the
      entry clearance officer" and the respondent as "the claimant."


   2. Notice of hearing of this appeal was sent by first class post  to  the
      claimant care of Mrs Neeva  Karki,  his  sponsor,  at  her  Hillingdon
      address. Its date, time and place were clearly set out in  the  notice
      itself. The notice was sent to the sponsor herself  and  to  Aschfords
      Law at their address in  Harrow,  Middlesex.  The  claimant  had  been
      represented before the First-tier Tribunal by counsel,  instructed  by
      Aschfords Law. Directions were also set out in the notice of hearing.


   3. The claimant has not filed any Rule 24 response.


   4. In the circumstances, having regard to paragraph 38  of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  being  satisfied  that  the
      parties have been notified of the hearing  or  that  reasonable  steps
      have been taken to notify them, I consider that it is in the interests
      of justice to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the  claimant
      or representative.


   5. The claimant is a national of Nepal born on 19th September  1984.  His
      appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
      respondent to grant him an entry clearance as a partner under Appendix
      FM of the Immigration Rules was allowed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge in a determination promulgated on 23rd  April  2014.  The  entry
      clearance officer refused  the  application  on  the  basis  that  the
      claimant  had  not  provided  evidence  relating  to   the   financial
      requirements under Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.


   6. In allowing his appeal under the rules, the Judge was  satisfied  that
      the claimant and his sponsor met the threshold "as  should  have  been
      calculated with the correct figure  from  the  P60  for  April  2013".
      Despite an overlap between the figure in  2012  and  2013,  the  right
      figure to use is that in the P60 for April 2013 as the 2012 P60  could
      not have included any  of  the  correct  figures  for  the  claimant's
      application. As this was not a points based  system  case,  the  Judge
      held that he was entitled to take into account evidence pertaining  to
      the date of decision, namely the P60 for April 2013 as it  covers  the
      wages the sponsor was earning as at the date of  application  and  the
      date of decision.


   7. The Judge also had regard to the calculation of the figure relating to
      savings which was over �21,000. The Judge accepted  that  counsel  had
      correctly calculated the figure in respect of  savings  with  all  the
      documents before him. That meant that the  sponsor  and  the  claimant
      went beyond the threshold which was wrongly calculated in the  reasons
      for refusal letter. The balance statements presented showed funds over
      the period April 2012 to September 2012, which is  six  months  before
      the application was made. The various statements are set out.


   8. On 21st May 2014, First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted the  entry
      clearance officer permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge. He found that the grounds of appeal and the
      determination disclosed an arguable  error  of  law  inasmuch  as  the
      immigration rules, Appendix  FM-SE  set  out  the  types  of  evidence
      required  but  the  Judge  "has  had  no  regard  to   this   in   the
      determination"; nor had he had any regard to the  relevant  date,  the
      date of the application and the evidence prior to that  date  and  the
      claimant's sponsor's annual gross income was below the threshold.


   9. Ms Kenny submitted that the rules  reagrding  the  specified  evidence
      required to be produced are comprehensively set out in Appendix FM-SE.
      This includes the evidence required, the periods they  cover  and  the
      format that they should be in. The  First-tier  Tribunal  has  had  no
      regard to this in the determination.  Accordingly  there  has  been  a
      failure to comply with the immigration rules and the findings  are  in
      the circumstances unsustainable.


  10. Nor has the Tribunal had regard to the relevant date. For Appendix FM,
      the  significant  date  is  the  date  of  the  application  and   the
      significant evidence is from the specified period  before  that  date.
      The Tribunal did not address that evidence from prior to the  date  of
      application. That also renders the conclusions unsustainable.


  11. In the event, she submitted that  the  evidence  as  at  the  date  of
      application meant that the sponsor's actual gross  annual  income  was
      below the threshold and as such the maintenance requirement could  not
      be fulfilled. It is stated by entry clearance officer that it is  also
      worth noting that if the sponsor's  current  income  does  exceed  the
      income threshold, there is no reason  to  prevent  the  claimant  from
      making a fresh application based on the sponsor's income at this time.




  12. At the hearing on 2nd July 2014,  Ms  Kenny  produced  a  consolidated
      version of the current immigration rules relating to  Appendix  FM-SE.
      The  date  of  application  was  1st  October   2013.   The   evidence
      subsequently presented was the P60 to April 2014.  However,  the  said
      P60 had not been available as at the date  of  the  decision  in  this
      case. The Judge nevertheless accepted figures relating  to  employment
      with regard to the April 2013 P60.


  13. Ms Kenny submitted that in order to meet the financial requirements of
      the rules, the claimant's sponsor needed a gross income  of  at  least
      �18,600 per annum. His wife was employed since 2006.  She  provided  a
      P60 as evidence of her income which stated that she earned  �11,562.40
      in the last tax year (that was for the period 2011-12).


  14. In order to meet the  financial  requirements  the  claimant  and  his
      sponsor had to demonstrate that the total of �33594 had been  held  in
      savings for the relevant six months, i.e.,  �7037.60  times  2.5  plus
      �16,000.


  15. The Judge  had  at  paragraph  32  referred  to  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer's contentions relating to the amount of �33,594 required to be
      held in savings  for  six  months  in  order  to  meet  the  financial
      requirements. It was noted that although the  sponsor  stated  on  the
      sponsorship declaration that she held to the tune of �17,500, from her
      bank statements she had not held those funds for a consecutive  period
      of six months.


  16. Ms Kenny submitted that the P60  should  not  have  been  accepted  as
      evidence of earnings. However, the  amount  required  was  �33,594  in
      savings. It is asserted that there is thus a deficit of  over  �12,500
      as the First-tier Judge accepted that the figure of savings  with  all
      the documents before him amounted to �21,000.


  17. The Judge had no regard at all to the requirements and  in  particular
      the kind of evidence  that  was  required  from  Appendix  FM-SE.  The
      relevant date was the date of the application.


  18. The Judge however had regard to the  P60  for  April  2013.  That  was
      'impermissible'. There was no explanation or evidence as to what  that
      showed the salary of the sponsor to have been for the six months prior
      to the date of application. It is  not  known,  for  example,  whether
      substantial amounts of that income occurred evenly over the period  or
      whether the earnings were greater after the date of application.


  19. It is also significant that no wage slips for the six months prior  to
      the date of application had been submitted.


      Assessment


  20. I find that the Judge has not had regard to Appendix FM-SE as part  of
      the determination. There is no reference to  that  appendix  regarding
      the specified evidence required to  be  produced.  Nor  is  there  any
      regard to the evidence required in respect of the periods  they  cover
      or indeed the format that they should be in.


  21. Moreover, the relevant date is the date of  the  application  and  the
      evidence required to be furnished relates to the period of six  months
      before that date. That evidence has not been considered  or  addressed
      for the period prior to the date of application.


  22. It appears that the sponsor's actual gross annual income was below the
      threshold  and  that  the  maintenance  requirements  could   not   be
      fulfilled. The figures presented did not add up to the �21,000  relied
      on for the period April to October 2012.


  23. I am accordingly satisfied that there has not been a proper regard  to
      the relevant immigration  rules  and  in  particular  Appendix  FM-SE.
      Further, there has been reliance on evidence that was not in existence
      prior to the date of application. In any event, it is not  clear  what
      the claimant's income was for the six months  prior  to  the  date  of
      application.


  24. I accordingly find for the reasons given  that  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law.
      The decision is accordingly set aside.


  25. Ms Kenny very fairly submitted that it would be inappropriate to  make
      a final disposal of  the  appeal  and  that  the  claimant  should  be
      afforded an adequate opportunity to make submissions relating  to  the
      proper disposal. In that respect, she submitted that there should be a
      case management review where both parties are required  to  attend  in
      order to make appropriate submissions.


  26. It is unfortunate that there was no attendance  or  representation  on
      behalf of the claimant. The directions clearly stated that the parties
      were to prepare for the hearing on the basis that if it  were  decided
      to set  aside  the  determination,  any  further  evidence,  including
      supplementary oral evidence  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  may  need  to
      consider if it decides to re-make the decision, can be  so  considered
      at that hearing.


  27. In the circumstances, I accept that it would be in  the  interests  of
      justice to afford the claimant, his sponsor  and  representatives  the
      opportunity to make submissions at a CMR  which  should  be  scheduled
      within six weeks of the decision being sent to the parties.


     Hearing on 2 October 2014


  28. On 1st August 2014, the claimant's solicitors, Aschfords Law wrote  to
      the Tribunal, stating that "we on behalf  of  the  appellant  and  the
      sponsor had withdrawn the hearing by a letter  dated  25th  June  2014
      which was posted first class."


  29. The letter  was  placed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  for  his
      consideration. A notice was subsequently issued in  response  to  that
      letter. It was noted that the appeal in the Upper Tribunal was by  the
      Entry Clearance Officer. It was not open to the claimant  to  withdraw
      another party's appeal. It was accordingly directed  that  the  appeal
      would remain in the system for hearing and it would be  a  matter  for
      the claimant whether he wishes to attend.


  30. Notice of hearing was given to  the  claimant  and  his  sponsor.  The
      matter was stood down until the end of the list. There was however  no
      appearance on behalf of the claimant.


  31. I accordingly proceeded with the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal.


  32. Mr Whitwell submitted that there had been a  failure  to  provide  the
      necessary  specified  evidence  in  accordance  with  Appendix  FM-SE.
      Further, the sponsor's actual gross income was below the threshold and
      accordingly the maintenance requirements could  not  be  fulfilled.  I
      accept those submissions for teh reasons already given.


     Decision


      The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  material  errors  of  law.  The
      following decision is substituted:


      The claimant's appeal is dismissed.


      The fee award made by the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set
 aside.


     No anonymity direction made.
