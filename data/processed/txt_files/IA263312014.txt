For the Appellant:     Ms S. Haji of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting  Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS
The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of  India  born  on  15th  March  1989.   He
    appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 3rd June 2014 which
    was to refuse him leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended.  His appeal was allowed  by  Judge
    of the First-tier  Tribunal  Majid  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  9th
    September 2015.  The Respondent appealed against that decision and  the
    matter came before me on 14th March 2016 to determine whether there was
    an error of law in the First-tier decision.  On 26th April 2016 I  gave
    my decision that there was indeed an error of law and I set  aside  the
    decision of the First Tier and  directed  that  the  appeal  should  be
    reheard before me on a date to be fixed.  I have now reheard the appeal
    and give my decision herein.  For  the  sake  of  convenience  I  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they were known at first  instance.



2.   The Appellant's case was that  he  was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  with  a  British  citizen  Ms  Gabrielle  Crawford  ("the
    Sponsor") a relationship which began in 2010.  The parties  married  on
    10th August  2013  and  the  Appellant  argued  that  the  Respondent's
    decision was both contrary to the Immigration Rules and  to  Article  8
    (right to  respect  for  private  and  family  life)  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.  The burden  of  establishing  this  rested
    upon the Appellant and the  standard  of  proof  was  the  usual  civil
    standard of balance of probabilities.

3.   I set out the background to this case in  my  decision  of  26th  April
    2016 when I wrote:

     "2. The Appellant claimed that he had entered the  United  Kingdom  in
         December 2007 after leaving India due to ill-treatment as a  result
         of a refusal to follow the Sikh faith.  The  Sponsor  required  his
         support as she suffered from  depression  and  was  on  medication.
         Should he be removed this would have a detrimental  effect  on  his
         wife's health.  The Respondent accepted  the  relationship  between
         the Appellant and the Sponsor but considered  that  there  were  no
         insurmountable obstacles to the  Appellant  continuing  his  family
         life outside the United Kingdom.  The Sponsor would be able to join
         the  Appellant  in  India  as  he  could  help  her   through   the
         transitional period on relocation to that  country.   If  necessary
         she could receive medical treatment in India.

    3.   At the hearing at first instance Judge Majid heard  oral  evidence
         from both the Appellant and the Sponsor.  She told the  Judge  that
         she was earning �27,000 per annum as a medical secretary.  She  had
         never been to India.  In allowing the appeal  the  Judge  found  at
         paragraph 23 of his determination  that  the  Appellant  should  be
         helped by the system because the Sponsor was "a  partial"  and  has
         the constitutional right to be protected.  If the only solution was
         that the Appellant should go back to India and apply  to  join  his
         wife in this country then  she  should  be  given  the  benefit  of
         discretion and the appeal should be allowed outright.

    4.   The Respondent appealed against that  decision  arguing  that  the
         Judge had failed to give adequate reasons for making findings on  a
         material  matter.   There  was  no  indication  of  the   balancing
         exercise.  The Appellant had arrived in the United  Kingdom  as  an
         illegal entrant in 2008  and  had  not  sought  to  regularise  his
         immigration  status  until  after  he  was  arrested  for   working
         illegally in 2013.  The grounds of  appeal  also  took  issue  with
         certain factual matters and concluded that it was notable that  the
         First Tier Tribunal had had no regard to the factors  contained  in
         Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
         particularly the precarious nature of the  Appellant's  immigration
         status prior to making a claim.

    5.   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pooler in granting permission  to
         appeal found it arguable  that  Judge  Majid  had  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons for his findings.  There were disputed matters  in
         respect to which the Judge arguably failed  to  make  findings  and
         that the Judge arguably gave weight to irrelevant matters.  Insofar
         as the Judge considered Article 8 outside  the  Rules  he  arguably
         misdirected himself by failing to take into account the  provisions
         of Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

    6.   At the hearing before me Counsel sought to argue that there was no
         error of law in the Judge's decision.  He had made it clear that he
         had analysed the evidence  and  there  was  a  lot  of  documentary
         evidence.  The Judge found the evidence of the witnesses  credible.
         The  Appellant's  wife  could  not  relocate  to  India.   She  had
         depression.  The Appellant had also given evidence at the  Tribunal
         about why he could not relocate to India.   He  feared  retribution
         from his father  because  the  Appellant  did  not  consent  to  an
         arranged marriage.

    7.   After hearing Counsel's submissions I indicated that I found clear
         errors of law in the  determination  which  was  almost  completely
         devoid of reasoning.  Despite  brave  efforts  by  the  Appellant's
         Counsel to support the determination it was clear that it had to be
         set aside.  It was  impossible  from  this  determination  for  the
         losing party (in this case the Respondent)  to  see  why  they  had
         lost.  It was not at all clear how the Judge  had  arrived  at  the
         conclusion  that  the  appeal  should  be   allowed   outside   the
         Immigration Rules under Article 8 and  there  were  a  few  if  any
         findings on any of the relevant matters upon which the Judge needed
         to make findings.  These included the matters listed in  the  grant
         of permission to appeal.

    8.   Having indicated that the appeal needed to be reheard I considered
         whether the matter should  remain  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  be
         remitted back to the  First-tier.  I  have  considered  the  Senior
         President's Practice Direction and am of the view  that  this  case
         does not fall into the category of those cases  which  need  to  be
         remitted. The case turns on whether the appeal  should  be  allowed
         outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  There  is  documentary  evidence
         already and this can be readily supplemented by further  statements
         and/or oral evidence.  I had hoped that I would be able  to  obtain
         the First-tier Tribunal's Record of Proceedings which  would  be  a
         record of the evidence  given  below.  That  would  mean  that  the
         Appellant and Ms Crawford would  not  need  to  give  evidence  any
         further and the matter could be dealt with by way  of  submissions.
         Unfortunately it has not been possible for me to obtain a Record of
         the Proceedings and therefore  it  will  be  necessary  for  me  to
         reconvene the case for oral evidence to be given by  the  Appellant
         and Ms Crawford.

    9.   I therefore set aside the First Tier decision on the grounds of an
         error of law and will proceed to rehear the matter on a date to  be
         fixed when the Appellant and Ms Crawford should attend to give oral
         testimony.  It is open to the Appellant and his witness to  put  in
         further updated statements if  so  advised.   Any  such  statements
         should be filed and served at least fourteen days before  the  next
         hearing. I make no anonymity direction as there is no public policy
         reason for so doing."

Documentary Evidence

4.   For the hearing before me the Respondent relied  on  the  bundle  filed
    for the First-tier proceedings which contained immigration  information
    on form PF1; correspondence with the  Appellant's  representatives  and
    Statement of  Additional  Grounds;  statements  of  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor; divorce documents regarding the Sponsor  and  her  ex-husband;
    utility bills and employment  documentation  of  the  Sponsor;  medical
    evidence for the Sponsor;  letters  of  support  and  other  supporting
    documents.

5.   For the Appellant reliance was placed on  the  bundle  filed  at  first
    instance which comprised chronology, statements of  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor; copy of the Appellant's Indian passport;  photographs  of  the
    couple and correspondence showing the genuineness and subsisting nature
    of the relationship; financial information for the Sponsor and a bundle
    of case law.

The Rehearing Before Me

6.   Both the Appellant and Sponsor attended and gave oral testimony.   They
    were examined and cross-examined but neither were re-examined.

The Evidence of the Appellant

7.   The Appellant adopted his statement in which he stated he was  born  on
    15th March 1989 in the Punjab province of India.   He  left  school  at
    aged 13 or 14 years and worked thereafter on the family farm.  He had a
    poor relationship with his father who abused  him  for  no  reason  and
    arranged that when the Appellant became 18 years old that the Appellant
    would marry the daughter of a family friend (who lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom) called Sonia.  The Appellant did not wish  to  do  this.   His
    mother sympathised with her son and  arrangements  were  made  for  the
    Appellant to travel to Italy in November 2007.  Later in December  2007
    he arrived in the United Kingdom by car.  After two years he  moved  to
    south London where he  assisted  a  family  friend  running  a  chicken
    takeaway shop.

8.   He got to know the Sponsor through his work at the shop and they  began
    going out around about December 2010.  He lost  his  job  in  2011  and
    moved in with the Sponsor in December of that year and they have  lived
    together ever since.  She was aware of the difficulties  the  Appellant
    had with his father.  In January 2013 members of his family took him to
    a temple in Manchester to force him to marry  Sonia.  He  explained  to
    Sonia he did not wish to marry her and travelled back to  London.   The
    Appellant was reluctant to inform the police of this incident as he had
    no lawful status in this country and was concerned he might be removed.
     As the relationship with the Sponsor deepened the parties  decided  to
    marry and did so on 10th August 2013 the Appellant having converted  to
    Christianity after meeting the Sponsor.

9.   The Appellant came to the attention  of  the  authorities  following  a
    burglary in the street where the Appellant lived.  The  police  carried
    out routine checks and discovered the Appellant had  no  status  to  be
    here. He was given instructions to report  weekly  to  the  Respondent.
    This the Appellant did and in May 2014 he  instructed  a  solicitor  to
    make an application on the basis of his relationship with the  Sponsor.
    This was refused by the Respondent on 3rd  June  2014.   The  Appellant
    indicated in his statement (dated 4th February 2014) that  he  did  not
    wish to return to India as he could not  get  in  touch  with  his  own
    family because he had brought shame upon them for not agreeing  to  the
    arranged marriage they had organised.

10.  In oral evidence-in-chief the  Appellant  accepted  that  he  had  been
    working illegally for two years helping out his  uncle.   His  sister's
    husband had been looking after the Appellant at first but  his  brother
    in law had returned to India and the  Appellant  had  nowhere  else  to
    stay.  If he had not taken that job he would have ended up sleeping  on
    the street.  He could not return to India because he still had problems
    with his father.  It would put the Sponsor in  danger  if  he  were  to
    return with her, she had a job and friends here, it was impossible  for
    her to leave the United Kingdom.

11.  In cross-examination the Appellant accepted  it  was  not  in  fact  an
    uncle who had given him employment  it  was  a  family  friend  but  he
    referred to the friend as uncle.  The friend had helped because he knew
    of the Appellant's circumstances, that the Appellant's  father  was  an
    alcoholic who had assaulted the Appellant in India.  The  friend  could
    not help the Appellant if he was returned.  The Appellant  was  helping
    out in the kitchen when the deliveries came in.  He would sort the food
    out and put it in the refrigerator.  He could not leave his wife and go
    to India, internal relocation to a city within India was impossible  as
    everything was new to him, he had no skills, his education was limited.
     Sometimes he was in contact with his mother but no one else.

The Evidence of the Sponsor

12.  In her statement she confirmed she was born on 9th March  1964  in  the
    United Kingdom and was a British national.  She had met  the  Appellant
    in or about October/November 2010 when she used to frequent  the  local
    chicken  shop.   She  was  suffering  from  depression  and  had   been
    prescribed medication as she had split up  with  her  ex-partner.   The
    relationship with the Appellant deepened and they  saw  each  other  as
    partners from about March 2011.  The Appellant informed her then  about
    his family problems and the arranged marriage that  the  family  wanted
    him to undergo. Following advice from an Immigration Officer the couple
    approached a solicitor and made an application after their marriage for
    the Appellant to remain in this country which was refused.

13.  In examination-in-chief she said that she would not relocate  to  India
    even if the Appellant's appeal was dismissed and he was  forced  to  go
    back.  She had her job in this country which she had had for  the  last
    ten years and her mother  was  here.   The  Sponsor's  mother  depended
    heavily on the Sponsor.  The Sponsor herself was  still  being  treated
    for depression.  She had been off  work  for  four  months  and  helped
    through it by her GP, she was going back to work  now  on  a  graduated
    basis.  The Appellant gave her a lot of support.  She  could  not  just
    leave everything.  She was only now just getting back to  full  health.
    She did not speak any Indian languages and the health care  system  out
    there was private.  The couple had no savings or money to live on.  She
    herself was on disability benefits.

14.  In cross-examination the Sponsor said she  had  two  brothers  and  one
    sister.  One brother  lived  in  Australia  and  the  sister  lived  in
    Penzance, Cornwall.  Her second brother had a high flying job.  All  of
    the care required by the Sponsor's mother fell upon  the  shoulders  of
    the Sponsor.  The Sponsor's mother lived on  her  own  having  divorced
    from the Sponsor's father but she did not have a carer.   She  saw  her
    mother two to three times per week.  Her mother had  some  friends  who
    also  came  and  visited  but  whenever  the  Sponsor's  mother  wanted
    something it was the Sponsor that the mother turned  to.   The  Sponsor
    had  been  on  medication  since  2002  and  had  various  amounts   of
    counselling recently sorted out by the GP.  She  was  waiting  for  the
    referral to be processed.  She had not looked into the  possibility  of
    employment in India for either herself of the Appellant.

Closing Submissions

15.  In closing for the  Respondent  reliance  was  placed  on  the  refusal
    letter.  This had accepted that the relationship between the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor was genuine and subsisting  but  did  not  accept  that
    there would be any  difficulties  for  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  to
    establish  a  family  life  in  India.   Treatment  for  mental  health
    including medication and support was  available  in  India  should  the
    Sponsor require this upon relocation.

16.  The Presenting Officer indicated that the Appellant would  be  able  to
    support himself, the alleged  difficulties  with  individuals  in  this
    country had never been reported to the police  nor  had  the  Appellant
    made any complaint to the authorities in India.  The Appellant's  claim
    at its highest was a fear of his own family.  The Appellant  was  still
    in contact with his mother and he could relocate to  a  large  city  in
    India.

17.   The  Appellant  could  not  succeed  under   the   Immigration   Rules
    particularly under EX1 because the Appellant  had  no  status  in  this
    country at the time that he made his application for leave.  In Agyarko
    [2015] EWCA Civ 440  the Court of  Appeal  had  said  that  the  phrase
    "insurmountable obstacles"  to  family  life  with  a  British  citizen
    partner continuing outside the United Kingdom clearly  imposed  a  high
    hurdle to be overcome by an applicant for leave  to  remain  under  the
    Rules.  The test was significantly more demanding than a mere  test  of
    whether it would be reasonable to expect a  couple  to  continue  their
    family life outside the  United  Kingdom.   The  criterion  had  to  be
    satisfied before an applicant was  entitled  to  be  granted  leave  to
    remain, it was not simply a factor to be taken into  account.   However
    in the context of a wider Article 8 assessment outside the Rules it was
    a factor to be taken into account, it was not an  absolute  requirement
    which had to be satisfied in every single case.  In  a  case  involving
    precarious family life it would be necessary to  establish  that  there
    were exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  such  a  conclusion  (see
    paragraph 31 of Agyarko).  The fact the Sponsor was a  British  citizen
    was not of itself something which made the  case  exceptional  for  the
    purposes  of  the  test  under  Article  8  (see  paragraph  33  ibid).
    Similarly that a Sponsor had lived all his or her life  in  the  United
    Kingdom and had a job here (and hence might find  it  difficult  and/or
    might be reluctant to relocate to another  country  to  continue  their
    family life there) could not constitute insurmountable obstacles to the
    applicant so doing (see paragraph 25 ibid).

18.  The issue of the Sponsor's mental health was set  out  in  the  refusal
    letter.  There were adequate medical  provisions  should  she  wish  to
    relocate.  She was well aware that the Appellant had no status  in  the
    United Kingdom  when  the  relationship  was  formed.   There  were  no
    children in this case.  The care given by the Sponsor to her mother was
    limited to two to three times per week.  The Appellant was  a  fit  and
    able young man who could obtain work in India.  He  had  not  lost  all
    ties  to  India.   The  test  in  EX1  was  not  made  out.   All  visa
    applications from India were processed within a 90 day period.   Should
    the Appellant wish to return and make an application for settlement (on
    the basis for example that the  Sponsor  could  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM) he could do  so  in  those  circumstances.
    There was no need to look at Article 8 outside the Rules in  this  case
    but if one did the family life enjoyed by the Appellant and the Sponsor
    was a precarious one due to the Appellant's lack of  status.   Pursuant
    to Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    little weight could be afforded to it.

19.  For  the  Appellant  Counsel  argued  that  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the Appellant relocating to India such that the  Appellant
    could bring himself within Section EX1 of Appendix FM.  One had to look
    at matters in a practical  and  sensible  way  and  at  the  degree  of
    difficulty  in  relocating  to   India.    There   would   be   serious
    interference.  The Appellant had come to the United Kingdom in fear  of
    retribution from his father who was an alcoholic.  The Appellant had no
    real ties and could satisfy paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules
    in relation to his private life claim.  There was no real connection to
    India anymore.  The only effective support was with  his  mother.   His
    level of education was very low.  He had never worked in India (I pause
    to note here that that in fact is not the Appellant's evidence  as  per
    his statement, the Appellant said that he  had  worked  on  the  family
    farm).

20.  The Appellant's wife would also experience very  significant  obstacles
    to travelling with the Appellant as she had  suffered  from  depression
    for the last twenty years and was receiving ongoing treatment for  that
    depression.  An interruption of her medical treatment was sufficient of
    itself to create an insurmountable obstacle.  She  was  vulnerable  and
    relied on the Appellant for support.  Any  temporary  separation  would
    affect her state of mind.  The couple had no accommodation in India  to
    settle in.  She was earning in excess of  �27,000  per  annum  and  the
    Appellant would meet the entry requirements.  There was no  reason  why
    he should be made  to  return  to  India  to  apply  from  there.   The
    Respondent's figures as to visa processing times were not reliable.  In
    reality one did not know how long it would take  for  the  visa  to  be
    processed.  The couple now  were  financially  independent  within  the
    meaning of Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  Both were Christians  and  it
    would not be safe for the Sponsor to relocate given her  vulnerability.
    This was an exceptional  case  and  would  lead  to  unjust  and  harsh
    consequences if the Appellant were required to return.

Findings

21.  The Appellant has never had leave to be in this country and could  only
    bring himself within the Immigration Rules if  his  case  falls  within
    Section EX1 of Appendix FM in relation to  his  family  life  with  the
    Sponsor or paragraph 276ADE in relation to his claim for  private  life
    in this country.  In order to succeed under Section EX1  the  Appellant
    must show that he is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
    partner who was a British citizen and  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with the Sponsor continuing outside the United
    Kingdom in this case India.

22.  The genuine and subsisting nature of the relationship  is  accepted  as
    is the Sponsor's nationality.  The test  under  the  Rules  is  one  of
    insurmountable obstacles.  The Respondent relies heavily on the case of
    Agyarko which I have summarised  above.  The  insurmountable  obstacles
    test is relevant at different stages of the  case.   The  first  is  in
    deciding whether Section EX1 is satisfied.  It is  only  if  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles that Section EX1 can be satisfied.  Should the
    case proceed thereafter to a consideration of the  appeal  outside  the
    Immigration Rules to Article 8  then  the  question  of  insurmountable
    obstacles is a factor although not necessarily the decisive factor when
    weighing up the proportionality of interference with protected rights.

23.  Concentrating at first however on Section EX1 under the Rules,  I  find
    that the Appellant  cannot  make  out  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing outside the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant lived in India for most of his life, was educated  there  and
    worked there on the family farm.  He speaks the language and if he does
    not wish to return to his home area because of  difficulties  with  his
    family I see no reason why he cannot reasonably be expected to relocate
    to one of the very many large cities of the most  populous  country  in
    the world.  The Sponsor could accompany him in that relocation  if  she
    so wished.  For much of her life in this country she has suffered  from
    depression  particularly  following  the   break-up   of   a   previous
    relationship.  There is ample evidence of adequate  medical  facilities
    in India should she require treatment in that  country.   Whilst  India
    might be unfamiliar to her at first, as the Respondent  points  out  in
    the refusal letter there is no  reason  why  the  Appellant  could  not
    assist the Sponsor with relocation.  Family  life  could  therefore  be
    continued elsewhere and Section EX1 is not met.

24.  In relation to the Appellant's claim to private life under  the  Rules,
    the Appellant must  show  that  he  can  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE.  The Appellant has not  lived  in  this  country  for
    twenty years. He can only show he has been resident in this country for
    at most just under nine years.  He was approximately 18 years old  when
    he arrived in this country and thus has not spent at least half of  his
    life in the United Kingdom.  He has spent the majority of his  life  in
    India including his formative years.   The  Appellant  would  therefore
    have to show that there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration into India.  This replaced the test prior to 28th July 2014
    which was that the Appellant would have to demonstrate he had  no  ties
    including social, cultural or family with India.  That test was applied
    by the Respondent in the refusal letter dated 3rd June 2014 but  by  HC
    532 the very significant obstacles test  applies  to  all  applications
    under paragraph 276ADE decided on or after that date.

25.  I do not consider that there are  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant's relocation to India.  I have already set  out  the  reasons
    why I do not consider that the  Appellant  personally  would  have  any
    difficulties in  relocating  and  those  factors  apply  equally  under
    paragraph 276ADE.  In any event even if the earlier test of no ties  is
    applied, it is clear that the Appellant retains ties to India.  He  has
    family ties in the form of the contact he has with his mother who still
    lives in India and he has social and cultural ties given  that  he  can
    speak the local language and has lived most of  his  life  there.   The
    Appellant thus cannot succeed under the Rules in this  case  on  either
    private or family life.

26.  I therefore turn to consider whether the Appellant's claim can  succeed
    outside the Rules.  Any such claim has to look through the prism of the
    Rules.  The Appellant and Sponsor have an established family life which
    will be interfered with by requiring the Appellant to return  to  India
    on his own or with the Sponsor.  That interference will be pursuant  to
    the legitimate aim of immigration control since the Appellant  has  had
    no leave since  entering  this  country.   The  issue  is  whether  the
    interference is proportionate to that legitimate  aim.   In  the  first
    place I consider that it is  reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
    return to India  and  make  a  proper  application  through  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  This is not a case where it could be said  that  it
    is so obvious that the Appellant  would  succeed  that  it  is  a  mere
    bureaucratic formality to require him to return to  apply  from  there.
    Although the Sponsor's income through work and benefits is said  to  be
    well in excess of the  �18,600  limit,  issues  would  arise  over  the
    suitability requirements which would have to be  considered  given  the
    Appellant's persistent (and  admitted)  breaches  of  immigration  law.
    These are not limited just to illegal entry but also to illegal work.

27.  In the first place  the  Appellant  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
    return to India and make an application from there.  The only  evidence
    I have of how  long  that  process  might  take  was  provided  by  the
    Respondent.  Although the  Appellant  objects  to  it,  no  alternative
    evidence was given to me to suggest that the Respondent's  figures  are
    incorrect.  I do not consider that the time it might take for an  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  to  consider  the  Appellant's  application  is  so
    unreasonable that the Appellant cannot be expected  to  return  to  his
    country of origin and make a proper application for entry clearance  in
    the usual way.  That of itself disposes  of  the  Article  8  claim  to
    family life but I would go further and say that just as  I  found  that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in
    India, I do not find that the Appellant and Sponsor can pray in aid the
    Sponsor's reluctance to travel to India with the Appellant to show that
    interference would be disproportionate.

28.  The Sponsor's concerns are that she has not been to India  before,  she
    is concerned for her health and she is concerned for the  care  of  her
    mother.  That she would give up her job is not of itself  a  sufficient
    reason, see Agyarko.  The care which she gives to her mother  could  be
    supplemented by  other  members  of  the  Sponsor's  family  or  public
    authorities if necessary.  The Sponsor's evidence of her own ill-health
    is somewhat limited.  As I have indicated it is clear  that  there  are
    adequate medical facilities in India for  treatment  on  an  outpatient
    basis of depression.  Whilst some or all of that treatment  might  have
    to be paid for by the Appellant and Sponsor, the Appellant has  a  work
    history in India and I see no reason why he could not find  work  again
    upon return.  The Appellant has apparently applied for a number of jobs
    in this country besides working illegally here and I see no reason  why
    he should not be able to apply for and work in his country of origin.

29.  I appreciate the Sponsor's concern about travelling to  a  new  country
    which she has not previously visited.  Nevertheless she was aware  that
    the Sponsor's status in this country was precarious if not unlawful and
    thus any family life built up between the couple during that time would
    be afforded little weight. Article 8 does not afford  the  right  to  a
    couple to choose where to enjoy their married life. Little  weight  can
    thus be given to the relationship between the Appellant and Sponsor  in
    the balancing act I have to perform whereas considerable weight  should
    be given on the Respondent's side  of  the  scales  in  part  at  least
    because of the illegal nature of the Appellant's life in this  country.
    I find no reason why this appeal should be  allowed  either  under  the
    Immigration Rules or outside the Rules under Article 8  and  I  dismiss
    the appeal on both grounds.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I remake the decision in this case  by  dismissing  the  Appellant's  appeal
against the Respondent's decisions to refuse leave.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so  doing.
