For the Respondent:    -

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent is a national of Iran.   On the 22nd January 2014
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Shamash allowed his appeal against the
       Secretary of State's decision to refuse to  vary  his  leave  to
       remain in the UK and to remove him from the UK pursuant  to  s47
       of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.  The
       Secretary of State now her permission  to  appeal  against  that
       decision.

    2. The Respondent was not represented before me but  I  received  a
       letter dated  16th  June  2014  from  his  representatives,  the
       contents of which I have noted and taken into consideration.

Background and Matters in Issue

    3. The Respondent came to the UK in 2004 as a student, that  status
       being renewed on four further occasions before  he  was  granted
       leave as a Tier 1 (Post Study Work) Migrant. The Respondent  has
       used his time in the UK very effectively.  He began by taking an
       English language course and ended by taking an  MPhil  in  Paper
       and Cellulose Science.  The research he  undertook  during  that
       degree and since, concerns  the  manufacture  of  an  innovative
       "woodflake" board that is manufactured entirely from  the  waste
       produced by the wood industry and others. He has established his
       own company, Sash Trade Limited, with a view  to  patenting  and
       marketing what could  be  a  revolutionary  new  alternative  to
       hardboard. He has invested substantial time and money  into  the
       research and development of this product.  It was  against  this
       background that he applied, in May 2013, for  further  leave  to
       remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepeneur) Migrant.

    4. His application was refused. He did not have any  advertisements
       to show that he was promoting his product. He did not  have  any
       contracts to show that he was selling it. There was no  evidence
       to show that his business is actively trading. Since it is still
       at the research and development stage this is hardly surprising.
        On the 29th October  2013  Dr  Vince  Cable  MP  was  moved  to
       personally intervene by writing to the Home  Secretary  pointing
       out that the Respondent is exactly the sort of entrepreneur that
       the UK should be encouraging to live here.  Dr  Cable  had  been
       shown a powerpoint presentation about the Respondent's work  and
       had been shown the outstanding references that he had been given
       by his Professors at the University  of  Manchester.  He  called
       upon the Home Secretary to review  the  case,  and  the  Tier  1
       scheme, in order to ensure that  such  applicants,  with  "great
       scientific ability"  who  had  invested  their  own  capital  in
       research in the UK, could be accommodated with the Rules.

    5.  Dr Cable had received no response by the time  the  matter  was
       listed before the First-tier  Tribunal.  Judge  Shamash  clearly
       shared Dr Cable's enormous sympathy  for  the  Respondent.   She
       noted that the Secretary  of  State  does  not  appear  to  have
       engaged at all with the nature  of  the  Respondent's  business;
       there had been a failure to contact him during  the  application
       process and if the case-owner had not understood the  nature  of
       the application he should have contacted the  Respondent;  there
       was an unfairness  in  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
       exercised her discretion. The appeal  was  allowed  as  'not  in
       accordance with the law' and Judge Shamash purported to  'remit'
       the  matter  back  to  the  Secretary  of  State  so  that   the
       application could be looked at again.

    6.  The  Secretary  of  State  now  appeals  that   decision.   The
       Respondent's   representatives   have    conceded    that    the
       determination contains at least two errors.  At paragraph 30 the
       determination describes some of the requirements of the rules as
       "in essence a guide". It is conceded that  the  requirements  of
       the Rules  relating  to  what  evidence  must  be  produced  are
       mandatory.  It  has  always  been  agreed  that  the  Respondent
       cannot, at this stage, produce an advert for a product  that  is
       not yet ready for market; similarly he cannot produce  contracts
       for sale. It is therefore conceded that the requirements of  the
       rules as to specified evidence cannot be met. This leads to  the
       second error that is agreed to  be  in  the  determination.  The
       Judge  appears  to  have  placed  reliance  on  the  'evidential
       flexibility'  policy  to  impute  some   unfairness   into   the
       assessment of this application; it is conceded that  insofar  as
       this is pertinent to the outcome of the appeal this is an error,
       since the Respondent would not have been able  to  produce  this
       evidence if he had been asked.

    7. Beyond that  the  Respondent's  representatives  submitted  that
       Judge Shamash was being entirely  reasonable  and  pragmatic  in
       suggesting that the Secretary  of  State  look  at  this  matter
       again. I could not  agree  more.  Unfortunately  the  First-tier
       Tribunal has no power to "remit" the matter to the Secretary  of
       State. The First-tier Tribunal's power is restricted to allowing
       or dismissing the appeal. The option  taken  by  Judge  Shamash,
       allowing the appeal on the basis that the decision  is  "not  in
       accordance with the law" was not, on the  facts,  open  to  her,
       since there is nothing  in  law  wrong  with  the  decision.  It
       follows that the decision must be set aside.

    8. Neither the Secretary of State nor Judge Shamash  conducted  any
       analysis  of  whether  this  decision  is   a   disproportionate
       interference with the Respondent's private life as protected  by
       Article 8. He plainly has a private life. He has  been  studying
       and working in the UK for some ten years. The decision is lawful
       in that the Secretary of State has  the  power  to  take  it.  I
       presume that it is justified on the grounds of  "protecting  the
       economy". I am not satisfied that this decision can be  said  to
       be rationally connected to that aim. Unlike the situation in the
       vast majority of immigration appeals where it  can  be  inferred
       that the presence of a migrant will have some detrimental impact
       on the economy, this is a man who has invested over  ï¿½50,000  of
       his own money to add to the many thousands he has already  spent
       on his tertiary education here. I am  not  satisfied  that  this
       decision would protect the economy. On the contrary I  think  it
       likely that it would damage the economy. If I am wrong in that I
       nevertheless find that the  decision  is  disproportionate.  The
       decision  would  have  a  hugely  detrimental  impact   on   the
       Respondent. His plans and business ideas would have to be  moved
       elsewhere and I accept that this would  be  unjustifiably  harsh
       when all he has ever done is comply with the  rules,  work  hard
       and invest substantially in the UK economy.  I  therefore  allow
       the appeal under Article 8.

    9. If the Secretary of State is in any  way  dissatisfied  with  my
       conclusion she will no doubt consider the views expressed  about
       this case by Vince Cable, by Judge Shamash and now myself before
       considering any onward appeal.


Decisions

   10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law
       and it is set aside.

   11. The decision is re-made as follows:

"the appeal is allowed on human rights grounds."
