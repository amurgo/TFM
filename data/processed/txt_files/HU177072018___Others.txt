                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Turkey who was born on 1  September
    1975.  The second and third appellants are his wife and  daughter,  who
    are also citizens of Turkey, and were born on 1  January  1980  and  10
    October 2017 respectively.

 2. The first appellant came to the UK and remained as  a  visitor  between
    1998 and 2008.  In 2008, he applied for leave  as  a  Turkish  business
    person under the Turkey-European Community Association Agreement  ("the
    Ankara Agreement")).  It would appear that, after some  delay,  he  was
    granted leave to remain for a year in 2013 and  that  was  subsequently
    extended until 10 May 2017. As a business, the first appellant  runs  a
    pizza kebab shop.

 3. The second appellant came to the UK as the first appellant's spouse  on
    13 September 2015 and has remained, it would appear,  in  the  UK  with
    leave as his dependant since that time.  The third appellant  was  born
    in the UK on 10 October 2017.

 4. On 8 May 2017, the first appellant  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain (ILR) relying, again on the Ankara Agreement, on the basis  that
    he had been carrying on his business in the UK for a period of at least
    four years.  The second appellant was a dependant upon that application
    and, after her birth, the third appellant was added as a dependant.

 5. On 13 August 2018, the Secretary of State refused the first appellant's
    application for ILR and also refused to grant ILR  to  the  second  and
    third appellants as his dependants.

 6. In reaching  those  decisions,  the  Secretary  of  State  applied  the
    Immigration Rules in force as at 1 January 1973,  namely  Statement  of
    Immigration Rules for Control after Entry (23 October 1972), HC 510, as
    required by the 'standstill' clause in the Ankara Agreement.

 7. The basis of the refusal was para 4  of  HC  510  and,  in  particular,
    taking into account the factors set out in para 4:

         "Whether in the light of his character, conduct of associations  it
         is undesirable to permit him to remain; ..."

 8. The Secretary of State relied upon two matters.   First,  on  28  March
    2018 the first appellant had been convicted at the Bristol Crown  Court
    of an offence under the Regulatory  Reform  (Fire  Safety)  Order  2005
    namely that as the "responsible person" for his  business  premises  he
    had:

         "fail[ed] to comply with any requirement or prohibition imposed  by
         articles 8 to 22 and 38 (fire safety  duties)  where  that  failure
         places one or more relevant persons at risk  of  death  or  serious
         injury in case of fire". (art 32(1)(a))

 9. Having been convicted, he was sentenced to a period of  twelve  months'
    imprisonment which was suspended for 24 months.  He was ordered to  pay
    a victim surcharge of �140 and costs of �4,772.49.

10. Secondly, the Secretary of State relied upon the  underpayment  of  tax
    and national insurance contributions by the first appellant.

11. In the light of both these matters,  but  in  particular  the  criminal
    conviction, the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  prepared  to  exercise
    discretion to grant the appellant's application in  the  light  of  his
    conduct and character.

12. The first appellant sought an Administrative Review.  That review  was,
    however, rejected on 19 September 2018.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

13. The appellants' appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge C J Woolley on 15 January 2019.  It was accepted  before
    Judge Woolley that the appellants could not appeal against the decision
    to refuse them leave under HC 510 on the basis of the Ankara Agreement.
     That followed from the decision of the Court of Appeal in  SSHD  v  CA
    (Turkey) [2018] EWCA Civ 2875.  Judge Woolley, however, concluded  that
    there was a valid appeal before him because the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision was, properly understood, a decision to refuse the appellants'
    human rights claims which  were  appealable  under  s.82(1)(b)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "NIA Act 2002").

14. Consequently, it was  common  ground  before  Judge  Woolley  that  the
    appellants' appeals were on the basis that the decision to refuse  them
    leave breached Art 8 of the ECHR.  It was  also  common  ground  before
    Judge Woolley that, in reaching a conclusion in respect of that, it was
    relevant to determine whether the appellants could  succeed  under  the
    applicable Immigration Rules  including,  in  the  case  of  the  first
    appellant, HC 510.  The only other relevant rule was para 276ADE of the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

15. Judge Woolley concluded that the Secretary of State's decisions did not
    breach Article 8 of the  ECHR.   In  reaching  that  conclusion,  Judge
    Woolley found that, on the basis of the first  appellant's  conviction,
    he could not succeed under HC 510 as a Turkish business person  because
    on the basis of his character and conduct it was "undesirable to permit
    him to remain".  Judge Woolley did not base his finding  on  the  fact,
    earlier relied upon by the Secretary of State, that the  appellant  had
    underpaid tax as Judge Woolley accepted that that had now been remedied
    by repayment.

16. The appellant sought, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  O'Garro)  on  21
    February 2019.

17. On 25 March 2019, the Secretary of  State  filed  a  rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision.

The Submissions

18. On behalf of the appellants, Ms  Daykin  relied  upon  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  Those grounds raise, in essence, three points.   In  her  oral
    submissions, she focused upon the first two points.

19. First, she submitted that the judge in concluding that para 4 of HC 510
    applied because of the  first  appellant's  conviction  of  the  strict
    liability offence, had failed to adopt 'a nuanced'  approach,  in  that
    the judge had  failed  to  take  into  account  the  first  appellant's
    explanation, set out in his witness statement  dated  11  January  2019
    particularly at para 6.  She submitted that at para 42(vii), the  judge
    had failed to take into account the first appellant's explanation  that
    he was liable for the strict  liability  offence  as  the  "responsible
    person" for his business premises but that the offence, which  involved
    an employee staying in the room above his premises, unbeknown to him.

20. Secondly, Ms Daykin submitted (at least initially) that the  judge  had
    failed in para 44 of his determination properly to consider whether, in
    the light of the nature of the offending, a  "lesser  measure"  than  a
    refusal of ILR was available, namely a further grant of limited  leave.
    That, she submitted, was open to  the  Secretary  of  State  under  his
    policy when considering Ankara Agreement applications for ILR.

21. Thirdly, although this was not directly  raised  in  Ms  Daykin's  oral
    submissions, the grounds contend that the  judge  reached  inconsistent
    findings in para 43(ii) and para 43(v).  In the former, he had accepted
    that the appellants were "financially independent" and that  there  was
    "no evidence that any of them are  dependent  on  the  State"  for  the
    purposes of s.117B(3) of the NIA Act 2002.  However in the latter,  the
    judge had found that the  appellants  would  "represent  a  significant
    economic burden on the country in terms of the provision of housing and
    healthcare".

22. On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Howells relied upon the rule  24
    response.

23. As regards the first ground, Mr Howells submitted that in para  43(vii)
    the  judge  had  fully  considered  the  circumstances  of  the   first
    appellant's offending and had properly come to the conclusion that para
    4 of HC 510 applied.

24. As regards the second ground, Mr Howells submitted that, as  the  judge
    had found that para 4 applied, he was entitled to conclude that in  the
    light of the first appellant's conviction it was "undesirable to permit
    him to remain"; namely that he should be granted any leave to remain.

25. Mr Howells did not refer to the third ground which, as I have said, was
    not addressed in Ms Daykin's oral submissions.

Discussion

26. Apart from ground 3, the scope of the appellants' appeals is  that  the
    judge erred in law in reaching his finding  that  the  first  appellant
    could not succeed under HC 510 because para 4 of those Rules applied on
    the basis of his criminal conviction in 2018.  As a result,  and  given
    the judge's unchallenged finding in para 31 that the  appellants  could
    not succeed under para 276ADE, their appeals turned upon an application
    of Art 8 outside the Rules.

27. As I have already indicated, it is common  ground  that  as  a  Turkish
    business person the first appellant's application  (and  those  of  the
    other appellants as his dependants) turned upon an application  of  the
    relevant Rules in HC 510.

28. Paragraph 28 of HC 510 provides as follows:

         "A person who is admitted in  the  first  instance  for  a  limited
         period and who  has  remained  here  for  four  years  in  approved
         employment or as a businessman or a self-employed person  or  as  a
         person of independent means may have  a  time  limit  on  his  stay
         removed unless there are grounds for maintaining it.   Applications
         for the removal of the time limit are to be considered in the light
         of all the relevant circumstances including those set out  in  para
         4..."

29. That was the provision upon which the first appellant  relied,  seeking
    removal of the time limit upon his leave (and that of  his  dependants)
    such that they would each have indefinite leave to remain.

30. Paragraph 4 of HC 510 provides as follows:

         "The succeeding paragraphs set out the main  categories  of  people
         who may be given limited leave to enter and who may seek  variation
         of their leave, and the principles to be followed in  dealing  with
         their applications, or in initiating any variation of their  leave.
         In deciding these matters  account  is  to  be  taken  of  all  the
         relevant facts; the fact that the applicant  satisfies  the  formal
         requirements of these Rules for  stay,  or  further  stay,  in  the
         proposed capacity is not conclusive in his favour.   It  will,  for
         example, be relevant whether the person has observed the time limit
         and conditions subject to which he was  admitted;  whether  in  the
         light of his character, conduct of associations it  is  undesirable
         to permit him to remain; whether he represents a danger to national
         security; or whether, if allowed to remain for the period to  which
         he wishes to stay, he might not be returnable to another  country."
         (My emphasis).

31. It is clear from reading para  28,  together  with  para  4,  that  the
    decision maker (here the judge) was required to take into  account  all
    the circumstances.  Paragraph 4 is, itself, a discretionary  ground  of
    refusal.

32. In these appeals, it was not suggested that the first appellant did not
    satisfy the "formal requirements"  for  leave  as  a  Turkish  business
    person (see para [21] of the determination).  The sole basis upon which
    the judge found, and which was the basis for the argument  before  him,
    that the appellant could not succeed  under  HC  510  was  because  the
    discretionary provision in para 4 applied to him.

33. Judge Woolley  dealt  with  para  4  at  a  number  of  points  in  his
    determination.

34. At para [32] he stated under the heading "global conclusion on  HC  510
    and paragraph 276ADE":

         "I therefore find that the appellants  do  not  qualify  for  leave
         under HC 510 or  under  paragraph  276ADE.   I  have  reached  this
         decision on the basis of all the evidence in this appeal."

35. In the grounds it is asserted that in para 32, the judge failed to give
    any reason why the appellants did not qualify for leave under  HC  510.
    Ms Daykin did not pursue this point in her oral submissions.   She  was
    correct not to do so since it  is  plain  that  the  judge  was  simply
    stating his conclusion in  para  32  and  that  his  reasons  for  that
    conclusion were given in para 43(vii) and which, in  oral  submissions,
    Ms Daykin focused upon.  There, the judge said this:

         "vii) Whether HC510 could be met

         I recognise that HC510 involves a broad exercise of discretion, and
         that the  criminal  conviction  was  the  first  committed  by  the
         appellant.  As to its being an offence of strict liability  I  find
         that this is no mitigation: it is an offence  of  strict  liability
         for good reason as the appellant was the responsible  person  under
         the Regulations and they are designed to  prevent  death  by  fire.
         The appellant is in business which involves the running of premises
         to which members of the public may have access, and the  fact  that
         he has a conviction under the  Regulations  does  come  within  the
         wording of HC510 as "character" and "conduct" that should be  taken
         into account.  The fact that a prison sentence was imposed,  albeit
         suspended, shows how seriously the court treated the offence.   The
         court could have simply imposed a fine.  I find that,  had  I  been
         deciding the appeal under HC510, that  the  conviction  would  have
         meant that it was undesirable to permit him to  remain  because  of
         his  character  and  conduct.   In  terms  of  the  proportionality
         exercise this is therefore a factor against him."

36. Ms Daykin placed reliance upon  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in  R
    (Temiz) v SSHD IJR [2016] UKUT 26 (IAC) (UTJ Grubb) where, in  quashing
    a decision of the Secretary of State refusing the  applicant  leave  to
    remain under the Ankara Agreement, on the basis that the  Secretary  of
    State had not adopted "a nuanced approach" to para 4, I said  this  (at
    [36]):

         "In her decision,  by  simply  asserting  that  the  applicant  had
         overstayed albeit for some length of time, the respondent failed to
         take into account this context relevant to the application  as  one
         of "all the circumstances" she was required to consider under  para
         4 and in accordance with her own policy guidance.  The approach  to
         his discretion had to accommodate a more nuanced  approach  than  a
         simple assertion of unlawful presence.  In that  regard  also,  the
         respondent  acted  unlawfully  and  her  decision  to  refuse   the
         applicant leave is flawed."

37. The "unnuanced" approach of the Secretary of State in  Temiz  was  that
    para 4  was  applied  simply  on  the  basis  that  the  applicant  had
    overstayed in the UK.  No account had been taken of  the  circumstances
    during that time, for example, that he had not worked and/or  built  up
    his business whilst unlawfully in the UK (see [35] of Temiz).

38. I do not accept Ms Daykin's  submission  that  in  para  43(vii)  Judge
    Woolley adopted a similar, and unlawful, "unnuanced"  approach  to  the
    first appellant's offending.  In para 43(vii), the  judge  specifically
    referred to the first appellant's offending and the seriousness  of  it
    based upon the imposition of a custodial sentence, albeit one that  was
    suspended.  I do not accept Ms Daykin's submission that  Judge  Woolley
    failed to have in mind the circumstances of that offence as a result of
    which the first appellant was, nevertheless, guilty of that offence  on
    a  'strict  liability'  basis.   Ms  Daykin  relied  upon   the   first
    appellant's explanation of his offending in his witness statement.   In
    particular, it is set out as paras 6-8 as follows:

         "6.  I now wish to explain the circumstances of my  conviction.   I
             run a takeaway business called [~] from [~ Bath].  I took over
             this business in 2015 having previously run a takeaway  called
             [~] at [~ Midsomer  Norton].   I  lease  my  current  business
             premises which includes a single room above  the  shop,  which
             one of my employees, [G], was staying in.  The local authority
             inspected the premises and informed me that no-one  should  be
             living above the shop because it needed a fire escape and gave
             me a warning.  I asked the employee not to stay there  anymore
             and he moved in with a lady friend.  The inspector returned  a
             month later and said everything was okay and left.   Unbeknown
             to me my employee had an argument with the lady friend he  was
             staying with and stayed above the shop again and was  seen  by
             the inspector.  I was interviewed by the fire  brigade  and  I
             was charged with the offence because as  the  leaseholder  and
             business owner and employer I am the responsible person  under
             the law.  The Magistrates transferred my  case  to  the  Crown
             Court.

         7.   I pleaded guilty to the offence at the Crown  Court  after  my
             barrister informed me that I am  the  responsible  person  and
             therefore I should plead guilty.  My employee gave a statement
             to confirm that  I  did  not  know  he  had  returned  to  the
             premises.  I dismissed my employee as a result of his conduct.

         8.   I am paying the costs of the criminal case by  instalment  and
             am keeping up with those every month.  I also had  to  pay  my
             own legal costs privately.  I have also since sought  planning
             permission to instalment a fire escape and I am  just  waiting
             for approval from the council."

39. True it is that the judge does not specifically refer to that  evidence
    in para 43(vii) of his decision.  However, his decision must  be  read,
    sensibly, as a whole.  As  paras  18-23  of  his  determination,  Judge
    Woolly set out Ms Daykin's submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellants
    before him.  At para  22  Judge  Woolley  set  out  her  submission  as
    follows:

         "In respect of the conviction there is little information  provided
         by the respondent - all the respondent refers to  is  the  fact  of
         conviction and nothing is given of the facts.  There  is  no  basis
         for the respondent to conclude that it was a "clear and  conscious"
         act.  Ms Daykin invited me to look at the Fire  Safety  Regulations
         where the key provisions are set out  at  para  7.   The  appellant
         explains the circumstances of the conviction and in the absence  of
         any other material she invited me  to  find  that  these  were  the
         circumstances.  There was absolute liability under the criminal law
         even though an  employee  did  the  act.    The  appellant  has  no
         previous convictions  and  has  complied  with  the  terms  of  the
         sentence.  The prison term was wholly suspended and a costs payment
         plan has been put in place and he is complying with it.  There is a
         very broad exercise of discretion permitted  and  it  is  wrong  to
         treat this as a mandatory reason for refusal.  There is no evidence
         of the consideration of the circumstances and  this  was  a  strict
         liability offence.  To look at  this  otherwise  would  not  be  in
         accordance with the law."

40. Ms Daykin specifically relied upon the circumstances of  the  offending
    as a basis for inviting the judge to find that para 4 of HC510 did  not
    apply.  Reading the judge's determination as a whole, as  must  be  the
    case, it is plain that in reaching his conclusion at  para  43(vii)  he
    had well in mind her submissions which included her submission that the
    circumstances surrounding the offending, its  strict  liability  nature
    and how he had come to be in  breach  of  the  law,  were  relevant  in
    determining whether para 4 applied.  I am satisfied that he had all the
    circumstances in mind when he reached his finding on para 4.

41. Ms Daykin did not raise a challenge based upon the irrationality of his
    finding but rather simply that  he  had  failed  to  consider  all  the
    circumstances of  the  first  appellant's  offending  and  thereby  had
    adopted an "unnuanced" approach to para 4.  In my judgment,  the  judge
    clearly did take into account all the relevant circumstances and I  see
    no basis upon which his finding in para  43(vii)  can  be  said  to  be
    unsustainable in law.

42. Turning now to Ms Daykin's second ground, this is directed towards  the
    judge's reasoning in para 44 of  his  determination  which  is  in  the
    following terms:

         "Answering the questions put in Agyarko and Hesham Ali I find  that
         the objective of the measure (namely the refusal of  further  leave
         to the  appellants  in  the  interests  of  legitimate  immigration
         control) is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of any
         private and family life rights of  the  appellants,  and  that  the
         measure of refusing their application is  rationally  connected  to
         the objective of legitimate immigration  control  in  the  economic
         interests of the UK.  I find that a lesser measure could  not  have
         been used as there was full consideration under HC510 in  both  the
         decision and administrative review, and the appellant was found not
         to meet the requirements for further leave - there would have  been
         no reason to grant a further  period  of  limited  leave  in  these
         circumstances.   I  find  that   the   importance   of   legitimate
         immigration control outweighs the rights of the appellants which  I
         have summarised above.  Applying the balance sheet approach  it  is
         clear  that  the  countervailing  factors  do  not   outweigh   the
         importance attached to  the  principle  of  legitimate  immigration
         control.  The first appellant may face some difficulties on  return
         to Turkey after being in the UK for ten years, as  may  the  second
         and third appellants after living in the UK for  a  lesser  period,
         but the fact that this is so does not mean  that  their  Article  8
         rights  are  thereby  being  breached.   The  appellants  have  not
         produced a very compelling  case  so  as  to  outweigh  the  public
         interest in removal."

43. Ms Daykin's submission is that the judge has failed to  consider  that,
    even if the first appellant could not succeed under HC510 in  obtaining
    ILR, given the nature  of  his  offending  it  would  be  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to make a grant of further limited  leave  and  that
    the judge should have considered that in applying HC510.

44. It was accepted before me that, in certain circumstances, a grant of  a
    further  period  of  limited  leave  was  possible  even   though   the
    application was for ILR under HC510.

45. The difficulty with Ms Daykin's submission is, however, that the  judge
    found that para 4 applied such that that, by  its  own  terms,  in  the
    light  of  the  first  appellant's  character  and   conduct   it   was
    "undesirable to permit him  to  remain".   As  it  was  undesirable  to
    "permit him to remain", there was no basis for the grant of any  leave,
    including a further period of limited leave.  As I have concluded  that
    the  judge's  finding  in  respect  of  para  4  of  HC510  is  legally
    unassailable,  it  inevitably  follows,  as   Judge   Woolley   himself
    recognised in para 44 of his determination, that  there  would  be  "no
    reason to grant a further period of limited leave".

46. Consequently, I reject the appellants' second ground of challenge.

47. Turning, then, finally to the third ground, this was  not  specifically
    raised in the oral submissions.  There  is,  of  course,  no  necessary
    inconsistency in the judge finding, for the purposes of s.117B(2)  that
    the appellants are "financially  independent"  but  that  nevertheless,
    they will be an economic burden on the healthcare system as they  would
    be obtaining free NHS healthcare.  Whilst it  may  not  be  immediately
    obvious why, if they are financially independent, they will  remain  an
    economic burden on the UK in respect of the "provision of housing", any
    inconsistency is not, in my judgment, material to the  judge's  finding
    that the appellants have failed to establish that the refusal of  leave
    breaches Art 8 outside the Rules on the basis that  the  decisions  are
    disproportionate.  The judge clearly  took  into  account  a  range  of
    factors  "acting  against  the  appellants"  and  "in  favour  of   the
    appellants" at para  43.   His  conclusion  at  paras  44-45  that  the
    decisions were not disproportionate, given that  the  appellants  could
    not succeed under any relevant Immigration Rules and that despite "some
    difficulties" it was reasonable to expect them to return to  Turkey  to
    live, was rationally open to the judge.   Indeed,  his  conclusion  was
    inevitable.

48. For these reasons, I reject the appellants' grounds of challenge.   The
    judge did not materially err  in  law  in  dismissing  the  appellants'
    appeals under Article 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

49. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appellants' appeals under Art  8  did  not  involve  the  making  of  a
    material error of law.  The judge's decision, therefore, stands.

50.  Accordingly,  the  appellants'  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  are
    dismissed.
