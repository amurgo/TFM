                              Mr Andrew Jordan


                              Mr D. R. Bremmer




Between:
      Claimants

                                     and

                The Secretary of State for the Home Department
      Respondent
For claimant: Miss Maynard, counsel
For the Secretary of State: Mr J. Jones, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The claimants, a husband and wife, are both nationals  of  Serbia  and
      Montenegro and come from  Kosovo.   The  Secretary  of  State  appeals
      against the decision of an adjudicator, Miss D.A. Thomas, following  a
      hearing on 11 April 2002 dismissing  the  wife's  appeal  against  the
      decision of the Secretary of State to  refuse  her  asylum  claim  but
      allowing her appeal under Articles 3 and 8.  The claim of the  husband
      was decided in line with that of the wife.  It  follows  that  if  the
      Secretary of State's appeal is  allowed  in  relation  to  the  wife's
      appeal, a similar decision in the husband's case must  be  made.   For
      the purposes of this appeal,  we  shall  refer  to  the  wife  as  the
      claimant.


   2. The Article 8 appeal can be swiftly disposed of.  In paragraph  39  of
      the determination, the adjudicator finds  that  to  separate  the  two
      claimants by returning one to Kosovo without  the  other  would  be  a
      breach of their rights under Article 8.  In our judgment, there is  no
      question of the couple being separated.  If the wife succeeds  in  her
      claim, both will be permitted to remain.  If she fails, both  will  be
      expected to return.

   3. The principal issue in  this  appeal  concerns  the  wife's  state  of
      health.   In  paragraph  24  of  the  determination,  the  adjudicator
      considered the submission made on the wife's behalf that  it  was  not
      clear that the wife would receive the treatment she needs  in  Kosovo.
      Her conclusion is contained in paragraph 38 of the determination.  She
      accepted the psychiatric and  medical  evidence  put  forward  on  the
      wife's behalf and stated:

           "I am not satisfied that the appellant will  get  the  level  of
           treatment  that  she  clearly  requires.   In  considering   the
           objective evidence, I find that if she  returns  to  Kosovo  she
           will be stigmatised and that will have a devastating effect upon
           her life and first state of health.  I find that this  would  be
           the case wherever she lives in Kosovo.  I note and  accept  that
           she has  attempted  suicide  in  the  past  and  I  have  little
           difficulty  accepting  that  if  she  returns  she   will   feel
           vulnerable enough to attempt a repeat  suicide  in  the  future.
           For all these reasons I find that it would be a  breach  of  her
           rights under  Article  3  to  return  her  to  Kosovo  in  those
           circumstances."


   4. It is this finding that is  the  subject-matter  of  the  appeal.   In
      essence, the appeal centres upon the medical evidence  that  has  been
      provided dealing  with  the  claimant's  psychiatric  condition.   The
      claimant was born in Kline on 14 February 1961.  She is 42 years  old.
      She and her husband arrived in the United Kingdom on  6  October  1999
      and claimed asylum.  The couple have, therefore, been  in  the  United
      Kingdom for about four years.  The first psychiatric  report  prepared
      by Dr Mohammed Al-Uzri is dated 6 October  2001,  by  which  time  the
      claimant had been in the United Kingdom for  two  years.   The  report
      begins at page 8 of the appeal bundle.  On page 9 of the  report,  the
      doctor states that the claimant  describes  symptoms  and  a  clinical
      picture that are consistent with Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder.   On
      the following page, the doctor describes how the claimant  suffered  a
      traumatic experience  and  subsequently  developed  psychological  and
      physical problems.  He repeats his earlier comment that  her  symptoms
      as consistent with criteria of a Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder.   In
      the following paragraph, he reaches his conclusion:


           "The prognosis of post traumatic stress disorder is variable and
           uncertain as it depends upon the severity of the case and  other
           factors such as receiving appropriate treatment.  In Mrs  Dani's
           case she has good prognostic factors  such  as  the  absence  of
           mental health illness in her, or her family, and  the  good  pre
           morbid personality she had.  The  treatment  of  post  traumatic
           stress disorder could be long-term and involve psychotherapeutic
           intervention such  as  counselling,  behavioural  techniques  or
           psychodynamic therapy as well as drug treatment.
           "Mrs Dani will need a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of
           the severity of her symptoms  and  their  impact  on  her  daily
           functioning.  Therefore, she would benefit from a period of  In-
           Patient  admission  with  the  local  Psychiatric  Services  for
           further assessment and treatment of her symptoms."


   5. We were also referred to the City Hospital report prepared by Dr P. G.
      Wilson, Consultant Gastroenterologist on 3  April  2002  in  which  he
      describes the claimant is suffering from very very low  grade  colitis
      which  it  would  be  difficult  to  suggest  was  as  a   result   of
      psychological stress.  Importantly, he refers to  the  fact  that,  by
      April 2002, the claimant was taking antidepressants.


   6. The most recent report is dated 24 February 2003 and  was  not  before
      the adjudicator.  It clearly follows the direction given by  the  Vice
      President, when granting leave, that fresh medical evidence should  be
      provided.  Once again, the report is prepared by Dr  Al-Uzri.   It  is
      found beginning at page 27 of the  appeal  bundle.   This  report,  of
      course, is made 3ï¿½ years after the claimant's arrival  in  the  United
      Kingdom.  It records that she was then receiving  40  mg  per  day  of
      Cipramil, an antidepressant, as well as a sleeping tablet.

   7. On page 29 of the report, in discussing  Mood,  the  doctor  describes
      how, in the context of her low mood and  the  difficult  circumstances
      surrounding her asylum case, she made two attempts  to  kill  herself,
      which were stopped by her husband.  There is  no  further  information
      provided in relation to the circumstances of these attempts.  It  does
      not appear that they required hospitalisation.  This  scant  reference
      does not justify the weight that the adjudicator attached to these two
      episodes when considering the risk on return. It  is  insufficient  to
      justify the adjudicator's finding: "I note and  accept  that  she  has
      attempted suicide in the past and I have little  difficulty  accepting
      that if she returns she will  feel  vulnerable  enough  to  attempt  a
      repeat suicide in the future."  The medical evidence does not  support
      the adjudicator's finding that the claimant is suicidal.  Further,  it
      does not support the adjudicator's possible implication  that,  whilst
      not suicidal in the United Kingdom  now,  she  would  be  at  risk  of
      suicide in Kosovo.

   8. On page  31  of  the  report,  Dr  Al-Uzri  refers  to  the  treatment
      available.  This might include counselling and  cognitive  behavioural
      therapy.  He says: "It is not very clear  to  me  what  care  she  has
      received from the mental health services  in  Birmingham,  as  I  have
      received no details of their  intervention."   The  doctor  could,  of
      course, have asked the claimant.  In the absence of  any  evidence  to
      the contrary, apart from the antidepressants and the sleeping tablets,
      the claimant has  not  sought  out  any  further  treatment.   In  his
      recommendations, the doctor  repeated  what  he  had  said  18  months
      earlier that the claimant would benefit from active pursuance of  help
      in the form of  psychological  therapies  to  help  her  overcome  the
      symptoms she is experiencing and the trauma of the rape she suffered.

   9. As far as we can tell,  the  claimant  has  still  not  taken  up  the
      suggestion made as long ago as 16 October 2001 that she would  benefit
      from a psychiatric assessment.  It  seems  to  us  that  this  is  the
      starting-point for any assessment of treatment required.  Furthermore,
      the claimant has now had a further six months since the  last  medical
      report to take up the recommendations that were made in  October  2001
      and repeated in February 2003 to seek psychological therapies such  as
      counselling, behavioural techniques or psychodynamic therapy.  We  can
      only conclude that the claimant has  no  interest  in  pursuing  these
      remedies.  The availability of such remedies in Kosovo is,  therefore,
      of  only  academic  interest  because  the  claimant  has   shown   no
      inclination to make use of such remedies in the past 4 years when they
      have been freely available to her in the United Kingdom.

  10. The antidepressant drugs and sleeping tablets that the claimant is now
      prescribed are available, in one form or another, in Kosovo.

  11. The provision of medical services in Kosovo is considered in paragraph
      5.44 to 5.50 of the CIPU Country Assessment for April 2003:


           Medical services

           5.44  The health services are capable of providing  satisfactory
           primary care and are continuously improving. But some conditions
           requiring more complex or long term treatment are beyond current
           resources.   Details  are  not  included  here  because   health
           provision is constantly developing.

           5.45  All hospitals are  working,  but  the  capacity  of  their
           laboratories and x-ray departments is limited.   Also,  patients
           with conditions that require  regular  laboratory  control  (eg.
           transplantation patients taking  immuno-suppressive  drugs)  may
           not be able to find the necessary laboratory tests.  All  health
           houses  (large  health  centres  in  the  main  towns   of   the
           municipalities) are working but  their  diagnostic  capabilities
           are limited.


           5.46  There is a growing AIDS  problem  in  Kosovo,  thought  to
           originate  from  the  large  influx  of  prostitutes  into   the
           province.  Patients with rare, chronic diseases (e.g.,  lack  of
           growth hormone, hemophilia, HIV/AIDS) may not be  able  to  find
           the drugs they need in public health care institutions or  state
           pharmacies. Private pharmacies may be able to import  the  drugs
           they need, but they are likely to be expensive  and  the  supply
           may be uncertain.

           5.47  A review of the WHO mental health  project  in  July  2002
           made a positive evaluation of  the  progress  in  mental  health
           sector in Kosovo. The WHO mental health programme  has  impacted
           on the development of a  comprehensive  mental  health  strategy
           developed   in   collaboration   with   local   mental    health
           professionals. This may come to be used as a model  for  use  in
           other areas emerging from  a  period  conflict.  Also  a  Mental
           Disability and Mental Health Policy  Implementation  Task  Force
           has been established.

           5.48   Although   mental   health   provision   in   Kosovo   is
           underdeveloped, treatment for psychological conditions including
           Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is  available  in  Kosovo.
           Details of the "Kosova Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims
           (KRCT)" which provides treatment for PTSD are  included  in  the
           source documents.  Growing  numbers  of  people  in  Kosovo  are
           suffering  from  PTSD.   The  number  of  patients  treated  for
           psychiatric disorders by KCRT increased from 1,187  in  2001  to
           2812 in 2002.

           5.49  As with medical treatment,  the  range  of  medical  drugs
           available in Kosovo is  constantly  developing.   Many  standard
           drugs are now available, including Fluoxetin and Sertralin  from
           the Selective Serotonin Uptake  Inhibitors  group  (SSIs)  often
           used for the treatment of PTSD.

           5.50   A  report  by  Mental  Disability  Rights   International
           revealed that patients at the Shtimle Hospital were subjected to
           abuses by the staff. However,  at  the  end  of  2002,  physical
           protection of inmates was still inadequate.

  12. We note, in particular, paragraphs 5.48  and  5.49  dealing  with  the
      availability of drugs and  the  treatment  of  Post  Traumatic  Stress
      Disorder.


  13. We return to consider the crucial paragraph 38  in  the  adjudicator's
      determination.  The adjudicator accepted  that  the  claimant  was  in
      receipt of  treatment  for  her  stress  difficulties  in  the  United
      Kingdom.  The only treatment that the claimant was receiving, then  as
      now, was antidepressant medication and sleeping tablets. Dr  Al-Uzri's
      first report made no reference to medication because she was not  then
      receiving any.  The adjudicator did not, of course,  have  before  her
      the  second  report.   The  adjudicator  then  expressed  herself  not
      satisfied that the claimant would get the level of treatment that  she
      clearly required.  In our judgment, there was no evidence  before  the
      adjudicator as to what treatment she required and,  in  spite  of  the
      February 2003 report, there is still no evidence that treatment, other
      than medication, has been attempted and found to be successful.

  14. Mr Jones, who appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State, criticised
      the  adjudicator's  use  of  the  expression  "level  of   treatment".
      Applying the decision of the Court of Appeal in I [1977] Imm  AR  172,
      he submitted that the quality or level of treatment was not a material
      consideration - it was immaterial if medical facilities in Kosovo were
      inferior to those in the United  Kingdom,  provided  those  facilities
      were available.  Whether or not this is a fair gloss  to  put  on  the
      adjudicator's words, there is  no  doubt  that  medical  treatment  is
      available in Kosovo for the claimant.

  15. Finally, we  shall  deal  with  the  adjudicator's  finding  that  the
      claimant will suffer a violation of her Article 3 rights as  a  result
      of the fact that she was raped and there is stigmatisation of  victims
      of rape.  The event, of course, took place some four years  ago.   The
      claimant has the support of her  husband  and  family.   There  is  no
      suggestion that those members of her family around her will stigmatise
      her. There is no reason why neighbours need know about this  incident.
      In particular, there is no reason for the claimant to tell  them.   We
      do not consider that the background material  establishes  that  women
      who have been raped in Kosovo  cannot  be  returned  because  societal
      discrimination against them is sufficiently  severe  to  overcome  the
      high threshold of a violation of Article 3.

  16.  For  these  reasons,  we  do  not  consider  that  the  adjudicator's
      conclusion is sustainable.



Decision:  The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.
