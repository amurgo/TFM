For the Appellant:     Ms Patel, Counsel instructed by Broudie Jackson and
Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION and DIRECTIONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in  1993.  He  appeals  with
       permission the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge M.  Davies)
       to dismiss his human rights and protection appeal.

    2. The basis of the Appellant's claim for asylum was  that  he  faced  a
       real risk of persecution by the Sh'ia militia Hashd al Shaabi.    The
       Appellant claims that in 2017 his father was kidnapped  by  ISIS  who
       looted his property and stole his car. The car was subsequently  used
       as a vehicle for a bomb.   The Appellant received  a  telephone  call
       from someone who identified himself as a member  of  Hashd  al-Shaabi
       who told him that members of the group, and Bayat tribesmen, had been
       killed in the attack.   They swore revenge against the Appellant  and
       his family.  The Appellant and his family decided to flee  the  area.
       As they crossed the border into Turkey they heard that  their  family
       home had been blown up.  The  Appellant's  personal  characteristics,
       insofar as they are relevant for this appeal, is that he  is  a  Kurd
       from Tuz Khurmatu who is nominally Sunni but is in fact an atheist.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal found the Appellant's evidence to be  "wholly
       without credit".  The Appellant had suggested  that  Hashd  al-Shaabi
       might have identified the car's association with his  family  because
       it was  registered  in  their  name,  and  because  the  registration
       documents were in it when the bomb went off.  The Tribunal found that
       to be "pure speculation". The Tribunal regarded the  account  of  the
       family shop being looted as "complete  fabrication",  and  the  claim
       that the family decided to flee into  Turkey  "wholly  unbelievable".
       At paragraph 58 the determination says this:

           "The Appellant's credibility is further damaged by the  evidence
           which indicates at the time of the alleged incident which  gives
           rise to the appellant's claimed risk of  persecution  ISIS  were
           not in control of his home area and  there  is  no  evidence  to
           suggest that they now currently have any influence in  his  home
           area and that the Appellant for instance would be at  risk  from
           them at the present time"

    4. The Tribunal further rejected, for want  of  credibility,  the  claim
       that the Appellant's family left Iraq with him and  found  that  they
       remain in Iraq.  He would therefore have a CSID in Iraq and/or family
       members who could assist him in obtaining another one.  On that basis
       the appeal is dismissed.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page in
       limited terms. Judge Page refused permission to the challenge to  the
       Tribunal's findings on the historical events  narrated,  but  granted
       the  Appellant  permission  to  challenge  the  First-tier   Tribunal
       decision on the grounds that it had manifestly failed to consider the
       potential risk to the Appellant as a civilian from a contested area.

    6. At the outset of the hearing I took  the  unusual  step  of  inviting
       Counsel for the Appellant to renew the  application  for  permission,
       insofar as it related to the grounds rejected by Judge Page,  out  of
       time to the  Upper  Tribunal.  I  did  so  because  having  read  the
       determination with care I regarded it  to  be  arguably  flawed,  and
       because I considered that the limited terms of the grant could impede
       my ability to fairly dispose of the remaining grounds,  i.e.  whether
       the Appellant continued to face a real risk of serious  harm  in  Tuz
       Khurmatu and whether there was a viable internal  flight  alternative
       for him.

    7. For the Respondent Mr McVeety accepted that he  could  have  no  real
       objection to this.  I extended time and granted permission.

       Discussion and Findings

    8. The 'findings' in the First-tier Tribunal  determination  are  flawed
       for three reasons.

    9. First, the determination contains no hint of reasoning.  The  central
       elements of the Appellant's case - his father  being  kidnapped,  the
       family property being looted, the car bomb, the threat and the family
       fleeing - are each in turn rejected because of the Appellant's  "lack
       of credibility". That doesn't amount to reasoning, it  amounts  to  a
       finding unsupported by reasoning.

   10. Appellant's case. As the passage I cite at ï¿½3 above illustrates,  the
       Tribunal appeared to believe that he claimed a fear  of  ISIS,  which
       was rejected on the grounds that this group had not been  in  control
       of his area at the given time. The Appellant did not claim a fear  of
       ISIS. He has consistently claimed a fear of Hashd al_Shaabi. See  for
       instance:

           "I fear Hasdt al-Shabi (sic) they are in control of our area.  I
           am Sunni Kurd and am being targeted by them. They are  Shia  and
           are targeting us. I fear I could be killed by them"

           [answer to the question at  4.1  of  the  Appellant's  screening
           interview "please explain briefly all of  the  reasons  why  you
           cannot return to your home area"]

   11. Third, because the Tribunal failed to  have  regard  to  the  country
       background evidence on what was actually happening in Tuz Khurmatu at
       the time that the Appellant left in the autumn  of  2017.   That  was
       that the Shi'a militia Hashd al-Shaabi, widely believed to  be  under
       the control of the Government of Iraq, was  systematically  targeting
       the Sunni Kurdish population and trying to drive them  out  of  their
       homes:

           "In Tuz Khurmatu, a town in  Salahadin,  tens  of  thousands  of
           Kurdish civilians were displaced, with  their  homes  and  shops
           being allegedly looted and destroyed by GoI troops; Human Rights
           Watch report that at least 51 civilians were  killed.  Dr  Fatah
           has been informed by fieldworkers in Ninewa that Shi'a  militias
           have displaced hundreds of Kurdish families and destroyed homes.
           These groups, primarily Hashd al-Shaabi, have impeded  the  work
           of  international  humanitarian   organisations   and   targeted
           minorities such as the Yezidis; the same militia is reported  to
           be occupying Kurdish neighbourhoods in Kirkuk where they  patrol
           the streets in armed vehicles and  harass  civilians.   Military
           forces on both sides remain mobilised and 'combat ready'".

           [paragraph 12 of AAH (Iraqi Kurds - internal relocation) Iraq CG
           UKUT 00212 (IAC)]

   12. Had the First-tier Tribunal actually read the  Appellant's  case,  or
       the country guidance, or the country background material produced  in
       the bundle before it, and considered his evidence  in  that  context,
       the decision could very well have been different. I therefore set the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside insofar as  it  relates  to
       the claim under the Refugee Convention.

   13. In respect of the ground approved by Judge Page, the  parties  before
       me agreed that the determination contains absolutely no  findings  on
       whether the Appellant might be entitled to  humanitarian  protection.
       That part of the determination too is set aside.

   14. In view of the fact that the First-tier Tribunal decision contains no
       salvageable findings, the parties agreed that the only fair  disposal
       would be remittal de novo to the First-tier Tribunal by a Judge other
       than Judge Davies.

       Anonymity

   15. Having regard to the fact that  this  is  a  protection  claim  I  am
       prepared to make the following direction for anonymity,  pursuant  to
       Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the
       Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders.

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings
           shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
           family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant and to the
           Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead to
           contempt of court proceedings".

       Decisions

   16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside in its entirety.

   17. The decision in the appeal will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal.
