For the Appellants:      Mr B Ali, instructed by Messrs Kuddus, Solicitors
For the Respondent:  Mr C Avery, Presenting Officer


Whilst the evidence needed to  establish  the  availability  of  short  term
third party support may be satisfied comparatively readily  by  satisfactory
evidence  of  the  genuineness  of  intent  and  the  present  existence  of
sufficient surplus funds, a long term commitment  to  third  party  funding,
especially to one who is  neither  an  ascendant  nor  descendant  relative,
requires more detailed and broader evidence and enquiry, and  more  thorough
assessment  A  judge would need to be satisfied,  from  the  perspective  of
the circumstances at the date of the  Respondent's  decision,  that  in  the
long  term,  whatever  the  third  party's  own  future  family  and   other
commitments might be, he would be willing and able to give funding  priority
to supporting an appellant,  in  effect  treating  him  or  her  or  her  as
equivalent of one of his own dependants.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. The Appellants are citizens of Bangladesh. The First Appellant  is  the
     mother of the Second and Third Appellants. They were born on 9  January
     1948, 18 March 1986 and  22  March  1989  respectively.  They  are  all
     referred to herein as Appellants for ease of identification, but during
     the course of the hearing an issue arose as to whether the  Second  and
     Third Appellants are actually parties to the  present  proceedings.  We
     shall deal with this issue and other issues  arising  from  it  in  due
     course.

History of the Appeal

  2. All three Appellants applied to the Respondent  on  2  March  2004  for
     leave to enter the UK for settlement as the  wife  and  dependent  sons
     respectively of Mr K, their Sponsor, a person present  and  settled  in
     the UK. The First Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  also  have  four  other
     children. At the time of the application, three of  them  were  married
     and living independently in Bangladesh and the fourth, a  student,  was
     over the age of 18 but lived in the family home in Bangladesh with  the
     Appellants. At the time of the application, the Second Appellant was  a
     few days short of his 18th birthday, and the Third Appellant was 14.

  3. Their applications were refused by the  Respondent  on  9  August  2004
     under paragraphs 281 and 297 of HC395 on the basis he was not satisfied
     they could meet the requirements of  the  Rules  on  accommodation  and
     maintenance. His decision was addressed to all three Appellants and his
     reasons were as follows:


           As evidence of your Sponsor's ability to  maintain  you  he  has
           submitted evidence of Third party sponsorship from  a  relative.
           I have taken note of the third  party's  economic  and  personal
           circumstances.  At present the third party Sponsor has his  wife
           and child to look after and no doubt he has his own  commitments
           and financial obligations which are likely to be supplemented in
           the future.  Under the circumstances, I feel  that  although  he
           may be able to support you and your dependants in the very short-
           term  he  may  not  be  able  to  adequately  provide  you  with
           maintenance in the long run.   Your  husband's  only  source  of
           income is from state benefits.  I  am  therefore  not  satisfied
           that you and any dependants can be adequately maintained without
           recourse to public funds.
           You have submitted an EHO letter from local authority confirming
           that the proposed accommodation is fit for human habitation  and
           will not cause overcrowding.  I  am  content  with  his  letter.
           However, considering the fact that your husband is in receipt of
           state benefits, you failed to submit any  satisfactory  evidence
           of rent receipts or any confirmation that he is not  in  receipt
           of housing benefit.  In  view  of  these  factors  I  cannot  be
           satisfied that you will  be  accommodated  without  recourse  to
           public funds.

  4. On 22 September 2004 Messrs Kaddus  wrote  to  the  Respondent  in  the
     following terms. The underlining is ours.


           "Re AK           Dob: 19/01/1948   Bangladesh
           Notice of Appeal

           We write to inform you that we act for the above named client in
           connection with his [sic] immigration matter.


           Please find enclosed:
           1. notice of appeal
           2. grounds of appeal
           3. letter from third party Sponsor
           4. letter from employer
           5. bank statements from Abbey National
           6. proof of housing benefit award letter from council

           As you will see from the enclosed documentary evidence that  the
           grounds upon which application  for  entry  clearance  has  been
           refused has [sic] now been satisfied and met by the Sponsor  and
           the third party Sponsor.


           We suggest in order to save public  funds  and  court  time  you
           concede the issue of refusal under paragraph 281 and 297 of  the
           HC 395 as amended and issue our client entry clearance to the UK
           as the reasons for refusal has  [sic]  been  challenged  in  the
           grounds of appeal and the further documents provided herein.


           Kindly acknowledge the safe receipt of the same. We look forward
           to hearing from you as to when our client can collect her  entry
           clearance visa from the British  High  Commission.  Please  note
           that if  this  matter  was  to  proceed  to  a  hearing  in  the
           Immigration Appellate Authority our client Sponsor shall  defend
           and argue that he had tried  his  best  to  settle  this  matter
           without having to go to court."

  5. It can be seen therefore that the covering letter  refers  only  to  an
     appeal by the First Appellant and there is nothing in  this  letter  to
     indicate or imply that Messrs Kaddus were acting for anyone other  than
     the first Appellant in lodging the notice of  appeal.  Furthermore  the
     notice of appeal itself names only the first Appellant as the party  to
     the appeal.

  6. The appeal came before Immigration Judge Curzon Lewis on 2 March  2006.
     In his determination promulgated on 4 April 2006 he  listed  all  three
     appellants as parties to the appeal and made inter alia  the  following
     findings.


           1. ..... They [the three Appellants]  appeal  collectively  from
           the decision of the Respondent dated 9  August  2004  to  refuse
           their several applications for entry  clearance  to  the  United
           Kingdom for settlement.


           13. Notice of appeal, in the name of the Appellant  but  clearly
           intending to refer also to Humayun and Tanbir, was signed on  30
           September 2004 by [Mr D] and by Kuddus Ali, their Solicitor....


           62. The Respondent elected to consider the applications:-
                 (a) of the principal Appellant under paragraph 281  as  the
                 wife of her husband/Sponsor who is settled in the UK; and
                 (b) of Hamayun and Tanbir separately from  their  Appellant
                 mother by reference to paragraph 297, both boys being under
                 the age of 18 at the date of application.

            64. One can approach this appeal by alternative routes:-
                 (a)  by  considering  the  applications  separately   under
                 paragraphs 281 and 297, as the ECO  did: or
                 (b) by treating Humayun and Tanbir as dependants  of  their
                 mother/ the principal Appellant and  thus  considering  all
                 the Appellants by reference to paragraph 281.

                 65. The paragraph 64(b) approach can be applied only if the
                 evidence shows  that  Humayun  and/or  Tanbir  were  indeed
                 independent, and  that  their  dependency  was  upon  their
                 mother.  If the answer to both questions is positive,  only
                 then can either or both of the  boys  be  considered  under
                 paragraph 281.

                 66. Does this distinction make any material difference? The
                 answer is "yes", because of the amendment to paragraph  297
                 by CM4851 of 2 October 2000.
                       66.1  Paragraph  297  restricts   the   provider   of
                       accommodation and  maintenance  to  "the  parent  the
                       child is seeking to join".  The wording in  paragraph
                       297 as amended is effective to  exclude  third  party
                       support.
                       66.2  by  contrast  the  wording  in  paragraph   281
                       requires there to be "adequate accommodation" and  an
                       ability to maintain "the parties and any dependants".
                        Paragraph 281 does not exclude third party support.


                 77.   In  my  judgement  all  three  appeals  are  properly
                 determinable solely by reference to paragraph  281.  It  is
                 unnecessary to consider the appeal of  Humayun  and  Tanbir
                 separately by reference to paragraph 297.

  7. The Immigration Judge after  analysing  the  evidence  and  submissions
     allowed the appeal under paragraph 281 in respect of maintenance. In so
     doing he noted that:-


           91. Whereas the Sponsor hitherto has been able to meet  all  his
           expenses out of the public  funds  which  he  receives,  he  has
           candidly put figures before the court which show  that  he  will
           certainly not be able to do so if the  three  Appellants  joined
           his household, at least  not  without  dipping  into  his  Abbey
           savings account.


           97. ... In my judgment the income of Mr Malik, the third  party,
           is amply sufficient to cover not only all the costs of  his  own
           household, but also to supplement the income of his  uncle,  the
           Sponsor, thereby ensuring that the Sponsor will not be  entitled
           to increased  or  additional  public  funds  by  reason  of  the
           Appellants' arrival in United Kingdom.

  8. With regard to  accommodation  he  noted  that  there  was  conflicting
     evidence from the  local  authority  concerning  the  adequacy  of  the
     accommodation to be provided by the Sponsor. He concluded however  that
     the third party Sponsor would be willing to provide  accommodation  for
     one  of  the  boys.  On  that  basis  he  allowed  the  appeal  as   to
     accommodation under paragraph 281, but noted as follows:

            105. My decision would be different if the applications of  the
           two sons fell to be considered under paragraph 297,  because  of
           the decision in [AA  (Bangladesh)  [2005]  UKAIT  00105].  Under
           paragraph 297 the provision of accommodation and maintenance  is
           restricted to the Sponsor whose  household  the  applicants  are
           seeking to join, and clearly the Sponsor alone is  not  able  to
           accommodate  and  maintain  the  Appellants  without  additional
           recourse to public funds

  9. Thus, it appears from the  determination  that  the  Immigration  Judge
     concluded that there was a collective appeal by  all  three  Appellants
     (whatever "collective" might mean in this context) because they clearly
     intended it to be so, but he  provided  no  reasoning  or  evidence  to
     support this finding. He then confirmed he  would  have  dismissed  the
     appeals of the Second and Third Appellants if they fell to  be  decided
     under paragraph 297, but allowed them because he  considered  that  the
     Second and Third Appellants could be treated as the dependants  of  the
     First Appellant, and the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  could
     therefore be decided in their favour under paragraph 281.  He  made  no
     separate finding under paragraph 281  concerning  the  First  Appellant
     coming to the UK alone.

 10. Then, rather curiously, he went  on  to  dismiss  all  the  appeals  in
     respect of Article 8 by applying the test in Huang [2005] EWCA Civ 105,
     which is rather surprising given that  he  considered  that  they  were
     entitled to succeed under the Immigration Rules. We  conclude  that  by
     this he must have meant that if the claims could not succeed under  the
     Rules then they would  fail  under  Article  8  alone  because  by  the
     application of the test in Huang there was nothing "truly  exceptional"
     in the specific facts, with which we would agree.

 11. The Respondent then sought and obtained an order for reconsideration on
     the basis that the Immigration Judge had materially misdirected himself
     in law in four specific respects:

           1. In paragraph 64 he wrongly concluded that the appeal could be
              approached by alternative routes. Paragraph 281 related  only
              to spouses. Children, including dependent children,  fell  to
              be considered under paragraph 297, and on the facts  of  this
              appeal under sub-paragraph 297(i)(c).
           2.  Thus  he  erred  in  taking  into  account  in  respect   of
              maintenance and  accommodation  for  the  two  children,  the
              availability of third party support.
           3. He also erred in his interpretation of paragraph 281(v)  with
              regard to the First Appellant. On its proper construction and
              in line with the guidance in  AA  (Bangladesh)  [2005]  UKAIT
              00105, the  parties  must  be  able  to  maintain  themselves
              without third party support. As he concluded in paragraphs 91
              and 105 of the determination, they were unable to do that.
           4. With regard to the finding that accommodation for one of  the
              boys would be provided by the third party Sponsor, there  was
              no evidence upon which this finding could be based  and  this
              conclusion was entirely speculative


 12. Mr Ali, in response, filed what he described as  at  the  "Respondents'
     Reply", which should more correctly be  described  as  the  Appellants'
     Reply. In this he made the following points:

           1. The Appellants' appeal should  be  allowed  for  the  reasons
              given by the Immigration Judge in his determination.
           2. The Appellants' appeal should be allowed in respect of  human
              rights  because  of  unlawful  discrimination   against   the
              Appellants  who,  in  appealing  against  refusal  of   entry
              clearance, were precluded from  relying  upon  post  decision
              evidence  by  virtue  of  section   85(5)   and   were   thus
              disadvantaged by reference to in-country appellants.

 13. The further issue, to which we  have  already  alluded  briefly,  arose
     during the course of the proceedings before us. Mr Ali  indicated  that
     if it was necessary to assist the successful appeals of the  First  and
     Second Appellants, then the Third Appellant, who was  still  under  the
     age of 18, would be content for his appeal to be withdrawn so he  could
     later apply to join the other members of  his  family  under  paragraph
     297. This purported concession led us to inquire whether either Mr  Ali
     or the Sponsor had the authority to withdraw the appeal  on  behalf  of
     the Third Appellant and, in this context, to consider the terms of  the
     original notice of appeal. It was then we observed that the  notice  of
     appeal and  covering  letter,  which  we  expected  to  nominate  their
     representatives, if any, referred only to the First  Appellant  and  we
     invited and received oral submissions about this rather  obvious  point
     touching our jurisdiction.

 14.  We now turn to our assessment of the various issues and submissions.

The position of the Second and Third Appellants

 15. The Immigration Judge was of the view as set out above that  the  three
     Appellants appealed collectively, even though the Notice of Appeal  was
     in the name of the First Appellant only.  He said that  the  Notice  of
     Appeal clearly intended to refer to the Second and Third Appellants  as
     well. As we have indicated he gave no reasoning for this conclusion and
     there appears to be no evidence to support it. We  invited  Mr  Ali  to
     refer us to any such evidence, if it existed, but he was unable  to  do
     so. We are bound to assess this matter, even though it was  not  raised
     by the Respondent in his grounds of application, because it arises from
     the original grounds of appeal and goes to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.
     In this we follow AH (Scope of s103 reconsideration) Sudan [2006] UKAIT
     00038 and also A (Iraq) [2005] EWCA Civ 1438.

 16. First we must assess whether the Second and Third Appellants have  made
     appeals in their own right that may stand or fall on their  own  merits
     under whichever of the Immigration Rules apply.

 17. We can see no basis in the documents themselves for  this  proposition.
     Both the Notice of Appeal and the covering letter  from  Messrs  Kaddus
     refer exclusively to the  First  Appellant,  and  particularly  in  the
     covering letter do so on a number of separate occasions and  in  wholly
     unambiguous terms.  The  grounds  of  appeal  recite  the  Respondent's
     decision and take issue with it but  do  not  take  matters  materially
     further. They are consistent with an appeal under paragraph 281 by  the
     First Appellant alone.  In our  judgement,  the  terms  of  the  Kaddus
     letter indicate that only one appeal, by the First Appellant was  made,
     and that there was no accidental omission of the names  of  the  Second
     and Third Appellants from the notice of appeal.

 18. It is true that there was just one written decision by  the  Respondent
     for all three Appellants but that is neutral  to  the  issue  of  which
     amongst them wished to appeal from that decision. It  is  not  uncommon
     for only some of the parties to a decision by the Respondent to  appeal
     against it. There could be a variety of reasons why  the  two  sons  in
     this case might have decided not to appeal. They  might  at  that  time
     have preferred to remain in Bangladesh with their adult siblings.  They
     might have been advised that as the  basis  of  the  challenge  to  the
     Respondent's decision (as stated in the  covering  letter  from  Messrs
     Kaddus) was the adequacy of third party support, they could not succeed
     under paragraph 297, which excluded third  party  support.  They  might
     have concluded that their mother had a better chance to succeed on  her
     own. They might have seen some tactical advantage in pursuing  separate
     appeals. Alternatively, it could be explained by negligence on the part
     of their advisers. We cannot speculate.

 19. What we  do  find  is  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  the
     Immigration Judge's conclusion that the sons were intended  as  parties
     to this appeal and accordingly that  he  erred  materially  in  law  in
     proceeding on the basis that  the  Second  and  Third  Appellants  were
     parties to the appeal before him. There were and are no appeals by  the
     Second and Third Appellants before the Immigration Judge or before us.

 20. However, having said that, we have gone on to assess whether,  in  case
     we are wrong in our first conclusion and there are  extant  appeals  by
     the Second and Third Appellants, it was open to the  Immigration  Judge
     to assess those appeals under paragraph 281.

The scope of paragraph 281 and its relationship with paragraph 297

 21. The two paragraphs state as follows.

      SPOUSES OR CIVIL PARTNERS OF PERSONS PRESENT AND SETTLED IN THE UNITED
      KINGDOM OR BEING ADMITTED ON THE SAME OCCASION FOR SETTLEMENT
      Requirements for leave to enter the United  Kingdom  with  a  view  to
      settlement as the spouse or civil partner  of  a  person  present  and
      settled in the United Kingdom or being admitted on the  same  occasion
      for settlement
      281. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter the
      United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the spouse or civil
      partner of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom or who
      is on the same occasion being admitted for settlement are that:
      (i) (a) the applicant is married to or the civil partner of a person
      present and settled in the United Kingdom or who is on the same
      occasion being admitted for settlement; or
      (b) the applicant is married or the civil partner of to a person who
      has a right of abode in the United Kingdom or indefinite leave to
      enter or remain in the United Kingdom and is on the same occasion
      seeking admission to the United Kingdom for the purposes of settlement
      and the parties were married or formed a civil partnership at least 4
      years ago, since which time they have been living together outside the
      United Kingdom; and
      (ii) the parties to the marriage have met; and
      (iii) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other
      as his or her spouse and the marriage is subsisting; and
      (iv) there will be adequate accommodation for the parties and any
      dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation which
      they own or occupy exclusively; and
      (v) the parties will be able to maintain themselves and any dependants
      adequately without recourse to public funds; and
      (vi) the applicant holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for
      entry in this capacity.

     LEAVE TO ENTER OR REMAIN IN THE  UNITED  KINGDOM  AS  THE  CHILD  OF  A
     PARENT, PARENTS OR A RELATIVE PRESENT AND SETTLED OR BEING ADMITTED FOR
     SETTLEMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
     Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United  Kingdom  as  the
     child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled  or  being
     admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom.
     297. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to
     enter the United Kingdom as  the  child  of  a  parent,  parents  or  a
     relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement  in  the
     United Kingdom are that he:
     (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent, parents or
     a relative in one of the following circumstances:
     (a) both parents are present and settled in the United Kingdom; or
     (b)  both  parents  are  being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion   for
settlement; or
     (c) one parent is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom  and  the
     other is being admitted on the same occasion for settlement; or
     (d) one parent is present and settled in the United  Kingdom  or  being
     admitted on the same occasion for settlement and the  other  parent  is
     dead; or
     (e) one parent is present and settled in the United  Kingdom  or  being
     admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for  settlement  and  has  had  sole
     responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
     (f) one parent or a relative is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
     Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and there
     are serious and compelling family or other  considerations  which  make

     (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the  parent,  parents
     or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse  to  public
     funds in accommodation which the parent, parents or relative the  child
     is seeking to join, own or occupy exclusively; and
     (v) can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent, parents, or
     relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse to public
     funds; and
     (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
capacity.

 22. The Immigration Judge in paragraph 64  of  his  determination  asserted
     that there were two alternative routes to deciding the appeals  of  the
     three Appellants. The first was by considering paragraph  281  for  the
     First Appellant and paragraph 297 for the Second and Third  Appellants.
     There can be no objection to that approach. It was the  route  used  by
     the Respondent in his decision and is  the  obvious  intention  of  the
     Rules as indicated in the headings to the two paragraphs.

 23. The second alternative he  identified,  and  followed  as  he  said  in
     paragraph 77 of the determination, was to treat the  Second  and  Third
     Appellants as dependants of the First Appellant and  to  consider  them
     all under paragraph 281. He did not explain in any meaningful  way  how
     he reached a conclusion that would appear to be contrary to the obvious
     intent of the Rules. He did not seek to explain why, if his  view  were
     correct,  the Respondent's policy as  expressed  in  the  Rules  should
     offer two  different  routes  for  the  same  decision  with  different
     requirements under each. We consider he made another material error  in
     law in concluding that paragraph  281  was  relevant  at  all  for  the
     appeals of the Second and Third Appellants.

 24. The heading of paragraph 281 specifically states  that  it  relates  to
     spouses of persons present and settled in the UK or being  admitted  on
     the same occasion for settlement. It makes no mention in the heading of
     applying to dependent  children  or  any  other  dependants.  The  only
     reference to dependants is in sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) and  this  is
     to require that the parties to the marriage will be able to accommodate
     and maintain themselves and any dependants adequately without  recourse
     to public funds, which means as paragraph 6A of the  Immigration  Rules
     makes clear, without additional recourse to public funds. This does not
     offer a route for the dependants to obtain entry  clearance.  It  means
     that the spouses must be able to demonstrate that they can  accommodate
     and maintain all their  dependants,  whether  in  the  UK  or  outside,
     whether seeking entry clearance themselves or not,  without  additional
     recourse to public funds. The  paragraph  offers  no  support  for  the
     Immigration Judge's curious view.

 25. There are entirely separate paragraphs  relating  to  applications  for
     entry clearance by  each  type  of  dependant,  category  by  category.
     Paragraph 297 is  the  appropriate  paragraph  for  children  and  sub-
     paragraph (i)(c) is the relevant category  for  the  Second  and  Third
     Appellants. It provides for  the  situation  in  which  one  parent  is
     present and settled in the UK and the other is being  admitted  on  the
     same  occasion  for  settlement.  It  is  specifically  structured  for
     unmarried children who are under 18 and  are  not  leading  independent
     lives. The Second and Third Appellants would have to be able to satisfy
     all the requirements of this paragraph in order  to  succeed  in  their
     appeals, but as we have noted above the Immigration Judge in  paragraph
     105 of his determination concluded that  they  could  not  satisfy  its
     accommodation and maintenance requirements  due  to  the  exclusion  of
     third  party  support  from  the  calculation  as   confirmed   in   AA
     (Bangladesh). It was not open to the Immigration Judge  to  attempt  to
     circumvent the terms of this  paragraph  by  seeking  to  decide  their
     appeals under a different paragraph with less stringent conditions that
     had no relevance to them.

 26. Mr Ali at one point argued  that  paragraph  281  was  appropriate  for
     dependants who only wanted 2 years leave but in line with our reasoning
     described above we  conclude  there  is  no  support  in  the  text  of
     paragraph 281 for the assessment of the claims of anyone other  than  a
     spouse on any basis.

 27. Thus it follows that even if the Second and Third Appellant had  lodged
     notices of appeal against the Respondent's decision, their appeals were
     bound to fail. They could not meet the requirements of paragraph 297.

The human rights issue

 28. Mr Ali raised one final  matter  that  touches  the  Second  and  Third
     Appellants.  It is in essence that the  distinction  made  by  sections
     85(4) and 85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
     between the evidence that can be considered in in-country  and  out-of-
     country appeals is discriminatory under Articles 8 with 14, and is non-
     compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998.

 29. Essentially section 85(4)  provides  that  in  in-country  appeals  the
     Tribunal can  consider  evidence  about  any  matter  which  it  thinks
     relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence  which
     concerns a matter arising  after  the  date  of  the  decision,  whilst
     section  85(5)  limits  the  Tribunal  in  out-of-country  appeals   to
     considering only the circumstances appertaining  at  the  time  of  the
     decision to refuse.

 30. There is no material substance in this point, which was raised with and
     properly rejected by the  Immigration  Judge.  The  position  of  those
     seeking to enter the UK is that they can  choose  when  to  make  their
     application for entry clearance or for  a  certificate  of  entitlement
     and, if they are competently advised, they will not  do  so  until  the
     evidence available is adequate to succeed. Thus the question of  timing
     is in their own hands. That is rather different from the position of  a
     person who is in-country and may need to  make  an  application  before
     existing leave expires, and for whom removal from the  UK  may  be  the
     consequence of a  lost  appeal,  and  where  the  one-stop  requirement
     applies.

 31. It is therefore entirely fair, appropriate  and  non-discriminatory  to
     assess out-of-country appeals on the circumstances appertaining at  the
     time the Respondent's decision  was  made,  and  to  assess  in-country
     appeals as at the time of the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  There  is  no
     disadvantage to an out-of-country appellant who can choose the time  of
     his application and may be able, depending on the particular facts,  to
     make further applications if the  first  fails  but  his  circumstances
     change thereafter. Nor do the provisions  of  section  85  discriminate
     between people by reference to the matters identified  in  Article  14,
     including sex, race, colour, language,  religion,  political  or  other
     opinion,  national  or  social  origin,  association  with  a  national
     minority, property, birth or other status.

 32. Mr Ali's specific point was that  the  circumstances  relating  to  the
     Second Appellant changed after the date of the decision with the making
     of a job offer in the UK dated 22 September 2004, but he was  not  able
     to have that taken into account by the Immigration  Judge  because  the
     job offer post-dated the decision. However the  job  offer  also  post-
     dated the Second Appellant's 18th birthday and the reality is  that  he
     was never in a position to be able to satisfy all the  requirements  of
     the  Rules  because  his  accommodation  depended,  according  to   the
     Immigration Judge's findings, upon non-permissible third party support.
     When he was under 18 there was no job; when there was a job he was  too
     old.

 33. Thus in summary we  conclude  in  relation  to  the  Second  and  Third
     Appellants, that the Immigration  Judge  erred  materially  in  law  by
     allowing their appeals under paragraph  281  of  HC395,  first  because
     there were no extant appeals by them before  him  at  all,  and  second
     because, even if there were, paragraph 281 was not relevant  and  their
     appeals were bound to fail under the relevant  paragraph  297  for  the
     reasons he himself described in paragraph 105 of his determination.


The First Appellant's position

 34. We turn then to the position of the First Appellant,  which  is  to  be
     considered under paragraph 281 and is stronger  in  some  respects  for
     there being no extant appeals by the Second and Third  Appellants,  who
     therefore remain in Bangladesh.

 35. Thus there would be no problem of overcrowding  in  the  Sponsor's  one
     bedroom flat if the First Appellant were to come to the UK on her  own.
     There  is  therefore  no  issue  concerning   the   adequacy   of   the
     accommodation arrangements for her under paragraph 281(iv).

 36. The real issue is in relation to maintenance under paragraph 281(v) and
     whether the Appellant has discharged her burden of proof to the balance
     of probabilities. The Immigration Judge concluded in paragraphs 91  and
     105 of his determination that the Sponsor would not be able to maintain
     the three Appellants from his own funds without additional recourse  to
     public funds. He made no finding concerning the position if  the  First
     Appellant came to the UK alone. We have therefore considered  this  for
     ourselves bearing in mind that we are looking at the position as it was
     at the time of the Respondent's decision and all the material  evidence
     relating to this as presented on behalf  of  the  First  Appellant  was
     recorded in the Immigration Judge's determination.

 37. Additionally we would observe that, from  the  point  of  view  of  the
     adequacy of maintenance under paragraph 281(v), the  Second  and  Third
     Appellants still were the First  Appellant's  dependants,  even  though
     they remained in Bangladesh. The costs may be less than if they came to
     the UK but that would have to  be  established  by  evidence.  Moreover
     evidence would be required as to whether their other  sibling  who  was
     over 18 at the  time  of  the  decision  and  a  student,  was  also  a
     dependant. Dependency does not necessarily cease at 18 especially if  a
     son is pursuing full-time education. There was however no  evidence  on
     any of these points.

 38. The evidence before the Immigration Judge was that the Sponsor received
     �105.45 per week in pension credit and social security benefits. He was
     in receipt also of full housing and council tax benefit. He had savings
     at the Abbey Bank of about �1940.

 39. Our first observation is that given the Sponsor lives  on  pension  and
     state benefits alone without additional income and  receives  what  the
     Government assesses is adequate for a person  living  on  his  own,  we
     cannot see how two  people  can  live  on  that  money  without  either
     reducing their standard of living below that which the Government deems
     adequate for people living in the UK, or without creating  a  need  for
     additional recourse to public funds.

 40. Mr Ali suggested to us that the First Appellant  could  work  part-time
     but accepted there was no evidence  before  the  Immigration  Judge  to
     support this submission beyond a general assertion in  her  application
     form that she will be  attending  college  and  working  part-time.  He
     acknowledged that this matter was not pursued in  evidence  before  the
     Immigration Judge. Indeed so. The First Appellant was 58 years  old  at
     the time of the Respondent's decision and it would have  required  some
     compelling evidence that she  would  be  able  to  find  a  job,  being
     essentially unskilled.

 41. Also the evidence presented to the Immigration  Judge,  concerning  the
     consequences in terms of benefits, should the First Appellant join  the
     Sponsor, was vague and inadequate. He was not told what income  support
     levels would be  for  the  couple  together,  or  what  impact  regular
     payments to the Appellant from her  nephew,  the  third  party  Sponsor
     would have on the Sponsor's benefits.  This is a  matter  to  which  we
     shall return later.

 42. Therefore for these reasons and bearing in  mind  that  the  burden  of
     proof rests with the Appellant  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  we
     conclude that she has failed to establish under paragraph  281(v)  that
     she  and  the  Sponsor  without  third  party  support  could  maintain
     themselves and their dependants adequately without additional  recourse
     to public funds, even if she alone joined the Sponsor in the UK.

 43. The next question  is  whether  in  principle  in  order  to  meet  the
     maintenance requirement of paragraph 281(v) reliance can be  placed  on
     long term third  party  funding.  The  Respondent  in  the  grounds  of
     application prayed  in  aid  the  conclusion  of  the  Tribunal  in  AA
     (Bangladesh), which held as follows:

           "23. We note the  current  paragraph  297(v)  deals  solely  with
           maintenance unlike its predecessor 297(iv). It requires that  the
           applicant for  entry  clearance  "can,  and  will  be  maintained
           adequately by the parent (emphasis added) the child is seeking to
           join...., without recourse to public  funds".  We  are  satisfied
           that the use of the definite article limits the class  of  person
           who can provide the maintenance. We  regard  the  formulation  as
           pointing clearly to a requirement that where a child is joining a
           parent under paragraph 297 it is that parent  who  must  maintain
           that child. Third party support by relatives or otherwise  cannot
           satisfy the rule as it now is.  Arman Ali cannot be relied on for
           the proper interpretation  of  Rule  297(v)  of  the  Immigration
           Rules."

 44. However AA (Bangladesh) related specifically to paragraph  297  of  the
     Rules. We reach no conclusion concerning this as it not  necessary  for
     us to consider this matter for the purpose of this appeal  because  for
     the reasons we shall describe we have concluded that the offer of  long
     term third party funding by the Appellant's nephew is on  the  evidence
     inadequate to meet the requirements of paragraph 281.

 45. The sponsorship declaration by the  third  party  accompanying  of  the
     Appellant's original application is as follows.

           1. I wish to support my maternal uncle in  his  application  for
              his wife and two children to come to the United  Kingdom  for
              settlement.  My uncle is unable to work and is not  medically
              fit to work.  I am prepared  to  maintain  and  pay  for  the
              accommodation cost of my auntie, and my cousin brothers.
           2. I am willing and able to support my auntie and my two  cousin
              brothers during their stay in the  UK,  without  recourse  to
              public funds.
           3. I work for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets as a principal
              officer and earn �28,758 per year and have sufficient  income
              to maintain my auntie and her children during their  stay  in
              United Kingdom.
           4. I have savings of �3000 and over in my  bank  account  and  I
              have other savings  besides  this  ie  sufficient  income  to
              maintain and accommodate my  auntie  and  family  in  the  UK
              during a visit without seeking assistance from public funds.


 46. The Immigration Judge recorded the third party's oral evidence and  his
     own conclusions in the following terms:

           30. [The third party] and his wife, live at [London].  They  have
               one child only who was born on 15 February 2004.
           31. The third party is employed by the London  Borough  of  Tower
               Hamlets on a permanent contract as a senior  housing  officer
               at �30,423 per annum.
           32. His wife is also employed by  the  London  Borough  of  Tower
               Hamlets as a housing officer at a salary of �23,000 p a.
           33. The third party and his  wife  have  been  willing  from  the
               outset of the entry clearance applications  to  maintain  his
               uncle's family upon  her  arrival  in  United  Kingdom.   His
               mother was the Sponsor's sister. Given the amount of his  and
               his wife's joint income, he confirmed that he would  have  no
               difficulty in supporting the Appellant in the long term.   He
               had savings of �20,000.  As evidence thereof the third  party
               produced his HSBC statements  for  his  current  and  deposit
               accounts.  The balance at 26 October 2005  stood  at  �22,085
               .92.
           93. In considering the third party  evidence,  the  Court  cannot
               take into account
               the income of [the third party's wife] because  there  is  no
               evidence that her availability as a co-Sponsor  was  ever  in
               contemplation at the date of  decision.
           96. The third party on the other hand was named as a provider  of
               maintenance and accommodation costs on page  10  of  each  of
               visa  application  and  on  page  13   of   the   Appellant's
               application.
           97. The third party attended the hearing and gave oral  evidence,
               speaking to
               the pay slips and bank statements referred to above.  I found
               the third party to be very genuine and credible in his  offer
               to co-sponsor the Appellants. His wife is working.  They have
               one child only.  In my judgment  the  income  of   the  third
               party is amply sufficient to cover not only all the costs  of
               his own household, but also to supplement the income  of  his
               uncle, the Sponsor, thereby ensuring that  the  Sponsor  will
               not be entitled to increased or additional  public  funds  by
               reason of the Appellant's arrival in United Kingdom.

 47. We consider that the Immigration Judge erred materially in law  by  not
     addressing himself to  the  important  distinction  in  the  evidential
     requirement between the provision of short term third party support and
     the indefinite need, as in this appeal, for  long  term  support  which
     might continue for the life of the First Appellant. Nor did he properly
     address in this regard the specific concerns about this raised  by  the
     Respondent.

 48. No doubt, as indeed the Respondent accepted in his decision, the  third
     party would and would be able to provide support  in  the  short  term.
     There  is  no  reason  to  doubt  his  sincerity  and  good   intention
     particularly  when  he  gave  the  Sponsor  �2000  to  fund  the  legal
     proceedings. But a sponsorship declaration is not legally  binding  and
     whilst expressions  of  support  and  goodwill  coupled  with  adequate
     current means, if held genuine, may be enough  in  the  short  term  to
     satisfy paragraph 281 whilst a new arrival gets established and perhaps
     finds employment, much more is  required  evidentially  to  demonstrate
     that the necessary third party support will be available  in  the  long
     term to obviate the need for additional state funding.

 49. An Immigration Judge would need to be satisfied, from  the  perspective
     of the circumstances at the date of the Respondent's decision, that  in
     the long term, whatever the third party's own future family  and  other
     commitments might be, he would be willing  and  able  to  give  funding
     priority to supporting an appellant, in effect treating him or  her  as
     equivalent of one of his own dependants rather than being one of his or
     her sponsor's.

 50. In this appeal, the sponsorship declaration by the third party,  whilst
     it acknowledges the First Appellant's wish for  "settlement"  talks  of
     the First Appellant's "stay" and "visit" in the UK, which is perhaps an
     indication of some short term thinking. Moreover, there was no evidence
     or inquiry before the Immigration Judge as to how much might be  needed
     in the way of third party support to secure adequate  maintenance.  Nor
     in this context was there any evidence of  the  potential  impact  that
     regular payments by the third party to the First Appellant  might  have
     on the Sponsor's own present and future entitlement  to  benefits.  Nor
     was there any evidence or inquiry as to the extent of the third party's
     own potential future commitments. It was established that he  presently
     had a wife and  child  but  there  was  no  evidence  recorded  by  the
     Immigration Judge about whether he wanted additional children, and  how
     this might impact on his  surplus  income  or  his  wife's  ability  to
     continue work, which is very material because  she  contributes  nearly
     half of their family's income. There  was  no  evidence  either  as  to
     whether at some point the third party might have financial  commitments
     to his own or his wife's parents, which could take  priority  over  his
     ability and willingness to support an aunt.

 51. Thus, whilst the evidence needed to establish the availability of short
     term third party support may  be  satisfied  comparatively  readily  by
     satisfactory evidence of the genuineness  of  intent  and  the  present
     existence of sufficient surplus funds, a long term commitment to  third
     party funding, especially to  one  who  is  neither  an  ascendant  nor
     descendant relative, requires more detailed and  broader  evidence  and
     enquiry,  and  more  thorough  assessment    Vague   and   unquantified
     expressions of goodwill are  inadequate  to  enable  an  applicant  for
     settlement to show the availability of adequate maintenance (or  indeed
     accommodation)  even  if  the  Rules  allow  third  party  support   in
     principle. We conclude that the First Appellant failed to  provide  the
     necessary evidence to the Immigration Judge to satisfy her burden under
     paragraph 281(v) and the Immigration Judge erred materially in  law  in
     allowing her appeal by misinterpreting the scope and true extent of the
     burden which the First Appellant is required to discharge.

                                  DECISION

 52. The Immigration Judge made material  errors  of  law  in  allowing  the
     appeals of the three Appellants. The following decision is  accordingly
     substituted therefor:
           1. There were no extant appeals by the Second and Third
              Appellants.
           2. The First Appellant's appeal is dismissed in respect of the
              Immigration Rules and Article 8.
