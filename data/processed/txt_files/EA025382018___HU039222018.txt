Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms U Miszkiel, instructed by Jein Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller on 5th November 2018 and Mr T Melvin on
                    14th January 2019, Senior Home Office Presenting
                    Officers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. Mr E, a Nigerian Citizen born on 22nd  November  1960,  applied  on
         30th May 2017 for a derivative residence card as the primary  carer
         of a British Citizen namely his wife, [I]. He  also  made  a  human
         rights claim on 19th April 2016. Both applications were refused  by
         the respondent for reasons set out in a decision  dated  8  January
         2018. PE appealed both decisions and the appeal was heard by First-
         tier Tribunal Judge Daldry on 18th May  2018.  She  dismissed  both
         appeals for reasons set out in her  decision  promulgated  on  13th
         June 2018. Mr [E] sought and was granted permission  to  appeal  to
         the Upper Tribunal on three grounds:

          i) It was  arguable  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  failed  to
             conduct a full  proportionality  assessment  when  considering
             Article 8, including the factors set out in s117B  Nationality
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and in particular whether  it
             was unduly harsh for him to return to Nigeria;

         ii) It was arguable the judge had  made  an  unreasonable  finding
             when considering regulation 15A of the  Immigration  (European
             Economic Area) Regulations 2006 that it would be [I]'s  choice
             whether she leave the EU by failing to consider [I]'s health;

        iii) It was arguable the judge failed to consider  all  the  issues
             with  the  most  anxious  scrutiny   because   there   is   no
             consideration of paragraph EX(1)(b) of the Immigration Rules.

      2. This was quite an unusual appeal in  that  the  appellant  had  two
         appeals running at the same time and the  factual  matrix  was  the
         same for each. Mr Deller  accepted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge had erred in law in her failure to consider the appeal in the
         context of paragraph EX(1)(b); there had been no assessment whether
         it was reasonable for the appellant to leave the UK and  apply  for
         entry clearance to return. Mr Deller confirmed that  if  the  human
         rights appeal was successful then the EU appeal became  academic  -
         it was not the position that a  derivative  residence  card  was  a
         route to settlement.  Mr Deller  also  noted  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge did not appear to have given sufficient  thought  to
         [I]'s medical  conditions,  which  were  set  out  in  the  medical
         evidence relied upon.

      3. I was satisfied on 5th November 2018 that the  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge had erred in law in her  lack  of  full  consideration  under
         regulation 15(b) and her failure to adequately assess the  evidence
         in the  human  rights  claim  including  the  failure  to  consider
         paragraph EX.1(b). I set  aside  the  decision  to  be  remade  and
         adjourned the hearing on 5th November 2018. The  findings  of  fact
         made by the First-tier Tribunal judge, in so far as  findings  were
         made, were retained and  the  parties  given  leave  to  file  such
         further evidence as they sought to rely

      4.  The  resumed  hearing  came  before  me  on  14th  January   2019.
         Unfortunately, and very sadly, [I] died on 27th November  2018  and
         her funeral took place on 12th January 2019.  Mr  E  was  obviously
         upset. It was agreed before me that there  was  no  need  for  oral
         evidence, the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal judge  stood
         as historical facts and the issue was the  consideration  of  those
         facts and the current circumstances to the appeals before me.

      5. Ms Miszkiel acknowledged that the appeal under the EEA  Regulations
         could not succeed and I formally dismissed that appeal. She however
         submitted that in determining the human rights claim the historical
         facts were of importance for the future claim. She  submitted  that
         the factual matrix was such that the human rights appeal,  and  the
         EU appeal would and should have  been  allowed  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal  judge;  the  respondent  should  not  have  refused   the
         applications and Mr E should be in the position now that  he  would
         have been in had his applications not been unlawfully  refused.  Mr
         Melvin submitted that there  was  no  historic  injustice  and  the
         decision taken by the respondent  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
         before him at the date of decision was lawful.  He  submitted  that
         the decision has to be taken on the basis of the factual  basis  as
         it is on the  day  of  the  hearing;  Mr  [E]  does  not  meet  the
         requirements of the Rules and his circumstances  are  not  such  as
         could lead to him being granted leave  on  a  broader  approach  to
         Article 8 - "outside the Rules".

         Background

      6. The appellant arrived in the UK in July 2007 with  entry  clearance
         as a visitor. He did not leave on the expiry of his visit visa  and
         on 7th August 2013 he was served with a removal decision.  On  21st
         August 2013 he sought leave to remain as the unmarried  partner  of
         [I]. That application was refused on  22nd  October  2013  with  no
         right of appeal. He made a further application on  29th  July  2014
         for leave to remain as the spouse  of  [I].  That  application  was
         refused on 18th September 2014. A family  and  private  life  human
         rights claim made on 21st November 2014 was refused on 5th February
         2015. A further application for leave to remain as a spouse made on
         11th December 2015 was refused and the human rights claim certified
         on 2nd March 2016 thus enabling an out of country appeal  only.  On
         19th April 2016 a further human rights claim was made,  refused  on
         8th January 2018 and it is the appeal against that decision that is
         the subject of this appeal.

      7. On  30th  May  2017,  the  appellant  made  an  application  for  a
         derivative residence card to confirm he was the  primary  carer  of
         his wife. That application was refused on 8th January 2018 and  the
         appeal against that decision is also the subject of this appeal.

      8. Mr [E] was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with  [I],  who
         was a British Citizen. They were married on 17th October 2013. They
         had met in 2006 and had been together since then. [I] ran  her  own
         business - a restaurant. According to the  medical  records  before
         the First-tier Tribunal  judge  and  accepted  by  the  judge,  she
         started suffering from bilateral knee pain in August 2015, was in a
         lot of pain and was referred for knee  replacement.  She  was  also
         instructed to lose weight. In the autumn of 2015 she  was  able  to
         travel to Nigeria, she had been attending weightwatchers  when  her
         business commitments permitted, and she was neither housebound  nor
         dependent upon her husband for care.

      9. In January 2016 she was referred  to  social  services  because  of
         mobility difficulties. In April 2016, the appellant  was  described
         by the GP as [I]'s full time carer. In June 2016 [I]  was  referred
         to a pain clinic, was taking  a  strong  opiate  pain  killers  and
         needed help with toileting.

     10. The First-tier Tribunal judge found that Mr E was the primary carer
         for [I]; Although she had a son  in  the  UK  he  did  not  provide
         personal care for her.

     11.  [I] had rental income of ï¿½3000 per month and the couple  therefore
         met the financial eligibility criteria in the Rules.

     12. The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  considered  the  availability  of
         medication in Nigeria. There was adequate evidence before the judge
         to find that such medication as she  required  would  be  available
         even though there was some evidence of "fake" medication.

         Discussion

     13. Ms Miszkiel relied heavily upon the background to this  appeal  and
         that Mr E should be placed in the position he would  have  been  in
         had his appeal been allowed before the First-tier Tribunal.

     14. Although on its face  an  attractive  submission,  had  Mr  E  been
         successful in his appeal against the refusal to grant a  derivative
         residence card or had the  appeal  been  allowed  on  human  rights
         grounds, given that [I] has passed away, any grant of leave made by
         the respondent could have been curtailed because he no  longer  met
         the criteria in the Rules or under the EEA Regulations.

     15. Although very  sad  that  she  has  died,  his  appeal  has  to  be
         determined on the basis of the evidence as it is now - he does  not
         meet the criteria in  the  EEA  Regulations  for  the  grant  of  a
         derivative residence card and his acquired private life is not such
         as would justify the human rights appeal being allowed. Although he
         speaks English  and,  it  seems,  he  would  be  financially  self-
         supporting, he has not been lawfully in the UK save for an  initial
         period of 6 months from July 2007. His first application to attempt
         to regularise his stay was not made until August 2013 and was after
         he had been served with an enforcement decision. Their relationship
         was entered into when his status in the UK was precarious and there
         is now, unfortunately, no current relationship. Mr  E  cannot  meet
         the requirements of the Immigration Rules and the only  issue  that
         was raised before me that could be considered as taking the  appeal
         outside the Rules for consideration as a wider Article 8 assessment
         was that he had been in a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
         his wife for whom he was the full-time carer for  the  year  before
         she died. That she needed him  cannot  be  disputed  but  the  fact
         remains that now he has no basis upon which he can  remain  in  the
         UK. His ties to the UK, established  through  his  residence  since
         2007 are insufficient to found a long residence claim,  and  he  is
         not in a subsisting relationship.

     16.  If  the  appeal  had  been  allowed  under  the  Regulations,  the
         derivative residence card would be declaratory of  rights  at  that
         date only; he would not have achieved any  long-term  benefit  from
         the grant  of  such  a  residence  card  because  her  death  would
         legitimately lead to the cancellation of the residence card.

     17. There was  in  any  event  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the
         contention that the appeal would have been allowed on human  rights
         grounds. There was no significant evidence that it would have  been
         unreasonable for Mr E to return to Nigeria to make  an  application
         for  entry  clearance.  [I]'s  son  had  been  looking  after   her
         previously, she had previously travelled to Nigeria on holiday  and
         although the evidence was that her health had  deteriorated,  there
         was no significant evidence that she would not be  able  to  either
         travel with him to Nigeria whilst he awaited the result of an entry
         clearance application or that they would be separated  for  a  long
         period of time. There was no formal assessment of  her  care  needs
         for the period he would be away or  what  could  or  could  not  be
         provided.

     18. Taking all these matters into account, the appeals by Mr E  against
         the SSHD's refusal of his derivative  residence  card  and  of  his
         human rights claim must fail.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such  that  the  decision  is  set
    aside to be remade.

    I re-make the decision in both appeals by dismissing them

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I lift that order. There was no application for  it  to  continue,  the
    purpose for which the order  was  granted  no  longer  exists  and  the
    necessity of open justice requires transparency.
