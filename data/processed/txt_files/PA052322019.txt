For the Appellant:     Mr J Holt, Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   In a decision sent on 29 August  2019  Judge  Broe  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) dismissed the appeal of the  appellant,  a  national  of
    Pakistan, against the decision made by the respondent on  17  May  2019
    refusing his protection claim.

2.   The basis of the  appellant's  claim  was  that  as  a  result  of  his
    convictions in the UK  for  offences  against  children,  he  had  been
    assaulted by relatives of these children in the UK and as a consequence
    his family in Pakistan had been subject to various  hostile  acts  from
    the family of the same relatives.  The  respondent  accepted  that  the
    appellant had given a credible account about having been a  target  for
    threats and acts of harm and at paragraph 57 of  the  refusal  decision
    the respondent also accepted that if he returned to his home village or
    local area he would face "risk of some harm as a minimum from relatives
    of those affected in the UK".  However, the  respondent  considered  he
    would be able to relocate to, for example, a large city or  a  location
    remote from his home area (paragraph 60).

3.   The judge accepted that the appellant would face risk in his home  area
    (Kotla village) and that it would be for a  Refugee  Convention  reason
    (paragraphs  29-33).   However,  (like  the   respondent)   the   judge
    considered that the appellant would have a viable  option  of  internal
    relocation to another part of Pakistan (paragraphs 34-38).

4.   The appellant's grounds contend that  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    issue of internal relocation was flawed because  he  failed  to  engage
    with what he himself had recorded on this issue as being  the  evidence
    of Dr Giustozzi.  At paragraph 22 the judge had stated:

         "He said that the cost of living  in  Islamabad  was  significantly
         higher than in other cities with accommodation for a single  person
         being around �400 per month.  In Lahore this would be �320  and  in
         Karachi less than �300 whereas in the Appellant's village it  would
         be about �120.  In order to relocate the Appellant  would  have  to
         visit his home area to obtain documentation which would  place  him
         at risk.  He would struggle to obtain job particularly  because  of
         the social stigma attached to  rapists.   There  is  treatment  for
         heart  disease.   Medication  is  available  but  at  a  cost.   In
         conclusion his opinion was that the Appellant would be at risk from
         his distant relatives seeking revenge for the offences he committed
         in this country.  The police would  not  be  able  to  protect  him
         although if he lived in Islamabad 'the police would be more  likely
         to represent a deterrent force against the family of the  girls  he
         sexually assaulted.  Much would depend on the actual influence  and
         means of Hafiz'".


5.   Both representatives expressed their view that the judge's  failure  to
    address  the  evidence  of  Dr  Giustozzi  regarding   the   issue   of
    documentation in order to relocate was a material error of law.  I have
    reached the same conclusion.  Given the judge's  own  understanding  of
    the position of the expert, Dr Giustozzi, as set out at  paragraph  22,
    it was incumbent on him to at least explain why  he  did  not  consider
    this would pose an insurmountable hurdle to relocation.

6.   Mr Holt was quick to point out that in fact Dr Giustozzi's  opinion  on
    this matter was in more qualified terms than the judge  portrayed.   At
    paragraph 17 Dr Giustozzi stated that:

         "In order to relocate and register, which  would  be  necessary  to
         obtaining employment with the government,  Mr  [S]  would  need  to
         visit his home area and obtain residence documentation there.  This
         would expose him to a risk of detection by his relatives  at  least
         for some time".


7.   Mr Holt submitted that  the  judge's  error  was  nonetheless  material
    because he failed to consider, as part of the requisite  reasonableness
    assessment, whether the appellant's inability to  return  to  his  home
    area would prevent or significantly reduce his employment prospects and
    ability to live without destitution.  I am prepared to accept that  the
    judge's failure to address the expert evidence  on  this  issue  was  a
    material error, necessitating that I set his decision aside.

8.   Given that there will be a need for an assessment of reasonableness  to
    be undertaken in light of the appellant's particular  circumstances,  I
    shall remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.  The findings  of  the
    judge regarding risk in the home  area  for  a  Convention  reason  are
    preserved.

9.   No anonymity direction is made at this stage.
