Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Erwin Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Lee Stone, UK Sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. In this determination I will refer to the  parties  by  the  style  in
      which they appeared before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand born  11  December  1980.   The
      appellant applied for entry clearance as a visitor to  enable  her  to
      enter the United Kingdom to visit her fianc� Mr Lee Stone.

   3. The respondent refused the application having formed  a  view  that  a
      number of aspects of the applicable Immigration Rules had not been met
      by the appellant.

   4. The refusal notice  clearly  indicated  that  the  appellant's  appeal
      rights were limited to the grounds referred to in Section 84(1)(c)  of
      the Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act 2002.  These limited grounds
      related to Human Rights and/or racial discrimination.

   5. A full right of appeal in respect of a visitor is  only  available  to
      family visitor that is someone  proposing  to  visit  a  close  family
      member in the United Kingdom.  Regulations define family  members  and
      the definition does not include (as in this case) fianc�s.

   6. The appellant, through her UK Sponsor, purported to lodge  grounds  of
      appeal.  Because of the restricted nature of any appeal the matter was
      referred to a Duty  Judge  who  in  his  words  construed  the  appeal
      "benevolently" and in doing so  considered  there  was  the  right  of
      appeal limited as set out above.

   7. The appeal came before Judge of the First-Tribunal Osborne sitting  at
      Newport on 24 March 2014.  An oral hearing was held.  The  sponsor  Mr
      Stone attended.   The  respondent  was  represented  by  a  Presenting
      Officer.   Judge  Osborne  took  evidence  from  Mr  Stone  and  in  a
      determination of the same day concluded that the respondent's decision
      refusing the application was "not in accordance with the law  and  the
      applicable Immigration Rules".  Judge Osborne's decision  is  recorded
      as "I allow the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules".   There  is  no
      reference within the determination to the question of Human Rights  or
      racial discrimination.

   8. The respondent sought leave to appeal that decision on the basis  that
      the judge had made a material misdirection of law, in that  the  judge
      had purported to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules, whereas
      no right of appeal in respect of that decision existed.

   9. In granting leave to appeal to the respondent  another  judge  of  the
      First-Tier Tribunal said this:

         "1.  The appellant seeks permission to appeal, in time, a  decision
      of the First-Tier Tribunal (Judge Osborne)  who,  in  a  determination
      promulgated on 1 April 2014 allowed the appellant's appeal against the
      Entry Clearance Officer decision to refuse a visit visa.

     2.  The appellant wished to visit her fianc�.  The  grounds  of  appeal
      argue that the judge failed to consider the limitations placed on  her
      right of appeal, as indicated in the refusal.  This is because she  is
      not a  member  of  the  sponsor's  family  as  set  out  in  the  2012
      Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations.
     3.  In fairness to the judge the respondent was represented by  a  Home
      Office Presenting Officer at the hearing, who is not recorded  in  the
      ROP to have taken the above point.  However on the face  of  it  there
      was no jurisdiction to hear the  appeal  and  there  is  therefore  an
      arguable error of law disclosed by the application".

  10. Thus the matter now comes before me in the Upper Tribunal.

  11. Mr Stone again  attended.   At  the  commencement  of  the  hearing  I
      explained to him the  nature  of  the  proceedings  and  the  possible
      outcomes.

  12. Mr Richards referred briefly to the grounds seeking leave which he now
      supported.  Mr Richards indicated that the judge had erred in law.  It
      was a material error and the decision should be set aside.

  13. Mr Stone produced a letter that he had written explaining his  various
      options which included  a  fresh  application  or  him  travelling  to
      Thailand  to  visit  the  appellant  and  the  possibility  of  future
      marriage.

  14. I do find that Judge Osborne made a material  error  of  law  for  the
      following reasons.

  15. The Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act 202 provides at Section 88A:

         (1)  A person my not appeal under Section 82(1) against refusal  of
             an application for entry clearance unless the application  was
             made for the purpose of -


             (a)  visiting a person of a class or description prescribed by
                  regulations for the purpose of this subsection, or


             (b)  entering as the dependant of a  person  in  circumstances
                  prescribed  by  regulations  for  the  purpose   of   this
                  subsection.


         (2)  Regulations under subsection (1) may, in particular -


             (a)  make provision by reference to whether the applicant is a
                  member  of  the  family  (within  such  meaning   as   the
                  regulations may assign) of the person he seeks to visit;


             ...

         (3)  Subsection (1) -


             (a)  does not prevent the bringing of an appeal on  either  or
                  both of the grounds referred to in  Section  84(1)(b)  and
                  (c), and


             (b)  is without prejudice to  the  effect  of  Section  88  in
                  relation to an appeal under Section 82(1) against  refusal
                  of entry clearance.

      The effect of this provision is that visitors refused entry  clearance
      only have a right of appeal by virtue of the Immigration Rules if they
      are proposing to visit a family member as defined by  the  regulations
      laid down by Parliament.  By virtue of Regulation 2 of the Immigration
      Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations 2012 laid before Parliament on 18
      June 2012 with effect from 9 July 2013 the definition of family member
      was restricted.


         (1)  A person ("P") is of a class or description prescribed for the
             purposes of Section 88A(1)(a) of the Nationality,  Immigration
             & Asylum Act 2002 (entry clearance), if -


             (a)  the applicant for entry clearance ("A") is  a  member  of
                  the family of P; and (b)  P's  circumstances  match  those
                  specified in Regulation 3.


         (2)  For the purposes of paragraph (1), A is a member of the family
         of P if AS is the -


             (a)  spouse, civil partner,  father,  mother,  son,  daughter,
                  grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, brother
                  or sister;


             (b)  father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-
         law;


              b)  son-in-law, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother
                 or stepsister; of
                     P.


         (3)  For the purposes of paragraph (1), A is also a member  of  the
             family of P if A is the partner of P.

  16. From the facts of this case I am satisfied that the appellant  and  Mr
      Stone are not partners as defined.  They are not family members.

  17. I did explain both to Mr Stone and Mr Richards (who was not  aware  of
      the situation) that a Duty Judge had considered that  the  grounds  of
      appeal could be construed to include human rights  and  therefore  the
      appeal,  in  its  restricted  form,  could   proceed.    However   the
      determination of Judge Osborne does not deal with either human  rights
      of racial discrimination.  It merely deals with the appeal  under  the
      rules for which there was no right of appeal.

  18. Having found a material error of law, I  set  aside  the  decision  of
      Judge Osborne and move forward to remake the decision.

  19. I am again restricted to only consider matters for which there  was  a
      right of appeal.  That is human rights and racial discrimination.   Mr
      Stone understood this and made no attempt to pursue the appeal on  the
      basis of racial discrimination under the Race Relations  Act.   It  is
      merely a question of Article 8 ECHR.

  20. Mr Stone referred to the letter mentioned above and to the grounds  of
      appeal.  He indicated that he had been able to maintain  contact  with
      the appellant by telephone etc and he had the option of  visiting  her
      and of the appellant making further application using the findings  of
      Judge Osborne.

  21. In considering the appeal under Article 8, I have noted the content of
      the letter of appeal and I note in particular that the  appellant,  as
      described by Mr Stone, is post-operative transgendered.  Any reference
      to that in the grounds  of  appeal  is  in  respect  of  the  possible
      discrimination in  Thailand  and  not  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
      respondent's decision to refuse entry clearance would not impact  upon
      that and there is no allegation that the appellant's position effected
      the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.

  22. Any family or private life enjoyed by the appellant with  the  sponsor
      had continued in the way  that  it  always  has.   The  appellant  has
      visited the United Kingdom in the past and  the  sponsor  has  visited
      Thailand on a number of occasions.  They  keep  in  contact  and  have
      future plans.

  23. Whilst the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  did  affect  their
      lives, the decision was proportionate.  In reaching this conclusion  I
      have looked at the situation of the appellant and sponsor  before  the
      decision and after it, and I have noted the ability of  the  appellant
      to reapply for entry clearance.

  24. The decision  of  the  respondent  is  not  disproportionate  and  the
      appellant's appeal in respect of human rights must be dismissed.

Decision

  25. The determination of Judge Osborne contains a material error  of  law.
      The decision cannot stand and I remake that  decision  dismissing  the
      appellant's appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

  26. I note Judge Osborne made a fee award in favour of the appellant.   As
      the appeal has now been dismissed, I am not in a position to make  any
      fee award and that aspect of Judge Osborne's  determination  is  again
      reversed.



Signed                                  Date 22/8/14
