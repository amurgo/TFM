Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Gobir instructed by Albany Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  we  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting  the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the appellant.  A failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Cameroon who was born on 15 August  1997.
    She last arrived in the United Kingdom on 10  October  2015.   On  that
    date, she  was  interviewed  and  referred  to  the  National  Referral
    Mechanism as a potential victim  of  trafficking.   That  referral  was
    suspended on 7 December 2015 when the appellant absconded.

 3. On 25 May 2016, the appellant was arrested as an immigration  offender.
    A screening interview took place on 2 June 2016 and on  that  date  the
    appellant claimed asylum.  The appellant's asylum interview took  place
    on 28 November 2016 and 29 November 2016.  The basis of her  claim  was
    that she was a lesbian and that her  relationship  with  another  woman
    ("Y") in Cameroon had been discovered by her family and she was,  as  a
    consequence, at risk from them on return to Cameroon.

 4. On 30 November 2016, the Secretary of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    claims for asylum, humanitarian protection and on human rights  grounds
    under Art 8 of the ECHR.  It was accepted by the respondent that if the
    appellant was a lesbian then she was at risk on return as a member of a
    particular social group.  However, the respondent did  not  accept  the
    appellant's account of events in Cameroon  including  her  relationship
    with Y or that she was a lesbian.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    sent on 24 January 2017, Judge Powell dismissed the appellant's  appeal
    on all grounds.  He made an adverse credibility  finding  and  did  not
    accept the appellant's account of events in Cameroon or that she was  a
    lesbian and so would on that basis be at risk on return to Cameroon.

 6. The appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    challenging the judge's adverse credibility finding.  On 22  May  2017,
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Keane) granted the appellant  permission
    to appeal.

 7. On 13 June 2017, the Secretary  of  State  filed  a  rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the judge's decision.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before us.

Discussion

 9. Mr Gobir, who represented the appellant, made a number of submissions.

10. First, relying upon the grant of permission  to  appeal,  he  submitted
    that the judge's adverse credibility  finding  was  flawed  as  he  had
    wrongly applied  s.8  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  (Treatment  of
    Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 ("the 2004 Act").  Mr  Gobir  submitted  that
    whilst the appellant had not claimed asylum until 2 June 2016 which was
    after her arrest on 28 May 2016, she had nevertheless first raised  the
    substance of her claim in her initial interview on 10 October 2015.  He
    submitted, therefore, that she had in substance referred to  her  claim
    before her arrest and that, therefore, s.8(6) of the 2004 Act  did  not
    apply even though, as Mr Gobir conceded, she had not said prior to  her
    arrest "I'm claiming asylum".

11. The judge dealt with s.8  of  the  2004  Act  at  paras  25-26  of  his
    determination as follows:

         "25. I note that although the appellant entered the United  Kingdom
             in October 2015, she did not claim asylum until  2  June  2016
             and only after she had been arrested  on  28  May  2016.   The
             appellant was less than  open  about  the  reasons  her  entry
             clearance was cancelled in March 2015  and  I  note  that  she
             accepts that she absconded from accommodation provided to  her
             in October 2015, resulting in the withdrawal of a referral  to
             the trafficking mechanism.  I agree with the respondent's view
             that this conduct brings the appellant within section 8 of the
             Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.

         26.  As a result, the appellant's  credibility  is  damaged.   This
             does not mean that I must disbelieve her evidence.  It means I
             must, and do, anxiously scrutinise her claim for international
             protection through the lens of her damaged credibility."

12. In those  paragraphs,  the  judge  made  three  points  concerning  the
    appellant's conduct which, in his view, fell within  s.8  of  the  2002
    Act.  First, the appellant did not claim asylum  until  after  she  was
    arrested.  Secondly, and  this  relates  to  part  of  the  appellant's
    narrative which we shall return to shortly, she had originally come  to
    the UK with entry clearance as a student in March 2015  but  that  this
    had been cancelled at port.  Thirdly, the appellant had absconded  from
    accommodation provided to her in October 2015.

13. The relevant provisions in the 2004 Act are contained  in  s.8(1),  (2)
    and (6).  They are in the following terms:

         "(1) In determining whether to believe a statement made  by  or  on
             behalf of an appellant makes an asylum claim or a human rights
             claim, a deciding authority shall take  account,  as  damaging
             the claimant's credibility, of any  behaviour  to  which  this
             section applies.

         (2)  This section applies to any behaviour by the claimant that the
             deciding authority thinks -

             (a)  is designed or likely to conceal information,

             (b)  is designed or likely to mislead, or

             (c)  is designed or likely to obstruct or delay  the  handling
                  or resolution of the claim or the taking of a decision  in
                  relation to the claimant.

         ....

         (6)  this section also applies to failure by the claimant  to  make
             an asylum claim or human rights claim  before  being  arrested
             under an immigration provision, unless -

             (a)  he had no reasonable opportunity to make the claim before
                  the arrest, or

             (b)  the claim relies wholly  on  matters  arising  after  the
                  arrest."

14. The effect of "behaviour" that falls within s.8 is that it is "damaging
    [of] the claimant's credibility".   A  Tribunal  must  take  that  into
    account in assessing an appellant's credibility.  In  JT  (Cameroon)  v
    SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 878,  the  Court  of  Appeal  interpreted  s.8  as
    requiring  the  decision  maker  to   consider   the   "behaviour"   as
    "potentially damaging [of] the claimant's credibility" (our  emphasis).
    The weight to be attached to the "potentially damaging behaviour" is  a
    matter for the Tribunal and must not distort the fact-finding  exercise
    detracting from an overall assessment of the evidence and  individual's
    credibility (see, SM (section 8: judge's  process)  Iran  [2005]  UKAIT
    00116 and JT (Cameroon) at [19]).

15. In this appeal, there is no  doubt  that  s.8(6)  applied  because  the
    appellant did not claim asylum prior to her arrest  as  an  immigration
    offender.  That behaviour was, therefore, "potentially damaging" of her
    credibility.  Likewise, s.8(2) applied as  the  appellant's  absconding
    was "likely to conceal information" or, possibly, "likely  to  obstruct
    or delay the handling...or taking of a decision"  in  respect  of  her.
    Section 8(2) was also engaged by the appellant's conduct  that  led  to
    her entry clearance being cancelled in March  2015.   The  judge  dealt
    with this at paras 30-33 in the following terms:

         "30. The appellant obtained entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
             to study at the University of  Portsmouth.   On  arrival,  the
             appellant's leave  was  cancelled  and  she  was  returned  to
             Cameroon in March 2015.  The appellant said at first that  she
             did not why her leave had been cancelled and then that she was
             refused entry because she was 17 and too  young  to  study  at
             university.  This is manifestly  untrue.   The  appellant  had
             secured a place at the University of Portsmouth.  She had been
             granted entry clearance to study in this  country.   Both  the
             University of Portsmouth and the Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
             Cameroon (or wherever entry clearance was granted) were  aware
             of the appellant's age.  Had she been too young to be admitted
             to the United Kingdom, it is not  at  all  credible  that  she
             would have been given a place by  the  university  or  granted
             entry clearance by the relevant visa officer.

         31.  The appellant was refused entry  in  March  2015  because  the
             appellant told the immigration officer on arrival that she was
             being met by a man, called Francis Angbeaud  Montjen  who  was
             not related to her and was not recorded as  her  sponsor.   He
             did not arrive at the airport to collect the  appellant.   The
             Appellant was interviewed.  She  said  that  this  man  was  a
             friend of her father's.

         32.  The appellant was asked about her study plans.  She said  that
             she had planning to study in the United Kingdom for  5  years,
             since she 12 years old.  However, she arrived  in  the  United
             Kingdom with only �120 and insufficient clothes.  She had none
             of the usual trappings of a student, such as books,  materials
             or paper.  She did, however, have a pen.  The  appellant  said
             that her father would be  sending  further  funds  to  her  to
             enable her to study in this country.

         33.  In the light of all that the immigration officer had heard, he
             formed the view that the appellant's welfare and safety  could
             not be assured and returned her on the next  available  flight
             to Cameroon."

16. The judge was, in our judgment, entitled to  regard  the  appellant  as
    being disingenuous as to the basis upon which her  visa  was  cancelled
    and therefore was behaviour "likely to mislead".

17. In any event, the fact of her absconding and  her  disingenuousness  on
    seeking entry in 2015 would be damaging of the appellant's  credibility
    even without s.8 of the 2004 Act.

18. In applying s.8, the judge was careful in para 26 of his  determination
    to emphasise that the effect of s.8 was not that  he  "must  disbelieve
    her evidence".  Rather, he correctly, in our judgment, emphasised  that
    he  must  scrutinise  her  claim  "through  the  lens  of  her  damaged
    credibility".   In his approach, he went no further  than  required  by
    s.8 in taking into account the features  of  the  appellant's  evidence
    which potentially damaged her credibility.  As is  clear  from  reading
    the judge's determination as a whole, he said no more about s.8 but  at
    paras 27-51 gave a number of discrete reasons why he  did  not  believe
    the appellant's account and accept that she was a lesbian and  at  risk
    on return to Cameroon.

19. Consequently, we reject Mr Gobir's submission that the  judge  wrongly,
    and inappropriately, applied s.8 of the 2004 Act.

20. Secondly, in addition to the point raised under s.8 of the 2004 Act, Mr
    Gobir indicated that he continued to rely upon  his  skeleton  argument
    and the contention that the judge had improperly relied upon  a  number
    of "minor discrepancies" in the appellant's evidence  in  reaching  his
    adverse credibility finding.  He did not  address  us  further  on  the
    points raised.  We can deal with them briefly as they fail to  identify
    any material error of law in the judge's reasoning.

21. First, it is contended that the judge was wrong to take  into  account,
    in  assessing  the  appellant's  credibility  in  the  light   of   the
    cancellation of her entry clearance that she only had  �120  with  her,
    had insufficient clothes and none of the usual trappings of  a  student
    such as "books, material and papers".  We  have  set  out  the  judge's
    reasoning above at paras 30-33, in particular at  para  32.   This  was
    clearly a matter which the judge was entitled to take into  account  in
    assessing whether the appellant had been seeking entry  to  the  UK  in
    March 2015 as a genuine student.

22. Secondly, the judge is criticised for taking into account, if  she  had
    been a genuine student, the absence of any reaction by  her  family  on
    return.  The judge dealt with this at para 34 as follows:

         "34. I asked the appellant  about  her  family's  reaction  to  her
             return.  She said that her father did  not  say  anything.   I
             find this incredible.  If the plan for the appellant to  study
             here had been so long in the formulation, it is beyond  belief
             that her family would have nothing  to  say  about  that  plan
             being thwarted.  It is incredible that there  would  not  have
             been discussion about why Mr Montjen had not met  her  at  the
             airport.  There would have been  discussion  about  the  money
             paid to the University of Portsmouth for her course and, it is
             reasonable to expect, conversation about how  to  recover  it.
             There may well also have been discussion about the decision of
             the UK immigration officer to cancel her leave  to  enter  the
             United Kingdom.  Furthermore, it is beyond belief  that  there
             was no discussion about the appellant's future.  Her long-held
             plans to study in the United Kingdom and the family's  efforts
             to ensure that funds were available to allow her to do so, had
             come to an end.  I do not find the appellant's account of  her
             father having nothing to say at all credible."

23. Again, we see nothing untoward  in  the  judge's  reasoning  which  was
    properly open to him.

24. Thirdly, it is contended that the judge's reasoning that led him not to
    accept her account of her sexual relationship with Y whilst at a  state
    school and thereafter that they worked as prostitutes was flawed.   The
    judge's reasoning is at paras 35-41 as follows:

         "35. However, other aspects of the appellant's account  also  raise
             significant  concerns.   Mindful  of  the  way  the  appellant
             described her plans to the immigration officer at  Gatwick  in
             March 2015, it does not appear to me to be credible  that  she
             attended a state school in  Cameroon  rather  than  a  private
             school.  I say this because the appellant's  account  is  that
             her family had supported her plans to study abroad for about 5
             years.  It is beyond belief that her  father  would  not  have
             wished  to  give  her  the  best  opportunity  to   reach   an
             educational standard that would best allow her to  fulfil  her
             ambition.  If the appellant's account is true, her father  was
             a relatively wealthy man, with a house, cars and a  relatively
             senior position in the army.

         36.  The appellant's explanation that her father insisted she  went
             to a state school rather than a private school as a punishment
             for some rebellious  streak  is  just  not  credible.   It  is
             nonsensical.

         37.  The appellant's account of forming a sexual relationship  with
             [Y] is inextricably linked to her claim that  she  attended  a
             state school because [Y] was in her mid-twenties, some 7 years
             older than the appellant.  The appellant  claims  that  it  is
             common for adults to attend state schools as students and,  as
             such, there is nothing implausible about [Y] and  her  meeting
             and  forming  a  relationship,  whereas  private  schools  are
             reasonably likely to have had stricter age requirements.

         38.  As such, I find that the appellant's account of where and  how
             she met [Y] to lack credibility.

         39.  The appellant claims that she and [Y] did not form an intimate
             relationship until after she returned from the United Kingdom.
              There is nothing inherently implausible about the appellant's
             account of how this relationship started  although  given  the
             oppressive attitude to same sex relationships, it  is  perhaps
             surprising, if true, that they placed themselves in a position
             where discovery so easily occurred.  However, I remind  myself
             that suspicion is not a sufficient reason to find  an  account
             or part of it incredible.

         40.  The appellant claims that she and [Y] fled  to  Youande  where
             they decided to become prostitutes in order to  survive.   The
             appellant told me that  she  and  [Y]  earned  good  money  as
             prostitutes.  This was  inconsistent  with  answers  given  in
             interview where she said that all of the money  received  from
             their prostitution had been retained by [Y] although she  also
             said that the money was given to the landlord and none  of  it
             was given to [Y].

         41.  From some answers given by the appellant (AIR  Q122,  PRI  Q45
             and PRI Q48) I  find  that  the  appellant  gave  inconsistent
             accounts of [Y's] role in her claimed prostitution,  at  times
             indicating that the decision to prostitute  themselves  was  a
             joint decision or that she had just followed [Y's]  previously
             established working practice or that she had  been  forced  to
             become a prostitute.  For my part, the decision  to  become  a
             prostitute is likely to have been of such importance  that  it
             is not believable that the appellant would  not  remember  the
             exact circumstances in which  she  started  to  have  sex  for
             money.  The inconsistencies undermine the appellant's evidence
             of how she maintained herself after fleeing her family.  In my
             judgment, this casts  significant  doubt  on  the  appellant's
             account."

25. In his skeleton argument, Mr Gobir contended that  the  matters  relied
    upon were minor (including the inconsistencies) which,  in  respect  of
    her account of prostitution with Y, were in part due to  the  first  of
    her asylum interviews not being conducted with an interpreter.

26. It is clear that the judge  had  well  in  mind  that  there  might  be
    difficulties relying on the first interview which had been conducted in
    English rather than French because at para 28, in  respect  of  another
    aspect of the appellant's account, he declined to find an inconsistency
    in her evidence based upon that  first  interview.   His  reasoning  in
    paras 35-41 identifies real inconsistencies  in  her  account  and  the
    judge was entitled to regard them as significant and to take them  into
    account  in  assessing  whether  he  believe  a  central  part  of  the
    appellant's claim concerning her relationship with Y.  Further, we  see
    nothing irrational  or  improper  in  the  judge  doubting,  given  the
    appellant's evidence of her family's financial and  societal  position,
    that he did not accept that the appellant would be  sent  to  a  public
    school (as opposed to a private school) where the opportunity to meet Y
    arose.

27. In addition, the judge gave a number of further reasons at paras  42-46
    why he did not accept the appellant's account about  how  she  came  to
    leave Cameroon and that, despite her claimed relationship with  Y,  she
    had an almost total absence of contact with  Y  subsequent  to  leaving
    Cameroon.

28. As Mr Richards (who represented the respondent) submitted, the  judge's
    reasons are balanced.  At a number of points he rejected arguments  put
    forward by the Secretary of State for  not  believing  the  appellant's
    account (see paras 22 and 28).  In  addition,  he  recognised,  in  the
    appellant's favour, that her account of her sexual orientation has been
    consistent (see para 23) and her activities  in  the  UK  with  a  LGBT
    support group was consistent with her claimed sexuality (see para 50).

29. None of the points raised on behalf of the appellant establish that the
    judge's decision, in particular his  adverse  credibility  finding,  is
    legally flawed.  The judge gave cogent and sufficient reasons  for  his
    adverse credibility finding which was based upon the evidence  and  was
    not irrational or otherwise unsustainable in law.

Decision

30. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal did not involve the making of an error of law.   Its
    decision stands and the appellant's appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
