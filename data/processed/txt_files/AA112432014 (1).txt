                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Turnock made following a hearing at Bradford on 9th March 2015.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Guinea born on 17th April 1988.   He  came
    to the UK in January 2010 with a Tier 4 (General) Student visa valid to
    30th August 2013.  He claimed asylum on 19th August 2013.

 3. His claim is based upon problems which  started  in  Guinea  after  the
    deaths of his parents and uncle.  The family were all  members  of  the
    Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea. His father  was  killed  on  28th
    September 2009, at a demonstration supporting the UFDG. His mother died
    two days later as a consequence of being arrested by the  military  and
    tortured. The claimant went to live with  his  uncle,  who  was  killed
    during the attempted coup against Alpha Condï¿½ in July 2011.  After  his
    uncle's death the claimant  was  informed  that  there  was  an  arrest
    warrant issued against him.

 4. The objective evidence confirmed that there was a premeditated massacre
    of at least 150 people on 28th September 2009 by government forces  and
    also that an attempted coup did take place in July 2011.

 5. The Secretary of State  accepted  that  the  claimant  had  produced  a
    genuine Guinean passport but not that there was any truth in his  claim
    that the authorities were interested in him. She refused the claim.

The Judge's Determination

 6. So far as the delay in claiming asylum is concerned, the judge did  not
    accept that the claimant was ignorant of the asylum process during  his
    stay in the UK but recognised that there would  always  be  a  concern,
    even for a genuine asylum seeker, that a claim would be  refused  which
    might inhibit one being lodged at the first opportunity.  The  claimant
    was in the UK lawfully throughout his stay and in  those  circumstances
    the delay in claiming was not as damaging to credibility  as  would  be
    case if he had remained in the UK unlawfully.

 7. He found that there was some inconsistency in the evidence relating  to
    the claimed arrest and torture of his mother which cast  doubt  on  his
    credibility. On the other hand, the judge concluded that  the  claimant
    answered the questions put to him at interview about the  UFDG  with  a
    reasonable degree of accuracy although his answers were not conclusive.

 8. The claimant produced a number of documents in  support  of  his  claim
    including the warrant said to have been issued against him,  the  death
    certificates in respect of his mother and uncle, and  a  document  from
    the Conakry court.

 9. The judge set out in some detail both  what  those  documents  said  on
    their face, and the checks that the Secretary of State had been able to
    make upon them.

10. He then wrote as follows:

         "The case of Tanveer Ahmed [2002] UKIAT 00439 established  that  it
         is for an individual claimant to show that a document on  which  he
         seeks to rely can be relied upon, and  the  decision  maker  should
         consider whether  a  document  is  one  on  which  reliance  should
         properly be placed after looking at all  of  the  evidence  in  the
         round.

         In this case the appellant  has  submitted  original  documents  in
         sufficient  time  to  enable  the   respondent   to   check   their
         authenticity.  At  paragraph  16  of  the  letter  of  refusal  the
         respondent notes: 'It is accepted that this is  a  genuine  Guinean
         passport in the absence of any reason to  the  contrary'.   If  the
         respondent had taken the same  approach  to  the  documentation  in
         question that would have  been  accepted.   In  any  event,  taking
         account of the findings of the  document  examiner,  who  does  not
         suggest that the documents are false or give any reasons  why  they
         might be  otherwise  unreliable,  I  find  that  to  the  requisite
         standard the documentation is reliable."

11. Having found the documentation to be reliable, and  taking  account  of
    the country information, he concluded that the claimant  had  made  out
    his case.

The Grounds of Application

12. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the judge had allowed the appeal entirely on the basis of his erroneous
    acceptance of the documentation and had misdirected himself in relation
    to Tanveer Ahmed,  mistakenly  placing  a  burden  of  proof  upon  the
    Secretary of State and incorrectly citing paragraph 16 of  the  reasons
    for refusal letter in order to adopt the view that, unless  a  document
    can be shown not to be genuine, it ought to be  accepted.   Furthermore
    he had failed to include the inconsistencies at paragraphs 38 and 39 in
    his assessment and therefore not considered all of the documentation in
    the round.

13. Specifically the judge had  erred  by  stating  that,  as  the  Guinean
    passport had been accepted as genuine, since there was no reason not to
    find it to be so, he had then adopted the same reasoning in respect  of
    the other documents.  There were no clear reasons to accept as  genuine
    the documents relied upon  by  the  claimant  and  no  reason  for  the
    Secretary of State to take the same approach to those documents as  she
    had taken to the passport.

14. Moreover, in considering that the  document  examiner  could  not  find
    reasons why the documents might be unreliable, the judge had failed  to
    have regard to the fact that the examiner also could not  find  reasons
    to find them to be reliable.  None were conclusively authenticated.  It
    was therefore incumbent upon the judge to consider their reliability in
    the light of the inconsistencies identified at  paragraph  39  and  his
    rejection of the explanation for the delay at paragraph 38.

15. Second, it was not the claimant's evidence that he delayed  making  his
    claim because he was concerned that it might be refused; the finding at
    paragraph 38 was not open to the judge.

16. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  Simpson  for  the  reasons
    stated in the grounds on 13th April 2015.

Submissions

17. Mr Diwncyz said that he was not relying on the Section 8 point  in  the
    grounds but did rely upon the principal ground, i.e. that the judge had
    wrongly reversed the burden of proof.

18. Mr Middleton defended  the  determination.  He  observed  that  it  was
    unfortunate that the judge had not  recorded  that  there  had  been  a
    previous  hearing  of  the  appeal  when  the  Presenting  Officer  had
    successfully applied for an adjournment in order to give an opportunity
    for a specialist to consider the documents.  It was open to  the  judge
    to place weight upon the examining officer's  conclusions,  which  were
    more supportive of the claimant's case than that of  the  Secretary  of
    State.

Findings and Conclusions

19. There is no material error  in  this  determination.  There  is  not  a
    reversal  of  the  burden  of  proof.  It  is  an  assessment  of   the
    documentation in the light of  the  objective  evidence  and  the  oral
    testimony.

20. The context of this appeal is that the country information was not only
    supportive of the claim in general terms but also in  relation  to  the
    specific events which triggered  the  decision  to  claim  asylum.  The
    Appellant had also answered the questions in relation to the UFDG  with
    a reasonable degree of accuracy.

21. First, this is a very experienced judge who was clearly aware  that  it
    was for the claimant to establish that the document upon which he seeks
    to rely can in fact be relied upon. He set  out  the  correct  test  at
    paragraph 52 of the determination.  Moreover, he also  stated  that  in
    order to consider the reliability of the document it was  necessary  to
    look at all of the evidence in the round.

22. It is the Secretary of State's case that, having set  out  the  correct
    test at paragraph 52, the  judge  then  did  exactly  the  opposite  at
    paragraph 53.

23. It was plainly relevant for the judge to state that the  documents  had
    been submitted in sufficient time to enable checks to be made.  It  was
    also relevant that other documents were genuine.  Moreover,  the  judge
    was entitled to place weight upon the fact that the  document  examiner
    had not put forward any reasons to suppose that the documents might  be
    unreliable.

24.  In  fact  the  examiner's  conclusions  in  relation  to   the   death
    certificates are broadly positive although he said that he  was  unable
    to conclude upon their authenticity.  He did say that he suspected that
    they were as issued and were similar in  design  and  layout  to  known
    authentic Guinea certificates.

25. Both state that the cause of  death  were  maltreatment/assault/battery
    which is entirely consistent with the claim.

26. The document examiner was unable to reach any conclusions or  make  any
    observations in relation to the authenticity of the arrest warrants and
    the court document.  However,  he  did  make  some  positive  findings,
    namely that the wet ink  endorsements  were  true  ink,  and  were  not
    digital reproductions, although  of  very  poor  quality.   The  arrest
    warrants appear to have been signed by the  same  judge  and  digitally
    printed without secure features.  There was nothing  in  the  documents
    which raised concerns.

27. It is right that the judge observed that there was  some  inconsistency
    in the evidence relating to the  claimed  arrest  and  torture  of  his
    mother but, even if he had specifically referred to that  inconsistency
    in his conclusions, the examining officer's conclusions in relation  to
    the mother's death certificate were  reasonably  clear.   He  suspected
    that they were as issued.

28. Mr Diwncyz did not submit that there was any misapplication of  Section
    8.  The judge was entitled to place  weight  upon  the  fact  that  the
    claimant was in the UK lawfully throughout his stay and  the  delay  in
    claiming was less damaging than if he had been in the UK unlawfully.

29. In conclusion, the judge was entitled to conclude that the claimant had
    discharged the burden of proof upon him to show that the  documentation
    was reliable and did not, as argued in the grounds, either reverse  the
    burden of proof or fail to look at the documents in the round.

Notice of Decision

The judge did not err in  law.   The  decision  stands.   The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
