Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss S. Khan (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Bell promulgated on the 28th March 2017, in  which  she
      dismissed the Appellant's protection appeal.

   2. Judge Bell  did  not  find  that  the  Appellant's  account  of  being
      politically active in Iran with an environmental group "Toolu"  to  be
      at all credible, and did not accept that he had anti-Islamic  material
      on his laptop that had been taken by the authorities in  a  raid  upon
      his home. Nor did Judge Bell accept that the Appellant  had  genuinely
      converted to Christianity since the refusal of  his  asylum  claim  as
      claimed.  Nor did  she  accept  the  Appellant  had  material  on  his
      Facebook site, which would place him at risk upon return.

   3. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is sought to be  argued  in  ground  1
      that Judge Bell erred in failing to assess the evidence in  the  round
      before rejecting the credibility of  the  Appellant's  case.   In  the
      Grounds of Appeal and/or her oral submissions, Miss Khan  argued  that
      the Judge made findings rejecting the Appellant's credibility of  what
      happened to  him  in  Iran  before  going  on  to  consider  that  the
      Appellant's brother's evidence, in circumstances where the brother had
      been granted refugee status and where the brother in  his  own  asylum
      interview had expressly given evidence on the fact that in a  raid  on
      the  family  home  on  the  21st  August  2015,  the  authorities  had
      discovered material relating to the Appellant on his computer.

   4. In the second ground of appeal, it is argued that the Judge  erred  in
      her assessment of the genuineness of  the  Appellant's  conversion  to
      Christianity and it was sought to be argued by Miss Khan that the fact
      that the Appellant belonged to a  small  church  with  a  90%  Iranian
      congregation, did not mean  that  the  Appellant  himself  was  not  a
      genuine convert. She argued that the reasoning at [41]  is  inadequate
      to show why the evidence of NB was insufficient to show the  Appellant
      had genuinely converted to Christianity.

   5. In the third ground of appeal it is argued that the  Judge's  analysis
      of the assessment of the Facebook  evidence  was  incorrect  and  that
      Judge Bell had not sought to  clarify  any  lack  of  clarity  in  the
      evidence of NB  regarding  the  Appellant's  Facebook  account  as  to
      whether or not he had actually seen it or been told about the contents
      of the account by the Appellant.  Within the Grounds of Appeal it  was
      further argued that the Judge speculated as  to  whether  or  not  the
      Appellant had access to a passport and the Judge  failed  to  properly
      assess  the  risk  to  the  Appellant  in  relation  to  his  Facebook
      activities.

   6. Permission to appeal in this case was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge
      McWilliam on the 12th September 2017 where he found  it  was  arguable
      that the Judge did not consider the evidence in the round and  allowed
      the grounds to be argued.

   7. In considering this appeal, I have carefully considered  the  decision
      of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bell, the Grounds of Appeal, the Rule  24
      Reply and the submissions from both legal representatives,  which  are
      fully recorded within the record of proceedings, together with all  of
      the evidence contained within the file.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   8. Although it is sought to be argued on behalf  of  the  Appellant  that
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Bell failed to consider the evidence in  the
      round before making adverse findings against the Appellant in terms of
      credibility and before going on to make findings  in  respect  of  the
      brother's  account,  in  circumstances  where  the  brother  had  been
      accepted as a genuine Christian convert and had been  granted  asylum,
      Judge Bell made it clear at [43]  that  she  had  looked  at  all  the
      evidence in the round, and I do accept having read  the  decision  and
      Judge's Bell account that she had looked at the evidence in the  round
      before making her  findings  that  the  Appellant  had  not  genuinely
      converted to Christianity but had undergone simply the  appearance  of
      conversion to bolster his failed asylum claim.  The Judge clearly  had
      to start somewhere, and did start with consideration of  the  evidence
      regarding the Appellant's account of his political  activities  within
      Iran, and gave clear, adequate and sufficient reasons for her findings
      in that regard.  She was entitled and did take  account  of  the  fact
      that  the  Appellant's  description  of  the  group's  activities  was
      extremely vague.  She also clearly explained why she  did  not  accept
      that either his fiancï¿½ or his brother would not have  initially  known
      about his involvement with the group.

   9. The Judge went on to give clear reasons as to why she did  not  accept
      the account that he had anti-Islamic material on his laptop from [28],
      and did not accept that someone who had been very  careful  about  who
      they distributed leaflets to had simply kept  subversive  material  on
      his laptop and she found specifically that there  was  inconsistencies
      regarding how he had accessed the sites that would have  been  blocked
      in Iran.

  10. The First-tier Tribunal Judge mentioned that "I  am  of  course  aware
      that his brother was granted refugee status as  a  Christian  convert,
      but that does not mean that every aspect of his account  was  accepted
      and this does need lead me to find that  the  Appellant's  account  of
      events in Iran is credible once the reasons  given  above".   In  that
      regard, the Judge went on at [42] to set out  the  brother's  evidence
      regarding the Appellant's account that he  had  been  aware  that  his
      brother had converted to Christianity  in  Iran  and  the  Appellant's
      brother had claimed he had been aware  that  the  Appellant  had  been
      involved with Toolu, and gave clear, adequate and  sufficient  reasons
      for finding the Appellant was not credible in terms of him not knowing
      about his brother's conversion, and  for  disbelieving  parts  of  the
      evidence of the brother's account at [42]. In circumstances where  the
      brother had been granted asylum as an administrative decision  without
      there being clear findings made by a Tribunal, that was a process open
      to the Judge on the evidence before her. She did not  have  to  accept
      the entirety of the  brother's  account  and  has  not  made  findings
      inconsistent with him being granted asylum.

  11. However, the  Judge  had  to  start  somewhere  when  considering  the
      evidence, and I find has taken account of  all  the  evidence  in  the
      round as she said she had done, and has not  simply  made  credibility
      findings adverse to the Appellant  before  going  on  to  consider  in
      isolation, the brother's evidence in that regard.   I  therefore  find
      that ground 1 of the Grounds of Appeal lacks merit.

  12. In respect of the second ground of appeal I do  not  accept  that  the
      submission by Miss Khan that Judge Bell is  in  fact  criticising  the
      church or NB, when  making  her  findings  regarding  the  Appellant's
      conversion  to  Christianity  The  Judge  is  not,  contrary  to   the
      submission made, questioning the genuineness of  that  church.   Judge
      Bell at [41] accepted that the Appellant had been regularly  attending
      church since March 2016 and accepted that NB considered him  to  be  a
      genuine convert. However, it was open to her on the evidence  to  find
      that it was an extremely small church with a congregation of  only  12
      to 14 regularly turning up on Sundays, 90% of whom were Iranian.   The
      point she was making was that she had very grave doubts as to  whether
      or not the church was in fact being  taken  advantage  of  by  Iranian
      asylum seekers.

  13. However, she went on to question the  timing  of  the  nature  of  the
      Appellant's conversion taking account of  the  evidence  she  had  not
      found credible regarding the events  in  Iran,  and  in  circumstances
      where he had told the interviewer that he had  no  religion  and  then
      when his brother was granted asylum in December 2015, and  also  after
      his own asylum claim had been rejected that  the  Appellant  had  then
      started attending church in March 2016  not  having  attended  at  all
      before that.  It is not the case that simply because  someone  from  a
      church considered the Appellant to be credible, that the Judge had  to
      accept that  evidence.   The  Judge  had  given  clear,  adequate  and
      sufficient reasons for not accepting that the Appellant was actually a
      genuine Christian convert as claimed and  has  clearly  explained  her
      reasoning in [41] and made findings which were  open  to  her  on  the
      evidence.

  14. She was not criticising bona fide of the  church,  simply  was  giving
      reasons as to why the Appellant was not a genuine convert. The  second
      ground of appeal also lacks merit.

  15. In respect of the third ground of appeal regarding the  assessment  of
      the Facebook evidence, the point being made by Judge Bell was at  [44]
      that she was handed a printout of his Facebook  page,  but  there  was
      nothing on it relating to Christianity.  She said that  she  had  been
      told that was because the representative was not a member of  Facebook
      and had therefore not been able to  access  the  full  site,  but  she
      explained that she was unable to understand why the  full  site  could
      not have been accessed by  the  Appellant's  representative  with  the
      assistance of the Appellant.  That was a finding open to her  and  she
      commented upon the lack of evidence regarding what was said to  be  on
      his Facebook site regarding Christianity.  She was  also  entitled  to
      find that NB although saying in his oral evidence that  the  Appellant
      had posted Christianity related material on his Facebook page had  not
      explained in his oral evidence whether he had actually seen it or been
      told about it by the Appellant.

  16. Although Miss Khan seeks  to  criticise  Judge  Bell  for  not  having
      clarified that  issue,  it  is  clearly  for  the  Appellant  and  his
      witnesses, to provide clear evidence themselves on  such  issues,  and
      clearly, Miss Khan could have sought to deal with that  issue  in  re-
      examination, had she so chosen.  It is not  for  Judge  Bell  to  plug
      deficiencies in the Appellant's evidence.

  17. In circumstances where the contents of the Facebook  page  which  were
      said to have actually given rise to a risk had not  been  produced  to
      Judge Bell, she was entitled to find that NB had not explained whether
      or not he had actually seen that evidence or simply been told about it
      by the Appellant.  That was a finding open to her on the evidence  and
      there is nothing in her findings, to reveal any material error of  law
      in that regard.

  18. In a thorough decision, Judge Bell has given clear, adequate and  more
      than sufficient reasons for rejecting the Appellant's account  on  the
      evidence which is open to her and made findings which were open to her
      on the evidence.  The decision does not reveal any material  error  of
      law and is maintained.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bell does not reveal any  material
error of law and is maintained;

I do make an Anonymity Order in respect of  this  case,  such  Order  having
been made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  therefore  do  Order  that  the
Appellant is entitled to  anonymity.   No  record  or  transcript  of  these
proceedings may identify the Appellant or any member of  his  family  either
directly or indirectly.  This direction applies both to  the  Appellant  and
to the Respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this  direction  may  lead  to
contempt of Court proceedings.
