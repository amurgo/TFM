Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Peterson, Counsel instructed by VMD Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission to appeal
    by First Tribunal Judge Landes on 5 December 2013.

 2. Initially, this appeal was linked with that  of  the  appellant's  son,
    VA/03918/2013, but that appeal was withdrawn by the respondent when  it
    came before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. Having taken instructions, Mr Duffy sought to withdraw the decision  of
    the respondent. Ms Peterson said that, in the circumstances, she had no
    objection to that course of events.

 4. The Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008 allow for the withdrawal of the
    respondent's 'case' rather than his decision (Rule 17(1) (b)). As there
    was no objection from the appellant or her representative, I  consented
    to the respondent's  withdrawal  (Rule  17(2)  applies)  and  given  Ms
    Petersen's consent, I am satisfied that the appellant's case  has  been
    withdrawn, to which I also consent.

Decision

The appeal has been withdrawn.  That  disposes  of  proceedings  before  the
    Upper Tribunal
