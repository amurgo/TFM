Representation:

  For the Appellant:       Sponsor in person
  For the Respondent:  Ms H Horsley, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.      The appellant before the Upper Tribunal  is  the  Secretary  of
       State for the Home Department and the respondent  is  a  citizen  of
       Nigeria born on 14 March 1974.  However, for the sake of convenience
       we shall refer to the latter as the "appellant" and to the Secretary
       of the State as the "respondent", which are  the  designations  they
       had in the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal.


    2.     The appellant's appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  was  against
       the decision of the respondent to refuse his application dated 2 May
       2012 to enter the United Kingdom as the spouse of a British national
       pursuant to paragraph 281  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as
       amended).


    3.      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Oakley  allowed  his  appeal.
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant Hutchinson in a  decision  dated  26
       September 2013 granted the respondent permission to  appeal  to  the
       Upper Tribunal, it being found to be arguable  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal judge had erred in his  findings  and  conclusions  on  the
       issue of maintenance.


    4.      Thus the appeal came before us.

       Error of Law

    5.       The ECO refused the appellant's  application  in  reliance  on
       paragraphs 281(i)(a), (iv) and (v) of the Immigration Rules.


    6.        The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal,
       concluding in relation to the maintenance requirement that:  .


          "[13] The Sponsor's income for the tax year 2011/12 was  at  �7311
          and appropriate details were provided to the Respondent in respect
          of the tax assessment which provided those figures...


          [14] The Appellant has been offered employment by Mr Glen Lambert,
          a personal friend of the  Sponsor,  and  there  will  be  training
          provided to the Appellant but the sponsor was  unable  to  clarify
          the amount that the Appellant would be paid...


          [17] Finally, I turn to the issue of finance and note firstly that
          no account has been taken whatsoever by the Respondent at the time
          of the Decision of the savings of the Sponsor but in  addition  at
          the time of the review took place details  had  been  provided  of
          additional income receive by the Sponsor which, coupled  with  the
          Sponsor's savings together with the offer  of  employment  of  the
          Appellant, would certainly satisfy the requirements  of  a  couple
          under the Department of Work and Pensions figures."


    7.     At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the sponsor was advised
       that the  appeal  would  involve  two  steps,  the  first  being  to
       determine whether there is an error of law in the  determination  of
       Judge Oakley and the second, if we find there was an error, to  hear
       evidence from the sponsor to enable us to remake the decision.


    8.      The sponsor submitted that Judge Oakley's decision was  a  good
       one; however  when asked whether she could point to any paragraph in
       the determination where the judge had  considered  evidence  of  the
       rent or council tax payable or  she accepted that she could not.


    9.      Having considered the determination as a whole  we  find  Judge
       Oakley's consideration of the maintenance issue involved the  making
       of an error on a point of law. The judge failed to consider  whether
       the monies put forward by  the  sponsor  as  savings  were  in  fact
       savings; these  claimed  savings  being  in  the  sponsor's  current
       account the balance of which fluctuated on a day to  day  basis  and
       which was clearly being used to meet the sponsor's living  expenses.
       The judge further failed to observe that the  evidence  relating  to
       these savings was dated three months prior to the date of the  Entry
       Clearance Officer's decision, and that there had been large sums  of
       money deposited into the account the provenance  of  which  was  not
       known.

  10. Most significantly, the judge failed to make an assessment as  to  the
      amount of rent and council tax payable by the  sponsor,  monies  which
      should have formed an integral part of any calculation of adequacy  of
      maintenance.  As to the five line letter of offer of employment to the
      appellant by the sponsor's friend, the judge said nothing of the  fact
      that this was on un-headed paper, that the offer was  absent  material
      details such as, the likely duration of the employment  and  how  much
      the appellant would be paid and most importantly that on the  face  of
      the document relied upon by the appellant  the  offer  post-dated  the
      ECO's decision by approximately 3 months.


  11. Having considered the determination as a whole we  conclude  that  the
      judge erred in law in his evaluation of the maintenance issue  and  we
      therefore set aside the decision and remake it for ourselves.

   Re-making of decision

  12. It was agreed by the parties that the only issue  in  the  appeal,  in
      relation to the  Immigration  Rules,  is  whether  the  appellant  can
      satisfy the maintenance requirement in paragraph 281.  The  respondent
      does not now take issue with any of the  other  requirements  of  this
      rule. The appellant has to demonstrate that he will be  maintained  in
      the United Kingdom from his own  resources  or  that  of  his  sponsor
      without recourse to further public funds.


  13. The respondent did not challenge the appellant's evidence  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal that the sponsor's two daughters, aged 17  and  18
      at the relevant time, were no longer living with the sponsor, are  not
      her responsibility and that therefore the financial  requirement  that
      the appellant has to satisfy is not for a couple with two children. As
      a consequence, at the hearing it was agreed that the  relevant  income
      support level for our considerations was �106 per week, that being the
      level for a couple. The sponsor further accepted that the rent for her
      proportion of the accommodation was �72.00 a week and  that  she  pays
      �20.10 per week for council tax. In order to meet the  requirement  of
      the Immigration Rule she, therefore, has  to  demonstrate  income,  or
      other   available   funds,   in   excess   of   �198.10    per    week
      [�106+�72+�20.10].


  14. The sponsor also accepted  in  evidence  that  her  accounts  for  the
      financial year to 2012 show  her  profit  to  have  been  �6131.  This
      equates to earnings of �117.90 per week i.e. �80.20 per week short  of
      the required sum.

  15. In order to make up for this deficit the sponsor asserts that (i)  her
      income has subsequently increased (ii) she has savings which  she  can
      use (iii) the appellant has savings which can also be  used  and  (iv)
      the appellant has an offer of employment,  which  he  will  take  upon
      arrival.  We now turn to consider each of these in turn

  16. In relation to the former, the sponsor states that  her  turnover  has
      been �6438 in the last six months.  As  this  is  an  out  of  country
      appeal, it is trite law  that  we  can  only  consider  evidence  that
      appertained to the date of decision under appeal i.e. the 2 May  2012.
      Evidence of the sponsor's current income, which in any  event  is  not
      documented before us and was accepted to be only an estimate,  is  not
      relevant  to  our  assessment  of  whether  the  appellant   met   the
      requirement of the Immigration Rules nearly 18 months ago.

  17. As to the sponsor's savings, these in reality were not savings at all.
      The sponsor provided her current  account  statements  to  demonstrate
      that she has savings �1315 as of 25 February 2012. The level of  funds
      in the bank account fluctuates  on  a  daily  basis  and  the  sponsor
      accepted that her income is deposited into this account and  that  she
      uses it for her living expenses.  She accepted  that  money  lying  in
      that account could not be considered to be savings. In any event,  the
      latest statement made available to  the  Tribunal  was  for  a  period
      ending approximately 3 months prior to the date of decision  and  thus
      is of little assistance in relation to what the position  was  at  the
      relevant date. Additionally the appellant was unable  to  explain  the
      origins of two cash deposits of �800 and �180 made  into  her  account
      prior to the application.


  18. The appellant provided a copy of a bank  statement  bearing  his  name
      from GTB Bank dated, the end date of which was 12  March  2012.  There
      were several large deposits made into this account.   On  12  February
      2012 a deposit of 70,000 naira  was  made  and  three  weeks  later  a
      deposit of 655,000 naira were made into the account. At  the  hearing,
      when asked where the funds have come from, the sponsor stated that she
      did not know.  She also said that she does not have more  up  to  date
      statements for the appellant.  Her evidence is that the  appellant  is
      unemployed and that he owns some land in Nigeria. Given the  statement
      dates from two months prior to the date of decision  and  shows  large
      unexplained deposits which are not  consistent  with  the  transaction
      history as whole, we do not accept that it has  been  demonstrated  to
      the balance of probabilities that the monies in that account as of the
      end date of the statement were (i) monies available to he appellant to
      use to maintain himself in the United Kingdom and  (ii)  monies  which
      were also in the account  as  of  the  date  of  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer's decision

  19. We therefore find that the funds in the bank accounts of the appellant
      and his sponsor are not monies genuinely available to them to  use  to
      maintain the appellant in the United Kingdom.


  20. The appellant claims that he owns land in  Nigeria.  Although  he  has
      provided some evidence that he owns land,  there  is  no  evidence  of
      historical income and  certainly  no  evidence  that  this  historical
      income will be maintained if he leaves Nigeria.


  21. We finally turn to the proposed employment. The appellant  provided  a
      letter dated 25 August 2012 from Mr Glenn Paul Lambert stating that he
      confirms that when the appellant returns to the United Kingdom he  has
      offered him a  "permanent  position  as  a  driver's  mate  within  my
      company". This letter post-dates the entry clearance application,  and
      there is no reliable  evidence  that  such  offer  of  employment  was
      available to the appellant at that date. We therefore disregard it for
      this reason. In any event, the letter does  not  indicate  the  salary
      offered, the proposed length of the appointment or for  how  long  the
      position will be kept open for the appellant..


  22. Although the letter states that it is a permanent  position,  it  does
      not indicate  whether  it  is  full  time  work  or  part  time  work.
      Questioned at the hearing, the sponsor  had  very  little  information
      about this job.  She was completely unaware as  to  what  a  "driver's
      mate" does.  She further confirmed that she  has  no  other  documents
      such as a business card to corroborate the existence of the  business.
      There is also no credible evidence before us that  the  appellant  has
      the requisite skills to do the job of a driver's mate in this country.
       The sponsor's  evidence  is  that  the  appellant  is  unemployed  in
      Nigeria.  We also observe that the claimed proposed employer  did  not
      attend the hearing to give evidence  in  support  of  the  appellant's
      appeal. No credible explanation has been given as to why  an  employer
      in this country would give  an  open  ended  offer  of  employment  to
      someone who is seeking entry clearance, which he may  or  may  not  be
      granted. Looking at the extremely limited evidence before us  on  this
      issue as a whole we do not accept that it has been demonstrated to the
      balance of probabilities that the employment was  genuinely  available
      to the appellant at the time of the ECO's decision.


  23. For the reasons given above we find that the appellant does not  on  a
      balance of probabilities satisfy the requirements of paragraph 281  of
      the Immigration Rules as he has failed to demonstrate that he will  be
      maintained in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds. The
      appellant's appeal therefore must fail to the extent that he relies on
      the Immigration Rules.


     Article 8


  24. Applying the five stage test set out at paragraph 17 of R v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department, ex parte Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27  we
      are satisfied that the answers to the first four stages  of  the  test
      are all affirmative.  We find that the appellant has  a  family  life,
      that the appellant's exclusion from the United Kingdom  would  clearly
      be an interference with this family life, that the interference  would
      have consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage Article  8,
      but that this interference would be in  accordance  with  the  law  in
      pursuit of the legitimate aim of immigration  control.  The  essential
      question in this case concerns the  test  of  proportionality  at  the
      fifth stage of the Razgar test.


  25. The next question that we have to decide is  whether  the  refusal  of
      leave to the appellant, 'in circumstances where the life of the family
      cannot reasonably be expected to be  enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking  full
      account of all considerations  weighing  in  favour  of  the  refusal,
      prejudices the family life of the applicant in a  manner  sufficiently
      serious to amount to a breach of the fundamental  right  protected  by
      article 8' (Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2007]
      UKHL 11 ("Huang"), para. 20).  In considering this question,  we  have
      taken into account all factors that weigh in favour of the refusal  of
      leave, including the desirability of applying a workable, predictable,
      consistent and fair system of immigration control (Huang,  para.  16).
      Against this, we have taken into account the effect  that  refusal  of
      leave would have on the enjoyment of the appellant's  family  life  in
      the appellant's case, bearing in mind the core value that Article 8 of
      the Human Rights  Convention  seeks  to  protect  and  the  fact  that
      '[t]heir family, or extended family, is the group on which many people
      most heavily depend,  socially,  emotionally  and  often  financially'
      (Huang, para. 18).

  26.  We have considered the effect of our decision on the sponsor, in  the
      light of the  decision in Beoku-Betts v Secretary  of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2008] UKHL 39, in which it was held that  the  effect
      on other family members with a right to respect for their family  life
      with the appellant must also be taken into account in an appeal to the
      AIT on human rights grounds. In light of this  decision,  we  have  to
      consider the family life of all those who share their family life with
      the appellant.


  27. The duty imposed by Article 8 does not extend to a general  obligation
      on the part of the  United  Kingdom  to  respect  the  choice  by  the
      appellant and his sponsor of the United  Kingdom  as  the  country  of
      their  matrimonial  residence,  and  to  accept  the   appellant   for
      settlement in this country, at least unless it is established that  it
      would be unreasonable to  expect  them  establishing  family  life  in
      Nigeria or elsewhere, or that there are special reasons why that could
      not be expected of them.  Article 8 imposes a positive obligation upon
      the state to respect the family life of the appellants:  it  does  not
      guarantee a right to family life in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  first
      question we ask ourselves is whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the
      sponsor to leave the United Kingdom and live in Nigeria (See EB Kosovo
      [2008] UKHL 41). We conclude that it is.


  28. We take into account that the sponsor is a British citizen as are  her
      children. Following ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2011] UKSC 4, we are required to afford the  interests  of
      the children a primary though not paramount  consideration,  which  we
      have done. The sponsor was previously married  but  is  now  divorced.
      Her two children from the previous marriage were aged 17 and 18 at the
      relevant date. Whilst we have no doubt there are still emotional bonds
      between the sponsor and her children, we have accepted  the  sponsor's
      evidence that they now live with their father  and  that  she  has  no
      responsibility for them. The effect on the children's interests would,
      on the limited evidence available to us,  be  only  marginal  and  the
      sponsor is free to travel to Nigeria to be with the appellant if  that
      is her wish. Although not ideal, the sponsor's children  can  continue
      family life with their mother by way of  visits  and  other  forms  of
      communication.

  29. As to the sponsor herself, she is a British Citizen and has lived  her
      whole life here. This, though, is not  impediment  of  itself  to  her
      living in Nigeria (See Ogundimu [2013] UKUT 00060). We have taken into
      account she has a business here, and that if she  were  to  leave  the
      country that business would cease. This  would,  though,  have  little
      impact other than on the  sponsor.  She  does  not  employ  any  other
      persons  and  it  is  not  suggested  her  customers  could  not  make
      alternative arrangements. The only reason that the sponsor gave at the
      hearing for why  she  cannot  relocate  to  Nigeria  to  be  with  the
      appellant is the lack of creature comforts in Nigeria and  that  there
      is a better quality of life for her in the United Kingdom.   She  said
      electricity can be interrupted as can the water supply and that it  is
      not easy to live in Nigeria.  Whilst we accept that  the  standard  of
      life is higher in this country,  the  appellant's  sponsor  must  have
      known that when she married a Nigerian  national,  he  would  have  to
      satisfy the immigration laws of this country. Looking at the sponsor's
      circumstances as a whole we find it is entirely reasonable  to  expect
      her to move to Nigeria and continue her life with her husband there.

  30. As we have indicated above, the appellant does not qualify  under  the
      Immigration Rules and this is a weighty factor  when  determining  the
      issue of proportionality. In coming to our conclusion  we  have  taken
      full account  of  the  fact  that  the  appellant  has  an  impeccable
      immigration history, that he and the sponsor  lived  together  in  the
      United Kingdom for six months from September 2011 until March 2012 and
      that he returned voluntarily to Nigeria to make  his  entry  clearance
      application. Nevertheless, looking at all the evidence as a  whole  we
      find  that  the  decision  of  the   entry   clearance   officer   was
      proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining   immigration
      control.


      DECISION

For the reasons given above, the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
is set aside.

We remake the decision  on  appeal  dismissing  Mr  Agoyi's  appeal  on  all
grounds.
