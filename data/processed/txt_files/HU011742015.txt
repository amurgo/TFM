Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis (Senior Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr G Davison (counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of Meixin  Ding,  a  citizen  of
   China born 5 May 1997, against the decision (of 29 May 2015)  to  refuse
   her application for entry clearance.


2. The application was for the Appellant to join her mother,  the  Sponsor,
   Guangmei Ni, who is present in the UK with  leave  to  remain  until  24
   April 2017 (at the date of  the  hearing  below,  then  a  date  in  the
   future). Ms Ni is married to Leong Cheen Soon, a Malaysian citizen  with
   indefinite leave to remain in the UK. The application set out  that  the
   Sponsor earned �23,053, and the Appellant's mother earned �10,735.


3.  The  application  was  refused  because  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
   considered that notarial certificates were so easily obtained as  to  be
   considered unreliable absent an actual death  certificate.  It  was  not
   accepted that the mother had sole responsibility for her  case  or  that
   there were serious or compelling reasons rendering the child's exclusion
   undesirable. The relevant earnings threshold was  �24,800  annually  and
   the evidence available as to proof of earnings was  unsatisfactory.  The
   Entry Clearance Manager upheld those reasons on review.


4. The  Appellant's  younger  brother,  Meiheng  Ding,  applied  for  entry
   clearance subsequently,  the  third  of  his  three  applications  being
   granted after two had been refused. He joined his mother and  stepfather
   here on 9 December 2015. The fresh application route was barred  to  the
   Appellant as she was now over eighteen.


5. The First-tier Tribunal summarised the evidence before  it  as  follows.
   The Appellant's mother was a Chinese national who had joined her husband
   on the basis of a spouse visa in August 2014. She, her husband  and  her
   youngest child, her son,  now  lived  together.  She  had  had  parental
   responsibility for the Appellant since the  latter's  biological  father
   died in October 2005. She was the only carer for the two children  since
   their father's death.  There  were  other  children  from  her  previous
   marriage but those half-siblings had never cared  about  the  Appellant;
   her children from that relationship did not keep  in  touch  with  their
   relatives. Her  only  contact  with  them  had  been  when  seeking  the
   biological father's death certificate. She had been the sole  source  of
   financial support to them since the father died;  her  new  husband  now
   helped her in supporting them.


6. The Appellant and her brother were very close to one  another,  and  the
   former had become very worried about the latter's  well-being  when  she
   had to move away began  from  home  to  pursue  her  degree  studies  in
   September 2015. Now she was stranded alone in China, whilst her  brother
   in  the  UK  showed  visible  signs  of  grief  and  anxiety  at  having
   effectively abandoned her there.  The mother had visited  the  Appellant
   in April and December 2015 for periods of around a week.


7. The Appellant's stepfather gave evidence, stating that  the  family  had
   been surprised when the biological father's death  had  been  questioned
   given the same documentary evidence had previously been accepted by  the
   entry clearance post. He ran his own business on a self-employed  basis,
   and his wife worked for him; he paid her wages into  the  bank  account.
   The Appellant was a full-time student who relied  wholly  on  the  money
   sent from the United Kingdom to support herself.


8. The First-tier Tribunal reminded itself that this was an appeal to which
   the  statutory  considerations  identified  in  section  117A-D  of  the
   Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  applied.  It  accepted  the
   evidence given before it as cogent and  credible,  and  found  that  the
   biological father was indeed dead and that  the  financial  requirements
   were met at the date of  hearing,  and  probably  met  at  the  date  of
   application. The Appellant was alone with her close family  members  now
   present in the UK. It was highly relevant that the  Appellant's  brother
   had been permitted to come to the UK; it  was  only  her  age  that  had
   prevented her from making a further application herself.  It  was  clear
   that their separation had left him feeling guilty and grief-stricken.


9. Having regard to these considerations and to  the  duty  to  secure  the
   brother's best interests,  the  immigration  decision  to  refuse  entry
   clearance was disproportionate to the private and family life in play.


10. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for permission to appeal, which  was
   granted.


Findings and reasons

11. At the hearing before me Mr Jarvis requested the  Tribunal's  permission
   to withdraw  the  appeal,  as  it  had  now  become  apparent  that  the
   Respondent would satisfy the requirements of the Rules if her  case  was
   properly analysed.


12. In all the circumstances I considered it appropriate to accede  to  this
   course of action, consistent as it is with  the  interests  of  justice.
   Unsurprisingly, Mr Davison had not objection for the Respondent.


          Decision:

    The appeal is recorded as withdrawn.
