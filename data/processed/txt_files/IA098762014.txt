For the Appellant:     Miss P Makunzva (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (HOPO)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herbert OBE, promulgated on 8th October 2014, following a hearing
    at Taylor House on 29th September  2014.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of  Keith  Musekiwa  Makoni.   The  Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Zimbabwe, who  was  born  on  9th
    February 1978.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 21st January 2014  rejecting  the  Appellant's
    application to remain in the UK on the basis of ten  years'  continuous
    residence because he could not comply with paragraph 276ADE, and it was
    also not accepted that the Appellant had a partner or a child in the UK
    who met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge observed how the  Appellant  had  come  to  the  UK  on  11th
    September 2002, as a 24 year old man, and was granted leave  to  remain
    until 11th September 2003.  His leave was extended until 29th  November
    2007.  Further applications were rejected between  30th  November  2007
    and 8th February 2008.  These applications  were  in  relation  to  his
    student stays.  The Appellant maintained that he had  at  all  material
    times applied on time but the Respondent had  lost  the  postal  orders
    enclosed with his application and he  had  faced  great  difficulty  in
    obtaining his Zimbabwean passport and had  eventually  been  forced  to
    send his passbook back to Zimbabwe with his parents in order for a  new
    one to be safely issued which  only  occurred  approximately  one  year
    later.  There was a period of some 134 days between the expiry  of  the
    Appellant's leave on 30th November 2007 and the grant of his  leave  to
    remain as a student on 7th April 2008,  which  was  largely  caused  by
    issues relating to fees and passport, such that he could not fall under
    the twelve year concession of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The judge also had regard to the fact that the Appellant  had  attended
    university  in  the  UK  and  had  subsequently  obtained  "significant
    employment as a quantity surveyor in London with a  reputable  company"
    (paragraph 24).  He had gone on to establish "a long term  and  serious
    relationship with his partner who is a UK citizen with whom he has been
    living since  December  2013".   The  Appellant's  "partner  also  gave
    evidence before me who is  a  UK  citizen  originating  from  Ghana..."
    (paragraph  25).   The  Appellant's  partner  was  "a  senior   project
    information manager with a firm called AECOM who earns some ï¿½39,000 per
    annum" (paragraph 26).  The judge was firm in his conclusion that,  "it
    is clear from the couple's answers, a party who intend to  get  married
    in the foreseeable future and who are in  a  very  deep  and  committed
    relationship" (paragraph 27).

 5. The judge then went on to consider the application of the law and  held
    that the Appellant "is not eligible under the Immigration Rules for the
    ten years' long residence as it is not continuous..."  (paragraph  30).
    The judge applied then the two stage approach in the  case  of  Gulshan
    (see paragraph 31) before moving on  to  consideration  of  the  Razgar
    principles (paragraph 32).  In that context, the judge  considered  the
    current codification of the Razgar principles in  Section  117  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014 (paragraph 33).  The judge held that the Appellant
    was a person of previous good character, was a tax payer, and was in  a
    durable  relationship  "which  will  almost  certainly  lead  to  their
    marriage" (paragraph 37).

 6. In applying the Razgar principles, the judge held that there  would  be
    "grave consequences if he were now to be removed  because  his  partner
    would not re-establish herself in Zimbabwe as she has no  knowledge  of
    the language, culture or economic ability to re-establish herself there
    save for a  relationship  with  the  Appellant"  (paragraph  38).   The
    judge's conclusions were that "the  removal  of  this  Appellant  would
    cause significant hardship to both the Appellant and his civil partner"
    (paragraph 40).

 7. The appeal is allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge  had  not  sufficiently
    identified what were the "compelling reasons" as required by Nagre  and
    Gulshan, such that the judge could go outside the Immigration Rules and
    consider freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.

 9. On 24th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 13th January 2015, Mr Tufan,  appearing  on
    behalf of the  Appellant,  relied  upon  the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   He
    submitted first, that it was clear that the Appellant could not satisfy
    the Immigration Rules; but that second, the judge allowed the appeal on
    the same facts under Article 8, without explaining why he could do  so.
    This was important because there was nothing in the facts that could be
    considered to be exceptional.  Mr Tufan relied upon the recent case  of
    Nasim [2014] UKUT 25.  It is true that there had  been  a  relationship
    with a partner since 2013 but no  evidence  that  such  a  relationship
    would fit into Appendix FM paragraph 276ADE.

11. For her part, Miss Makunzva submitted that first, there was evidence in
    the bundle that the Appellant's partner was born in the  UK,  had  been
    living here all her life, and  could  not  go  and  live  in  Zimbabwe,
    because she was a person of Ghanaian extraction.  Her  name  is  Sharon
    Osei.

12. Second, she gave evidence about her  relationship,  was  cross-examined
    before the judge, and the judge concluded that  theirs  was  a  genuine
    relationship which was "very deep and committed" (paragraph  27).   The
    judge was clear that this relationship "will almost certainly  lead  to
    their marriage" (paragraph 37).  The reason why they have  not  married
    is because the passport of the Appellant remains  with  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State, without which she cannot go into a registry  office
    and get married.

13. Third, the judge did consider  the  two  stage  test  in  Gulshan  (see
    paragraphs 30 to 31), before proceeding on to the Razgar principles (at
    paragraph 32) and then considering Section 117 (at paragraph 33) of the
    2014  Act.   Most  importantly,  the  judge  actually  identified   the
    "exceptional circumstances" at paragraph 38 of the  determination  when
    he said that there would be "grave consequences if he were  allowed  to
    be removed because  his  partner  could  not  re-establish  herself  in
    Zimbabwe as she has no knowledge of the  language..."  (paragraph  38).
    The judge concluded that removal "would cause significant  hardship  to
    both the Appellant and his civil partner" (paragraph 40).

14. Finally, a spate of recent cases such as Oludoyi [2014] UKUT  539,  now
    confirmed  that  there  was  no  "intermediary  test",  such  that  the
    Appellant would have succeeded under the current approaches to  Article
    8 issues.  In fact, the Appellant would have  succeeded  under  Section
    117B because he was in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    qualifying partner which had not been established at a time when he was
    in the UK unlawfully.  His private  life  had  not  been  developed  in
    circumstances where his status was precarious.

15. In reply, Mr Tufan relied upon  paragraph  23  of  Oludoyi,  where  the
    Tribunal makes it clear that it is not always necessary to  follow  the
    five step approach explained in  Razgar  because  it  is  only  if  the
    circumstances  relied  upon  for  the  grant  of  leave   outside   the
    Immigration Rules relate to matters that go to proportionality, that it
    is permissible to proceed to the question of proportionality.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of  law  (see  Section  12(1)
    TCEA 2007) for the following reasons.

17. First and foremost, this was a  case  where  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules, and the judge so found, because he
    did not have a  seamless  whole  of  ten  years'  long  residence  (see
    paragraph 30).  There had been a break in the  continuity.   The  judge
    was clear that, "some of this delay may have been due to the Respondent
    themselves" (paragraph 30).

18. Second, in considering the Appellant's relationship with Sharon Osei, a
    person who has no association with Zimbabwe, the judge was  looking  at
    the situation which did not represent a "complete code" as far  as  the
    Immigration Rules were concerned.  The application was on the basis  of
    the so called ten year Rule.  Paragraph 276ADE is also not  a  complete
    code.

19. Third, and no less importantly, this is a case where, in the  light  of
    what has been established by Oludoyi in the Upper Tribunal in 2014,  it
    must  be  recognised  that  there  is  no  "intermediary  test"  before
    freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence can be considered, such  that  the
    approach of the judge was flawed, even on the basis  of  the  arguments
    put forward by the Respondent Secretary of State.

20. This is a case where the Appellant would have succeeded  under  Section
    117B of the 2014 Act.  There is, accordingly, no error of  law  in  the
    determination.   The  determination,  in  terms  of  its  analysis  and
    findings, as described above, was comprehensive and thorough.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity order is made.
