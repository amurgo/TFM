                            DECISION AND REASONS


Background

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Nepal born on 18 March 1985.
     He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  against  the  refusal  of  his
    application for entry clearance to settle in the United  Kingdom  as  a
    dependent son of Kharka Bahadur Gurung, a former Gurkha.   The  refusal
    by the respondent is dated 7 April 2015.  In  a  decision  and  reasons
    promulgated on 16  February  2017  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Phillips dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.

Error of Law

 2. The appellant appealed and was  granted  permission  including  on  the
    basis that in the Court of Appeal in Rai v Entry Clearance Officer (New
    Delhi) [2017] EWCA Civ 320 the Court of Appeal identified that  it  was
    wrong for the Upper Tribunal to  concentrate  on  the  decision  of  an
    applicant's parents to leave  Nepal  and  settle  in  the  UK,  without
    focusing on the practical and  financial  realities  entailed  in  that
    decision.  Although Judge Phillips did not  have  the  benefit  of  the
    Court of Appeal's decision it was arguable that  as  this  consolidated
    existing jurisprudence rather than changing the  approach,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did not properly apply existing case  law.   The  Grounds
    before me were as follows:

         Ground 1 - insufficient direction of law  on  Article  8(1)  family
         life;

         Ground 2 - failure to consider evidence.

 3. At the beginning of the hearing Ms Holmes conceded that  including  for
    the reasons given in the grant of permission there was an error of  law
    and both parties agreed that  the  Upper  Tribunal  could  re-make  the
    decision on the basis of submissions, Ms Holmes declining to  make  any
    indication other than that the Court of Appeal in Rai  did  not  assist
    the respondent's case.

 4. The respondent was correct in that submission.  The First-tier Tribunal
    took  the  wrong  approach  in  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
    discharged the burden of showing emotional dependence on the sponsor.

 5. It is the case that dependence is arguably not a requirement  and  that
    what may constitute an extant family life  falls  well  short  of  what
    constitutes dependency (see Patel & Others v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17,  Selby  LJ  at  [14].   In  addition,  the
    judge's approach to the evidence before her  was  flawed  and  she  was
    incorrect in asserting whether there was an absence of evidence of  use
    of a bank card as the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  included
    the  sponsor's  bank  statements  from  April  2014  (page  61  of  the
    appellant's bundle) and this shows  five  ATM  withdrawals  between  22
    April 2014 and 30 May 2014.  This is then followed by  money  transfers
    from the sponsor to the appellant which was further evidenced at  pages
    62 to 63.

 6. In finding that it was inconsistent that the appellant now uses cheques
    when the sponsor had left his bank card, the First-tier Tribunal failed
    to give adequate reasons for that finding  and  why  she  rejected  the
    evidence before her as summarised above, if  that  was  the  case.   In
    addition, the judge failed to give reasons why she did not  accept  the
    evidence  of  the  sponsor  including  as  there  was  information  and
    documents before the First-tier Tribunal  including  of  the  sponsor's
    exemplary record of conduct in the  army  and  who  was  found  by  his
    commanding officer to be "completely reliable".  It is unclear in  this
    context what the inconsistency was that the judge found  there  to  be.
    The First-tier Tribunal also failed to give adequate  reasons  for  her
    finding that the "appellant cannot properly be said to be residing with
    his mother", purporting to distinguish AA v UK [2012]  Imm  AR1,  which
    confirmed such residence is a relevant  factor  in  considering  family
    life.  There was no challenge to the evidence that  the  appellant  and
    his mother were living in the same house and the judge had  found  that
    the appellant's mother chose to spend the majority of her  time  there,
    returning to Nepal in January 2014.  In finding that  it  was  not  the
    appellant's dependency which had led the appellant's mother to make the
    decision to spend  the  majority  of  her  time  in  Nepal,  the  judge
    approached the issue from an erroneous perspective, the 'wrong  end  of
    the lens', rather than looking at the cohabitation and  then  assessing
    dependency.

Re-making the Decision

 7. As I am satisfied there are material errors of law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision I have proceeded to re-make that decision in light of
    the evidence before  me  and  the  submissions.   As  indicated,  these
    consisted of the submissions of Mr Jesurum as Ms Holmes  conceded  that
    she was in difficulty and had no submissions to make.

Background

 8. It is undisputed that the appellant's father and the  sponsor  in  this
    case served in the Gurkhas for fifteen years and was discharged in 1989
    but was unable to apply to settle in the United Kingdom at  that  stage
    and was not given the opportunity to do so until 2009, at  which  stage
    the appellant was no longer a minor.  It  has  always  been  maintained
    that if that had not happened the appellant would have accompanied  the
    sponsor as a minor to the United Kingdom, the appellant having  been  4
    years of age when  his  father  was  discharged  from  the  army.   The
    appellant appeals the refusal of the respondent,  of  entry  clearance,
    dated 7 April 2015.  It is not in dispute  that  the  appellant  cannot
    meet the Immigration Rules and can only be considered under  Article  8
    and the relevant policy.

 9. It is common case that prior to 1997 veterans of the Brigade of Gurkhas
    were denied the opportunity for settlement  until  2004  and  this  was
    found to be an historic injustice in R(on the application  of  Limbu  &
    Others) v SSHD [2008] EWHC 2261 (Admin).  It was not  until  a  further
    policy was introduced in 2009 that this provided the first  opportunity
    for all adult children to apply for entry clearance.   The  policy  was
    amended in 2015 to remove the requirement of exceptionality,  in  light
    of the Court of Appeal decision in Gurung [2013] 1WLR 2546.

10. I have considered the five stage test set out in R (Razgar) v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2004] 2AC 368 .  It  is  settled  law
    that the Article 8 rights of both the appellant, the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant's mother i.e. all family members must be  considered  (Beoku-
    Betts [2009] 1AC 115).

11. In considering whether family life exists between the appellant and his
    family members in this case I have considered all  the  evidence.   The
    appellant was born in 1985.  His father was granted indefinite leave to
    enter on 27 July 2009 and his mother was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    enter on 14 December 2009.  The appellant's father entered the UK on 27
    February 2010 and his mother on 12 April 2011.  I accept, and  such  is
    not disputed, that the appellant resided  with  the  family  until  his
    mother's departure  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  that  there  was  no
    opportunity for the sponsor to apply prior to 2009.

12. I accept that it is a relevant consideration that the sponsor  faced  a
    choice between taking up settlement (or losing it after two years under
    paragraph 20 of the Immigration Rules) or continuing his family life as
    it was.  There was considerable evidence before me,  including  in  the
    form of extracted passport stamps, that both the appellant's father and
    mother have returned to Nepal for extended periods from  2011  onwards.
    The appellant's mother in particular returned home for over a year  and
    a half from 2014 to 2015 and was cohabiting with the appellant  at  the
    date of decision (and it was not disputed that the date of decision was
    the relevant date for the purpose of this appeal).

13. In terms of financial dependence the appellant,  the  sponsor  and  his
    mother have all  maintained  that  the  appellant  is,  and  has  been,
    financially dependent on the  sponsor  who  left  his  bank  card.   In
    addition to his bank card there was evidence that  the  sponsor's  bank
    had specific  written  authority  for  the  appellant  to  access  that
    account, as well as sending remittances of ï¿½100 a month.  Ms Holmes did
    not submit that there was any inconsistency in the evidence  before  me
    and I do take into account the credibility of the sponsor as evidenced,
    including his discharge from the army.  In accepting that the appellant
    is financially dependent on his parents I have further considered  that
    he is not in employment and is not married and that the appellant  also
    depends on his parents for his accommodation in Nepal.

14. It was the evidence  of  the  entire  family  that  regardless  of  the
    appellant's age he remains emotionally close to his parents.   This  is
    evident in the fact that the appellant's mother effectively returned to
    live with her son and has continued the relationship as it  has  always
    been.  There was in addition evidence  before  me  of  continued  close
    contact between the parties including by phone and viber.

15. In deciding  on  whether  family  life  exists,  the  test  is  whether
    "something more exists than normal emotional  ties"  (Kugathas  v  SSHD
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31) and relevant factors include who the near relatives
    are, the nature of the links, age, where and with  whom  the  appellant
    has resided in the past and the nature of contact.  I  accept  that  in
    order to establish whether family life exists it is  not  necessary  to
    find that that support is indispensible which it is unlikely to  be  in
    an appellant over 30 years old.  However, I have considered the  nature
    of the ties and note that  Sedley  LJ  in  the  dissenting  opinion  in
    Kugathas, found dependence to mean real support, effective  support  or
    committed support.  It is particular in this  context  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Ghising [2012] UKUT 160 confirmed that  Kugathas  had  been
    interpreted too restrictively in the past and the Court  of  Appeal  in
    Patel  (supra)  confirmed  that   family   life   can   exist   without
    indispensible support.

16. The jurisprudence in this area confirms that the attainment of the  age
    of majority in itself does not end family life and in this case I  have
    taken particular account of the fact that family life has continued  in
    the family home for the majority  of  the  time  with  the  appellant's
    mother returning, together with strong evidence of continued  financial
    and emotional support, which can be reciprocal with both the  appellant
    being the recipient of that support and also offering such  support  to
    his parents.  I am satisfied  that  there  is  evidence  of  continuing
    mutual support and dependency between the appellant, his father and his
    mother in all areas of their lives, not least because  the  appellant's
    mother returned to live with her son  for  extended  periods  (although
    that is not the sole consideration).  I  am  satisfied  that  there  is
    real, committed and effective support of the appellant by his  parents.
    In such circumstances I am satisfied that family life exists.

17. I then go on to consider whether there would be interference with  that
    family life in the respondent's refusal and I am  satisfied  that  that
    question must be answered in the affirmative and  that  given  the  low
    threshold such interference is sufficiently serious to  engage  Article
    8, such interference is in accordance with the law and for the purposes
    of maintaining effective immigration control.  Therefore I have gone on
    to consider whether such interference is proportionate.  In so doing  I
    must have regard to Section 117 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, the public interest consideration  and  I  have  taken
    into account that Section 117B represents  the  ordinary  interests  of
    immigration control.  (Dube (Sections 117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90).

18. I have taken into account that there is no evidence of the  appellant's
    proficiency in English language or of financial independence  and  that
    therefore the public interest is engaged in this  respect.   However  I
    have considered that in the context of the respondent's policy  and  as
    already noted Ms Holmes made no submissions on this point.

19.  I must give appropriate weight to  the  historic  injustice.   I  have
    reminded myself that the historic injustice is not the only issue to be
    considered, when in reality  there  are  many  factors.   Patel  v  ECO
    (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17  confirms  that  whilst  the  interests  of
    immigration control would in most cases outweigh Article 8  rights,  in
    historic cases the reverse is true and  the  approach  in  Patel  is  a
    compensatory one in terms of "righting the law".  The starting point is
    that those denied entry earlier should be put in the position that they
    would have been but for that law.

20. The Court of Appeal in Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320  confirmed  that  whilst
    the Tribunal must have  regard  to  Section  117B  including  that  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control is in the public interest,
    it  was  also  correct  that  given   the   historic   injustice   such
    considerations under Section 117B in  themselves,  would  not  make  an
    adverse difference to the outcome of the case

21. In considering whether the  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant  is  a
    disproportionate interference with, what I found to be the family  life
    in this case, I have considered as set out in Ghising & Others  (above)
    that a bad immigration  history  or  criminal  behaviour  may  tip  the
    balance in the respondent's favour but that if all that  is  relied  on
    the public interest decide or in the interests of  immigration  control
    "the weight to be given to the historic injustice will normally require
    a decision in the appellant's favour".

22. It was not in dispute that  there  is  no  question  of  either  a  bad
    immigration history or criminal behaviour  in  this  case  and  I  have
    considered  further  in  the  appellant's  favour  that   the   sponsor
    sacrificed many years of his family life  in  order  to  serve  in  the
    British Army, serving well in excess of the  four  years  necessary  to
    qualify for settlement, and that his access to his family  during  that
    time in terms of visits and his family  being  able  to  join  him  was
    greater than that endured by other soldiers of the British Army (see  R
    (Purja) v MOD [2004] 1WLR 289).

23.  I  am  satisfied  that  the   respondent's   decision   represents   a
    disproportionate interference with family life.
