Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N Ahluwalia of Counsel instructed by Farani Javid
                    Taylor Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of  State  but  for  convenience  I
    will refer to the appellant, a national of Pakistan born on 20 December
    1986, as the appellant herein.  The appellant arrived in  this  country
    on 16 September 2010 with entry clearance as a  student  and  was  then
    given further leave to remain for post-study  work  until  20  February
    2014.  During this period the appellant having been  unable  to  obtain
    work in the United Kingdom went to Dubai to join his  father  for  some
    months.

2.   The appellant made two applications for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur).  The first application was made on 7 June 2013 when  he
    applied as part of an entrepreneurial team including Umair Anees.  That
    application was  unsuccessful.   The  appellant  then  made  a  further
    application  on  12  February  2014  as  a  sole  entrepreneur.    That
    application was refused on 24 April 2014 and a decision to  remove  the
    appellant was taken under Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 on the same date.  The refusal is the  subject  of
    the present appeal proceedings.

3.   The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyes  on  27  January
    2015.  The judge heard from both the appellant  and  his  father.   She
    summarised the  respondent's  case  in  paragraphs  12  to  14  of  her
    determination and put the matter shortly in paragraph 21 as follows:

         "In essence, the respondent argues  that  the  business  is  not  a
         genuine one and that the  appellant  does  not  have  the  business
         acumen necessary to run the business concerned..."

4.   It was submitted in addition by the  Presenting  Officer  that  certain
    aspects of the evidence given by the witnesses called into question the
    appellant's  credibility.   It  was  submitted  that  the   appellant's
    father's evidence was quite vague and his  lack  of  knowledge  of  the
    appellant's business plans was surprising.

5.   The judge found that the  appellant's  father's  evidence  was  broadly
    consistent with the appellant's evidence and  rejected  the  suggestion
    that it was vague and found him to be a credible witness.

6.   The judge found that  there  was  no  issue  about  the  viability  and
    credibility of the source of the finances in this case.  The  appellant
    held �50,000 and had been given these funds by his  father  who  was  a
    wealthy businessman with extensive business interests in both  Pakistan
    and Dubai.  The judge was satisfied that the appellant was involved  in
    the family businesses while he was growing up and that his  father  had
    passed on practical skills and shared his experience with him.

7.   Among other points the respondent  had  commented  on  the  appellant's
    visit to Dubai when he could not find employment  in  the  UK  but  the
    judge resolved this matter in favour of the appellant in paragraphs  69
    and 70 of the determination finding that there was  nothing  about  the
    appellant's immigration history and previous activity in the  UK  which
    caused her to doubt that he genuinely intended to run a business in the
    UK or invest �50,000 in the business.  The  judge  commented  that  the
    appeal hearing was very lengthy compared  with  other  appeals  raising
    similar issues and much time had been given to hearing the  appellant's
    evidence which was detailed and extensive.   She  found  him  to  be  a
    credible witness coming from a family with a  proven  track  record  of
    success in business.   She  allowed  the  appeal  finding  he  met  the
    relevant requirements of the Rules.

8.   The respondent applied for permission to appeal which was granted on  1
    June 2015 by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker on the  ground
    that the judge had regard to evidence that was not submitted  with  the
    application and was therefore not before  the  decision  maker  and  so
    erred in her assessment of the evidence.

9.   Ms Isherwood relied on the grounds and referred to paragraph 44 of  the
    determination where there was reference to a written contract  prepared
    in May 2014 which was after the date of the decision in April.  It  was
    submitted in the grounds that it  was  clearly  demonstrated  that  the
    judge had based her  decision  "entirely  on  the  post-oral  evidence,
    giving it considerable weight, which was clearly not in  front  of  the
    decision maker".  Apart from the contract  raised  in  the  grounds  Ms
    Isherwood referred to documents at pages 89 to 91 of the  bundle  which
    were postdecision material.  Although  it  was  acknowledged  that  the
    judge  had  directed  herself  correctly  she  had  in   fact   allowed
    postdecision evidence to influence her decision.  A point not taken  in
    the grounds of appeal was the amendment to the company register  on  27
    November 2014 showing that Umair Anees was no longer a director of  the
    appellant's company - see paragraph 68 of the determination.

10.  Mr Ahluwalia relied on his response to the grounds of  appeal  received
    shortly before the hearing.

11.  He made the point that this was not a case concerning  the  failure  to
    produce  documents  but  rather  the  question  of  the  viability  and
    credibility of the appellant's business plans.  The judge  had  clearly
    directed herself correctly that she  could  not  consider  postdecision
    evidence under Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act, referring to Ahmed (PBS: admissible evidence)  [2014]  UKUT  00365
    (IAC) in paragraph 18 of her determination.  He pointed  out  that  the
    contract  in  May  2014  was  referred  to  in  cross-examination  (see
    paragraph 53 of the determination).  The respondent had questioned  the
    appellant about this contract, using  it  as  an  example  of  how  the
    business was neither credible nor plausible.  The judge made  it  quite
    clear in paragraph 53 that the contract postdated the decision and  she
    was making reference to it  as  it  had  been  referred  to  in  cross-
    examination.

12.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved  my  decision.   I  was
    referred to the case of Olatunde [2015] EWCA Civ 670 where the Court of
    Appeal concluded that the Tribunal had erred in taking into  account  a
    contract which had not been submitted at the time  of  the  application
    and had not then come into existence.

13.  In this appeal the judge, as I have said,  directed  herself  correctly
    in paragraph 18 of the determination by reference to Ahmed stating that
    in the light of that case "I am therefore unable to take  into  account
    documentary evidence that was not before the respondent at the date  of
    decision."  The judge repeats this at paragraph 25 of her decision:

         "As I am bound by Ahmed and Another, when reaching my conclusions I
         have only taken into account documentary evidence which was  before
         the decision maker at the date of decision, that is 24 April  2014.
         This documentary evidence is listed at page 3 of  the  Reasons  for
         Refusal Letter."

14.  In paragraph 53, while referring to  the  contract  in  May  2014,  the
    judge remarks that this contract postdates the decision and she  refers
    to it because it was referred to cross-examination.  In paragraph 75 of
    the decision (the  penultimate  paragraph  of  her  determination)  she
    stated:  "Having  considered  all  of  the  [pre-decision]  documentary
    evidence and witness evidence before me in the  round  ...",  [emphasis
    added] she was satisfied that the appellant had established  a  genuine
    business and met the relevant requirements of the Rules.

15.  It is therefore clear that both  at  the  start  and  the  end  of  the
    determination as well as during the course of it the  judge  was  fully
    aware of the relevant position about the  reception  of  evidence.   It
    would  have  been  impossible  for  her  not  to  make   reference   to
    postdecision evidence where this was raised in cross-examination.   She
    is meticulous about referring to dates as she did in paragraph 44.

16.  Overall this is a very careful and lengthy  decision  where  the  judge
    focused with care and attention on the points raised by the  respondent
    in the decision and she dealt with them all  during  the  course  of  a
    fully reasoned decision.  Having  correctly  directed  herself  on  the
    legal principles I see no reason for doubting that she failed to  apply
    them correctly and there is every indication that she did indeed  apply
    them correctly.

17.  Although the grounds took  an  additional  point  about  the  appellant
    being unable to find a job in Dubai  or  the  UK  and  had  lodged  his
    application as an entrepreneur in order to acquire  status  in  the  UK
    although he had no intention of setting up a business  this  point  was
    rightly not pursued.  The judge  correctly  addressed  herself  to  the
    issues of fact and came to well-reasoned conclusions on them as I  have
    said.  Despite the forceful submissions raised by Ms Isherwood I am not
    satisfied that the judge erred as claimed or indeed at all.

Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed and the  decision  of  the
First-tier Judge to allow the appeal stands.

I have made no anonymity award.
