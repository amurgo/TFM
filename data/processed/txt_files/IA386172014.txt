                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW


1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh, born  on  1st  January  1986.
    He appealed against a decision of the Respondent  dated  8th  September
    2014 to refuse the Appellant's application for further leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom on  the  basis  of  the  Appellant's  family  and
    private life.  The Appellant's appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-
    tier  Tribunal  Price  sitting  at  Newport  on  7th  July  2015.   The
    Respondent appeals with leave against that decision and for the reasons
    which I have set out below I have set the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal aside on the grounds of a material error of law.

2.   The Appellant entered the United  Kingdom  on  9th  October  2010  with
    leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student valid until 31st August  2012.   On
    21st August 2012 the Appellant was granted further leave to remain as a
    Tier 4 (General) Student until 28th June 2014.  On 11th March 2014  the
    Appellant married M A who has settled status  in  this  country  having
    been granted humanitarian  protection  on  27th  September  2012  ("the
    Sponsor").  Her leave is due to expire on 12th September 2017 when  she
    will be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain.   The  couple
    have a child, M, born on 24th April 2015.  The Appellant  submitted  an
    application for further leave to  remain  on  12th  June  2014  as  the
    dependant of the Sponsor.

3.    The  Respondent  refused  the  application  stating  that  Educational
    Testing Service (ETS) had confirmed that the Appellant's test score  in
    a past English language  test  was  obtained  through  deception.   The
    Appellant had taken the test on 27th June 2012 but because the validity
    of the test results could not be  authenticated  the  scores  had  been
    cancelled.  The Respondent considered the Appellant to be a person  who
    had sought leave to remain in the United Kingdom  by  deception  having
    come to that view following information provided by ETS that an anomaly
    with the Appellant's speaking test indicated the presence  of  a  proxy
    test-taker.

4.    The  Appellant's  application  was  refused  under   the   suitability
    requirements  S-LTR.2.2(a).   That  is  where  false  information   and
    representations or documents have been submitted  in  relation  to  the
    application including false information  submitted  to  any  person  to
    obtain a document used in support of the application.  The  Appellant's
    claim to have a family life with his spouse was rejected on suitability
    grounds but for the sake  of  completeness  the  Respondent  considered
    eligibility under Appendix  FM  on  the  basis  of  family  life.   The
    Respondent did not accept that the marriage was genuine and  subsisting
    noting that the Appellant  was  withdrawing  money  from  his  bank  in
    Birmingham whereas his spouse was withdrawing money from her account in
    Middlesex.  Even if it were  accepted  that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
    genuine   and   subsisting   relationship   it   was   not   considered
    disproportionate to interfere  with  any  family  or  private  life  to
    require the Appellant to leave the  United  Kingdom  and  apply  for  a
    spouse visa from Bangladesh.

5.   On appeal the  Judge  noted  that  the  Appellant  had  undertaken  his
    English language test at Colwill  College  in  Leicester  when  he  was
    living at Birmingham at the time. The Appellant did not take  the  test
    in Leicester in order to employ the services of a proxy test-taker.  35
    miles was not that far for the Appellant to travel to take the test and
    it was a  reasonable  explanation  that  he  was  unable  to  obtain  a
    convenient time slot in one of the Birmingham venues. The Appellant was
    not aware that his certificate had been invalidated until  he  received
    the Respondent's decision to refuse leave.  He had not been informed in
    the previous two years that his test result had been invalided nor  had
    he been given any opportunity to challenge the decision. The  Appellant
    was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with his spouse.   It  was
    not reasonable for the Appellant to return to Bangladesh to make an out
    of country application.

6.   The Judge had before him generic evidence from three officials  of  the
    Respondent, Mrs Rebecca Collings, Mr  Peter  Millington  and  Mr  Kevin
    Hibbs.  He  was  not  satisfied  that  there  had  been  an  individual
    examination of the Appellant's case and there was no reference  in  the
    statements to the Appellant's personal  circumstances.   There  was  no
    evidence that Colwill College was one  of  the  prime  locations  where
    fraudulent proxy  test-taking  was  taking  place.   Referring  to  the
    Appellant as "the client" the Judge continued that a question had to be
    raised as to why the client had not received  earlier  notification  of
    the ETS decision.  In the interests of fairness  the  Appellant  should
    have received such a notification with an opportunity to challenge  the
    decision.  Mr Hibbs' statement attached  a  spreadsheet  recording  the
    Appellant's name with the insertion of the word invalid  but  that  did
    not persuade the Judge that  the  decision  taken  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's test was individual to him.  The  technology  used  by  ETS
    could be imperfect and samples could be incorrectly flagged as  batches
    i.e. false positives.  The Respondent had not discharged her burden  of
    proof in respect to the allegation of deception.

7.   The separate withdrawals from banks in  Middlesex  and  Birmingham  did
    not persuade the Judge that this  was  not  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship.  A letter from the  YMCA  Housing  Officer,  8th  January
    2015,  indicated  that  the  Appellant's  spouse  had  introduced   the
    Appellant to the Housing Officer as her fiancï¿½ and he visited  her  for
    two days every week.  That  document  had  not  been  challenged.   The
    couple now had a son which  demonstrated  the  genuine  and  subsisting
    nature of the relationship.  The Appellant had spent  the  majority  of
    his life in Bangladesh and had  the  appropriate  skills  to  integrate
    there.  However he had lost ties with his family since arriving in  the
    United Kingdom.  He now had a son which was a significant  obstacle  to
    the Appellant returning to Bangladesh.  His wife could not return there
    as she had fled the country.  At paragraph 45 the Judge found  that  in
    light of the dependency by the Appellant's wife upon the Appellant  and
    the fact that he has a son of less than 5 months old, even returning to
    Bangladesh  for  a  short  time  (the  majority  of  applications  were
    processed within three months) to make an entry  clearance  application
    would be a disproportionate interference with  the  Appellant's  family
    life.

8.   The Respondent appealed against that decision arguing that the  witness
    statements she relied upon when read in conjunction  with  one  another
    detailed extensively  the  investigation  undertaken  by  ETS  in  this
    Appellant's case along with thousands of other applicants.   The  Judge
    had given inadequate reasons for rejecting the  Respondent's  evidence.
    Further the Appellant and his representative had failed in  their  duty
    to the Tribunal  by  failing  to  disclose  the  fact  that  there  was
    objective evidence available which revealed  that  Colwill  College  in
    Leicester was the subject of a criminal enquiry because of the cheating
    that took place there, that this necessarily undermined the  favourable
    findings of Article 8.

9.   Permission to appeal was refused by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Saffer on 3rd December 2015 who said that  the  Respondent  was  merely
    disagreeing with the Judge's findings on the three witness  statements.
    There was no evidence  to  support  the  allegation  of  dishonesty  at
    Colwill College in the three generic  witness  statements,  a  document
    regarding the investigation into Colwill College  was  not  before  the
    Judge at first instance.

10.  The Respondent renewed her application for permission to  appeal  which
    came before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Archer on  25th  January  2016.
    In granting permission to appeal he wrote  that  it  was  arguable  the
    Judge had  failed  to  correctly  apply  the  case  of  Gazi  and  gave
    inadequate weight to the generic evidence of the use of a  proxy  test-
    taker.  The Judge had arguably failed to consider the spreadsheet which
    confirmed  that  the  Appellant's  case  was  individually  considered.
    Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds though  there  appeared
    to be no substantive challenge to the finding that  the  Appellant  was
    entitled to a grant of leave under  paragraph  276ADE  and  that  issue
    might need further exploring at the hearing.

11.  The Respondent's appeal came before  me  on  14th  March  2016  when  I
    adjourned the matter to the first available date to await  the  outcome
    of a pending Upper Tribunal decision of the President.   That  decision
    is now reported as SM [2016] UKUT 00229.  At the resumed hearing before
    me both parties had a copy of the decision.  The headnote to SM states:

    (i)  The Secretary  of  State's  generic  evidence  combined  with  her
         evidence particular to these two Appellants sufficed  to  discharge
         the evidential burden of proving that their TOEIC certificates  had
         been procured by dishonesty.

    (ii) However given the  multiple  frailties  from  which  this  generic
         evidence was considered to suffer and in the light of the  evidence
         adduced by  the  Appellants,  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to
         discharge the legal burden of proving dishonesty on their part.

12.  For the Respondent it was argued before  me  that  the  Respondent  had
    discharged the burden of proof as could be seen  from  the  spreadsheet
    entry.  It was clear from SM that the evidence of  the  Respondent  did
    discharge the burden of proof.  Judge Price appeared to be saying  that
    anything  less  than  100%  accuracy  meant  that  the   evidence   was
    insufficient but that was wrong in law.  There was information  in  the
    public domain about Colwill College which had a high  invalidity  rate.
    As to paragraph 276ADE one could not satisfy that paragraph if one  did
    not meet the suitability criteria which this appellant did not  because
    of the alleged deception.  There was a need for  oral  evidence  to  be
    given taking into account two further documents  which  the  Respondent
    wished to rely on, including a report from Dr French who  had  reviewed
    the evidence before the Tribunal in SM.

13.  For the Appellant reliance was placed on the  decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  There  was  no  nexus  between  the  extract  from  the
    spreadsheet referring to invalidity and the generic statements  of  the
    Respondent's witnesses.  Dishonesty  had  to  be  proved  to  a  higher
    standard  with  the  burden  on  the   Respondent.    The   Article   8
    circumstances of the Appellant  were  now  different.   His  child  had
    medical  difficulties  which  were  shown  in  a  statement   submitted
    subsequent to the First Tier hearing.

14.  There was a difficulty for the Respondent in  that  S-LTR.2.2  referred
    to false documents being submitted in  the  instant  application.   The
    Appellant had passed the English test some time before this application
    which is the subject matter of the appeal.  Subsequently the  Appellant
    obtained  an  English  language  qualification  from  Trinity  College,
    London.  Thus the question mark over the English  language  certificate
    did not relate to the application under  appeal.   If  it  was  not  in
    relation to this application the Appellant was in a different category.
     This was a case where the Judge had taken  all  the  evidence  in  the
    round and  considered  the  matter  in  some  detail.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal who had refused permission to appeal said that the Home Office
    grounds were just a disagreement and that was correct.

15.  In reply the Respondent argued that the statements did take the  First-
    tier through the process of how a decision was arrived at.  The Judge's
    decision under paragraph 276ADE was challenged in the grounds of onward
    appeal.  This appeal would have to be decided outside  the  Immigration
    Rules under Article 8 if the Appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    suitability requirements.  The Appellant's spouse had not been  present
    at the last hearing and it was difficult  to  see  how  the  Judge  had
    arrived at his decision that this was a genuine and subsisting marriage
    without hearing from her.  The Appellant's solicitor replied  that  she
    had not been present because she had needed to stay at home to care for
    the couple's child.  She was, however, present today.

Findings

16.  There are two arguments in this case put  forward  by  the  Respondent.
    The first is that the Judge has failed  to  deal  adequately  with  the
    generic evidence simply dismissing it out of hand.  It  is  clear  from
    the decision of SM that the Respondent's generic evidence is sufficient
    to discharge the evidential burden of proving that the certificate  had
    been  procured  by  dishonesty.   The  Judge  at  first  instance  was,
    therefore, wrong in law to conclude that  they  did  not.   There  are,
    however, difficulties with the generic evidence and in the case of  SM,
    having heard other evidence from the  Appellants,  the  Upper  Tribunal
    were able to find that the particular Appellants  in  the  case  before
    them had not been involved in proxy test-taking.  Such further evidence
    was not before the Judge or at any rate not considered by  him  in  the
    instant determination before me and the rejection,  therefore,  of  the
    Respondent's evidence was an error of law.

17.  The Appellant argues that even if  that  is  the  case  that  is  still
    irrelevant to the issue because the objection taken by  the  Respondent
    to the Appellant's application for leave to remain as the dependant  of
    his wife was based on evidence submitted  in  relation  to  an  earlier
    application and not this application.  That in my view is based  on  an
    incorrect reading  of  S-LTR.2.2  which  refers  to  false  information
    submitted to any person to obtain a document used  in  support  of  the
    application.   If  the  Respondent's  case  is  correct  the  Appellant
    submitted false information to the Respondent on 21st  August  2012  to
    obtain leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.   That  grant  of
    leave was then used as the basis of the application for leave to remain
    as a dependant (the refusal of which has  given  rise  to  the  present
    proceedings). If the Appellant had  had  no  leave,  under  Tier  4  or
    otherwise, he would not have been able to  submit  the  application  he
    made in 2014. The Respondent is correct that the Appellant's ability to
    meet the suitability requirements in the  2014  application  ultimately
    depend on the validity or otherwise of the 2012 certificate of  English
    language.

18.  It follows that any assessment of Article 8, whether  under  the  Rules
    or outside them, must inevitably be affected by whether  the  Appellant
    meets the suitability requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  If  the
    certificate  was  awarded  wrongly  as  the  Respondent  contends   the
    Appellant falls foul potentially of the  suitability  requirements  and
    cannot succeed under paragraph  276ADE.   I  therefore  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal in its entirety with no findings of
    fact preserved for this appeal to be re-heard.  I  give  leave  to  the
    Respondent to file and serve the report of Professor French dated  20th
    April 2016 and the Home Office report of Project Facade,  the  criminal
    enquiry into Colwill College, Leicester.  I  also  give  leave  to  the
    Appellant to produce the statement of M A,  29th  April  2016  and  the
    correspondence regarding M's medical condition.   It  is  open  to  the
    Appellant and his spouse to file and serve any further statements  they
    wish  to  rely  upon  including:  any  further  medical  evidence;  the
    circumstances in which the English language  test  was  taken  and  the
    difficulties or otherwise  which  might  be  caused  by  the  Appellant
    returning to Bangladesh to make an application for entry clearance from
    there.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  The appeal will be re-heard on a  date  to  be
fixed when the Appellant and his spouse can give oral testimony.  A  Bengali
interpreter will be required on the next occasion.

I make no anonymity direction as there is no public  policy  reason  for  so
doing.
