                           DECISION AND Directions


Introduction and background facts:


 1. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cockrill who, following  a
    hearing on 9 January 2017, allowed the appeal of Mr Wiatrek  (hereafter
    the "claimant"), a national of Poland born on 2 July  1976,  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of  State  of  2  February  2016  to  make  a
    deportation order against  him  on  the  ground  of  public  policy  in
    accordance with regulation 19(3) and regulation 21 of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area`) Regulations 2006 (the "EEA Regulations").

 2. The claimant claimed to have arrived in the UK in 2004.  There  was  no
    specific evidence to confirm the actual date  of  entry.  He  has  been
    convicted of the following offences:

    i)      On 7 April 2003, prior to his arrival in the United Kingdom, he
        was convicted  in  Poland  of  offences  relating  to  the  illegal
        trafficking of narcotics, possession  of  firearms  and  ammunition
        without the required licence and concealment of documents.  He  was
        sentenced  to  a  total  of  4  years'  imprisonment.  He  spent  a
        significant period of time in prison but had an outstanding  period
        of 2 years 9 months and 3 days left to serve.

    ii)     In the United Kingdom, he has been convicted of  the  following
        offences:

            a)   In October 2006, he was brought before Ashford Magistrates
             Court for an offence of fraudulently using a  vehicle  licence.
             He was fined �150 and ordered to pay �35 in costs. This offence
             related to the  use  of  a  Road  Fund  Licence  that  was  not
             attributable to the relevant vehicle.

            b)   On 26 March 2012, he appeared before Isleworth Crown Court
             and was convicted  of  possessing,  controlling  or  improperly
             obtaining an identity document belonging  to  someone  else.  A
             sentence of 4 months' imprisonment,  wholly  suspended  for  12
             months, with a 4-week curfew requirement was  imposed.  He  was
             also ordered to pay costs of �85.

 3. In her decision letter, the Secretary of State contended,  inter  alia,
    that the claimant had not provided documentary  evidence  to  establish
    the length of his residence in the United Kingdom,  he  had  not  shown
    that he had exercised  Treaty  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    continuous period of 5 years and therefore had not shown  that  he  had
    acquired a  permanent  right  of  residence.  The  Secretary  of  State
    highlighted the lack of documentation produced by the claimant to  show
    both presence in the United Kingdom and working in the United  Kingdom.
    The Secretary of State drew the conclusion, with reference to the three
    levels of protection afforded to EEA  nationals  under  regulation  19,
    that the lowest level of protection  was  relevant  in  the  claimant's
    case.

The claimant's late submission of documents

 4. This case was listed for case management review on 5 July 2016  when  a
    Designated Judge directed that  the  case  be  listed  for  substantive
    hearing on a  suitable  date  after  10  October  2016.  The  case  was
    subsequently listed for 14 October 2016. Directions were given for  the
    Secretary of State and the claimant to file and serve their evidence in
    advance of that hearing. The hearing on 14 October 2016 was  adjourned,
    on  the  claimant's  application,  on  the  ground  that  the  forensic
    psychologist who had been identified at that point was going to  charge
    too much and an alternative had been found who could prepare the report
    by the end of November 2016.

 5. The Secretary of State's representative at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Cockrill, Mr M Lowton, received  two  bundles  of  documents  from  the
    claimant on Friday 6 January 2017. This was the last working day  prior
    to the hearing taking place on Monday 9 January. The  principal  bundle
    was described by the judge as a substantial bundle  of  documents  that
    ran to about 1,800 pages. There was a supplementary  bundle  which  the
    judge described as much smaller. The claimant said at the hearing  that
    he had given the documents to his solicitor in October 2016.

 6. I have examined the bundles of documents. It is evident that there were
    a large number of documents that were potentially relevant to the issue
    of residence. There were many invoices  for  work  on  a  self-employed
    basis said to have been carried out by the  claimant  over  the  years,
    tenancy agreements going back to 2004 and information submitted  to  HM
    Revenue  &  Customs  that  included  self-assessment   statements   and
    calculations spanning the period January 2005 to 2016 as well  as  bank
    statements. The documents were photocopies.

 7. The grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  state  that  Mr  Lowton
    undertook to verify the documents. Mr Fripp did  not  take  issue  with
    this at the hearing before me.

 8. Paras 15 and 16 of the judge's decision indicate that Mr  Lowton  first
    requested that these documents be excluded. This  was  refused  by  the
    judge. Mr. Lowton then asked for the hearing to be adjourned. This  was
    also refused by the judge. The judge said that he then gave  Mr  Lowton
    "an appropriate opportunity to  prepare  the  matter  further"  but  Mr
    Lowton did not consider that that was necessary. The relevant  part  of
    the decision of the judge is para 17, where the judge said as follows:

                 "It seemed to me that, looking at the  matter  overall  and
             keeping very much at the forefront of my  mind  the  overriding
             objective, and  the  overall  period  of  time  that  had  been
             available  to  both  the  [claimant's]   solicitors   and   the
             [Secretary of State]  to  prepare  their  respective  cases,  I
             considered that this bundle was not quite as daunting as  would
             appear at first sight. The [Secretary of State] made the  point
             that originals had not been produced but, notwithstanding  that
             state of affairs, I considered that the interests  of  fairness
             were plainly that the matter ought to  proceed  before  me  and
             that I would make an  assessment  of  the  evidence  which  was
             presented to me on 9 January 201 and make findings of  fact  in
             relation to  the  appropriate  level  of  protection  for  this
             [claimant]. It was  plainly  a  failure  on  the  part  of  the
             [claimant's] solicitors to file this large amount  of  material
             so late and I was told, by way of  excuse  for  that  state  of
             affairs, that the fee earner  concerned  had  been  unwell  and
             under pressure. Looking at the overall circumstances, I refused
             the  adjournment  and  afforded  Mr   Lowton   an   appropriate
             opportunity to prepare the matter further. He did not  consider
             that that was necessary and basically no specific  points  were
             going to be taken upon the papers now to be relied upon by  the
             claimant. The point was repeated that they were  not  originals
             and the respondent was not going to engage with that material."

 9. During the course of the hearing, the judge permitted another  document
    to be submitted.  This  was  a  letter  from  a  company  of  purported
    accountants, Atena Accounting Services Ltd.  Para  29  of  the  judge's
    decision states that Mr Lowton criticised the terms of this  letter  by
    saying that there was no company registration and no  VAT  registration
    on the letter-heading.

10. The judge considered the documents that were before him.  He  said,  at
    para 32:

            "The [claimant] brings an appeal against this  decision  of  the
             Secretary  of  State  taken  on  2  February  2016  to  make  a
             Deportation Order against him. I have set out  in  some  detail
             the specific requirements contained in  Regulation  21  of  the
             2006 Regulations. I think it is vital, first of all, to make an
             assessment and finding as to what is the appropriate  level  of
             protection that needs to be afforded to this [claimant],  given
             that he is an EEA national.  The highest  level  of  protection
             follows when an EEA national has resided in this country for  a
             continuous period of at least ten years prior to  the  relevant
             decision. We know that the relevant decision  was  taken  on  2
             February 2016 and so, in the first place, it is a  question  of
             going back in time from that date to see  whether  or  not  the
             [claimant] has indeed been residing here. That, of course, is a
             question of fact. I have been provided with a very  large  body
             of  material  and  that  was,  for  practical  purposes,   only
             presented to me at Hendon Magistrates' Court and only  came  to
             the attention  of  the  [Secretary  of  State]  on  the  Friday
             preceding the appeal hearing. The  documents  were  photocopies
             and I did not see originals.  The solicitor that had conduct of
             this case is from a highly respectable  firm  and  I  heard  an
             explanation and excuse for why these  bundles  were  served  so
             late on both the Tribunal and the Respondent.  I accepted  them
             in evidence as I have already  explained  but,  unquestionably,
             they were served late  and  that  is  not  creditable.  I  have
             thought carefully as to whether or not the copy documents  that
             I have seen, which as has been  stressed  ran  to  about  1,800
             pages, form what could be described  as  a  fiction  or  really
             whether they are copies that  have  been  taken  from  original
             documents that were placed in the solicitor's hands  and  which
             serve to show principally that the [claimant] has  been  living
             in this country, as he has claimed, since 2004. I conclude that
             the latter is the likely position,  that  it  really  would  be
             wholly  incredible,  it  seems  to  me,  for  this  wealth   of
             information to have been manufactured in some manner.  That  is
             simply not feasible, as I see it. By way of example,  the  bank
             statements that have been supplied by Barclays are in,  what  I
             might term, the original form, and that does speak  volumes  to
             me then about  the  reliability  of  the  information  that  is
             produced. Putting the matter  slightly  differently,  they  are
             photocopies of what are clearly Barclays  Bank  statements  and
             not some later printout  from  Barclays  of  the  state  of  an
             account."

            (My emphasis)

11. At paras 33 and 34, he said:

            "33. ... the overall conclusion I draw, looking at the  totality
             of the material, is  that  the  [claimant]  has  been  in  this
             country, residing here, for more than ten years  prior  to  the
             date of decision.

            34.  If, for any reason, that is incorrect as an analysis,  then
             what has been shown, again by reference to the substantial body
             of  material  supplied,  is  that  the  [claimant]   has   been
             exercising Treaty Rights for a period in excess of  five  years
             continuously and, accordingly, he  would  be  entitled  to  the
             intermediate  level  of  protection  afforded   by   the   2006
             Regulations being entitled to a permanent right  of  residence.
             That would mean, then, that the test would be serious  grounds.
             I make plain that my primary finding is that imperative grounds
             are the relevant test. What is clear to me, though, is that  it
             really cannot be said that the lowest level  of  protection  is
             the appropriate one and that was the position contended for  by
             the [Secretary of State]."

            (My emphasis)

12. At para 35 onwards, the judge considered whether the circumstances were
    such that the claimant could be removed on imperative grounds of public
    security. He considered the offences committed in Poland. He said  that
    the offences committed in the United Kingdom did not approach the level
    of criminality as the offences committed in Poland. He  considered  the
    claimant's explanation for the offence committed in 2012, i.e. that  he
    was embarrassed at disclosing  his  true  identity  to  girlfriends  or
    potential girlfriends, and  rejected  it  as  lacking  in  credibility.
    Nevertheless, he considered that the sentence of 4 month's imprisonment
    wholly suspended for 12 months acted as a  "proper  barometer"  of  the
    gravity of the offence. At the end of para 37, he said:

             "It  seems  to  me  that  those  offences,   when   looked   at
             individually and collectively, cannot, as I see it, add up to a
             state of affairs where the conduct of this [claimant], and that
             is the critical feature, the conduct of this  [claimant]  could
             come anywhere near reaching that highest  level  of  imperative
             grounds of public security. I do not think that it comes close,
             then, to reaching the intermediate level of serious grounds  of
             public policy or public security. Miss Asanovic  said  that  it
             would be straining the matter, in effect, to be trying  to  say
             that he had even reached the  lowest  level  of  simple  public
             policy or public security."

13. At para 42, the judge said:

      "My overall assessment of this [claimant], and I come to this  in  the
             light of all the material that has been  provided  to  me,  and
             having listened to the [claimant] give his  oral  evidence,  is
             that his personal conduct does not represent a genuine, present
             and  sufficiently  serious  threat   affecting   one   of   the
             fundamental interests of society. The  situation  is  that  his
             deportation to Poland would not be consistent with  the  proper
             application of the principle of proportionality. The test  that
             I consider  is  the  relevant  one  is  the  highest  level  of
             protection, namely a relevant decision may not be taken  except
             on imperative  grounds  of  public  security,  because  he  has
             resided here for a continuous period  of  at  least  ten  years
             prior to the relevant decision. Alternatively, if  it  is  only
             the intermediate level of protection that is  afforded  to  the
             [claimant], then the test would be one of  serious  grounds  of
             public policy or public security and for all the reasons I have
             expressed the [claimant's] criminality, his misconduct, is  not
             of sufficient gravity, at  a  sufficient  level,  he  does  not
             represent such a risk  that  those  tests  could  sensibly  and
             properly be said to be met in my judgment."

14. It is therefore clear that the judge's primary  finding  was  that  the
    claimant was entitled to  the  highest  level  of  protection.  In  the
    alternative, that he was entitled to the medium  level  of  protection.
    The judge said that what was clear to him was that it could not  really
    be said that the lowest level of protection  was  the  appropriate  one
    (para 34).

15. It is also clear that, in reaching these  findings,  the  judge  relied
    upon his assessment of the two bundles of  documents  received  by  the
    Secretary of State one working day prior to the  hearing  day.  He  may
    also have relied upon the document submitted during the course  of  the
    hearing that  was  purportedly  from  Atena  Accounting  Services  Ltd,
    although there  was  no  direct  reference  to  this  document  in  his
    assessment from para 32 onwards.

The grounds

16. The Secretary of State's grounds maybe distilled into five arguments as
    follows:

    i)      As a matter of fairness, the Secretary of  State's  adjournment
        request was wrongly refused despite an undertaking by the Secretary
        of State's senior case worker that she would  seek  to  verify  the
        documents. The claimant  had  obtained  an  unfair  advantage.  His
        solicitors had received the documents in October 2016.  Given  that
        the claimant had previous convictions  regarding  false  documents,
        the adjournment  request  should  have  been  granted  due  to  the
        potential impact of the documents as there was  no  opportunity  to
        seek verification.

    ii)     The judge erred in permitting the claimant  to  rely  upon  the
        letter  said  to  be  Atena  Accounting  Services   Ltd.   In   the
        alternative, the judge should have adjourned the hearing  to  allow
        the Secretary of State to verify the contents of the document.

    iii)    The judge erred in his approach in assessing the documents.  At
        para 32, he said that "it really would be wholly incredible ... for
        this wealth of  information  to  have  been  manufactured  in  some
        manner" and that this was "simply not feasible". In  reaching  this
        conclusion, the judge failed to address the fact that the  claimant
        had previously used false documents,  that  he  had  only  provided
        copies of the documents and that the documents  had  been  provided
        late. The judge failed to consider the use of modern computers  and
        photocopies  to  produce  multiple  copies.  The  judge  failed  to
        consider the lengths to which  those  facing  expulsion/deportation
        will go in order to remain in the UK and fell into the trap of what
        he believed was reasonable.

    iv)     The judge failed to consider the reliability of  the  documents
        in line with the guidance in Tanveer Ahmed v. SSHD *  [2002]  UKIAT
        00439, in that,  he  failed  to  reconcile  the  apparent  conflict
        between his acceptance of the  documentary  evidence  and  that  he
        found  at  para  37  that  the  claimant's  explanation  of  events
        incredible. He failed to explain why he accepted the documents.

    v)      Even if the judge  was  correct  in  his  assessment  that  the
        claimant was entitled to the highest level of protection, he failed
        to  deal  with  the  authority  of  Land  of  Baden-W�rttemberg   v
        Panagiotis Tsakouridis (23 November 2010, C-145/09).

Submissions

17. Mr Fripp  submitted  a  skeleton  argument  immediately  prior  to  the
    commencement of the hearing before me. The skeleton argument  contends,
    inter alia, that although it was unfortunate that  a  large  volume  of
    documents was served late, the Secretary of State  had  to  demonstrate
    both an error of law and that such an error was material. There was  no
    material unfairness. The refusal to adjourn was balanced by an offer to
    the Secretary of State's representative of  extra  time  to  allow  for
    preparation and examination  of  the  documents,  an  offer  which  was
    declined. The skeleton  argument  suggests  that  it  was  likely  that
    several hours could have  been  made  available  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's representative to examine the documents  and  prepare  for  the
    hearing.  It  was  not  rational   for   the   Secretary   of   State's
    representative not to engage with the documents. If  the  Secretary  of
    State's  representative  had  attempted  to   address   the   documents
    constructively but was unable to do so, a renewed  application  for  an
    adjournment could have been  made.  The  Secretary  of  State  has  not
    conducted verification checks in the period of 4  �  months  that  have
    elapsed since the hearing took place  on  9  January  2017.  There  was
    therefore  no  evidence  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  suffered
    injustice. The absence of such  evidence  or  any  apparent  effort  to
    verify the documents is relevant to the question whether  there  was  a
    material error of law.

18. Mr Staunton took me  through  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds.  In
    response to the suggestion in the skeleton argument that the judge  had
    offered the Secretary of State's representative extra time to  prepare,
    he submitted that this was an all-or-nothing situation given the  large
    number of documents. Furthermore, the Secretary of State would not have
    been able to verify  the  documents.  In  relation  to  the  fact  that
    Secretary of State had not verified the documents in the period of 4  �
    months since the hearing before the judge, Mr Staunton  submitted  that
    the resources of government departments are stretched and  steps  would
    not be taken to verify the documents until  it  is  known  whether  the
    appeal would be remitted for a re-hearing.

19. In response, Mr Fripp submitted that the judge was plainly  unimpressed
    by the explanation for the  late  service  of  the  documents.  He  had
    considered the overriding objective. The ultimate question was  one  of
    fairness. There was  no  unfairness  in  continuing  with  the  hearing
    subject to the Secretary of State's representative being allowed  extra
    time  to  prepare  for  the  hearing.  The  question  of  fairness  was
    ultimately one for the judge, subject to consideration on appeal.

20. Mr Fripp submitted that there was no material unfairness given that:

    i)      The Secretary of State's representative had been offered  extra
        time to prepare.

    ii)     No attempt had  been  made  to  call  the  relevant  banks  and
        government departments on the hearing day.

    iii)    No attempt had been made to explore  the  viability  of  making
        such calls.

    iv)     The Secretary of State had therefore failed in her  duty  under
        rule  2(4)  of  the  Tribunal   Procedure   (First-tier   Tribunal)
        (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 (the "FtT Rules") to co-
        operate with the Tribunal.

    v)      The Secretary of State has done nothing in the period  of  4  �
        months since the hearing in January 2017 to verify the documents.

21. I asked Mr Fripp to address me on the question whether the Secretary of
    State had effectively been denied the opportunity of  participating  in
    any meaningful way in the hearing. Mr Fripp submitted that the question
    was whether any error was material. It had  not  been  shown  that  the
    Secretary of State had  been  denied  the  opportunity  to  investigate
    anything material.

22. Mr Fripp asked me to note  that  the  judge's  decision  was  good  and
    detailed. He took  into  account  that  the  claimant  had  used  false
    documents previously and there was nothing to show that the  judge  was
    unaware of the possible use of computers to produce multiple documents.



23. Mr Fripp submitted that the final ground, in reliance upon Tsakouridis,
    was no more than a disagreement.

24. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

25. As I have said at para 14 above, it is clear that the  judge's  primary
    finding was that the claimant was entitled  to  the  highest  level  of
    protection and that, in the alternative, he was entitled to the  medium
    level of protection. The judge said that what was clear to him was that
    it could not really be said that the lowest level of protection was the
    appropriate one (para 34).  In other words, he rejected  the  Secretary
    of State's position, as stated in her refusal letter,  that  given  the
    lack of documentary evidence to establish both residence and  that  the
    claimant had been exercising Treaty rights, the  appropriate  level  of
    protection was the lowest level.

26. I have also said at para 15 above that, in reaching his findings on the
    level of protection, the judge relied upon his assessment  of  the  two
    bundles of documents received by the Secretary of State one working day
    prior to the hearing day. As I said, he may also have relied  upon  the
    document  submitted  during  the  course  of  the  hearing   that   was
    purportedly from Atena Accounting Services Ltd.

27. At my para 10 above, I emboldened  part  of  para  32  of  the  judge's
    decision. In my judgement, it is plain from this part  of  the  judge's
    decision that his findings as to the appropriate  level  of  protection
    were based on his view that it was simply not feasible for this  wealth
    of information to have been manufactured. Although he went on to  state
    that "By way of example, the bank statements that have been supplied by
    Barclays are in, what I might term, the original form,  and  that  does
    speak volumes to me then about the reliability of the information  that
    is produced", it is accepted that the judge did not have  any  original
    documents. Thus, what the judge was saying, in the sentence I have just
    quoted, is that the copies of the Barclays bank  statements  look  like
    what one would expect original bank statements to look  like  and  this
    fact "spoke volumes .... about the reliability" of the contents of  the
    documents.

28. I make the following points. Firstly, it is plain from para 32  of  the
    judge's decision, that his findings as  to  the  appropriate  level  of
    protection was based entirely on his view,  for  the  reasons  he  gave
    (i.e. that it  was  simply  not  feasible  for  the  claimant  to  have
    manufactured so many  documents  and  that,  by  way  of  example,  the
    Barclays banks statements look like original Barclays bank  statements)
    that the documents were either genuine documents or copies  of  genuine
    documents.

29. However, this was  the  very  reason  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative requested an adjournment, so that the documents could be
    verified.  In  effect,  therefore,  the  judge  refused  to  allow  the
    Secretary of State an opportunity to verify the documents but proceeded
    to make findings that turned on that very issue.

30. Secondly, the judge took an overly simplistic view.  If  an  individual
    were to embark upon producing false bank statements, it is likely  that
    he or she would try their  hardest  to  make  them  look  like  genuine
    statements from the bank in question in the knowledge that their  fraud
    would be readily discovered if they did not produce documents that look
    like the real article. Therefore, the point the judge made was in  fact
    an empty one. Furthermore, as the grounds correctly state, it is simply
    not correct to state that the production of a large number of documents
    is simply not feasible, given modern technology.  What  the  judge  was
    required to do was to consider the contents of the documents and decide
    whether they demonstrate that the  documents  were  copies  of  genuine
    documents, which he plainly did not do.

31. Thirdly, in the absence of an opportunity to verify the documents,  the
    only remaining option left to the Secretary of  State's  representative
    was to explore the reliability of the documents by cross-examining  the
    claimant on them. Mr Fripp relied upon the  fact  that  the  judge  had
    offered Mr Lowton extra time to  prepare  for  the  hearing.  Mr  Fripp
    submitted that several hours could have been made  available.  However,
    it is usually the case that the Secretary of  State  arranges  for  one
    representative to appear on her behalf in connection with  all  of  the
    cases in a particular statutory appeal list. In my  own  experience  of
    sitting full-time over many years, an adjournment of several hours  for
    a presenting officer to examine the  documents  in  one  case  is  very
    likely to impact upon the time available not only for hearing that case
    but also for  hearing the remaining cases in the list. Accordingly, the
    reality is that it is very unlikely that Mr Lowton was offered  several
    hours.

32. Given the large number of documents, one working day (on the assumption
    that the whole of the working day before the hearing had been available
    to the Secretary of State's representative upon receipt of the  bundle)
    did not  provide,  on  any  reasonable  view,  a  sufficient  and  fair
    opportunity to the Secretary of State's representative to  examine  the
    documents and prepare for the hearing even if he or she decided to take
    no steps to verify their authenticity.

33. For the reasons given at paras 31 and 32 above, the option of exploring
    the reliability of the documents by  cross-examining  the  claimant  on
    them was effectively denied to the Secretary of State's representative.
    I agree that the claimant did obtain an unfair advantage by  submitting
    his bundle of documents so late.

34. It is therefore entirely unsurprising that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative declined the opportunity the judge gave him "to  prepare
    the matter further" and said that no specific  points  would  be  taken
    upon them. Once the judge had delivered his decision,  the  matter  was
    best dealt with on appeal in the event the appeal was allowed.

35. Mr Fripp submitted that it  was  not  rational  for  the  Secretary  of
    State's representative to refuse to engage with the documents and  that
    she had failed in her duty to co-operate with the Tribunal. However, it
    is very clear to me that it is the claimant,  through  his  solicitors,
    who failed to comply with his duty to co-operate  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by submitting his documents on a timely  basis.  There  is  no
    substance in the argument that the Secretary of State's  representative
    irrationally refused to engage with the documents.

36. I reject Mr Fripp's  submission  as  wholly  unrealistic  that  it  was
    possible for the Secretary of State's to have made telephone  calls  on
    the hearing day itself to the bank and government departments.

37. The fact that the claimant had successfully obtained an adjournment  of
    a previous hearing in order that he  could  obtain  a  report  from  an
    alternative  forensic  psychologist  (my  para  4  above)  whilst   the
    Secretary of State's request for an  adjournment  in  order  to  verify
    documents produced at the eleventh hour notwithstanding  that  she  had
    raised the fact that he had not produced documentary  evidence  in  her
    decision  letter  and  that  the  claimant's  solicitors  had  had  the
    documents from October  2016  leads  me  to  the  conclusion  that  the
    proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal in relation to  this  case  were
    entirely one-sided and unfair.

38. In effect, and for all of the reasons given  above,  the  Secretary  of
    State was unable to participate in any meaningful way  at  the  hearing
    before the judge. The hearing was therefore unfair. This is  sufficient
    for me to set aside the decision of the judge in its entirety. I do not
    consider it necessary for me to deal with Mr  Fripp's  submission  that
    the Secretary of State's failure to conduct any verification checks  in
    the period of 4 � months since the hearing before the judge means  that
    she is unable to demonstrate that she had suffered injustice.  However,
    even if I am wrong about this, Mr Fripp's submission ignores  the  fact
    that  government  departments  are  overstretched  and   have   limited
    resources,

39. For all of the reasons given above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge
    materially erred in law, in that,  his  refusal  of  the  Secretary  of
    State's adjournment request led to the hearing before him being unfair.
    The Secretary of State was effectively unable  to  participate  in  any
    meaningful way in the hearing.

40. I therefore set aside the decision of the judge in its entirety.

41. It is not necessary for me to consider the remaining grounds.

42. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision  will  be  able  to  re-make  the  relevant  decision  itself.
    However, the Practice Statement for the Immigration and Asylum  Chamber
    of the Upper Tribunal at  para  7.2  recognises  that  it  may  not  be
    possible for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when
    it is satisfied that:

         "(a)     the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
             the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity
             for that party's case to be put to and considered by the First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)      the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

43. In my judgement, this case  falls  within  para  7.2(b).  In  addition,
    having regard to the Court of Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo) &  Others
    [2012] EWCA Civ 327, I am of the view that a remittal to the First-tier
    Tribunal for a re-hearing on the merits on  all  issues  is  the  right
    course of action. Mr Fripp and Mr Staunton agreed that, if I found that
    the judge had materially erred in law, the appropriate course of action
    would be to remit this case for a re-hearing on the merits  by  another
    judge.

44. The claimant submitted a large bundle  of  documents  for  the  hearing
    before me. I was told that this contained original documents. I  record
    that the entire bundle was returned to Mr Fripp so that he  could  make
    it available for the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  the
    event of a remittal.

Decision

The decision of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Cockrill  involved  the
making of errors on points of law such that his decision  is  set  aside  in
its entirety.

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for that  Tribunal  to  re-
make the decision on the appellant's appeal on the merits on all  issues  by
a judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cockrill.
