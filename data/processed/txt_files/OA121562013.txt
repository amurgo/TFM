                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:  Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Ms H Gore, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant in the Upper Tribunal is the entry clearance  officer
         (ECO). The respondent in the Upper Tribunal, Mr St George Anderson,
         is referred to hereafter as the  claimant.  He  was  born  on  17th
         November 1976 and is a citizen of  Jamaica.  The  ECO  was  granted
         permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal against the decision  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen (the Judge) who, in a determination
         promulgated on 23rd June 2014, allowed the claimant's appeal  under
         the Immigration Rules against the  ECO's  decision  to  refuse  his
         application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse
         of the sponsor, Mrs Wendy Davis,  a  British  citizen.   The  ECO's
         decision was made on 4th June 2013 and was upheld on  review  after
         consideration of the  grounds  of  appeal  by  an  entry  clearance
         manager (ECM) on 12th November 2013.


      2. After a hearing before me on 3rd September  2014  attended  by  the
         sponsor, when the claimant was not  represented,  I  was  satisfied
         that the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved
         the making of an error on a point  of  law  and  I  set  aside  the
         decision.  The matter was adjourned for the decision to  be  remade
         at a continuation hearing before  me  today  because  the  claimant
         wished to renew  his  legal  representation  and  to  consider  the
         submission of further evidence.


      3. The sponsor appeared again at the resumed hearing and the  claimant
         was represented by Ms H Gore, counsel, who also had conduct of  the
         case before the First-tier Tribunal Judge. I  heard  oral  evidence
         from the sponsor and submissions on behalf of both parties  at  the
         end of which I  reserved  my  decision  which  is  now  given  with
         reasons.


      4. Under the Immigration Rules the burden of proof is on the  claimant
         and  the  standard  of  proof  required  is  on  the   balance   of
         probabilities. The appeal must be determined on  the  circumstances
         appertaining at the date of the decision to refuse.

      5. Article 8 of the ECHR provides that:
             1. Everyone has the right  to  respect  for  his  private  and
             family life, his home and his correspondence.
             2. There shall be no interference by a public  authority  with
             the exercise of this right except such  as  is  in  accordance
             with the law and is necessary in a democratic society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

      6. The burden of proof in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR lies  with
         the claimant.  He must prove on the balance of  probabilities  that
         private or family life is established and will be  interfered  with
         as a result of the ECO's decision.   Once he has  established  that
         he enjoys this protected right which is threatened  with  violation
         the burden shifts to the ECO  to  show  that  the  interference  is
         lawful and in pursuit of a legitimate aim.  The ECO must show  that
         the violation is justified and that it does not  impair  the  right
         any  more  than  is  necessary;  in  other   words,   whether   the
         interference is proportionate.


      7. The genuine and subsisting relationship between  the  claimant  and
         sponsor is no longer challenged; it has  been  conceded  and  I  am
         satisfied that this is consistent with the evidence.  The  claimant
         and sponsor married in Jamaica on 31st August 2012.  The  issue  in
         the appeal is whether the financial requirements of the Immigration
         Rules are met.  The claimant made his  application  on  15th  March
         2013 and needs to show that the sponsor has a minimum gross  income
         of �18,600 per annum.


      8. The evidence before the ECO was that the sponsor was in receipt  of
         a student loan and grant  from  Student  Finance  England  for  the
         2012/2013 academic year. She was in receipt from this source  of  a
         total of �17,128.94 which  consisted  of  �6,855.00  by  way  of  a
         maintenance loan and  grants  of  �10,273.94.  However,  under  the
         Immigration Rules the student loan of �6,855.00 could not be  taken
         into account.  The necessary specified evidence was  not  submitted
         for the payments  of  the  sponsor's  grant;  her  bank  statements
         showing this income were not submitted.


      9. Reliance was also placed on rental income received by  the  sponsor
         from property owned by her mother,  but  without  evidence  of  the
         property or the  sponsor's  entitlement  to  the  rent.  HSBC  bank
         statements submitted in the name of Wendy Davis and Ismay  Ferguson
         showed entries described as rent but the ECO found  no  independent
         evidence that the sponsor had declared rental income to HMRC or  to
         Student Finance England as additional income; the latter  calculate
         grant entitlement from household income.


     10.  Savings held by the sponsor had not been held, as required by  the
         Rules, continuously for the past 6 months at the date  of  decision
         and were excluded by the ECO.  The calculation of savings needed is
         not challenged as follows.  The sponsor relied  upon  �6,692.43  by
         way of savings, which added to the income from grants of �10,273.94
         makes �16,966.37.   In  order  to  qualify  �20,084.00  is  needed:
         �18,600 - �16,966.37 = a shortfall of �1,633.36.  The shortfall  of
         �1,633.36 x 2.5 + �16,000 = �20,084.00, namely the required amount.
         The application was refused under Appendix FM.


     11. Ms Gore stated at the outset of the hearing to remake the  decision
         that the claimant's case is now put  on  the  basis  of  gifts  and
         savings.  She called the sponsor, Mrs Davis, to give evidence.  Mrs
         Davis confirmed in answer to my questions that she is expecting the
         claimant's child which is due to be born in January 2015; she  said
         that she was feeling well and able to give  evidence.  She  adopted
         her most recent statement in evidence, dated 27th October 2014,  as
         follows.


     12. Her mother is the owner of 4 properties,  the  rental  income  from
         which is paid into an account jointly operated by Mrs Davis and her
         mother; Mrs Davis has  unrestricted  access  to  the  income.   Her
         mother has now relocated to Jamaica where she resides  permanently;
         she allows Mrs Davis unrestricted access both to the properties and
         the account. Mrs Davis states that the rental income for 12  months
         had exceeded �30,000.00; she asserts that she has complied with the
         Immigration Rules to meet the income  threshold  and  she  and  the
         claimant can overcome  any  accommodation  and  maintenance  issues
         without recourse to public funds.


     13. In cross-examination the sponsor relied upon submitted documents as
         evidence of the 4 rental properties, each of which is shown to have
         Mrs I Ferguson, the sponsor's mother, as  the  sole  proprietor  or
         owner. In her brief oral evidence in chief the sponsor was referred
         to page 65 of the bundle relating  to  one  of  the  4  properties,
         namely 5 Downscourt Road in London. The document in question  is  a
         tenancy agreement dated 10th  December  2011  showing  a  six-month
         tenancy for a Mrs Carrington and the sponsor to be the landlord. In
         evidence the sponsor was uncertain about the departure date of this
         tenant. She recalled that she had, however, struggled  to  pay  her
         rent and a top-up had been paid by Croydon Council for her.


     14. The sponsor stated that she did not have evidence from the  council
         to show this as they do not send statements; she has to go  on-line
         to access the information. At page 35 and the  following  pages  of
         her recent bundle the sponsor referred to a bank statement  in  the
         joint names  of  herself  and  her  mother  and  identified  rental
         payments, annotated by her in handwriting, purporting  to  be  from
         rent on dates in July 2013 and thereafter in August  and  September
         2013.  In a short  written  statement  the  claimant  confirms  and
         adopts the sponsor's statement as his evidence. He states that they
         meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and he was surprised
         and saddened at the refusal of  the  application  by  the  ECO.  He
         confirms the sponsor's pregnancy by him.


     15. Ms Gore stated at the outset of the  hearing  before  me  that  the
         claimant's case is now put on the basis of gifts and  savings,  the
         gifts being the only matter in issue.  It is  her  submission  that
         the ECO accepted income of �10,273.94 by way of grants as  well  as
         �6,000.00 in  savings.  The  �10,273.94  was  accepted  subject  to
         submission of the  necessary  bank  statements  and  is  no  longer
         challenged. I accept that this  is  allowable  income  towards  the
         necessary sum of �18,600. The savings were not,  however,  accepted
         in the absence of the necessary evidence of the length of time  for
         which they had been held.


     16. In the grounds of appeal the claimant relies upon the child support
         payments, child tax credits and  child  benefits  received  by  the
         sponsor.  The ECM rejected these, correctly so in my view, as  they
         are specifically excluded from income by paragraph 21  of  Appendix
         FM-SE.  Loans are no longer argued and I  am  satisfied  that  such
         income is also excluded under paragraph 21 of Appendix FM-SE.


     17. It is difficult to unravel the evidence and basis of this appeal as
         the claimant has been without legal representation for part of  the
         proceedings.  The basis of the appeal has changed. The evidence  of
         the sponsor and claimant relies in part on loans and benefits which
         are not allowed within the Rules.  Grant income is now accepted  as
         set out above, but reliance is still apparently  placed  on  rental
         income.  I set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision  because  the
         appeal was  allowed  including  rental  income  which  was  not  in
         accordance with specified evidence in under Appendix FM-SE.   I  do
         not take account of the rental income  as  there  is  a  continuing
         failure for it to be supported with such as evidence as set out  in
         paragraph 10 of FM-SE as follows.


             10. In respect of non-employment income all the following
             evidence, in relation to the form of income relied upon, must
             be provided:

             (a) To evidence property rental income:

             (i) Confirmation that the person or the person and their
             partner jointly own the property for which the rental income
             is received, through:

             (1) A copy of the title deeds of the property or of the title
             register from the Land Registry (or overseas equivalent); or
             (2) A mortgage statement.

             (ii) personal bank statements for the 12-month period prior to
             the date of application showing the rental income was paid
             into an account in the name of the person or of the person and
             their partner jointly.
             (iii) A rental agreement or contract.



     18. Whether or not the sponsor was shown as  the  landlord  in  tenancy
         agreements  the  evidence  remains  that  her   mother   owns   the
         properties, not the sponsor, and they do not therefore qualify. The
         bank statements to which I was specifically referred at the hearing
         on behalf of the claimant are after the date of decision.   In  her
         final submissions to me at the hearing Ms Gore submitted  that  the
         decision of the ECO is not in accordance with the  law  because  it
         failed to take into account the evidence, including that of  gifts.
         Ms Gore submitted that the savings of the sponsor were  acceptable,
         but  without  addressing  the  issue  of  how  they  overcome   the
         insufficiency as set out by the ECO, including the failure to  show
         that they had been  continuously  held  for  6  months.   I  cannot
         identify such evidence from all the documents before me.


     19. Ms Gore returned in her final submissions to reliance on the rental
         income which I have rejected for the  reasons  set  out  above.  In
         order to  circumvent  the  problem  with  the  need  for  specified
         evidence it appears that the rental income is now  relied  upon  as
         gifts to the sponsor from her mother. The  sums  are  submitted  to
         come within the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  as  third-party
         support under paragraph 1(b)(iii) and (e) as follows:


             (b) Promises of third party support will not be accepted.
             Third party support will only be accepted in the form of:

             ....

             (iii) gift of cash savings (whose  source  must  be  declared)
             evidenced at  paragraph  1(a)(iii),  provided  that  the  cash
             savings have been held by the person or persons  at  paragraph
             1(a)(iii)  for  at  least  6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
             application and are under their control.


     20. Ms Gore submitted that the rental income is a gift as  the  sponsor
         has unfettered access to it and it  amounts  to  over  �12,000  per
         annum, received by way of payments of �1,600 per month. She submits
         that the addition of this sum to the sponsor's finances brings  her
         within the financial requirements  of  the  Rules.  I  reject  this
         submission.  I am not satisfied  that  the  evidence  supports  the
         gifting of cash or meets the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  in
         circumstances in which the case is newly put on this basis  because
         of the failure of the rental income to  meet  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE. The reality is that  the  sponsor  receives  rental
         income. In a letter dated  8th  March  2013  the  sponsor's  mother
         states that the sponsor is managing her properties in  England  and
         receives �500 - �1,000 per month, depending on what she  does.  The
         sponsor may have unfettered access to the rental account but it  is
         nonetheless in join names.


     21. I find that the claimant fails to discharge the burden upon him  to
         show the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules to be met.
         The appeal is alternatively argued on the basis of Article 8 family
         life. Ms Gore made submissions that the appeal should be allowed in
         the light of the letter from the sponsor's son  and  the  sponsor's
         inability to travel because she  is  in  the  late  stages  of  her
         pregnancy.  She submitted that there are exceptional  circumstances
         and the case warrants Article 8 consideration  in  accordance  with
         the cases of Gulshan (Article 8 - new  rules  -  correct  approach)
         [2013] UKUT 640 and MF (Article8 - new rules) Nigeria  [2012]  UKUT
         00393.


     22. Mr Nath, on behalf of  the  ECO,  opposed  such  consideration  and
         submitted that there are no exceptional circumstances in  the  case
         relying on Gulshan  and  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin).  Taking
         account of all the submissions and the  review  of  relevant  cases
         undertaken in the cases of R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  2712
         (Admin) and R (on the application of Aliyu &  Ors)  v  SSHD  [2014]
         EWHC 3919 (Admin) I am satisfied that consideration under Article 8
         is warranted. The ECO  did  not  consider  Article  8  at  all  and
         although the ECM did address Article 8 it was without any realistic
         engagement with the facts of the case.


     23. There sponsor has two children whose  interests  are  arguably  not
         taken into account by the Immigration Rules  so  that  a  "complete
         code" is not provided by the Rules.   I  accept  the  existence  of
         family life between the sponsor and claimant as husband  and  wife.
         There is clearly family life between the sponsor and her  children,
         apparently now living with her in the United Kingdom  and  arguably
         between the claimant and those children who have lived with him  in
         Jamaica in the past.  If I accept that  the  first  four  questions
         posed in  the  5-step  Razgar  approach  can  be  answered  in  the
         affirmative, the legitimate aim being the maintenance of  effective
         immigration  controls,  the  fifth  and  critical  question  is  of
         proportionality.  Is  the   interference   proportionate   to   the
         legitimate public end sought to be achieved?


     24. In a written statement before the First-tier tribunal  the  sponsor
         states that she has resided in the United Kingdom for over 10 years
         in accordance with the Immigration Rules. From  the  time  of  this
         undated statement the sponsor states that she visited the  claimant
         in Jamaica a few months ago. She has returned to the United Kingdom
         and is pregnant by the claimant; precautionary measures  against  a
         premature birth on medical advice will require her to rest 3 months
         into the pregnancy. She will need the necessary  support  from  the
         claimant at this difficult time. She states that the claimant is of
         good character and will make  a  positive  contribution  to  United
         Kingdom society.


     25. The child of the sponsor and claimant has  yet  to  be  born.   The
         children whose interests  must  be  taken  as  a  primary  are  the
         sponsor's two children who  are  stated  by  the  claimant  on  his
         application form to be British citizens. There was very little oral
         evidence in support of the Article 8 aspect of the appeal  and  the
         recent statements from the sponsor and claimant  do  not  make  any
         reference to the children involved in this  case;  nor  is  any  of
         their previous evidence consolidated in relation to relevant family
         life issues. As far as I can identify the  relevant  evidence  from
         the bundles of documents it is as follows.


     26. The sponsor was born on 1st August 1972 in Jamaica  but  is  now  a
         British citizen. She  appears  to  have  dual  nationality  as  the
         documents submitted include a copy of a current  Jamaican  passport
         held by her.  In a letter dated 6th March 2013,  not  addressed  to
         any person, the sponsor sets out her history with the claimant from
         the time they met in March 2008, apparently in Jamaica. They  dated
         for 4 months before they lived together  in  Jamaica  during  which
         time claimant assisted with the sponsor's children, namely her  son
         T D-T and her daughter TW; at this time the  claimant  was  helping
         the sponsor to run her mother's business.


     27. In this letter the sponsor states that the claimant eventually took
         over the role of being a father to her two children  and  he  cared
         for them alone when she travelled.  She returned to live in  London
         to live permanently, on a date  not  provided,  but  continued  her
         relationship with the claimant.  They made their vows in  2012  and
         then decided to live in the United Kingdom. This  letter  concludes
         with the sponsor stating that her children adore the claimant.


     28. The sponsor submits a birth certificate for her  son,  T  D-T,  now
         aged 9 years.  He was born in the  United  Kingdom  on  13th  April
         2005; the birth was registered in 2010 in  the  United  Kingdom  at
         which time the sponsor was living in Croydon.  T D-T's  father  was
         born in Jamaica. In a letter dated 4th June 2014, not addressed  to
         anyone, T D-T pleads for his stepdad to be  allowed  "to  come  and
         join us in England, he's fun and can help with my homework. Also he
         can help mum and things will be a lot easier".  A birth certificate
         is submitted for the sponsor's daughter, TW, showing  her  to  have
         been born on 2nd November 2002 in Croydon. Her father is other than
         T DT's; he was born in the United Kingdom.


     29.  The  sponsor  does  not  give  evidence  of  the  children's  best
         interests, although they will no doubt be served by remaining  with
         her.  There is no information at all about their respective fathers
         or what contact or residence  arrangements  there  may  be  between
         them.  T D-T's father was born in Jamaica and may perhaps still  be
         there. TW's father was born in the United  Kingdom.  Both  children
         have their maternal grandmother in Jamaica and they have both lived
         with the sponsor there.  The  sponsor  gives  no  evidence  of  her
         intentions should the appeal fail.  She does not  say  whether  she
         would return to Jamaica or remain in the United Kingdom.  There  is
         no evidence of the likely impact  upon  the  children  should  they
         return to Jamaica with their mother in order to  have  family  life
         there with the claimant.


     30. As British citizens the children are entitled to all the  intrinsic
         value that brings with it, including schooling, health  and  social
         care. However, the limited evidence before me does  not  show  that
         they will be deprived of these benefits as  a  consequence  of  the
         refusal of the application.  I take account of the  expressed  wish
         of the sponsor's son to have the claimant in the England.  However,
         there is no indication of the wishes of the sponsor's  daughter  or
         of the children's position in education, their  social  and  family
         links within the United Kingdom by way of family or  otherwise.  In
         these circumstances I find that the  evidence  does  not  show  the
         decision of the ECO to be contrary to the  best  interests  of  the
         children.


     31.   Moving   to   the   wider   balancing   exercise   in   assessing
         proportionality, I necessarily attach  significant  weight  to  the
         public interest. Section  19  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014  made
         amendments to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  by
         introducing a new Part 5A which contains sections 117A, 117B,  117D
         and 117D which now apply to this appeal. Section 117B  of  the  Act
         states that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
         the public interest.


     32. In considering the impact of  the  decision  on  the  claimant  and
         sponsor I take account of the fact that it was the sponsor's choice
         to leave Jamaica and to return to live in the United  Kingdom  with
         her children, leaving  the  claimant  behind  in  Jamaica  with  no
         certainty that he would be able to join them.  I  accept  that  the
         sponsor is unable to travel at the moment because of her  pregnancy
         but this is a temporary situation. She has  maintained  contact  by
         visits previously and there is no  apparent  bar  to  the  claimant
         visiting her and the children in the United Kingdom.


     33. I take account of the content of a letter dated 8th March 2013 from
         the sponsor's mother supporting the claimant's appeal.  She  states
         that she first met him in 2008; he has worked and lived  with  her,
         helping out as a bartender and cook in her bar  and  restaurant  in
         Jamaica.  She states that since then he has shown himself to  be  a
         dedicated husband, a hard-working and trustworthy young man.


     34. I necessarily take into account the fact that the  requirements  of
         the Immigration Rules have not been met. However, it  remains  open
         to the claimant to make a renewed application for entry  clearance;
         the merits of such an application may in  due  course  include  the
         birth and presence in the United Kingdom  of  his  expected  child.
         Taking account, as I must, of the factors set out in  section  117B
         of the 2002 Act, in his favour the claimant is presumably  English-
         speaking.  He does not, however, show  himself  to  be  financially
         independent.


     35.  Whilst  the  claimant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
         relationship with  qualifying children, it is not clear whether the
         children have such a relationship with their own fathers, or  where
         they may be. In the light of all the  relevant  factors,  including
         the sponsor's heritage and blood ties in Jamaica, the fact that the
         children have lived there previously, the evidence in my view  does
         not show that it would not be reasonable to expect the children  to
         leave the United Kingdom.  Weighing all the factors in the  balance
         and returning to the public interest I find that  any  interference
         caused  by  the  decision  of  the  ECO  is  proportionate  to  the
         legitimate public end sought to be achieved.  The appeal  fails  on
         Article 8 ECHR grounds.

     36. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.


     37. The appeal is dismissed under Article 8 of the ECHR.


     38. The appeal of the ECO in the Upper Tribunal succeeds.

Anonymity


    The position remains that the First-tier  Tribunal  made  no  anonymity
    order.
