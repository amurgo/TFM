                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. FtT Judge David C Clapham SSC  dismissed  the  appellants'  appeals  on
    human rights grounds by a decision promulgated on 7 November 2017.  The
    FtT and the UT refused permission to appeal.  The appellants petitioned
    the Court.  The latter  decision  was  reduced,  pursuant  to  a  joint
    minute.  The UT granted permission on 28 June 2019.

 2. Parties agree the following outcome: the decision of  the  FtT  is  set
    aside and the appeals, as brought to the FtT, are allowed.

 3. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
