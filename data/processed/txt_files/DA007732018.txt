For the Respondent:    Mr A Berry, instructed by Lexmark Legal Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing Mr [K]'s appeal  against  a
decision to deport him  from  the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  regulation
23(6)(b) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  ("the
EEA Regulations").

For the purposes  of  this  decision,  I  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent  and  Mr  [K]  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of the  Netherlands,  born  on  5  May  1997.  He
claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom on 29  December  2003,  at  the
age of six years. He first came to the attention of the UK authorities  when
he was convicted of battery on 19 August  2015.  On  14  July  2016  he  was
cautioned for attempted theft. On 3 March 2017 he was convicted  of  robbery
and on 31 March 2017 he was sentenced to  4  years'  detention  in  a  young
offenders' institution and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of ï¿½30.

On 13 April 2017 the appellant was served with  a  notice  of  liability  to
deportation. He responded to that notice with evidence of his  residence  in
the UK under the EEA Regulations. On 29 November 2018 he was served  with  a
decision to make a deportation order under the EEA Regulations 2016.

In that  decision,  the  respondent  noted  the  evidence  produced  by  the
appellant in regard to his education and his mother's tax credit awards  and
accepted that he had arrived in the UK in December  2003  and  had  been  in
full-time education from January 2004 to October 2013.  The  respondent  did
not, however, accept that the appellant had been resident in the  UK  for  a
continuous period of five years in accordance with the EEA Regulations  2016
as there was no evidence of  him  having  comprehensive  sickness  insurance
whilst he was a student and there was insufficient evidence of  his  parents
exercising  treaty  right  for  the  period  when  he  was  a  student.  The
respondent also noted  that  the  appellant  had  been  refused  a  document
certifying permanent residence on 4 October 2017 and  again  on  18  October
2017. Accordingly it was not accepted  that  he  had  acquired  a  permanent
right of residence in the UK  and  the  respondent  considered  whether  his
deportation was justified on the basis of the lower level of protection.

The  respondent  considered  the  index  offence  which  consisted  of   the
appellant and four other males approaching a car with two occupants and  two
of the appellant's associates stabbing the victims after  they  handed  over
their mobile phones  and  wallets.  The  appellant  stood  outside  the  car
blocking the victims' escape. The  respondent  noted  that  the  appellant's
offender manager, in his OASys assessment on 5  June  2017,  found  that  he
posed a high risk of harm to the public, and that his probation officer,  in
his assessment on 19 November 2018, determined that he posed a  medium  risk
of harm. The respondent considered that the appellant was involved  in  gang
criminal activities and noted also his poor  behaviour  in  prison.  It  was
concluded that he continued to pose  a  risk  of  serious  harm  and  had  a
propensity to re-offend and that his deportation was  justified  on  serious
grounds of public policy. The respondent noted the  appellant's  claim  that
all his immediate family members resided in the UK  and  that  his  extended
family remained in Kurdistan which was  not  safe  and  that  he  needed  to
remain in the UK  to  care  for  his  father  who  suffered  from  paralysis
following post-surgery complications. However, it was considered  reasonable
to expect him to return to the Netherlands and resume life  there  and  that
his deportation would therefore be proportionate and in accordance with  the
EEA  Regulations  2016.  The  respondent   considered   further   that   the
appellant's deportation would not breach his  Article  8  rights  under  the
ECHR.

The appellant appealed against that decision and his  appeal  was  heard  in
the First-tier Tribunal on 26 September 2019 by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Morgan.  The  judge  accepted  the  evidence  from  the  appellant's  family
members, as set out in their witness statements, without hearing  from  them
in person. He accepted that  the  appellant's  mother  had  been  exercising
treaty rights in the UK and  that  the  appellant,  as  her  dependant,  had
accrued  a  continuous  period  of  five  years  residence  under  the   EEA
Regulations  from  2004,  so  qualifying  them  to  a  permanent  right   of
residence, and that there had been a further five years on  the  same  basis
prior to the deportation decision. The  judge  accordingly  found  that  the
correct test was that of "imperative grounds of public security". The  judge
considered the appellant's criminal offending to  be  appalling,  but  noted
that his family circumstances, including his care for  his  father  and  his
employment provided by his brother, had led to the latest  OASys  assessment
in September 2019 concluding that the likelihood of  re-offending  was  very
low.  The judge considered that,  in  the  circumstances,  the  evidence  of
future risk was not sufficient to  satisfy  the  general  grounds  and  came
nowhere near establishing imperative grounds of public security. He did  not
go on to consider proportionality, in light of such a finding,  and  allowed
the appeal on the basis that the deportation decision was not in  accordance
with the EEA Regulations.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
grounds that the judge had failed to  conduct  any  adequate  assessment  of
whether the appellant's integrative links had been broken and had  therefore
erred in the assessment of the imperative grounds test; that the  judge  had
erred in his assessment  of  whether  the  appellant  presented  a  genuine,
present and sufficiently serious threat; and that the judge  had  failed  to
consider  the  prospects  of   the   appellant's   rehabilitation   in   the
Netherlands.

Permission to appeal  was  refused  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  but  was
subsequently granted by the Upper Tribunal on 18 November 2019.

At the hearing Mr Avery submitted that the judge had failed  to  follow  the
relevant test for "imperative grounds" as set out in B (Citizenship  of  the
European Union - Right to move  and  reside  freely  -  Enhanced  protection
against expulsion - Judgment) [2018]  EUECJ  C-316/16  (Vomero)  as  he  had
failed to consider  whether  the  period  of  imprisonment  had  broken  the
appellant's integrative links to the UK. The judge had  also  erred  in  his
assessment of continuing risk for the purposes of  Regulation  27(5)(c).  He
had erred by factoring the level of integration into the question  of  risk,
he had wrongly referred to a "very low" risk and had  not  properly  engaged
with the OASys assessment.

Mr Berry submitted that the judge had given consideration  to  his  skeleton
argument at the hearing which set out the relevant parts of Vomero  and  the
relevant test  for  imperative  grounds  and  had  properly  considered  the
question  of  "integrative  links".  In  any  event,  the  first  ground  of
challenge was immaterial as the judge found that the  lowest  test  was  not
made  out  by  the  respondent.  The  judge's  assessment  of  risk  was  in
accordance with the latest OASys assessment. The appellant had  no  ties  to
the Netherlands and his rehabilitation had all been in the UK. The  decision
was unimpeachable.



Discussion and conclusions

I do not agree with Mr Berry that  the  fact  that  the  relevant  test  for
"imperative grounds" was set out in his skeleton  argument  was  sufficient,
when taken  with  the  judge's  reference  to  that  skeleton  argument,  to
conclude that the judge had himself considered and carried out the  relevant
test. Neither do I agree with Mr Berry that the judge's subsequent  findings
on the appellant's ties to the UK including his  role  in  the  family  were
part of his consideration of the question whether the appellant's  detention
had severed his integrative links to the UK, when the relevant period to  be
considered was the ten years prior to the expulsion  decision  and  not  the
period subsequent to his release from prison. Accordingly I agree  with  the
Secretary of State's grounds and with Mr Avery's submission that  the  judge
had erred in law in his conclusion at [10], that  the  "imperative  grounds"
threshold applied, since he had failed to carry out the relevant  assessment
as  set  out  at  [70]  of  Vomero  to  consider  whether  the   appellant's
imprisonment had broken the integrative links previously forged with the  UK
in the preceding ten years.

However the relevant consideration is  whether  or  not  such  an  error  is
material. The judge's conclusion, at [16] and  [17],  was  that  the  lowest
threshold had not been met by the  respondent  and  that  it  had  not  been
demonstrated  that  the  appellant  represented  a  genuine,   present   and
sufficiently serious threat to the public to justify deportation,  in  which
case the judge's conclusion that the relevant threshold was the highest  one
was immaterial. I do not  agree  with  the  assertion  in  the  respondent's
grounds that the application of the imperative  grounds  threshold  infected
the judge's findings on risk  of  offending,  as  the  issues  are  entirely
separate. Neither do I agree with Mr Avery's  submission  that  the  judge's
reference at [14] to the likelihood of the  appellant  engaging  in  similar
offences was "very low" was not consistent with the evidence, as it  clearly
came directly from the OASys Assessment of 17 September 2019 at R10.3  (page
67 of the appellant's bundle B). Mr Avery submitted that  the  judge  failed
properly to engage with the OASys assessment, but I do not  agree.  Although
the OASys assessment at R11.12  (page  70  of  the  bundle)  refers  to  the
assessor considering the risk to  be  medium  despite  the  actuarial  score
showing a low risk, the judge clearly gave  detailed  consideration  to  all
the risk assessments and was entitled to  accept  the  actuarial  assessment
and proceed on the basis of the likelihood of  the  appellant   re-offending
being low.

In reaching the conclusion that  he  did  about  the  threat  posed  by  the
appellant, the judge plainly had regard to all the  relevant  factors  under
Regulation 27(5). He acknowledged the seriousness and  appalling  nature  of
the appellant's offending, he had full regard to his past offending  and  he
considered the appellant's behaviour in detention.  The  judge  gave  cogent
reasons for concluding, nevertheless, that  the  lowest  threshold  had  not
been  met  and  he  explained  why  those  were  sufficient  to  show   that
deportation was not justified, setting out at [14] to [16] reasons  why  the
prospects for the appellant's rehabilitation in the  UK  were  positive.  It
cannot be said that the judge failed to undertake a full assessment  of  all
relevant and material matters. The grounds in this respect  are  essentially
a disagreement with the judge's assessment and  conclusions  and  I  do  not
find the challenge to be made out.

For all of these reasons, and whilst I consider that  the  judge  failed  to
undertake a complete assessment of the matters relevant  to  the  imperative
grounds threshold, I do not consider that there was any  material  error  in
the judge's conclusion that the appellant's deportation  was  not  justified
on grounds of public policy and security. The judge's decision is upheld.


DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of  law  requiring  the  decision  to  be  set  aside.  The
decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
therefore stands.
