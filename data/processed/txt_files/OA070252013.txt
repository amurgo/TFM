                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State but I shall refer to the
       parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of  Iran  born  on  6th  July  1985.  She
       applied to join her husband Mr Asghar  Ali  Ismailzadeh,  a  British
       Citizen born on 23rd March 1978. Her application for entry clearance
       was refused on 14th February 2013. The entry clearance  officer  was
       not satisfied that the couple's marriage was genuine and  subsisting
       and that they intended to live together permanently as  husband  and
       wife; or that the sponsor earned sufficient income as he had  failed
       to provide all the specified evidence. The appellant  appealed,  and
       this appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules on  the  basis
       that the sponsor's full cash pay was not put into his  bank  account
       so the evidential requirements under Appendix FM could not  be  met,
       but was allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds by Judge of the First-tier
       Tribunal Munro in a determination promulgated on  the  24th  January
       2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of State by  Judge
       of the First-tier Tribunal PJM Hollingworth on the basis that it was
       arguable that the First-tier judge had erred in law  in  failing  to
       establish that the criteria for  passing  the  gateway  between  the
       Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. Mr Avery relied upon the grounds of appeal. The grounds  argue  that
       Judge Munro had allowed the appeal on the  basis  of  a  "near-miss"
       argument. At paragraph 24 it was said that the only  requirement  of
       the Immigration Rules that had not been met was the failure  to  pay
       all the sponsor's wages into his bank account. Other evidence showed
       that he could support his wife, and thus given the  genuine  spousal
       relationship the decision was disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR.
       The cases of Patel & Ors v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72 and Nasim and  Others
       (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 held that Article  8  ECHR  is  not  a
       general dispensing power. He added that Judge Munro had not followed
       Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
       in failing to consider whether there were  compelling  circumstances
       not recognised by the Immigration Rules before going on to  consider
       Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules.

    6. Mr Khan argued that it was correct for Judge Munro  to  record  that
       the appellant had not met the Immigration Rules, and simply so doing
       was not making a near-miss argument. He argued that the  authorities
       of Gulshan and R (on the application of) Nagre v SSHD were from  the
       Upper Tribunal and Administrative Court and were not therefore to be
       given as much weight as those of Patel,  Huang  &  Kashmiri  v  SSHD
       [2007] UKHL 11 and MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192  which
       were from the Court of Appeal, House of  Lords  and  Supreme  Court.
       Judge Munro was simply relying at paragraph 24 of her  determination
       on the principle set out at  paragraph  23  of  that  document  (and
       derived from R (on the application of MM) v SSHD [2013]  EWHC  1900)
       that the Immigration  Rules  could  themselves  be  disproportionate
       interference with a genuine spousal relationship.

    7. I found that Judge Munro had erred in law for the  reasons  set  out
       below. I set aside her decision under Article 8 ECHR.  I  asked  the
       parties for submissions on re-making the appeal.

Evidence and Submissions - Re-making

    8. Mr Khan tried to  raise  a  cross-appeal  relating  to  whether  the
       Secretary of State had erred in law in failing to  consider  use  of
       discretion at D (d) of Appendix FM- SE but I refused to  allow  this
       to be done as it  had  not  been  raised  at  an  earlier  point  in
       proceedings as should have happened in accordance with the Procedure
       Rules.

    9. Mr Khan then asked the sponsor to  adopt  his  statement  which  was
       before the First-tier Tribunal, which he did  confirming  it  to  be
       true and correct and that there  had  been  no  material  change  in
       circumstances since the statement was made. Neither Mr Khan  nor  Mr
       Avery wished to ask any further questions. In response to  questions
       from me the sponsor explained that he did not wish  to  have  family
       life with his wife in Iran because he had lived in the  UK  for  ten
       years; he had a job and friends in this country and  would  find  it
       difficult to live in Iran again. He confirmed he had only  one  bank
       account for his personal and business affairs, which was his Halifax
       one for which there were statements in the bundle.

   10. Mr Avery submitted the appellant's appeal had failed under  Appendix
       FM of the Immigration Rules and therefore it was necessary  to  look
       to see if there were  any  arguably  good  grounds  to  grant  leave
       outside of the Immigration Rules in accordance with Gulshan, and  in
       this case there were none. The sponsor in this case  could  relocate
       to Iran, see particularly the  finding  by  Judge  Munro  under  the
       Immigration Rules at paragraph 20 of her  determination  that  there
       was no evidence before her that there were insurmountable  obstacles
       to the sponsor relocating to Iran. Even if the matter was considered
       outside of the Immigration Rules the decision was  proportionate  as
       the appellant had not succeeded under the Rules, and he could  apply
       in another year if he started paying his full cash salary  into  his
       bank account before spending any money.

   11. Mr Khan  submitted  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed.  It  was
       permissible to look at Article 8 ECHR generally because the  outcome
       under the Immigration Rules  was  unjustifiably  harsh  because  the
       Rules did not cater for those who were paid in cash, and because re-
       applying was hugely expensive for this appellant as was set  out  in
       the sponsor's statement. As Mr  Justice  Blake  had  said  in  MM  a
       British Citizen should be able to live in his country without let or
       hindrance,  and  in  this  case  the  Immigration   Rules   were   a
       disproportionate interference with the right to respect  for  family
       life, as other less intrusive responses were available and  had  not
       been considered.  The  decision  was  disproportionate  because  the
       sponsor was a British citizen, because he had lived in  the  UK  for
       ten years; because he had built a business here; because  reapplying
       for a visa under the Immigration Rules would take a year and be very
       expensive and because the sponsor had sufficient income  to  support
       the appellant and she was a  qualified  accountant  who  would  also
       contribute to the UK economy.

   12. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions: Error of Law

   13. I find that Judge Munro erred in law in  her  determination  of  the
       matter under Article  8  ECHR.  I  find  that  whilst  she  made  no
       reference to Gulshan  she  did  identify  matters  which  she  found
       justified looking outside of the Immigration Rules at Article 8 ECHR
       including the finding that the Rules did not deal with persons  paid
       in cash in an equitable fashion. However she then, at  paragraph  24
       of her determination, either failed to give any reasons  beyond  the
       appellant and sponsor  having  a  genuine  spousal  relationship  to
       explain  why  the   decision   to   refuse   entry   clearance   was
       disproportionate; or employed a "near-miss"  argument,  contrary  to
       what is said by the Supreme Court in Patel, finding that due to  the
       appellant only failing for lack  of  one  piece  of  evidence  under
       Appendix FM-SE (payments in of the sponsor's salary  into  his  bank
       statement corresponding to payslips/ profit from his  business)  she
       was entitled to succeed under Article 8 ECHR .

Conclusions: Re-making


    14. In accordance with Gulshan, and in accordance with the  submissions
        for the appellant, I find that there are good grounds  to  consider
        whether the appellant's refusal of admission was a  breach  of  the
        UK's obligations under the wider law relating to Article 8 ECHR  as
        there are features (identified below) which  are  not  sufficiently
        recognised by the Immigration Rules which would make a  failure  to
        do so unjustifiably harsh.

    15. I find that the appellant and sponsor have  family  life  together,
        and had this at the time of decision  in  January  2013.  They  are
        lawfully  married,  and  in  determining  the  appeal   under   the
        Immigration Rules the First-tier Tribunal found that  they  have  a
        genuine relationship and intend to  live  together  permanently  as
        husband and wife. The sponsor has attested to this in his statement
        before me. I find that the appellant and sponsor have kept in touch
        since their marriage on 20th June 2012 by telephone,  text,  email,
        Skype and four visits by the sponsor since the instigation of their
        relationship in 2009 (documentary evidence of which is also in  the
        appellant's bundle along with  photographs  of  the  appellant  and
        sponsor together), and are both distressed at their separation.

    16. I find that the refusal of  entry  clearance  interferes  with  the
        family life of the appellant and sponsor, and that the interference
        is of  sufficient  gravity  to  engage  Article  8  ECHR.  In  this
        connection I note what was said by the Supreme  Court  in  Quila  v
        SSHD [2011] UKSC 45 by  Lord  Wilson  at  paragraph  43  about  not
        following the old authority of Abdulaziz v UK 7 EHRR 471, and  that
        issues  of  the  possible  reasonableness  of  family  life   being
        exercised elsewhere  should  be  dealt  with  in  consideration  of
        whether the decision to refuse entry clearance  is  justified.  The
        Supreme Court also clarified that  no  difference  should  be  made
        between family life in an entry case as  opposed  to  an  expulsion
        case, as there was no different standard in relation to positive or
        negative obligations.

    17. As  the  appellant  cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  under
        Appendix FM-SE  the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  is  in
        accordance with the law. The respondent justifies the  interference
        with  the  appellant's  family  life  in  the  interests   of   the
        maintenance of economic order by applying a  consistent  system  of
        immigration  control.  In  the  evidence  before  me  there  is  no
        suggestion  that  the  appellant  has  a  criminal  record,  or  is
        otherwise not of good character.

    18. I have finally to consider  whether  the  significant  interference
        with the appellant's family  life  rights  that  refusal  of  entry
        clearance represents is justified  as  proportionate,  and  a  fair
        balance between the competing  considerations  of  the  appellant's
        family life and the respondent's desire to maintain economic  order
        by applying a consistent system of immigration control.


    19. In favour of the respondent is the fact that weight must  be  given
        to the refusal under the Immigration Rules as special consideration
        has been given to making these compliant with the UK's  obligations
        under Article 8 ECHR. I also note that a narrow failure to meet the
        Rules, in this case by virtue of having insufficient documentation,
        is not to be seen as a matter which can be cured in  an  Article  8
        ECHR balancing exercise, see Patel and others v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC
        72. I therefore give no weight to any argument that a  "near  miss"
        under the Immigration Rules assists the  appellant  to  succeed  in
        this balancing exercise. This appeal can only succeed, as was  said
        in Gulshan,  if  refusal  of  entry  clearance  would:  "result  in
        unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual or their family
        such that refusal of the application would not  be  proportionate."
        In this case I also consider  the  fact  that  the  sponsor  is  of
        Iranian origin and speaks Kurdish, and so would find relocation  to
        Iran easier by reason of his background, as a matter supportive  of
        the respondent's decision.

    20. In favour of the appellant is the fact that the sponsor  cannot  be
        reasonably be expected to relocate to Iran by virtue of his British
        citizenship. In Sanade  &  Others  (British  Children  -Zambrano  -
        Dereci) [2012] UKUT 48 at point 5 of  the  head  note  it  says  as
        follows:  "Case C-34/09 Ruiz Zambrano now makes it clear that where
        the child or indeed the remaining spouse is a British  citizen  and
        therefore a citizen of the European Union, as a matter of EU law it
        is not possible to require the family as a unit to relocate outside
        of the European Union or for the Secretary of State to submit  that
        it would be reasonable for them to do so." Further at the time  of
        decision the sponsor rented his own home in the UK (verified by the
        tenancy agreement); and is a self-employed taxi driver (verified by
        private hire and Hackney carriage driver  licence,  documents  from
        Andicars Ltd,  letters  from  his  chartered  accountant  and  HMRC
        documents) and is employed by Agir (UK) Ltd a restaurant  (see  P60
        for year ending April 2013 and  payslips).  The  sponsor  also  has
        friends in the UK, and was settled in the UK  way  of  life  having
        lived here for seven years at the time of decision. I find what was
        said by Blake J in MM, agreeing with Sedley LJ,  relevant  to  this
        appeal: "in the generality of ordinary cases,  the  abandonment  of
        the citizen's right of residence in order to enjoy family life with
        his  or   her   spouse   is   an   unacceptable   choice,   and   a
        disproportionately high price to pay for choosing a foreign  spouse
        in an increasingly international world."


    21. I am also more than satisfied that at  the  time  of  decision  the
        sponsor had a gross annual income from his work of  �36,223  (which
        is set out in his  letter  from  his  chartered  accountant),  plus
        additional gross annual income from paid  employment  of  �7800(see
        P60 for year ending April 2013). I accept  that  his  Halifax  bank
        statements  do  not  show  regular  payments   of   the   sponsor's
        wages/income corresponding to his payslips. However the  statements
        show very many payments in of cash, for instance in  the  month  of
        the decision his account received �1790 in cash, and the sponsor is
        clearly paid in cash for both for his self-employed work as a  taxi
        driver and his employed work (this is set out on the payslips).  Of
        course he may well have chosen  not  to  pay  all  or  any  of  his
        wages/income into his account on the day  these  were  received  or
        thereafter as money could be used  for  living  and  work  expenses
        before being  paid  into  the  bank.  He  has  supplied  a  lot  of
        documentary  evidence  supporting  his  claimed  income  and  given
        credible evidence to the Tribunal on this issue. On the balance  of
        probabilities I am satisfied that he has earned the  gross  amounts
        that he claims, and that in terms of net monthly income as  a  taxi
        driver at the time of decision he had  �1642  (�19,700  net  profit
        from his accounts and HMRC documents  divided  by  12)  and  a  net
        amount of �650 per month (yearly amount on P60  ending  April  2013
        divided by 12) from his employed work.  This  total  of  �2292  per
        month less �550 in  rent  and  �58  in  council  tax,  i.e.  �1684,
        compares very favourably to the amount a couple would have received
        per week on income support of  �482.95  a  month  at  the  time  of
        decision( based on a weekly amount of �111.45).

    22.   I find that on the  balance  of  probabilities  I  am  more  than
        satisfied at the time of decision the  appellant  could  have  been
        more  than  adequately  financially  support  by  the  sponsor.   I
        therefore find that the legitimate aim of the Secretary of State to
        ensure that that families of  migrants  do  not  live  at  or  near
        subsistence level and are not perceived to be a long term drain  on
        the public purse in the form of increased access to state  benefits
        is met by the appellant in this case. I am also satisfied that more
        than adequate accommodation was available to her in the one bedroom
        flat rented by the sponsor, as attested to by the tenancy agreement
        and the letter from Aharva  &  Co  LLP  Solicitors  inspecting  his
        property.

    23. The sponsor has given detailed evidence  about  the  costs  of  the
        appellant in applying and re-applying for another  visa.  The  visa
        application process has already cost him �2500.  He  estimates  the
        cost of a further application to be �2000. He has broken this  down
        into costs of travel to Turkey (as  there  is  no  visa  office  in
        Iran), visa application fee, hotel stay, food and other  incidental
        expenses, and I accept that this is a reasonable estimated  budget.
        The sponsor is able to provide  financially  for  himself  and  the
        appellant in a more than adequate way but he is not a very  wealthy
        man and whilst his Halifax bank account is normally  in  credit  he
        has  no  separate  savings  account.  GR  v  Netherlands   22251/07
        judgement dated 10th April finds that on the  facts  of  that  case
        there was a breach of Article 13  ECHR  because  excessive  charges
        prevented the applicant from seeking recognition  of  his  arguable
        claim under Article 8 of the Convention. I find that this must be a
        consideration in the case before me.  Further the  appellant  could
        not immediately re-apply. He would have to wait  12  months  during
        which time he paid in his gross income in  its  entirety  into  his
        bank account so he  was  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
        Immigration  Rules  at  Appendix  FM-SE  7(f).   2012.   In   these
        circumstances I do not find  it  an  appropriate  or  proportionate
        response to the appellant's Article  8  ECHR  claim  for  entry  to
        suggest that she should re-apply under the Immigration Rules.


    24.  When all factors are considered I find that the  decision  of  the
        respondent was not proportionate to the legitimate  aim  given  the
        sponsor's citizenship and integration  and  ties  in  the  UK,  the
        genuine  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  sponsor,   the
        appellant's adequate ability in the English language, the more than
        adequate provision in terms of accommodation and financial  support
        in the UK for the appellant and  the  expense  and  delays  of  re-
        applying under the Immigration Rules.

    25. I find that there have been no significant changes in the appellant
        or sponsor's circumstances since the date of decision so refusal of
        entry clearance continues to be  a  breach  of  the  appellant  and
        sponsor's Article 8 ECHR rights.

Decision

   26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law in relation to Article 8 ECHR.

   27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing  the  appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR is set aside.

   28.  The decision is re-made allowing the appeal under Article 8 of  the
       ECHR.

Fee Award

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee  award  (rule  23A
    (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
    2007). I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee
    Awards in Immigration Appeals (December 2011). I note that a fee  order
    was made by the Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  no  further
    submissions were made about this by either party, and therefore that it
    is appropriate to re-make the same full fee-award.
