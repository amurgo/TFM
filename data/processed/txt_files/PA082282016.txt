                               ARYAN MOHAMMEDI
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr J Bryce, instructed by Gray & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kempton, promulgated on 23 February 2017, dismissing his appeal against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. The grounds on  which  permission  was  granted  are,  in  summary,  as
    follows:

         "...

         2. The FtT  at  �27  concluded  that  the  appellant's  account  of
         distributing materials was inconsistent with objective  information
         because, "It is normally only small flyers of the 15 cm� size which
         are distributed or oral messages might be given". In contrast,  the
         FtT noted at �25 only that flyers "might" be 15  cm�  according  to
         objective evidence ...  Whilst  the  distinction  is  superficially
         slight, its effect in this appeal is profound ... what only happens
         carries the necessary  implication  that  anything  else  does  not
         happen ... what might happen carries  the  implication  that  other
         happenings take place.

         3. The FtT at �27 contends that it is surprising that such a volume
         of leaflets is distributed within  a  rural  and  remote  community
         because such a community  is  not  thought  to  be  literate.  That
         observation  has  no  evidential  foundation  and  is  contrary  to
         objective information [cited] that "many people in rural  areas  do
         not have access to the  internet,  political  information  is  more
         often spread by word-of-mouth or by flyers and night  letters"  ...
         The FtT's conclusion is directly in  conflict  with  the  objective
         evidence ...

         4. The FtT at �26 find it surprising that  the  applicant  did  not
         stay at school to learn to read but there is no basis for regarding
         that claim as far-fetched and it is contrary to the  FtT's  earlier
         and correct observation that he emanates from a community were "not
         many people bother to attend school".

         5. The above grounds bear upon  the  core  reasons  for  the  FtT's
         rejection of the claim to have been involved  in  the  delivery  of
         political material."

 3. Under cover of a letter of 11 August 2017 the appellant sought to amend
    the grounds by inserting the following (again in summary):

         "6.      The judge erred at �15 in her treatment of  section  8  of
         the 2004 Act ....  Entry into the UK without  a  passport  did  not
         engage section 8 and even if it did, the section does not  directly
         determine the outcome of  the  consideration.  The  judge  gave  no
         reason for finding that  a  section  8  factor  adversely  affected
         credibility.

         7. The judge errs in drawing an adverse inference at �27  from  the
         appellant's lack of interest in the KDPI youth wing and the absence
         of a letter from the party's representative in Paris. Those  points
         had not been put to the appellant and were procedurally unfair.  In
         the case of the omission of a letter from the KDPI,  there  was  no
         evidential basis for the inference  drawn.  The  background  report
         says the party will provide documentation for membership,  but  not
         for asylum applicants who do not  belong  to  the  party  but  seek
         corroboration of membership  of  another  person  [the  appellant's
         father].

         8.  The  judge  noted  at  �31  the  appellant  was  a   vulnerable
         individual, but failed to have regard  to  the  Joint  Presidential
         Guidance Note, or to identify and record the context  in  which  he
         became distressed.

         9. The judge erred in failing simply to allow the appeal. Reference
         is made to paragraph 5. 5 of the 6 January 2015  API's,  "Assessing
         credibility and refugee status",  which  is  "almost  uncannily  in
         point"; to �196 and 204 of the UNHCR Handbook, the "benefit of  the
         doubt"; and to Symes and Jorro,  "Asylum  Law  and  Practice",  2nd
         edition, �2.7 - approaching the appeal in a manner contrary to  the
         spirit of the inquiry."

 4. Mrs O'Brien, realistically and fairly, did not oppose the amendment  of
    the grounds.  She conceded that although  the  Judge  referred  to  the
    vulnerability of the appellant, she did not explain how this had  borne
    upon the assessment of his evidence; that  whether  or  not  section  8
    applied, there was  no  explanation  of  why  the  appellant's  arrival
    without a passport was "not the action of a genuine asylum  seeker  and
    ... seriously damaged his credibility"; and  that  the  grounds,  taken
    together, were enough to show that the decision could not safely stand.

 5. Mr Bryce, also realistically, did not seek to press  ground  9  to  its
    logical limit.  The following outcome was agreed.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Kempton.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
