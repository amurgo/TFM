                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


For the Appellant:           Mr D Saldanha of Howe & Co, solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


1.    The appellant, a citizen of Turkey, appeals  with  leave  against  the
    determination of an adjudicator (Mr B W  Dawson),  sitting  at  Cardiff
    Magistrates Court, in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal on both
    asylum and human rights grounds against the  respondent's  decision  to
    refuse his application for  asylum  and  to  give  directions  for  his
    removal from United Kingdom as an illegal entrant.

2.    The appellant arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  April  1998.   He
    applied for asylum in May 1998.  The grounds on which he did so may  be
    stated shortly.  He is of Kurdish ethnicity, and comes originally  from
    Bingol province.  However, he moved from his home village  to  Istanbul
    in 1995.  He was detained by the Turkish authorities on two  occasions.
    The first time was in December 1994 prior to  his  departure  from  his
    home village.  He was accused by the local jandarma of  supplying  food
    to members of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party).  He was  detained  and
    held for five days, during which time he was ill-treated.  However,  he
    was released without charge at the end of that period.

3.    His second detention took place in March 1996  in  Istanbul.   He  was
    stopped by the police whilst leaving a building occupied by members  of
    HADEP, the pro-Kurdish nationalist party.  He was held on this occasion
    for either three or five days (his evidence is unclear  on  the  point)
    before being released once again without charge.

4.    In 1996 or  1997,  he  attended  a  May  Day  demonstration,  and  was
    photographed  taking  part  in  the  demonstration.   A  copy  of   the
    photograph in question appears at page C3 of the  appeal  bundle.   The
    photograph  was  published  in  a  newspaper,  and  subsequently  in  a
    magazine.  On 25 June 2003, some  three  weeks  prior  to  the  hearing
    before the adjudicator, an order was  issued  by  a  judge  in  Kadikoy
    Second Crime Court for the appellant's  detention  in  connection  with
    offences allegedly committed by him in 1996.

5.    The appellant claimed asylum shortly  following  his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom on the grounds that if he were to be returned to Turkey,
    he would be detained by the authorities, and would then be at  risk  of
    persecution and/or ill-treatment at their hands in breach of his  human
    rights.  He did not seek to claim that there was any other  reason  why
    he would be at risk on return.

6.    In his determination,  the  adjudicator  rejected  the  whole  of  the
    claimant's evidence.  He concluded at paragraph 19 of his determination
    that the claimant had "fabricated his entire claim".  He  rejected  the
    claimant's evidence that he had been arrested and  ill-treated  on  two
    occasions as claimed.  It  was  on  that  basis  that  the  adjudicator
    dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  both  asylum  and  human  rights
    grounds.

7.    In his submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Saldanha  based  his
    challenge to the adjudicator's determination on a  number  of  separate
    grounds.  We will therefore deal with each of those grounds in turn.

    Assessment of medical evidence

8.    It was submitted on the appellant's behalf that  the  adjudicator  had
    erred in his assessment of the medical evidence which was  before  him.
    That evidence was limited to a report prepared by Dr P  Steadman  on  8
    October 2002, following a consultation which had taken place three days
    earlier.  In that report, Dr Steadman stated at page 17 inter alia:

         "These tests are important tests of concentration and reflect  what
         was apparent clinically  that  this  gentleman  has  some  loss  of
         concentration which is probably due to a combination of his anxiety
         and anger.


         Also he is not fully literate; he is disorientated in time  and  is
         lacking in numeracy.


         It is possible these difficulties may combine to affect his ability
         to present his case in a fully coherent way and  you  may  wish  to
         give consideration to them".

9.    In his determination at paragraph 19,  the  adjudicator  stated  inter
    alia:

         "He [Dr Steadman] diagnoses some loss  of  concentration  which  he
         attributes to the Appellant's anxiety and anger.  The Appellant did
         not seem unduly anxious at the hearing and  I  am  satisfied  fully
         comprehended the questions being put to him and was given the  time
         and opportunity to answer".

10.   It was argued on  the  appellant's  behalf  by  Mr  Saldanha  that  in
    arriving at that assessment, the adjudicator had erred  in  failing  to
    take proper account of the medical opinion of Dr Steadman.  In  support
    of that submission, he cited the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the
    case of N-BCM (children) [2002] 2 FLR 1059.  He relied in particular on
    paragraphs 44, 46 and 65 of that judgment.

11.   N-BCM was a case involving  the  custody  of  a  three-year-old  child
    referred to as "M".  The principal issue involved was the  question  of
    the fitness of M's father to have custody of  him.   In  his  judgment,
    Lord Justice Thorpe stated inter alia:

         "44.     Accordingly, the  judge  went  on  to  consider,  under  a
         distinct  subheading  "The  Personality  and  Capabilities  of  the
         Father", the evidence and  submissions  advanced.   This  makes  up
         seven full pages of his judgment.  He correctly cited the  evidence
         of Dr Black to which I have  already  referred.   However,  in  his
         citations from the evidence of Dr Asen, he seems  to  me  to  focus
         more on attachment considerations -- that is, M's attachments to Mr
         G [his paternal uncle] -- rather than on personality  disabilities.
         Furthermore, in his citations from Dr Freedman's  first  report  he
         seems to omit her clinical assessment of the  father's  emotionally
         unstable core.  He does, however, centre  on  the  passage  in  her
         second report which I  have  cited.   But  he  rejects  it  on  his
         differing assessment  of  the  father's  performance  on  practical
         levels since his release from  prison.   In  that  he  was  plainly
         justified.  But he went on also to reject  her  assessment  of  the
         father's emotional instability by relying on his own assessment  of
         the father in the witness box.  He said at page 41, line 14:


             "I myself  have  seen  the  father  at  length,  both  in  the
             courtroom throughout the hearing and during the course of  his
             long day in the witness box.  Whilst paying full weight to the
             assessments and opinions of the experts, I am entitled to, and
             indeed must, make my own assessment too.  I found him to  have
             considerable intelligence and to be thoughtful in his answers.
              He was not shown by cross-examination to have been untruthful
             or unreliable on any significant issue of fact, although I  am
             well aware that there are numerous points, for example  as  to
             whether he was "on the game" or a "rent boy" in the early/mid-
             1980s, on which his answers are in conflict with statements in
             contemporary documents".
         ....


         46.      Of course the assessment of the father's  credibility  was
         primarily the  judge's  task.   But  the  assessment  of  his  core
         personality and the extent to which damage resulting from his early
         life experiences was disabling and permanent was primarily for  the
         experts, whose professional training,  qualification  and  clinical
         expertise equipped them for the task.  In my judgment,  given  that
         the experts were unanimous on this vital aspect, it was not open to
         the judge to reject their conclusions, either on the basis  of  his
         own impressions of the father or upon the basis of the prejudice to
         the father's case caused  by  management  decisions  of  the  local
         authority and prison authority  during  the  interlocutory  stages.
         The assessment of the section 31 threshold could not admit  of  any
         redress to the father for that factor, nor could the assessment  of
         considerations relevant to M's welfare" (emphasis added).

12.   In his judgment, Lord Justice Robert Walker stated inter alia:

         "65.     Moreover the judge gave no real  explanation  of  why  his
         conclusion appeared so inconsistent with the views of the  guardian
         and the experts.  Whatever difficulties he  had  in  preparing  and
         giving his judgment (and I do not in any way underrate those), this
         was a very serious defect in his judgment.  It was  not  sufficient
         for the judge simply to say or imply that he took  account  of  the
         views of the guardian and the experts but that he took a  different
         view.  Even the most experienced and insightful family  judge  does
         not  have  the  specialised  training  and  skills  of   consultant
         psychiatrists and paediatricians who spend their lives working with
         damaged adults and children.   Discourse  between  a  judge  and  a
         witness in the course of a contentious hearing  is  very  different
         from that which can take place  in  a  consulting  room"  (emphasis
         added).

13.   It was on the basis of those extracts from the judgment of  the  Court
    of Appeal in N-BCM that Mr Saldanha sought to argue before us that  the
    adjudicator had erred in his  assessment  of  the  credibility  of  the
    appellant's evidence because he had failed to take  proper  account  of
    the opinions expressed by Dr Steadman in his report in  the  terms  set
    out above.

14.   We disagree.  It is clear from  the  extract  from  the  adjudicator's
    determination at paragraph 19 which we have also set out above that the
    adjudicator was aware of Dr Steadman's opinion that, at  least  on  the
    single occasion when he saw the appellant, he displayed "some  loss  of
    concentration", that he  was  disorientated  in  time  and  lacking  in
    numeracy, and, and that it was possible (sic) that  those  difficulties
    might combine to affect the appellant's ability to present his case  in
    a fully coherent way.  We see nothing in the determination  to  suggest
    that the adjudicator did not take that medical  opinion  properly  into
    account when arriving at his assessment of the credibility or otherwise
    of the appellant's evidence.

15.   However, Dr  Steadman  was  not  present  on  the  occasion  when  the
    appellant gave his oral evidence before the adjudicator in  July  2003,
    some ten months later.  He was therefore naturally in  no  position  to
    express an opinion as to whether or  not  the  appellant's  ability  to
    present his evidence on that occasion in a  "fully  coherent  way"  was
    affected to any significant extent by the  factors  identified  in  the
    relevant section of his report.

16.   On the other hand, the adjudicator was present  whilst  the  appellant
    was giving  his  oral  evidence.   As  an  experienced  member  of  the
    judiciary, the adjudicator was as well placed as anyone else to  assess
    the truthfulness or otherwise of  the  appellant's  evidence.   Indeed,
    that is one of the primary duties of an adjudicator hearing  an  appeal
    of this nature.  He had before him the evidence of  his  own  ears  and
    eyes that "the appellant did not seem unduly anxious at the hearing and
    I am satisfied fully comprehended the questions being put  to  him  and
    was given the time and opportunity to answer".  He was entitled to take
    the evidence of his own ears and eyes into account in arriving  at  his
    assessment of the appellant's evidence.  He was  not  bound  to  follow
    blindly the opinion of a medical practitioner expressed some ten months
    previously following a single consultation with his patient.

17.   Assessment of medical issues is  a  matter  on  which  an  adjudicator
    should of course pay due  deference  to  (but  not  necessarily  follow
    blindly) the opinions expressed by a  competent  medical  practitioner.
    However, the assessment of the credibility or otherwise of the evidence
    given before him is, and must necessarily,  remain  a  matter  for  the
    adjudicator alone.  In arriving at that assessment, he  must  take  all
    relevant   evidence   (including   expert   evidence)   into   account.
    Nevertheless, the assessment of credibility is a matter for him alone.

18.   In the present instance, we see nothing in the determination  read  as
    a whole to suggest that the adjudicator did not take proper  regard  of
    the opinion expressed by Dr Steadman as to the appellant's  ability  to
    present his evidence in a "fully coherent way".   We  see  no  arguable
    grounds for interfering with  the  adjudicator's  conclusions  in  that
    regard.

    Rejection of court document

19.   The next ground raised by Mr Saldanha was  that  the  adjudicator  had
    erred in rejecting the court document referred to at  paragraph  18  of
    his determination.  The document in question purports to  be  an  order
    issued by a judge of the Kadikoy Second Crime Court on 26 June 2003 for
    the  appellant's  detention  in  connection  with  offences   allegedly
    committed in 1996.  A copy of that document and  a  translation  of  it
    appear at pages 36 and 37 respectively of the appellant's bundle.

20.   The adjudicator's conclusions in relation to that document  appear  at
    paragraph 18 of his determination in the following terms:

         "I reject the note from the Judge as highly implausible.  I do  not
         see why such a document would be prepared in  2003  in  respect  of
         activities by someone back in 1996  who  remained  in  the  country
         until 1998".

21.   In support of  his  submission  that  the  adjudicator  had  erred  in
    rejecting the authenticity of that document, Mr Saldanha referred us to
    paragraph 4.5.4 of a document entitled "Report of fact-finding  mission
    to Turkey" prepared by the Home Office Country Information  and  Policy
    Unit in relation to a mission carried out between 17 and 23 March  2001
    (page 62 of the appellant's bundle).  The paragraph in  question  reads
    as follows:

         "As regards the length of time such intelligence material is  held,
         a  well-known  human  rights  activist  showed  us  a  copy  of  an
         indictment with which he had been served and in which he  had  been
         charged (amongst  other  things)  with  an  alleged  offence  under
         Article 312 of the Criminal Code [incitement to racial,  ethnic  or
         religious enmity] alleged to have been  committed  ten  years  ago.
         This,  he  felt,  clearly  demonstrated   the   extent   to   which
         intelligence material is both recorded, retained and  used  against
         someone even after an extended period of time.  He  also  mentioned
         another example of a charge  being  brought  against  a  particular
         individual some 22 years after the alleged event".

22.   He argued that this extract from  a  document  prepared  by  the  Home
    Office itself shows that the adjudicator had  erred  in  rejecting  the
    authenticity of the judge's order.  We  disagree.   There  is  a  clear
    distinction to be drawn between the  Turkish  authorities  resurrecting
    stale  offences  or  charges  in  order  to  deal  with   a   perceived
    troublemaker  who  is  currently  causing  problems  to  them  and  the
    situation in which the appellant found himself.   The  resurrection  of
    stale offences or charges is clearly a convenient way for an oppressive
    regime to bring pressure to bear on, or otherwise  deal  with,  someone
    who is currently causing problems from their point of view.

23.   However, the appellant's situation is entirely different.  By his  own
    account, he had left Turkey some five years previously in  April  1998.
    He had last been detained by the Turkish  authorities  in  March  1996,
    more than seven years prior to the date of the alleged court order.  He
    had remained at his own home in Istanbul for a further two years  until
    April 1998, and had, according to his own evidence,  been  "kept  under
    observation by the authorities outside  his  house  until  he  left  in
    1998".

24.   Whilst the adjudicator  rejected  those  aspects  of  the  appellant's
    evidence (indeed, as stated above, he rejected the appellant's evidence
    in its entirety), nevertheless even if those aspects of the appellant's
    evidence were true, the adjudicator was plainly entitled to  regard  it
    as utterly implausible that if the Turkish authorities genuinely wanted
    the appellant for offences committed in 1996 they would fail to  arrest
    him during the period of two  years  during  which  he  remained  under
    observation in his own home following his last release in  March  1996,
    or that they would then wait a further five years, during which  period
    he was not even in the country, before issuing an order for his arrest.
     It is beyond belief that this could have  happened.   The  adjudicator
    was manifestly entitled to reject the court order as a fabrication.

    Photograph of demonstration

25.   The third ground raised by Mr Saldanha was that  the  adjudicator  had
    erred in his assessment of the  evidence  adduced  on  the  appellant's
    behalf in the form of a photograph showing his attendance at a May  Day
    demonstration which took place in either 1996 or 1997 (the  appellant's
    evidence was inconsistent as to the date).  This is the  photograph,  a
    copy of which appears at page C3 of the appeal bundle.

26.    The  appellant's  case  was  that  he  was  wanted  by  the   Turkish
    authorities because that photograph appeared in both a newspaper and  a
    magazine.  The adjudicator's conclusions in relation to the  photograph
    appear at paragraph 15 of his determination in the following terms:

         "I think it significant that the Appellant was  unable  to  produce
         either Article.  The photograph  reveals  that  the  appellant  was
         involved in a  protest  but  not  having  had  the  opportunity  of
         inspecting the origin [this is clearly a misprint  for  "original"]
         in the light of the conclusions which I  reach  below.   I  am  not
         satisfied  that  this  alone  was  enough  for  me  to  accept  the
         Appellant's story".

27.   At the hearing before us, Mr Saldanha confirmed that he was unable  to
    identify either the newspaper or the magazine in which  the  photograph
    in question was allegedly published.  He did not know whether there was
    any text with the photograph when it was handed by the appellant  to  a
    representative of the respondent at the time of his  asylum  interview.
    He could say no more than that he believed that the original photograph
    had been handed by the appellant to the respondent's representative  at
    that time.

28.   In the absence of any evidence as to the  identity  of  the  newspaper
    and the magazine in which the photograph had allegedly been  published,
    or any evidence to indicate that the Turkish authorities had identified
    the appellant as having participated in the demonstration in  question,
    or that they were looking for the appellant as a consequence  (his  own
    evidence, albeit rejected by the adjudicator, that he  was  kept  under
    observation by the authorities outside his house until he  left  Turkey
    in April 1998 is cogent evidence that  this  was  not  the  case),  the
    adjudicator was properly entitled to conclude that the photograph alone
    was not enough to persuade him to accept the appellant's story.  We see
    no arguable grounds for interfering with that conclusion.

29.   However, even if we were persuaded that the adjudicator was  wrong  in
    his conclusion, the photograph, taken at its  highest,  shows  no  more
    than that the appellant attended  a  public  demonstration  which  took
    place at least 6� years ago.  There is no evidence of any kind that the
    Turkish authorities identified the appellant as one of the participants
    in that demonstration, or that they have ever sought to detain him as a
    consequence.  This ground  clearly  discloses  no  arguable  basis  for
    interfering with the adjudicator's determination.

    Suicide risk

30.   The final ground raised by Mr Saldanha was that the adjudicator  erred
    in failing to deal with  the  risk  that  the  appellant  would  commit
    suicide if he were to be returned  to  Turkey.   In  this  regard,  the
    appellant is on stronger ground.  It is unfortunate that,  in  what  is
    otherwise a careful and  commendable  determination,  this  experienced
    adjudicator has not dealt with that particular issue.  However, that is
    an omission which we ourselves are in a position to remedy.

31.   The claimed risk that the appellant would, or  might,  commit  suicide
    on return to Turkey is  based  solely  on  the  medical  report  of  Dr
    Steadman referred to above, i.e. the report prepared on 8 October 2002.
     That report is now some 17  months  out  of  date.   However,  in  the
    absence of any subsequent medical evidence, we proceed de bene esse  on
    the basis that it still remains Dr Steadman's assessment of the suicide
    risk so far as the appellant is concerned.

32.   Dr Steadman's conclusions in relation to the suicide  risk  appear  at
    page 14 of his report in the following terms:

         "It is difficult to give a prognosis with regard to suicide in  any
         given individual but one can look at risk factors and the following
         would appear to be risk factors in this case;


             A.  His past psychological difficulties.
             B.  His current psychological difficulties (see below).
             C.    His   physical   difficulties   (physical   difficulties
                  predispose to mental health difficulties).
             D.  His statement that he fears his life would  be  in  danger
                  were he to return to Turkey.
             E.  His statement that he would kill himself were he to return
                  to Turkey.


         In my view these factors would be likely to combine to place such a
         person at significant risk of suicide".

33.   In addition, at page 20 of his Report, Dr Steadman has stated:

         "I have already commented  upon  what  I  see  as  a  significantly
         increased risk of suicide in this gentleman were he to  be  ordered
         back to his country".

34.   It was Mr Saldanha's  submission,  based  on  the  extracts  from  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in N-BCM (above), that the  adjudicator
    was bound to accept the  accuracy  of  the  opinions  expressed  in  Dr
    Steadman's report that there would be a  "significant  risk"  that  the
    appellant would commit suicide if he were to be returned to Turkey.  By
    implication, this Tribunal was bound to do likewise.   We  reject  that
    submission.

35.   The situation of the appellant is entirely different from that of  the
    father in N-BCM.  The quality and reliability of the  medical  evidence
    in the two cases is also entirely different.  In  the  case  of  N-BCM,
    there was medical evidence from three separate doctors.  As recorded at
    paragraph 46 of  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  they  were
    unanimous in their assessment of the father's core personality and  the
    extent to which damage resulting from his early  life  experiences  was
    disabling and permanent.  The Court of Appeal held that, given that the
    experts were unanimous, it was not open to the judge  to  reject  those
    conclusions based, at least in part, on  his  own  impressions  of  the
    father.  We see nothing in the judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to
    suggest that there were thought to be any unsatisfactory aspects of the
    medical evidence provided by the three doctors in question.

36.   Regrettably, the same cannot be said  in  relation  to  Dr  Steadman's
    report.  At page 14 of that report, he has identified in terms the five
    risk factors which, in his opinion, combined to place the appellant  at
    "significant risk of suicide".  The first two factors (A  and  B)  were
    the appellant's past  and  current  psychological  difficulties.   With
    respect  to  Dr  Steadman,  it  is  difficult   to   see   what   these
    "psychological difficulties" were, or could have been.  At page  19  of
    his report, he has stated inter alia:

         "Fortunately, so  far,  this  gentleman  appears  to  have  avoided
         developing a syndrome of either post traumatic stress  disorder  or
         depression although does (sic) appear angry and anxious"  (emphasis
         added).

37.   In light of  Dr  Steadman's  diagnosis  that  the  appellant  was  not
    suffering from either of those conditions, and his failure to  indicate
    anywhere else in his lengthy report that the  appellant  was  suffering
    from any other identifiable mental condition (apart possibly from anger
    and anxiety), the "psychological difficulties" referred to  by  him  at
    factors A and B remain elusive, to put it at its lowest.

38.   Factor C is identified as  the  appellant's  "physical  difficulties".
    Once again, it is difficult (if not impossible) to  ascertain  from  Dr
    Steadman's  report  the  nature  of  these  "difficulties".    He   has
    identified at page 10 of his  report  a  number  of  scars  which  were
    allegedly caused by the ill-treatment which the appellant  received  at
    the hands of the Turkish police.  They comprise a small area of missing
    hair (sic) under his chin, a small scar approximately 2 cm long on  his
    left middle finger, and an attenuation in the length of that finger  of
    about � cm allegedly caused when electric shocks were  administered  to
    him.  At paragraph 11 of his  report,  Dr  Steadman  has  identified  a
    number of other scars which the appellant did not claim  to  have  been
    caused by ill-treatment.  They included such scars as a small  abrasion
    on his left shin sustained whilst playing football, a small scar on his
    left wrist caused whilst he was a child,  abrasions  on  both  kneecaps
    also dating back to his childhood, and the like.

39.   At page 12 of his report, Dr Steadman has referred to the  appellant's
    statement to him that he suffered continuing discomfort in his left jaw
    at the joint, and that this tended to ache if he laid on his side or if
    he chewed anything hard.  Apart from these  matters,  Dr  Steadman  has
    recorded at page 13 of his report that the appellant had told him that,
    apart from those problems, he  was  currently  physically  well.   With
    respect to Dr Steadman,  the  appellant's  "physical  difficulties"  as
    identified by him in his report are, even when viewed cumulatively,  of
    a minor, indeed trivial, nature.

40.   Factor D is no more than an assertion made by  the  appellant  himself
    at a time when he was attending upon Dr Steadman, not for the  purposes
    of receiving bona fide medical attention, but for the sole  purpose  of
    obtaining  a  favourable  medical  report  in  support  of  his  asylum
    application.  His assertion as recorded by Dr Steadman that  he  feared
    that his life would be in danger on return to Turkey was, taken at  its
    highest, one which Dr Steadman ought to have approached  with  caution.
    He should have been alive to the possibility that it was no more than a
    self-serving assertion made by an asylum seeker who had been brought to
    see him for the sole purpose of obtaining a favourable medical report.

41.   In light of the adjudicator's conclusion that the  claimant's  account
    was a fabrication in its entirety, the appellant's assertion made to Dr
    Steadman that he feared that his life would be in danger on  return  to
    Turkey provides an uncertain basis for Dr  Steadman's  conclusion  that
    the claimed fear (even if true) would give rise to an increased risk of
    suicide on return.

42.   Factor E  falls  into  the  same  category.  Once  again,  it  was  an
    assertion which Dr Steadman should have approached with caution.  It is
    one with which most (if not all) adjudicators will be familiar.

43.   In light of Dr Steadman's conclusion as recorded at  page  19  of  his
    report that the  appellant  had  not  developed  either  post-traumatic
    stress disorder or depression, we are bound to  say,  with  respect  to
    him, that we find it difficult (if not impossible) to see how he  could
    properly have concluded, as he did, at page 14 that the appellant would
    be at "significant risk of suicide" or, at page 20, that there would be
    a "significantly increased risk of suicide" if the appellant were to be
    ordered back to Turkey.   This  Tribunal  is  slow  to  reject  medical
    opinions  expressed  by  properly  qualified   medical   practitioners.
    However, in the present instance, we have little (if any) hesitation in
    so doing.  On  the  contrary,  we  are  satisfied  that  Dr  Steadman's
    conclusions in relation to the risk of suicide  in  the  case  of  this
    particular appellant are manifestly unsound and unsustainable.   Having
    determined that the appellant was not  suffering  from  depression,  Dr
    Steadman's  assessment  without  further  explanation   that   he   was
    nevertheless still at a "significant risk of  suicide"  may  fairly  be
    characterized as perverse.

44.   In arriving at that conclusion, we have  taken  account  of  the  fact
    that, as disclosed by Dr Steadman at page 1 of his report, he  saw  the
    appellant on  only  a  single  occasion.   In  addition,  there  is  no
    indication that he had access  to  the  appellant's  clinical  records.
    There is no indication that Dr Steadman had any communication with  the
    appellant's own general practitioner (if any).  Despite the absence  of
    that  essential  background  material,  Dr  Steadman  has  nevertheless
    arrived at his diagnosis of a "significant  risk  of  suicide"  in  the
    appellant's case based on but a single consultation.  With  respect  to
    Dr Steadman, we would respectfully question whether it is possible  for
    any psychiatrist, however well qualified and experienced, to arrive  at
    such a definite diagnosis on the basis of  a  single  consultation  and
    without any access to the patient's previous medical  records.   As  Dr
    Steadman himself commented at page 14 of his report, "It  is  difficult
    to give a prognosis with regard to suicide in  any  given  individual".
    In the circumstances, it is all the more surprising that he saw fit  to
    express a diagnosis in the terms in which he did.

45.   On a more general note, we observe from the preface to  Dr  Steadman's
    report at page 4 that he stated that he had carried out  in  excess  of
    5,000 medical assessments on behalf  of  the  Benefits  Agency  Medical
    Services.  On the following page of his report, he  disclosed  that  he
    has carried out over 1,500 medico-legal assessments for  solicitors  in
    relation to people  claiming  physical  injuries  resulting  from  road
    traffic accidents, assaults and other causes.  On  the  same  page,  he
    stated that during the preceding five years, he had produced over 2,000
    medical assessments on asylum seekers.   On  the  usual  basis  of  250
    working days per year, this discloses that during that period  of  five
    years, Dr Steadman had been producing  medical  assessments  on  asylum
    seekers alone (disregarding for the moment any assessments carried  out
    on behalf  of  the  Benefits  Agency  Medical  Services  and  claimants
    pursuing physical injuries claims) at the  rate  of  approximately  1.6
    assessments per day.

46.   Whilst that rate of output of medical assessments  is  impressive,  to
    be sure, we are bound to say that  it  must  inevitably  give  rise  to
    justifiable concerns as to the reliability of those assessments.   When
    a medical practitioner is engaged for such a substantial proportion  of
    his professional practice in producing medical reports  in  support  of
    the claims of asylum seekers and appellants, his  ability  to  maintain
    the impartiality required of an expert witness must  inevitably  become
    increasingly difficult, however hard he may attempt to do so.

47.   In light of the unfavourable view which we have formed in relation  to
    Dr Steadman's report in the present instance, particularly in  relation
    to his assessment of the claimed suicide risk in the appellant's  case,
    we are bound to say that  adjudicators  before  whom  his  reports  are
    placed in future would be advised to approach  their  reliability  with
    due caution.  In particular, it  should  not  be  assumed  that  merely
    because a qualified medical practitioner has expressed an opinion, that
    opinion must necessarily be correct or reliable.

48.   Reverting to the case of the appeal before us, we note  from  page  15
    of Dr Steadman's report that he has recorded that, at least at the time
    when the appellant came to see him in October 2002, he had "never  been
    on  any  psychological  medication   and   has   never   received   any
    counselling".  In light of the fact that Dr Steadman concluded that the
    appellant was at "significant risk  of  suicide",  it  may  be  thought
    surprising, to put it at its lowest, that he did not see fit to suggest
    that psychological intervention and/or counselling should be sought  as
    a matter of some urgency.  There  is  no  indication  in  the  evidence
    before us that such intervention or counselling has been sought by  the
    appellant during the period of some 17 months which has  elapsed  since
    that time.

49.   Whilst it is unfortunate that the adjudicator did not  deal  with  the
    issue of the claimed suicide risk in his determination, nevertheless it
    is clear to us that, if he had done so,  he  could  not  properly  have
    arrived at any conclusion other than that the evidence  was  manifestly
    insufficient to show, even to the lower standard of proof applicable to
    asylum and human  rights  appeals,  that  was  a  real  risk  that  the
    appellant would commit suicide either before or  after  his  return  to
    Turkey.  On the evidence before us, we certainly have no hesitation  in
    arriving at that conclusion.

50.    Despite  the  submissions  made  on  the  appellant's  behalf  by  Mr
    Saldanha, we  are  satisfied  that  there  is  no  arguable  basis  for
    interfering with the adjudicator's findings and conclusions.  They  are
    findings and conclusions  which  were  properly  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence.

51.   This appeal is dismissed.
