JUDGMENT


UTJ GLEESON:  The applicants are a husband and  wife  from  Pakistan.   They
      have  permission  to  challenge  by  way  of   judicial   review   the
      respondent's decision to refuse their application for indefinite leave
      to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  migrant,  and  the
      respondent's subsequent decision by way of  administrative  review  to
      uphold that decision.

   2. The respondent's decision is based on the evidence and conduct of  the
      principal applicant (hereafter 'the applicant').  Her husband  is  her
      dependant in this application and his right to remain stands or  falls
      with that of the applicant.

   3. The basis of the respondent's refusal to  grant  indefinite  leave  is
      that there was a substantial discrepancy in 2011 and 2013 between  the
      amount of self-employed income reported by the applicant to  HMRC  for
      tax purposes, and  that  declared  by  her  for  the  purpose  of  the
      applications she made in those years  for  further  Tier  1  leave  to
      remain, such that when she made her indefinite leave application,  she
      was relying on two years in which  her  leave  had  been  obtained  by
      deceit or deception.

   4. The respondent considered this conduct to engage paragraph  322(5)  of
      the general grounds for refusal, which is among the grounds  on  which
      leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  should  normally  be  refused.
      That implies a discretion, which the applicant says the respondent did
      not exercise, and should have exercised in her favour.

Immigration history

   5. The applicant's immigration history is set out in her original grounds
      for review.   The nub of the deception relied upon by  the  respondent
      when refusing indefinite leave  was  a  significant  under-declaration
      made in her tax returns for 2011 and 2013, which conflicted  with  the
      income figures she gave in historic visa applications:

       a) On 31 March 2011, the applicant claimed 20 points for earnings  of
          �38092.79 for 3 February 2010 - 4 February  2011,  being  earnings
          from employment of �14234.49, and from self-employment of �23,849.
           In her declaration  to  HMRC  for  the  same  period,  the  self-
          employment income was declared as �2013, not �23,849.

       b) On 11 May 2013, the applicant made  a  further  application,  with
          similar difficulties.  This time, her employed income on the  visa
          application  was  �7680.96  and  her  self-employment  income  was
          �32,340.  On her HMRC return, the applicant declared only �694 for
          self-employed earnings.  The applicant failed to file a tax return
          at all for the year ended April 2014.

   6. In May 2016, when the applicant and her  husband  were  preparing  for
      their  indefinite  leave  to  remain  application,  pressed  by  their
      solicitor to clarify matters, they visited the accountant who admitted
      to filing two incorrect returns.  It is their case that the accountant
      did not then tell them that he had filed no return at all in 2014:  in
      that year, the applicant had a child and  had  done  no  self-employed
      work, on her account.  The parties filed amended tax returns for all 3
      years, which were acknowledged in a letter received from HMRC dated 18
      May 2016.  They did not make good the underpayment at that  stage  but
      waited for the new tax calculation to be sent, with penalties as  HMRC
      considered appropriate.

   7. The applicants employed Sky Solicitors  to  prepare  their  indefinite
      leave applications.  They used the premium service, and took with them
      to the appointment a covering letter,  which  did  not  refer  to  the
      amendment of the tax returns, or the underpayment of tax.

   8. The applicant took with her to  the  appointment  the  May  2016  HMRC
      letter acknowledging receipt of the amended returns  but  it  was  not
      included in the application pack or mentioned in the covering  letter.
      The applicant now asserts that she was advised by her solicitors  that
      she need not make any disclosure of the discrepancy on the application
      or in the covering letter, but should mention the HMRC  issue  at  her
      premium service appointment only if the caseworker raised it, at which
      time, she was to hand over the HMRC letter of 18 May 2016 and  explain
      what had happened.

   9. The applicant did  not  make  any  disclosure  of  the  income  under-
      declaration for 2011 and 2013 either in her  application,  or  at  her
      appointment.  It was not mentioned in the solicitors' covering  letter
      which she took with her to the  appointment.   On  the  contrary,  the
      applicant made an untruthful response to a questionnaire which she was
      asked to complete at her premium  service  appointment.   One  of  the
      questions on that questionnaire was this:

           "Are  you  satisfied  that  the  self-assessment   tax   returns
           submitted to HMRC accurately reflect your self-employed income?"

      The applicant answered 'Yes', although she was well aware that in 2011
      and 2013, that was not the case, and although she  had  with  her  the
      letter which purported to explain why her  tax  was  underdeclared  in
      those years and not declared at all in 2014.

  10. In the event, the caseworker did  not  raise  the  question  with  the
      applicant before making a decision on the application.  The caseworker
      relied on the documents handed in by the applicant, the  questionnaire
      responses, the covering  letter,  and  the  information  on  the  HMRC
      database,  which  was  available  to  the  caseworker   online.    The
      respondent rejected the applicant's application on the sole  basis  of
      the HMRC discrepancies, the respondent considering that the  applicant
      had been 'deceitful or dishonest in [her] dealings with HMRC and/or UK
      Visas and Immigration by failing to declare your claimed self-employed
      earnings to HMRC at the time and/or by falsely representing your self-
      employed income to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom'.

  11. The respondent did not accept that the errors by the  accountant  were
      genuine. The refusal letter contained a standard paragraph so stating,
      and added 'It is noted that you have stated you  have  since  declared
      these claimed self-employed earnings to HMRC'.  It is the  applicant's
      case that that paragraph was inaccurate, because she had not made  any
      statement about the errors before the decision letter  was  handed  to
      her.  On receipt of the letter, however, she made just that statement.
      She gave her prepared explanation  and  produced  the  May  2016  HMRC
      letter, showing that the position had been put  right  about  a  month
      before the application was made.  The applicant stated  that  she  was
      shocked by the outcome.

  12.  On  7  June  2016,  HMRC  sent  amended  assessments,   amended   tax
      calculations,  and  late  filing  penalties,  amounting  in  total  to
      �15,198.90.  The applicant did not pay in full and still has not  done
      so.  She paid �3000 on account and set up a payment plan  for  �100  a
      month to pay the outstanding amount.

  13. On 13 June 2016, the appellant's accountants  wrote  a  letter  to  be
      produced to the Home Office, taking full responsibility for the under-
      declaration.  The reason given was that 'as a  consequence  solely  of
      failures of the systems in place in our company,  incorrect  data  was
      entered into the self-assessments of the said years and  submitted  to
      the Revenue by way of the online system'.  The accountants  stated  in
      their letter that a member  of  their  staff  might  have  erroneously
      inputted incorrect data to their computer system or when  the  returns
      were completed. The accountants recognised  that  the  alleged  errors
      were potentially serious, had apologised to the appellants and  agreed
      to pay all penalties and interest arising out of the under-declaration
      and consequent under-payment of tax, and to negotiate with the Revenue
      on a pro bono basis on the applicant's behalf.

  14. The accountants stated that they were considering what action to  take
      in respect of the accountant who prepared the returns  and  who,  they
      say in their letter, assured the applicant that  correct  returns  had
      been filed. They had assured the appellants that the corrected returns
      were now accurate and they considered that  on  2  June  2016  at  her
      appointment, the applicant was in a position to say, truthfully,  that
      the self-assessment tax returns submitted to HMRC accurately reflected
      her self-employed income, by reason  of  the  5  May  2016  corrective
      declaration.

Refusal letter

  15. On 2 June 2016, the respondent refused indefinite leave to remain. She
      did so on the basis that the applicant had answered in the affirmative
      the question regarding the accuracy HMRC returns for her previous self-
      employment.   The  respondent  considered  that  to  be  deceitful  or
      dishonest, applying paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.

  16. The respondent acknowledged that she had a discretion under  paragraph
      322(5) whether to refuse indefinite leave  to  remain.   She  was  not
      satisfied on the evidence submitted that the  applicant's  failure  to
      declare to HMRC in 2011 and 2013 the self-employed earnings which were
      declared, in those years, with her  application  for  further  Tier  1
      leave to remain was a genuine error.  The  respondent  noted  a  clear
      benefit to the applicant,  either  by  failing  to  declare  her  true
      earnings to HMRC in 2011 and 2013, or  in  falsely  representing  that
      income in her applications for further Tier 1 leave to remain in those
      years.

  17. The respondent stated in her letter  that  the  explanation  that  the
      earnings had since been declared was 'not sufficient  to  satisfy  the
      Secretary of State that you have  not  previously  been  deceitful  or
      dishonest on your dealings with HMRC' (in fact,  no  such  explanation
      had yet been given,  but  the  respondent  correctly  anticipated  the
      explanation later provided). Applying paragraph 245CD(g), and Appendix
      A  paragraph  19,  the  respondent  indicated  that  she  doubted  the
      genuineness of the claimed self-employment income declared in to  UKVI
      in 2011 and 2013.

  18. The applicant sought an administrative review of that  decision.   She
      provided representations settled by Counsel, a witness  statement  and
      further  evidence,  characterising   as   'entirely   unfounded'   the
      respondent's assessment that she had been deceitful  and/or  dishonest
      in  her  dealings  with  HMRC.  She  enclosed  the  letter  from   her
      accountants, taking the blame for  the  under-declaration  and  argued
      that the  respondent  had  not  yet  exercised  her  discretion  under
      paragraph 322(5), which would be a public law error.

  19. On 18 July 2016, the respondent in her administrative review  decision
      refused to overturn the decision to refuse indefinite leave  and  gave
      notice of liability to enforced removal pursuant to section 10 of  the
      Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (as amended).  The  passports  of  the
      applicant and her husband were retained.

  20. The applicant engaged with the respondent in the  Pre-Action  Protocol
      process.  The respondent in her  Pre-Action  Protocol  reply  dated  2
      August 2016 but maintained her decision, noting  that  she  had  taken
      account of all representations submitted on  the  applicant's  behalf,
      but had not exercised evidential flexibility to admit the new evidence
      which accompanied the administrative review application.

Permission for judicial review

  21. The applicant sought judicial review.  The judicial review grounds are
      lengthy.  Permission was refused on the papers, but granted  after  an
      oral hearing before Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins. The arguments in the
      grounds for review were that:

     a) The respondent's decision that the applicant had used deception was
        irrational, there being no evidence capable of justifying a finding
        of deception; alternatively

     b) The respondent had failed to apply the correct burden of  proof  in
        asserting that it was the applicant's responsibility to  make  sure
        her returns to HMRC were correct, and she did not need to be  given
        an  opportunity  to  respond.   The   applicant   relied   on   the
        respondent's Tameside duty and the respondent's own guidance on the
        general grounds for refusal.  She relied on R on the application of
        Semeda v Secretary of State for the Home Department (statelessness:
        Pham) [2015] UKSC 19 applied) IJR [2015]  UKUT  00658  at  [17],  a
        commentary on the Tameside duty. The  applicants  had  paid  for  a
        personal interview and were entitled to expect to  be  asked  about
        any matters which concerned the caseworker, before a  decision  was
        made.  Had she done so, the applicant submitted that the respondent
        might well have concluded that paragraph 322(5) was not  made  out,
        and the failure to allow her to explain was procedurally unfair;

     c) The respondent had not considered the exercise  of  her  discretion
        not  to  refuse,  even  if  paragraph  322(5)  was   engaged.    In
        particular,  and  applying  the  general  grounds   guidance,   the
        respondent had not considered what the applicant  gained  from  her
        deception.  The applicant would have to pay the outstanding tax  in
        the end.  There  was  no  direct  evidence  of  deception  and  the
        applicant's conduct was not serious: refusing indefinite  leave  to
        remain was disproportionate on the facts.

     d) The respondent had erred in refusing in the  administrative  review
        to exercise  her  residual  discretion  outside  the  Rules  and/or
        refusing to take account of the additional material submitted  with
        the application. By the date  of  application,  the  applicant  had
        filed correct accounts and there was no basis in law  in  which  it
        could sustainably be held that she had been deceitful or dishonest,
        having regard to the letter from her  accountant,  taking  all  the
        blame.

  22. Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins,  when  granting  permission,  considered
      that the respondent had arguably erred in failing to  have  regard  to
      the accountant's letter and that the  applicant  ought  to  have  been
      given an opportunity to explain what had happened before the  decision
      was made. He considered that the respondent, in relying  on  paragraph
      322(5), may have overlooked the provisions of paragraph 322(2),  which
      were also relevant to the facts  of  this  application.  None  of  the
      pleaded grounds were excluded from consideration  in  the  substantive
      judicial review hearing.

Detailed grounds of defence

  23. The respondent applied for, and was granted, an extension of  time  to
      file detailed grounds of defence. Her detailed  grounds,  when  filed,
      carried the subheading, "The Secretary  of  State  proposes  to  adopt
      these detailed grounds as her skeleton  argument  at  the  substantive
      hearing of  this  claim".   The  applicant  did  not  object  to  that
      subheading until the day of the hearing.

  24. The detailed grounds set out the history and the relevant law, arguing
      that the applicant's contentions  are  without  merit,  and  that  the
      respondent's decisions under challenge are  lawful  and  rational.  At
      [19], the respondent argued that the substantial under-declaration  of
      tax, coupled with the applicant's answer 'yes' to  the  question  'Are
      you satisfied that the self-assessment tax returns submitted  to  HMRC
      accurately reflected your self-employed earnings'  was  sufficient  to
      engage paragraph 322(5).  There would have been a 'clear  benefit'  to
      the applicant in seeking to mislead HMRC or the respondent in that way
      and her character and conduct was such that it was undesirable for her
      to be given indefinite leave to remain.

  25. The respondent noted that the principal applicant's  under-declaration
      of self-employed income in 2011 and 2013 totalled �53,482 and that  it
      was  not  for  the  respondent  to  search  for  a  possible  innocent
      explanation.  The applicant had been given an opportunity  to  declare
      the issue and explain it in the questionnaire which she  completed  at
      her appointment, but had opted not to do so.  There was no  reason  to
      exercise discretion in her  favour.   The  respondent  relied  on  the
      decision in R on the application of Giri v Secretary of State for  the
      Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 784 which held  that  no  question  of
      precedent fact arose in the exercise of the respondent's discretion.

  26. The respondent argued that it had been open to her  to  conclude  that
      the earnings claimed were not genuine:   there  was  no  duty  on  the
      respondent to seek further evidence or  to  invite  the  applicant  to
      explain the discrepancy.  As to  the  Tameside  duty,  the  respondent
      relied on the observation of Lord Diplock at 1065b:  the question  for
      the reviewing Court or Tribunal was 'did the Secretary  of  State  ask
      himself the right question  and  take  reasonable  steps  to  acquaint
      himself with the relevant information  to  enable  him  to  answer  it
      correctly'.  That was what she had done.

  27. The respondent also relied on the judgment of Lord Justice Sales in EK
      (Ivory Coast) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 1517 at [20]: the points-based system set  out  what  had  to
      accompany an application, to enable the  respondent  to  process  high
      volumes of applications in a fair and reasonably  expeditious  manner,
      according to clear objective criteria.  At [31] in his judgment, Sales
      LJ observed that 'application of  the  duty  of  fairness  should  not
      result in the public benefits associated with having such a clear  and
      predictable scheme operating according  to  objective  criteria  being
      placed in serious jeopardy'.  The gist of the evidence relied upon was
      in the refusal  letter  and  that  was  sufficient  to  discharge  the
      fairness obligation.

  28. As regards post-decision evidence, the applicant appeared to  consider
      that the decision was in reality  taken  under  paragraph  322(2)  not
      322(5).  That was a misplaced submission: the respondent's refusal was
      made under paragraph 322(5) and the fact that paragraph  322(2)  might
      also be applicable was immaterial.  Nor was there  any  obligation  on
      the respondent to consider granting leave to remain outside the  Rules
      at the administrative review stage.  Her decision not to  depart  from
      the Immigration Rules was rational and was not so fettered.

  29. The new evidence produced would not  have  changed  the  outcome:  the
      claim  that  the  under-declaration  was  the  responsibility  of  the
      applicant's accountants was incredible.  The applicant was responsible
      for ensuring that correct information was  given  to  HMRC  about  her
      earnings, and the explanation  about  'failures  in  systems'  by  the
      accountants was no explanation at all. It was just  unbelievable  that
      the applicant would not have noticed the difference when she paid  her
      tax for 2010-2011 and 2012-2013.

  30. There was no material public law error in the  respondent's  decisions
      and the reviewing Tribunal therefore had no power to  interfere.   The
      applicant's character and conduct fell within paragraph 322(5), on any
      view, and the application should be dismissed.

Rule 15(2A) application

  31. On 14 June 2017, the applicant applied for  permission  to  amend  her
      grounds and to adduce further explanatory and/or exculpatory material,
      obtained after the commencement of these judicial review  proceedings.
      Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan  refused  permission  for  the  post-issue
      materials.  However, he granted the applicant  permission  to  advance
      the arguments at [9]-[30] in the proposed  amended  grounds,  as  they
      were not novel.

  32. The contents of that application had  been  known  to  the  respondent
      since the judicial review application was made,  and  the  application
      was renewed at the oral permission hearing, but the new  evidence  was
      not admitted and is not summarised here, as  it  remains  outside  the
      scope of these proceedings.

  33. The applicants' amended grounds for review at [9]-[30]  reframe  their
      arguments in the following way:

     a) The applicants contend  that  the  respondent  has  misapplied  and
        misinterpreted paragraph 322(5), and misapplied her own  policy  as
        set out in her modernised guidance, General  Grounds  for  Refusal,
        Section 4, v 26.0, which requires  any  decision  to  refuse  under
        paragraph 322(5) to be approved by a senior caseworker.    Decision
        makers   must   give   specific   reasons,   not   include    vague
        generalisations   about   a   person's   character,   conduct    or
        associations, refer only to the specific reason why the application
        was being refused, and omit any reference to national  security  in
        the refusal notice.  Decision makers are required to  be  alive  to
        the possibility of  an  innocent  explanation  for  the  giving  of
        incorrect information to other government departments such as HMRC;

     b) The applicants submitted that the paragraph  322(5)  threshold  was
        high; that the respondent required clear and reliable  evidence  of
        sufficiently reprehensible conduct to support the undesirability of
        a person's presence in the United Kingdom; and that such a decision
        was a serious one, which should be taken  after  careful  scrutiny.
        The respondent was then required to consider whether, having regard
        to the evidence before her, it was reasonable  and  appropriate  in
        all the circumstances to invoke paragraph 322(5).  The  welfare  of
        any minor children, and any apparent human rights issues, should be
        taken into account at  this  stage.    In  brief,  the  applicants'
        contention was that the conduct identified in  the  refusal  letter
        was insufficiently reprehensible.

     c) The applicants contended that the  administrative  review  decision
        did not suggest that the principal applicant had been dishonest  in
        her dealings with HMRC, although the original refusal letter did so
        suggest; and that primary authority for policing  tax  matters  lay
        with HMRC and they had not imposed any penalty after accepting  the
        revised tax returns, save to seek to collect the tax  due.   It  is
        their case that HMRC accepted that the error was one of negligence,
        not dishonesty, and that HMRC's approach, if  not  binding  on  the
        respondent, should carry weight in the respondent's  assessment  of
        the exercise of her own discretion under paragraph 322(5).

     d) The June 2016 refusal  letter  contained  standard  paragraphs,  at
        least one of which was inaccurate, as the principal  applicant  had
        not  yet  given  the  respondent  any  explanation  of  her  under-
        declaration to HMRC, as she  continued  to  characterise  it.   The
        respondent had fettered her decision  making,  acting  unreasonably
        and potentially in bad faith.

  34. The rest of the  amended  grounds  was  not  admitted  and  I  am  not
      concerned with that in these proceedings.  The  applicants  have  been
      aware since his decision on 28 July 2017 that Judge Jordan  considered
      that items [2] to [5] of the proposed amended grounds set out  in  the
      application of 14 June 2017 were not within the permissible  scope  of
      judicial review proceedings and that he refused leave to amend in that
      way.  Judge Jordan's grant of leave to remain is expressly limited  to
      [9]-[30] of the Reply and Further Grounds.

  35. The respondent responded to the  application  to  amend.  Given  Judge
      Jordan's decision, and the contents of the response, I do not need  to
      deal with that document in detail.

  36. That was the basis on which the  application  came  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal on 1 August 2017.

Respondent's breach of directions

  37. Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Perkins'  grant  of  permission  directed  the
      respondent to submit detailed grounds   within 35 days, and a skeleton
      argument not less than 7 days before the hearing.   The respondent did
      not make any paid application to  vary  the  order  that  she  file  a
      skeleton argument before the hearing.  However,  she  did  not  comply
      with the directions: instead, she filed detailed  grounds  which  were
      stated to stand also as her skeleton argument.

  38. I have considered whether that is a breach engaging rule 7(2)  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as  amended).   I  am
      satisfied that it is.  There should have been detailed grounds  and  a
      separate skeleton argument. I also note that the  applicants  did  not
      take the point until the substantive hearing before me.

  39. I remind myself that the respondent's failure to comply with the Upper
      Tribunal's direction does not of itself render the proceedings, or any
      step taken therein, void (rule 7(1) of the Rules).   I  may,  however,
      take such action as I consider just under rule 7(2), including but not
      limited to waiving  the  requirement,  requiring  the  failure  to  be
      remedied, striking out a party's case under rule 8, or  restricting  a
      party's participation in the proceedings, 'except in ...an asylum case
      or  an  immigration  case'.   The  definition  of  'asylum  case'  and
      'immigration case' is  restricted  to  proceedings  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal, in each case, 'on  appeal  against  a  decision'.   Judicial
      review is not an appeal and this application  is  not  an  immigration
      case.

  40. The Upper Tribunal's directions are to be respected and obeyed by  the
      parties:  there is a  difference  between  the  function  of  detailed
      grounds and that of a skeleton argument.  On this occasion, I consider
      it just to waive the requirement for a skeleton argument and allow the
      detailed grounds to stand as such.

  41. I  do  not  consider  it  appropriate  to  restrict  the  respondent's
      participation in the  hearing  in  this  instance,  but  I  will  hear
      submissions on any costs  implications  arising  from  her  breach  of
      directions.

Paragraph 245CD of the Immigration Rules

  42. The applicable paragraph of the Rules, so far as  material,  reads  as
      follows:

           "245CD      Requirements for indefinite leave to remain

           To qualify for indefinite leave to remain, a  Tier  1  (General)
           Migrant  must  meet  the  requirements  listed  below.   If  the
           applicant meets these requirements, indefinite leave  to  remain
           will  be  granted.   If  the  applicant  does  not  meet   these
           requirements, the application will be refused.

           Requirements: ...

            b) The applicant must not fall for refusal  under  the  general
               grounds for refusal (except that paragraph 322(1C) shall not
               apply if the applicant meets the conditions in  (f)(i)-(iii)
               below), and must not be an illegal entrant.

            c) The  applicant  must  have  spent  a  continuous  period  as
               specified in (d) lawfully in  the  UK,  of  which  the  most
               recent period must have been spent as  a  Tier  1  (General)
               Migrant, in any of the following categories:

                  i) as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, ...

            d) The continuous period in (c) is ...

               (ii) 5 years, in all other cases."

  43. The respondent relies on the  general  grounds  for  refusal,  and  in
      particular on paragraph 322(5) of those grounds.  So far  as  relevant
      to these proceedings, the general grounds are as follows:

           "322  In addition to the grounds for  refusal  of  extension  of
           stay set  out  in  Parts  2-8  of  these  Rules,  the  following
           provisions apply in relation to the refusal  of  an  application
           for leave to remain, variation of leave to enter or  remain  or,
           where appropriate, the curtailment of leave,  except  that  only
           paragraphs (1A), (1B), (5), (5A), (9) and (10)  shall  apply  in
           the case of an application made under paragraph  159I  of  these
           Rules.

           Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter
           or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused ...

           (1A)  where  false  representations  have  been  made  or  false
           documents or information have been  submitted  (whether  or  not
           material  to  the  application,  and  whether  or  not  to   the
           applicant's  knowledge),  or  material  facts  have   not   been
           disclosed, in relation to the application or in order to  obtain
           documents from the Secretary of State or a third party  required
           in support of the application. ...

           Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter
           or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused

           (2) the making  of  false  representations  or  the  failure  to
           disclose any material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave to
           enter or a previous variation of leave or  in  order  to  obtain
           documents from the Secretary of State or a third party  required
           in support of the application for leave to enter or  a  previous
           variation of leave. ...

           (5) the undesirability of permitting  the  person  concerned  to
           remain in the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
           (including  convictions  which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
           322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact   that   he
           represents     a     threat     to      national      security;"
           [Emphasis added]

Submissions

  44. For the respondent, Mr Malik relied on the Upper  Tribunal's  guidance
      in R (SA) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  (human  rights
      challenges:  correct  approach)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT  536  (IAC).    The
      relevance of that decision is not clear:  the  decision  concerns  the
      distinction between public law grounds and human rights  grounds,  but
      human rights are not in issue here.

  45. Mr Malik reminded me of the Tameside[1] formulation: did the  decision
      maker ask herself the right question  and  take  reasonable  steps  to
      acquaint herself with the relevant information to enable her to answer
      it correctly? At [31] in the judgment of  Lord  Justice  Sales  in  EK
      (Ivory Coast) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA
      Civ 1517, the Court of Appeal held that application  of  the  duty  of
      fairness 'should not result in the  public  benefits  associated  with
      having such a  clear  and  predictable  scheme  [as  the  points-based
      system] operating in accordance with objective criteria  being  placed
      in serious jeopardy'.

  46. R (Kaur) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1538
      (Admin) extended the gisting obligation to the Secretary of State.  It
      was not suggested that the gist of the evidence was not known  to  the
      applicant at the material times.  The Secretary of State was  entitled
      to have mandatory and inflexible immigration rules and to  apply  them
      consistently (see R (Thebo) v Entry Clearance Officer [2013] EWHC  146
      (Admin)), and to prefer one rule to  another,  where  several  of  the
      general grounds applied (see, by analogy, RK (Nepal)  v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 359 and Patel and others
      v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 72).

  47. For the applicants, Mr Biggs in the amended grounds relied on what  he
      characterised as a requirement for a heightened standard of Wednesbury
      review, as extrapolated from the opinion of Lord Mance  JSC  at  [51]-
      [54] in the decision of the Supreme Court in  Kennedy  v  The  Charity
      Commission [2014] UKSC 20 and at [32] in the judgment of Lord  Justice
      Richards in R (Giri) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2015] EWCA Civ 784, when he said that a finding of dishonesty  was  a
      finding  that  deception  had  been  used,  and  that  it  'should  be
      scrutinised very  carefully'.   The  appellant  contended  that  every
      factor which might tell in her favour should  be  taken  into  account
      (see [24] in the judgment of Lord Justice Carnwath (as  he  then  was)
      inYH (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2010]  EWCA
      Civ 116).  The respondent's refusal to allow the applicants to respond
      to her concerns was procedurally unfair and  this  was  not  a  simple
      points-based system case.

  48. Mr Biggs submitted that the  respondent  was  bound  to  consider  the
      further evidence advanced with the administrative review  application,
      even though it was post-decision and did not form part of the material
      before the caseworker when  she  made  her  decision.   There  was  no
      evidence that the decision of the first caseworker had  been  approved
      by a senior caseworker as the respondent's own guidance required.   Mr
      Biggs relied on the high standard set  for  paragraph  322(5)  in  the
      respondent's casework guidance entitled General  Grounds  for  refusal
      section 4 v 26.0:

           "...A person does not need to have been convicted of a  criminal
           offence for this provision to apply.  When deciding  whether  to
           refuse under this category, the key  thing  to  consider  is  if
           there is reliable  evidence  to  support  a  decision  that  the
           person's behaviour calls into question  their  character  and/or
           conduct and/or their associations  to  the  extent  that  it  is
           undesirable to allow them to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom. ... If you are not sure the evidence  to  support  your
           decision is reliable, then speak to your line manager or  senior
           caseworker."

  49. HMRC had accepted the  amended  tax  returns,  imposed  penalties  and
      agreed a payment schedule with the applicants.  Mr Biggs wished me  to
      draw the conclusion that HMRC did not consider that the appellant  had
      used deception and that it was therefore not open to the respondent to
      do so. Unallayed suspicion was not sufficient.  The  respondent  could
      have asked HMRC for its view of the applicant's  bona  fides:  it  was
      open to her to make that enquiry but she had not done so.

  50. The respondent's GCID notes did not indicate that the  caseworker  had
      consulted a senior  caseworker  before  making  the  decision  not  to
      exercise discretion in the applicants' favour under paragraph  322(5).
      Mr Biggs argued, in effect, that failure to  record  in  GCID  that  a
      senior caseworker  had  been  consulted,  was  a  material  procedural
      irregularity rendering it ultra vires  the  caseworker  to  refuse  to
      exercise discretion in the applicants' favour in relation to the under-
      declaration of tax (as they say it was).

  51. Mr Biggs contended that these applicants should  have  been  given  an
      opportunity during the application process to make submissions on  the
      deception/under-declaration  issue.  The  respondent  had   unlawfully
      fettered her decision making by failing to ask the applicants  whether
      they had an innocent explanation.  In so  doing,  Mr  Biggs  contended
      that the respondent had acted unreasonably,  and  potentially  in  bad
      faith. The applicant had paid all tax on her employed income,  at  all
      times, albeit her self-employed income had been  incorrectly  declared
      in 2011 and 2013.  It had not been open to the respondent to  conclude
      that the higher income was a fiction, to enable the applicant to  make
      the present application and score sufficient income points.

  52. Mr Biggs' skeleton argument followed much the same scheme.  He  argued
      that the applicant had  produced  a  statement  from  herself,  and  a
      detailed letter from her accountant in which  they  accepted  complete
      and sole responsibility for the under-declaration of tax in  2011  and
      2013, and the failure to file a  tax  return  at  all  in  2014.   The
      respondent had  erred  in  failing  to  admit  this  evidence  to  the
      administrative review consideration, as the caseworker's finding  that
      leave should be refused for one of the general grounds for refusal was
      a caseworking error.  The applicants' case was that they had committed
      no dishonesty.

Discussion

  53. The circumstances in this application are not as complex as  Mr  Biggs
      for the applicants seeks to make them.  The principal applicant  bears
      personal responsibility for her tax  returns.   She  would  have  been
      aware that she paid much less tax than would normally have been due on
      such a large amount of self-employed income.

  54. The difference in her claimed income  is  not  marginal,  nor  is  the
      difference in liability to tax.  The additional tax to be paid is over
      �15,000 and the applicant has gained a benefit by her conduct: so far,
      she has paid only �3000 down and perhaps �1200 in instalments, and  is
      being permitted to pay the rest over 9 years.  That is  a  significant
      financial and fiscal advantage.

  55.  In  addition,  the  applicant,  once  aware  of  the   circumstances,
      consciously withheld the information from the respondent's caseworker.
      The questionnaire which she  completed  at  her  appointment  was  her
      opportunity to furnish an innocent explanation, but she did  not  take
      it.  The applicant was in full possession of all  the  material  facts
      then, whatever the position in the past.

  56. The assertion that the questionnaire could be answered  truthfully  by
      the principal applicant in the manner set  out  above  will  not  bear
      scrutiny, and no weight is added to that by the accountants' assertion
      to the contrary.  When  asked,  "Are  you  satisfied  that  the  self-
      assessment tax returns submitted to HMRC accurately reflect your self-
      employed income?", the applicant could have said that her returns were
      incorrect in the past,  but  had  been  corrected,  and  produced  the
      explanatory letter she had with her.  That would have been  an  honest
      response.  A simple 'Yes' was a deceitful response and  one  on  which
      the respondent was entitled to rely.

  57. The respondent chose to apply paragraph 322(5) of the general  grounds
      for refusal, which is one of those for which leave to enter or  remain
      'should normally be refused'.  That  implies  a  discretion  to  grant
      leave  in  appropriate  circumstances,  but  on  this  occasion,   the
      respondent by her caseworker decided not to exercise discretion in the
      applicants' favour.

  58. The respondent's primary conclusion appears to be that  the  applicant
      lied, either to the  respondent  (to  gain  more  points  for  earlier
      applications) or to HMRC, to save or delay the payment of the tax  due
      on her self-employed income.  On  the  evidence,  the  respondent  was
      unarguably entitled to conclude that the applicant had used deception,
      certainly to the respondent, and perhaps also to  HMRC,  depending  on
      whether  she  actually  earned  the  money  now  the  subject  of  the
      additional declaration.

  59. It could be argued that the applicants' conduct also engages paragraph
      322(1A) and paragraph  322(2)  but  I  am  not  concerned  with  those
      provisions: it is a matter for the respondent  to  decide  which  sub-
      paragraph she relies upon in any decision, and judicial review applies
      only to the decision she took, not  a  different  decision  which  she
      might have taken.

  60. As regards the  administrative  review  decision,  Mr  Biggs  errs  in
      considering that it was open to the respondent to  take  into  account
      post-decision evidence.  The administrative review is a review of  the
      original decision, on the evidence before the original caseworker,  as
      the statute and the Rules make clear.  That would have been  the  case
      if the decision had been made under paragraph 322(1A) or 322(2) of the
      Rules, but it was not.  The list of caseworking  errors  in  paragraph
      AR2.11 of Appendix AR of the Immigration Rules  does  not  stretch  to
      include post-decision, or post-issue evidence of the type on which the
      applicant seeks to rely.

  61. Even if the new evidence had been admitted, it would not have absolved
      the applicants of their responsibility,  and  that  of  the  principal
      applicant in particular, to declare all income  earned,  employed  and
      self-employed, in each tax year, and to pay tax on it as required.  It
      is beyond credit that the principal applicant could have mistaken  the
      amount chargeable to  tax  for  the  small  self-employed  income  she
      declared for the correct tax charge for the large  income  now  relied
      upon, however incompetent her accountants may have been.

  62. It is right that the respondent's GCID record does not state expressly
      that the respondent's caseworker consulted a senior caseworker  before
      deciding to refuse  this  application  under  paragraph  322(5).   The
      guidance states that it is not necessary for a  person  to  have  been
      convicted of a criminal offence for paragraph 322(5) to be applicable.
       The respondent's guidance requires the caseworker to do  so,  and  to
      give specific reasons to refuse under this sub-paragraph:  absence  of
      evidence in this respect is not evidence that the consultation did not
      occur.

  63. Nor, even if such an error  occurred,  am  I  satisfied  that  it  was
      material to the outcome of this application. It was unarguably open to
      the respondent to find that the applicants intended  to  deceive,  not
      just by acceptance of  the  enormously  reduced  tax  liability  which
      followed  from  the  under-declaration,  but  also  in  the  principal
      applicant's considered decision to withhold  any  disclosure  of  that
      under-declaration to HMRC on the day of her  appointment,  unless  she
      was asked for it.  I have regard to the  incorrect  answer  which  the
      principal applicant gave in the  questionnaire  she  completed,  which
      again failed to  disclose  the  past  under-declaration.    I  am  not
      persuaded that the question asked could  be  truthfully  so  answered,
      despite her accountants' assertion to that effect.

  64. There was no public law error by the respondent  in  her  handling  of
      this application.  Judicial review is a discretionary  remedy  and  is
      inappropriate here.

  65. I refuse judicial review of  the  respondent's  decision,  or  of  the
      administrative review decision.

Costs

  66. For the applicants,  Mr  Biggs  argued  that,  in  the  light  of  the
      respondent's late submission of her detailed grounds   and failure  to
      file any skeleton argument or costs schedule, detailed  assessment  of
      costs is disproportionate and unfair.

  67. For the respondent, Mr Malik submits  that  costs  should  follow  the
      event. The respondent has successfully defended the present claim, and
      should not be penalised for her attempt to assist the  Upper  Tribunal
      by combining the detailed grounds and skeleton argument  in  a  single
      document (see [38] above).

  68. The applicant had not objected to this approach  before  the  hearing,
      nor had it been suggested that she was prejudiced by the  lateness  of
      the detailed grounds or their standing as  the  respondent's  skeleton
      argument. No new points were raised at the hearing which  went  beyond
      the scope of the detailed grounds/skeleton argument and Mr  Biggs  had
      not suggested at the hearing that the appellants  were  prejudiced  or
      unable to deal with the matters raised therein.

  69. I agree.  The applicants will pay  the  respondent's  costs  of  these
      proceedings, to be assessed if not agreed.

Application for permission to appeal

  70. For the applicants, Mr Biggs seeks permission to appeal to  the  Court
      of Appeal.  He contends that my judgment goes beyond what is  required
      for judicial review, and that it was not open to me to  conclude  that
      even had the additional evidence been admitted in  the  administrative
      review, it would have made no difference.  In particular, he considers
      that I should not have taken notice of the direct untruth told by  the
      applicants in response to the questionnaire. The respondent  did  have
      regard to that deception at page 3 of 6 in the refusal letter for  the
      principal applicant. I have explained in my judgment  why  I  consider
      the deception in the questionnaire response to be  material:  by  that
      time, the applicant was aware of the under-declaration  and  even  had
      with her an exculpatory letter from her accountants, but  still  chose
      not to disclose that the 2011 and 2013  self-assessment  returns  were
      inaccurate.

  71. Mr Biggs asserted in his grounds of appeal, that  at  the  hearing,  I
      indicated that all of the amended grounds considered by Upper Tribunal
      Judge Jordan could be argued, on a proper reading  of  Judge  Jordan's
      order.  That is not correct.  Judge Jordan's order  is  plain  on  its
      face and the only matters which were before me were those set  out  at
      [9]-[30] of the amended grounds. The excluded  arguments  concern  the
      applicants' assertion that the respondent had applied paragraph 322(2)
      not  paragraph  322(5),  and  therefore  should  have   admitted   the
      exculpatory material thereunder; that it was procedurally  unfair  not
      to allow the applicants to respond to the paragraph 322(5) allegations
      of deception and undesirability; and that the respondent  should  have
      considered new evidence during the administrative review, pursuant  to
      her Tameside duty.

  72. As set out above, it is not open to the applicants to choose which sub-
      paragraphs of the Rules are relied  upon  by  the  respondent.   In  a
      judicial review application, the Upper Tribunal reviews  the  decision
      actually made, rather than that which the applicants submit  that  the
      respondent  might  have  made.   The  paragraph  322(2)  argument   is
      irrelevant for that reason, as is the assertion that  the  exculpatory
      material is admissible where, as here, it was obtained after the issue
      of these proceedings, and the exhaustion of the  Pre-Action  Protocol.
      Judge Jordan rightly excluded those arguments and I did not admit them
      at the hearing.

  73.  In  addition,  the  applicants  continue  to  rely  on  the  lack  of
      confirmation in the  GCID  record  that  the  respondent's  caseworker
      consulted a senior caseworker before refusing to  exercise  discretion
      in the applicants' favour under paragraph 322(5) of the  Rules.    For
      the reasons given above, this is a plain case of  deception  and  that
      procedural step, whether or not taken, would not have  resulted  in  a
      different outcome.

  74. Mr Malik for the respondent argues that there is no point  of  law  in
      this application which merits the Court of Appeal's attention  and  no
      other compelling reason for the  Court  of  Appeal  to  hear  it.   He
      invites me to refuse permission to appeal.

  75. I refuse permission.  I am not satisfied that the proposed grounds  of
      appeal disclose any properly arguable error of law in my judgment.
