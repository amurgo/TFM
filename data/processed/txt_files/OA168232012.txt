Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    The Sponsor, Mr J Mankin


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer, New  York  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing an  appeal  by  Mr  Rangel
    against the  decision  made  on  22  August  2012  refusing  him  entry
    clearance as a partner.  In this determination  I  will  refer  to  the
    parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Rangel  as  the
    appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as the respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of the  Philippines,  born  on  17  February
    1981.  It was his case that he met Mr Mankin, the sponsor, in New  York
    where they were both working and a relationship  formed  between  them.
    When they first met they both had their own separate apartments subject
    to separate leases and because of their commitment to their  respective
    landlords, it was not possible to provide evidence of a  joint  tenancy
    but  they  regularly   visited   each   other   at   their   respective
    accommodation.  After the appellant's US visa expired he went to Canada
    where he and the sponsor married under Canadian law on 7 December 2011.
     When his leave in Canada expired, the appellant returned to  Singapore
    where he found employment.  The sponsor returned to  the  UK  in  early
    2012 but did not secure employment until April 2012.  In July 2012  the
    appellant applied for entry clearance.

3.   His application was refused because the respondent  was  not  satisfied
    that the appellant and the sponsor were in a relationship, there  being
    no adequate evidence to show that they  had  maintained  contact,  that
    their relationship was genuine and subsisting or that the appellant was
    unable to meet the financial requirements of the rules, failing to show
    the sponsor had a gross income of at least �18,600 a year in accordance
    with the evidence specified in the rules.

4.   In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal it was argued  that
    their relationship was real  and  that  sufficient  evidence  had  been
    supplied to show that there was a subsisting relationship and that  the
    financial requirements of the rules could be met.

The Hearing in Front of the First-tier Tribunal

5.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  the  sponsor  gave  oral
    evidence.  He confirmed the fact of the  relationship.   He  said  that
    since his return to the UK he had managed  to  secure  employment  with
    POWA Technology Limited (POWA).  His evidence was confirmed by payslips
    and a letter from his employers.  The judge commented that the  sponsor
    produced in support of the appeal copies of itemised  telephone  bills,
    voluminous pages of emails and texts, copies of his  tax  returns  from
    the USA, his payslips and bank statements.

6.   The judge was satisfied that the sponsor's evidence was consistent  and
    credible and found that there was evidence of continued contact between
    him and the appellant over a substantial period of time.  She  accepted
    in  the  light  of  the  volume  of  evidence  presented   that   their
    relationship was genuine and subsisting.

7.   She then went on to deal with the issue of the  financial  requirements
    of the rules as follows:

         "13. With regard to the financial requirements of  the  Immigration
             Rules under paragraph  E-ECP3.1  the  appellant  must  provide
             evidence that he or his sponsor has an  annual  income  of  at
             least �18,600.  Mr  Mankin  has  provided  oral  evidence  and
             documentary evidence of his annual income  which  exceeds  the
             requirement of �18,600 per annum.  In  these  circumstances  I
             find  that  the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of   the
             Immigration Rules and I therefore allow this appeal".

The Grounds and Submissions

8.   In the respondent's grounds it is argued that the judge  erred  in  law
    by failing to give adequate reasons for her decision that the financial
    requirements of the rules were met.

9.   Permission to appeal was granted on the basis  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable, firstly  in light of the documentary  evidence  specified  in
    Appendix FM and secondly,  that  it  was  apparent  from  [13]  of  the
    determination that the judge had failed to identify the  documents  and
    give adequate reasons why she concluded that the requirements were met.



10.  At the hearing before me Mr Walker adopted the  grounds  and  submitted
    that the judge had not adequately reasoned her findings.   It  was  not
    clear on  what  basis  she  had  reached  her  decision.   The  sponsor
    explained that when the application had been made, they  had  submitted
    such evidence as was available but he accepted that  his  payslips  for
    his employment in the  UK  did  not  cover  a  six  month  period.   He
    explained that he had moved back to  the  UK  in  January  2012  having
    previously lived in the USA.  When the  application  was  made  he  was
    earning a salary of �24,000 which had  now  increased  to  �36,000  per
    year.

The Error of Law

11.  I am satisfied that the judge erred in law by failing to give  adequate
    reasons for her findings and conclusions on the issue of the  financial
    requirements of the rules.  Although she has referred in general  terms
    to the evidence submitted in support of the application and appeal, she
    has not dealt with the concerns that at the  date  of  application  and
    decision the sponsor had been unable to show employment for a period of
    six months as required by the rules.  I am satisfied that the  decision
    should be set aside.  Both Mr Walker and the sponsor were content  that
    I should re-make the decision on the basis of the evidence before me.

Re-making the Decision

12.  The sponsor confirmed that he has dual nationality for the USA and  the
    UK.  He had moved to the USA in  1995  and  had  subsequently  obtained
    employment with IBM where his last gross salary was in  the  region  of
    �60,000 in 2007-08.  At  that  stage  he  was  able  to  give  up  that
    employment because he received a legacy from an aunt leaving  him  half
    of her pension.  He was able to live off his  inheritance  supplemented
    by income from freelance work.

13.  In order to obtain entry clearance on the basis of family life  with  a
    partner the appellant has  to  meet  the  requirements  of  EC-P  which
    require him to meet all the requirements of  E-ECP.   No  issue  arises
    under S-EC on suitability and the judge  accepted  that  the  appellant
    could meet the relationship requirements in E-ECP2 and there  has  been
    no challenge to that  decision.   The  issue  for  me  is  whether  the
    appellant is able to meet the financial requirements in E-ECP3.1.

14.  The relevant requirements are as follows:

         "E-ECP.3.1    The applicant must provide specified  evidence,  from
                    the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2, of -
                    (a)    a specified gross annual income of at least -
                        (i)    �18,600; ..."


    The specified evidence is set out in Schedule FM-SE which at  the  date
    of decision in this appeal required in respect of  salaried  employment
    in the UK that the following evidence must be provided: a P60  for  the
    relevant period of all periods of  employment  relied  on,  wage  slips
    covering a period of  six  months  prior  to  the  application  if  the
    applicant has been employed by their current employer for at least  six
    months or any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of  twelve
    months prior to the date of  application  if  the  applicant  has  been
    employed by their current employer for  less  than  six  months  and  a
    letter from the employer who issued  the  wage  slips  confirming  full
    details of the employment.


15.  The schedule also sets out the requirements for proving  other  sources
    of income such as those in respect of an overseas pension at para 10(e)
    requiring official documentation from an overseas pension authority and
    one monthly bank statement showing payment of the pension. It  is  also
    provided that  in  respect  of  salaried  employment  outside  the  UK,
    evidence should be a reasonable equivalent  to  that  set  out  for  UK
    income.

16.  I must look at the position as at the  date  of  decision  but  by  the
    provisions of s.85(5) and s85A(2) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, I may only consider the circumstances appertaining  at
    that time.  However, this is not  a  case  where  I  am  restricted  to
    considering only the evidence adduced in support of and at the time  of
    making the application to which the decision relates as exception 2 set
    out in s85A(3) does not apply.

17.  The sponsor accepts that  he  was  unable  to  submit  six  months'  UK
    payslips with the application as he had only been  employed  for  three
    months at that time.  But his payslips from May to July  2012  do  show
    that he was in receipt of a gross income of �24,000 a year.   A  letter
    dated 1 September 2012  from  POWA  was  produced  confirming  that  he
    started employment on 30 April 2012 on a salary of �24,000 a year as an
    IOS software engineer.

18.  However, evidence was also  produced  of  the  sponsor's  previous  tax
    returns to the US authorities.  The tax return for 2011 for tax year  1
    Jan - 31 Dec 2011 confirms that the income  received  from  his  aunt's
    legacy was taxable in  the  sum  of  $130,485.   On  this  basis  I  am
    satisfied that there is evidence of sufficient income in the US  before
    the appellant returned to this country and that he is able to show that
    he has had a gross income of at least �18,600 for  a  period  exceeding
    twelve months prior  to  the  date  of  application.   I  am  satisfied
    accordingly that he is able to meet the substantive requirements of the
    rules.

19.  I would in any event have found in the light of the judgement of  Blake
    J in MM and others [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) that a refusal on the basis
    of a failure to meet the strict requirements of the  rules  as  to  the
    specific evidence to be produced in respect of his income  and  pension
    in circumstances where the evidence is clear that the sponsor had  more
    than sufficient income to meet  the  substantive  requirements  of  the
    rules would have led to a disproportionate interference with the  right
    of the appellant and sponsor to respect for their  private  and  family
    life and I would have allowed the appeal on article 8 grounds.

Decision

20.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  I set aside the decision.  I re-
    make  the  decision  allowing  the  appeal  against  refusal  of  entry
    clearance as a partner.  The costs  decision  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.
