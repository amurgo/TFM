For the Appellant:     Mr E Shrestha, Counsel instructed by Arkas Law
For the Respondent:    Ms H Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who was born on 7 January 1991.
       His father (now deceased) was a Gurkha soldier, who retired in 1969.

    2. On 21 July 2017 the appellant and his mother (his father's widow)
       applied for leave to enter and settle in the UK. The appellant's
       mother's application was allowed and she moved the UK.

    3. The appellant's application was refused.  The appellant appealed to
       the First-tier Tribunal where his appeal was heard by Judge of the
       First-tier Tribunal Bulpitt who, in a decision promulgated on 12
       October 2018, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant is now appealing
       against that decision.

  Background

    4. The appellant's father served in the British Army as a Gurkha between
       1959 and 1969.  He was discharged with exemplary service.

    5. The appellant's father married in 1969 and had three children.  The
       appellant is the oldest of the children.  The other two children are
       married and live independently with their families in Nepal.

    6. The appellant has lived all of his life within the family home with
       his mother (and father until he died) apart from a period of 14
       months in 2012/13 when the appellant worked in the United Arab
       Emirates (UAE).

    7. Since coming to the UK the appellant's mother has sent money to the
       appellant.  The appellant's bundle included money transfer receipts
       in respect of seven transfers between 10 February 2018 and 11
       September 2018.

  Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    8. The judge found that there was a paucity of evidence about the
       circumstances of the appellant.  He noted at Paragraph 19 that the
       appellant had not made a statement and therefore there was no
       evidence from him about his relationship with his mother.

    9. The judge found that there was a lack of detail to support the
       appellant's mother's claim that she and the appellant share a close
       emotional bond and high level of support.  The judge found that there
       was a lack of detail in the appellant's mother's account about the
       appellant and found that this undermined her assertion that there was
       a high level of emotional support and dependency.

   10. The judge found that the appellant's mother had a lack of awareness
       about the work undertaken by the appellant in UAE and found that her
       lack of knowledge was inconsistent with the claimed high level of
       dependency.

   11. The judge attached significant weight to the evidence of the
       appellant living and working independently in the UAE.  At paragraph
       22 he stated:

           "Not only does it demonstrate a level of independence which is
           inconsistent with the application being made, it also shows an
           ability to find and sustain employment which makes the claim
           that he has never worked in eleven years in Nepal and that he
           could not work now incongruous."

   12. The judge did not accept the appellant's mother's claim that the
       appellant is completely dependent on her financially.  The judge
       noted that no money was sent to the appellant during the first three
       months the appellant's mother was in the UK and that only ï¿½550 was
       sent over the following nine months.

   13. At paragraph 24 the judge stated:

           "I found therefore a distinct lack of detail about the
           circumstances of the appellant's life and the nature of his
           relationship with his mother beyond the very general comments
           about their closeness.  When the evidence was probed a bit
           closer it became clear that the appellant's mother was unable to
           give detail about the appellant - e.g., whether he had school
           friends, how he got to UAE - and was unable to give specifics of
           the support she gave her son."

   14. The judge, having made the findings of fact described above,
       considered whether the policy known as "Annex K - adult children of
       former Gerkhas" was satisfied, and concluded that it was not on the
       basis that the appellant had not established that he is financially
       and emotionally dependent on his mother.

   15. The judge also found that the appellant had not established that
       there is family life between him and his mother that engages Article
       8 of the ECHR.  The judge found at paragraph 32:

           "Whilst it is clear on the evidence from the appellant's mother
           that she and the appellant share a close affection, the evidence
           does not establish on the balance of probabilities that there is
           something more than the 'normal' love and affection between an
           adult and his mother.  Instead the lack of detail and the
           appellant's mother was able to give of the appellant's life and
           the evidence of the appellant's living and working independently
           means that it is more likely than not that the appellant is
           living an independent life."

  Grounds of appeal and submissions

   16. The grounds of appeal argue that it was unreasonable, given the
       factual findings, for the judge to conclude that Article 8(1) was not
       engaged.  The grounds cite several Court of Appeal cases to support
       this submission, including Rai v Entry Clearance Officer [2017] EWCA
       Civ 320 and Singh v Secretary of State [2015] EWCA Civ 630.

   17. The grounds assert that the judge erred by failing to consider in
       assessing Article 8(1) the historic injustice to Gurkhas, and that
       but for this injustice the appellant's father would have settled in
       the UK with the appellant many years earlier.

   18. The grounds also contend that the judge attached too much weight to
       the fact that the appellant worked overseas for 14 months and that
       insufficient regard was had to the decision of the appellant to
       return to Nepal because he could not live apart from his mother.

   19. The grounds also contend that the judge failed to appreciate that the
       sum of money transferred to the appellant by his mother is sufficient
       for maintenance in Nepal, given that the appellant is living in the
       family home, and that the reason money was not sent in the first
       three months was that the appellant's mother was not in receipt of
       benefits during her initial period in the UK.

   20. It also contended in the grounds that the judge failed to consider
       unchallenged evidence that the appellant is unemployed, unmarried and
       lives in the family home and as such is not independent from his
       mother in any way and does not have any other source of income.

   21. The grounds also argued that the judge failed to appreciate that the
       proportionality assessment under Article 8 inevitably must fall in
       favour of the appellant given the weight to be attached to the
       historic injustice.

   22. In his oral submissions Mr Shrestha developed the argument made in
       the grounds.  He submitted that the only reason the judge found that
       Annex K was not satisfied was that the appellant was not "financially
       and emotionally" dependent on his mother.  However, in Mr Shrestha's
       view, the evidence demonstrates that he was dependent.  The only
       period in which money was not sent was the first three months in
       which the appellant's mother was in the UK and the reason was that
       she was yet to start receiving her benefits and therefore was not in
       a position to send money during that three month period.   All
       evidence, in his view, points to there being a high level of ongoing
       financial dependency.

   23. He also argued that the judge had failed to take into account the
       decision in Rai, which shows that family life must be looked at at
       the time the appellant's mother left Nepal, not just at the present
       time.  He also argued that the judge had failed to appreciate that
       the only reason the appellant had travelled to work in the UAE was
       because of the historical injustice.  Were it not for that injustice,
       in 2012 he would have been living in the UK and not travelling to the
       UAE.

   24. Ms Aboni responded by arguing that the judge had properly directed
       himself and considered the relevant issues, and had reached a
       conclusion that was open to him on the evidence.

  Analysis

   25. The key issue in this appeal was whether the relationship between the
       appellant and his mother engages Article 8(1) ECHR.

   26. The test to determine whether there is family life for the purposes
       of Article 8 ECHR between a parent and adult child is well
       established in the context of children of former Gurkhas, having been
       addressed in cases such as Ghising and Rai.  These cases make clear
       that the assessment of whether family life exists is highly fact
       specific and there is not a legal or factual presumption as to the
       existence or absence of family life.  As highlighted by Mr Shrestha,
       Rai makes it clear that it is necessary to consider not only whether
       family life subsisted at the time of the hearing but also whether it
       subsisted when the parent left Nepal.

   27. The judge correctly identified the relevant law.  At paragraph 29, he
       accurately summarised the legal test and referred to relevant case
       law.  He cited paragraph 24 of Singh where the key point is made that
       there is no legal or factual presumption as to the existence of
       family life, and that there is no requirement of exceptionality.

   28. Having identified and set out the correct legal test, the judge set
       out several reasons why he did not accept family life within the
       meaning of article 8(1) existed.  The reasons he gave are:

        a) The evidence about dependency was vague.

        b) The appellant lived for 14 months in the UAE and his mother was
           not aware of how he got there or who he went with.

        c) The appellant's mother was unable to give detail of the time she
           spent with the appellant, other than that the appellant cooked
           for her.

        d) The appellant's mother was unable to give details of the
           conversations between her and the appellant over the last 10
           months.

        e) The evidence of the appellant living and working independently
           meant that it was more likely than not that he is living an
           independent life.

   29. Mr Shrestha argued that the judge failed to follow the approach
       required by Rai which is to consider whether family life subsisted at
       the time the appellant's mother left Nepal.  I disagree.  The judge
       did not limit his assessment to the period after the appellant's
       mother moved to the UK.  Rather, it is apparent from reading the
       decision as a whole that the judge reached the view that family life
       within the meaning of Article 8 had not existed for many years as,
       amongst other things, the appellant had lived and worked
       independently in the UAE.

   30. Mr Shrestha is correct that the historic injustice to Gurkhas means
       that ordinarily the proportionality assessment under Article 8(2)
       would weigh in favour of the appellant.  However, the proportionality
       of interfering with the appellant's right to respect for family life
       only falls to be considered if Article 8(1) is engaged.  In this
       appeal, I am satisfied that the judge, for the reasons he gave (as
       summarised above in paragraph 28) was entitled to conclude that there
       was not family life between the appellant and his mother for the
       purposes of Article 8.  It follows from this finding that the
       proportionality or otherwise of refusing the application for leave to
       enter was not relevant and the appellant could not succeed in his
       claim under Article 8. Accordingly, the decision does not contain a
       material error of law

  Notice of decision

  The appeal is dismissed.

  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain a material error
  of law.
