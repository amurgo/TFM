                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but are referred to in the rest of this  decision
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan,  born  on  24  May  2012.   His
    paternal uncle and his wife, both  naturalised  UK  citizens,  are  the
    sponsors.  They have no children.  The appellant is the fifth child  in
    his birth family.  The sponsors have  entered  into  an  "adoption"  or
    guardianship arrangement with his birth parents in  Pakistan,  but  the
    law of that country does not provide for adoption.  They have  obtained
    from the Scottish Government a certificate of eligibility to adopt  the
    appellant, but that matter cannot advance further unless and until  the
    appellant is granted entry clearance and travels to the UK.

 3. The ECO refused the appellant's application for entry  clearance  by  a
    decision dated 7 April 2016.  The requirements of the immigration rules
    were found not to be met.  Most importantly, the ECO in terms  of  rule
    297 (i) (f) was "not satisfied that there are  serious  and  compelling
    family circumstances or other considerations which make your  exclusion
    undesirable ...".  The application was also  refused  by  reference  to
    article 8 of the ECHR, including  the  duty  regarding  children  under
    section 55 of the 2009 Act.

 4. FtT Judge Kempton heard the appellant's appeal on 3 November 2017.   At
    �19 of her decision promulgated on 8 November 2017 she said,  "I  allow
    the appeal under rule 297 (i) (f) and it follows that it should also be
    allowed under article 8 of the ECHR".

 5. It was agreed in the UT that the outcome was wrong in form. The  appeal
    was not available under the immigration rules,  only  on  human  rights
    grounds.  However, Mr Matthews acknowledged that if rule  297  (i)  (f)
    was satisfied, its terms were such that success on  article  8  grounds
    would follow, and there was no need for a technical correction.

 6. The ECO's grounds of appeal to the UT say, in summary:

      (1) Given that the appellant still lives in the family home  with  his
      biological parents and siblings and is cared for more than adequately,
      the FtT's finding of compelling reasons is  not  made  out.   Sympathy
      with the sponsors has been confused with the actual  position  of  the
      appellant.

      (2)  The sponsors spend about 4 weeks a year  with  the  appellant  in
      Pakistan.  This does not amount to protected family life.

      (3)  The FtT applied the same flawed reasoning to article 8 as to rule
      297 (i) (f).

 7. Mr Matthews acknowledged that the category of legal error is  not  made
    clear in the grounds.  He accepted that the  grounds  do  not  say  the
    outcome was irrational, and he did not  seek  to  argue  that  it  was.
    There was no dispute on the facts.  He did not categorise the error  as
    inadequacy of reasoning, but as failure to  take  account  of  relevant
    matters, namely the adequate care provided by the  birth  parents,  and
    over-reliance on SK (Adoption not recognised in UK) India UKAIT  00068.
    The outcome in that case had been reached "by a very narrow margin", at
    �40.  The case was distinct.  There had been an adoption in the law  of
    India, but not recognised in the UK.  Here there was no legal  adoption
    even in the law of Pakistan, and no de facto adoption.  The parents  in
    SK had to leave the child in India but  did  not  leave  her  with  her
    natural parents.  The child  in  this  case  remained  with  his  birth
    parents.  There was nothing to prevent the sponsors living in Pakistan.
     He submitted that the errors were material and required  the  decision
    to be set aside.  There being no scope for further fact-finding, the UT
    should substitute a decision, reversing the outcome.

 8. Having considered also the submission of Mr  Iqbal,  I  find  that  the
    grounds and submissions for the ECO do not disclose that the FtT  erred
    on any point of law, such as to require its decision to be set aside.

 9. It is possible to  distinguish  SK,  but  there  will  always  be  some
    differences in the facts.   That  was  a  very  narrow  case,  but  not
    obviously weaker on  the  most  pertinent  circumstances:  a  childless
    couple in the UK, seeking to adopt from  extended  family  abroad,  and
    unable to form a legally recognised adoptive  relationship.   There  is
    never likely to be a rule either that most such cases succeed, or  that
    most do not.  This was also a narrow case.  The ongoing  care  provided
    by the birth parents was plainly taken into account  by  the  judge  at
    �15.   She did not think that rule  297  (i)  (f)  was  met  "at  first
    blush", but only for the detailed reasons she gave at �16  -  18.   The
    ECO's grounds and submissions are in my  view  only  disagreement  with
    that assessment, which was firmly rooted in  the  facts  of  the  case.



10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

11. The FtT made an anonymity direction, which is preserved herein.
