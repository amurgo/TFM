The relationship of brother- (or sister-) in-law between an  appellant
and sponsor falls within  the  Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)
Regulations 2003 where the sponsor is the sibling of  the  Appellant's
spouse but not where the appellant's brother or sister is  married  to
the sponsor in the UK.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. On 27 March 2006,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  in  Islamabad
    refused the appellant's application for entry clearance as a visitor to
    the UK under paragraph 41 of Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules,
    HC 395.  The appellant appealed.  In a determination promulgated on  10
    October 2007, Immigration Judge DA Radcliffe held that  there  was  "no
    valid appeal" before him as the appellant was seeking  entry  clearance
    to  visit  his  brother-in-law  and  that,  he  concluded,  was  not  a
    relationship falling within the Immigration  Appeals  (Family  Visitor)
    Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/518) as amended which gave rise to a right of
    appeal to the Tribunal under s.90(1) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge did not, therefore, consider the merits
    of the case.  The Appellant sought reconsideration of that decision.

 2. The appellant's grounds assert that the judge  was  wrong  to  conclude
    that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to deal with his appeal  because,
    as the sponsor is his brother-in-law, the 2003 Regulations do apply.

 3. The matter was listed for hearing on 9 April 2008.  In a letter dated 1
    April 2008 sent to the Tribunal, the sponsor indicated  that  he  could
    not attend the hearing as he would be  in  Pakistan  due  to  a  family
    bereavement but requesting  that  the  appeal  be  allowed.   In  these
    circumstances we saw no reason why we should not proceed  to  hear  the
    appeal in the absence of the  Appellant  under  rule  19(2)(b)  of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230) as
    amended.

 4. Before we turn to deal with the jurisdictional argument, we must  first
    address a procedural issue.   No order  for  reconsideration  has  been
    made.  It could not be.  In fact, the judge's decision is  not  subject
    to the reconsideration process set out in s.103A of the 2002 Act  which
    applies only in respect of the Tribunal's  "decision  on  the  appeal".
    This is because,  by  virtue  of  s.103A(7)(a),  a  decision  that  the
    Tribunal  lacks  jurisdiction  to  hear  an  appeal  falls  within  the
    statutory exclusion from that provision as "a procedural, ancillary  or
    preliminary  decision"  (s.103A(7)(a)).   Ordinarily,  therefore,   the
    appellant's remedy would seem to  be  restricted  to  judicial  review.
    However, we do not consider that this reflects the  legal  position  in
    family visit appeals such as the present.

 5. Once properly  instituted  an  appeal  remains  pending  until  finally
    determined,  withdrawn  or  abandoned:  s.104(2),  2002  Act.  If   the
    appellant's  grounds  are  made  out,  the   judge   wrongly   declined
    jurisdiction  and,  in  truth,  the  appellant's  appeal  was  properly
    instituted and remains outstanding before the Tribunal.   The fact that
    a notice has been issued under Rule 9 of the 2005 Procedure Rules  (or,
    as in this case, there is a determination stating) that the  appeal  is
    invalid is of no effect where in fact there is clearly a  valid  appeal
    before  the  Tribunal.   Such  a  notice  or  determination  does   not
    "determine" the appeal for the purposes of s.104(2).  The  Tribunal  is
    entitled, indeed required, when made aware of its error  to  deal  with
    the appeal in a proper way.

 6. The situation in this case is directly analogous to the situation where
    the Tribunal erroneously decides that a notice  of  appeal  is  out  of
    time.   In EA (Timeous appeal treated as late) Ghana [2006] UKAIT 00036
    the Tribunal reasoned as follows (at [4]-[6]):

           "4. The position is, however, rather different in relation to  a
           decision that an appeal  was  lodged  out  of  time.   ....   By
           s104(1) of the  2002  Act  his  appeal  is  pending  before  the
           Tribunal during the period beginning when it is  instituted  and
           ending when it is finally determined,  withdrawn  or  abandoned.
           There can be no doubt that the service of an in-time  notice  of
           appeal institutes an appeal for these purposes.


           5. There may be cases in which the facts are not clear, so  that
           the question whether the appeal was in  time  needs  a  judicial
           answer.  But if it is clear that the appeal was in time a  wrong
           decision that it was  out  of  time  does  not  "determine"  the
           appeal, which therefore remains pending.  Because no  permission
           is needed to pursue  an  in-time  appeal,  in  a  clear  case  a
           decision purporting to refuse to allow it to proceed is formally
           of no effect - although, of course, unless it  is  queried,  the
           appeal is unlikely ever to be determined.

           6. If a member of the Tribunal is persuaded  that  a  notice  of
           appeal to the Tribunal which has been treated out of time was in
           fact clearly given in time, he should ignore the  decision  that
           it was out of time and give  parties  notice  that  despite  the
           Tribunal's previous indication there is an appeal pending before
           it which will proceed to determination."


 7. The same approach was applied by the Tribunal in ST (s92(4)(a): meaning
    of  "has  made")  Turkey  [2007]  UKAIT  00085  at  [2]-[3]  where   an
    Immigration Judge had wrongly concluded that he had no jurisdiction  to
    hear an appeal.  That reasoning, with which we agree,  applies  equally
    in  this  case.   The  question  is,  therefore,   does   the   claimed
    relationship between the appellant and sponsor  fall  within  the  2003
    Regulations?

 8. So far as relevant, reg 2(1) provides as follows:

           "2(1) For the purposes of  section  90(1)  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, a 'member  of  the  applicant's
           family' is any of the following persons -
           ....
           (b) the ... brother or sister of the applicant's spouse; ...."

 9. This could not be clearer.  The brother or sister  of  the  appellant's
    spouse is his brother- or sister-in-law. In other  words  an  appellant
    who intends to visit his spouse's sibling in the  UK  has  a  right  of
    appeal under s.90(1) of the 2002 Act read with  the  2003  Regulations.
    But  it  is  worth  noting  that  reg  2(1)(b)  does  not  include  all
    relationships where the sponsor is the brother- or sister-in-law of the
    applicant/appellant.  That  relationship  will  also  exist  where  the
    appellant's brother or sister is married to  the  sponsor  in  the  UK.
    This is also a relationship  of  brother-  or  sister-in-law,  but  the
    wording of regulation 2(1)(b)  -  no  other  part  of  reg  2(1)  being
    relevant -  does not apply.  It may be  that  it  is  not  specifically
    covered because such  a  provision  would  generally  be  redundant  as
    usually the appellant will not only be visiting his brother- or sister-
    in-law (the sponsor) but also his own sister or brother (the  sponsor's
    spouse) and those latter  sibling  relationships  are,  in  any  event,
    covered by reg 2(1)(a) of the 2003 Regulations.

10. The evidence relevant to the claimed relationship between the appellant
    and  sponsor  is  somewhat  sketchy  in  this  case.   The   ECO   has,
    unhelpfully,  failed  to  file  with  the  Tribunal   the   appellant's
    application form or interview record where there might have  been  some
    useful information.  The ECO and the judge refer only to the sponsor as
    being the appellant's "brother-in-law" but do not provide  any  inkling
    of the basis for this familial connection.  The sponsor, however, does.
     In the Declaration of Sponsorship dated 20 April 2007 he states in the
    section dealing with the details of the appellant "RELATIONSHIP:  B  in
    Law (Real Sister's Husband)".  Further in his supporting letter to  the
    Tribunal he refers to the appellant by name and then  immediately  adds
    in brackets "Real sister's husband".   How is this  to  be  understood?
    The writer is the sponsor and it seems to us that the way in  which  it
    is written supports the view that he is referring to the appellant  and
    means, in effect, that 'the appellant  is  my  sister's  husband'.   It
    would be an odd  phraseology  to  use  if,  instead,  the  sponsor  was
    referring to himself and meant 'I am his sister's husband'.  That seems
    to us to  be  the  only  possible  alternative  interpretation  of  the
    sponsor's words and we reject it.  If that were  the  visit  which  the
    appellant intends, it is curious, to say the least, that in none of the
    documents before us does he mention that he is coming to  see  his  own
    sister in the UK who lives with the sponsor.  It is clear  to  us  that
    the appellant is coming to visit his wife's  brother  (his  brother-in-
    law) which is a relationship falling within reg  2(1)(b)  of  the  2003
    Regulations.  The judge was wrong to conclude that there was  no  valid
    appeal before him and, for the  reasons  we  have  already  given,  the
    effect is that the appeal remains pending before the Tribunal.

11. We now proceed to determine the appeal.

12. The applicable Immigration Rule is paragraph 41 of HC 395 which, so far
    as relevant, provides as follows:

           "The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave  to  enter
           the United Kingdom as a visitor are that he:

           (i) is genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for a limited period
           as stated by him, not exceeding 6 months; and

           (ii) intends to leave the United  kingdom  at  the  end  of  the
           period of the visit as stated by him; and

           (iii) does not intend to take employment in the United  Kingdom;
           and

           ....

           (vi) will maintain and accommodate himself  and  any  dependants
           adequately out of resources available to him without recourse to
           public funds or taking employment; or will, with any dependants,
           be  maintained  and  accommodated  adequately  by  relatives  or
           friends; ...."




13.  The ECO's reasons for refusing the Appellant entry clearance  are  set
    out in the Notice dated 27 March 2006 as follows:

          "I have taken careful consideration of all  of  the  evidence  you
          have placed before me and I am not satisfied that your application
          meets all the requirements of paragraph 41 of HC 395.


            . You are seeking entry clearance to visit your brother-in-law.
               I note that you were previously issued a visa in April  2006
              and you  stayed  in  the  UK  for  5  months,  although  your
              application  form  at  that  time  clearly  stated  that  you
              intended an 8 week visit, same  as  this  application.   When
              asked at interview what you did during these 5 months of your
              previous  visit,  you  were  unable  to  provide  a  credible
              explanation or name the famous places  you  claimed  to  have
              visited.  Based on your answers at interview, I  am  lead  to
              doubt that purpose of your previous travel  and  it  follows,
              therefore, that I am lead  to  doubt  both  the  purpose  and
              claimed duration of this trip.  41 (i) (ii) (iii)

            . I note that you previously stayed in the  UK  for  5  months,
              that you have only recently returned to Pakistan and that you
              are applying once more to  visit  the  UK  for  a  further  2
              months.  I do not consider this pattern of  migration  to  be
              commensurate  with  someone  who  claims  to  run  their  own
              business that requires their presence here.  This also  leads
              me to doubt the purpose and period of your visit  is  as  you
              have stated.  41 (i) (ii) (iii)

            . You have stated that you will take only �300 for your 2 month
              visit and that expenses will be met by  your  sponsor.    You
              have, however, not produced any evidence of his personal  and
              financial circumstances that would allow him to  so  do,  nor
              have you provided a recent sponsorship declaration from  your
              sponsor offering to meet your costs.  Without such evidence I
              am not satisfied that you will be adequately  maintained  and
              accommodated as claimed.  41 (v)

            . You have failed to provide any evidence of your own  personal
              circumstances in Pakistan.  Whilst I accept that this is  not
              an explicit requirement of the Immigration Rules  to  provide
              such evidence, full knowledge of  your  circumstances  is  an
              important consideration when assessing your application for a
              visit visa.  While I note that you were previously  issued  a
              visa in April 2006, no evidence has been presented to support
              that you continue to be in receipt of regular income, or that
              you have the funds that you claim for  this  visit.   In  the
              absence of such evidence you have not satisfied  me,  on  the
              balance of probability, that you are genuinely seeking  entry
              as a visitor for a limited period as stated by  you  or  that
              you will comply with the conditions of your entry  clearance.
              41 (i) (ii) (iii)

            ....

          I therefore refuse your application."



14. In effect, therefore, the ECO did not accept that the Appellant  was  a
    genuine visitor or that he had the available  funds  to  be  adequately
    maintained and accommodated in the UK.

15. For  the  hearing,  the  Appellant  submitted  a  bundle  of  documents
    including bank statements of the sponsor and copies  of  the  sponsor's
    tax return for the years ending April  2005  and  2006,  a  certificate
    setting out details of the Appellant's children,  and  three  documents
    relating to the Appellant's property holdings and business in Pakistan.
     In addition, the Appellant submitted a set of grounds of appeal  which
    in some detail deal with the issues taken against the Appellant in  the
    notice of decision.  Further, the Appellant submitted a declaration  of
    sponsorship by his sponsor and a supporting letter from his sponsor.

16. In the sponsorship declaration, the  sponsor  states  that  his  annual
    earnings are �20,000 and that he has �6,000 in  savings  at  the  Abbey
    National Bank.  The declaration states that he will bear the  costs  of
    the Appellant  travelling  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  returning  to
    Pakistan and will maintain and accommodate him at his own cost  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Attached  to  the  declaration  are  three  statements
    relating to the sponsor's account held at the Abbey Bank.  The earliest
    of these deals with the period between 22 November 2006 and 22 December
    2006 and shows a balance of �7,773.35.  We note that prior to this, the
    statements state that a balance of �5077.30 was brought  forward.   The
    other two statements relate to  similar  periods  between  January  and
    February 2007 and February and March 2007 showing respectively  closing
    balances of �4,198.15  and  �5,219.47  respectively.   The  sponsorship
    declaration also states that the sponsor in addition to  his  own  home
    owns an additional property in  Hounslow.   The  sponsor's  tax  return
    relating to the year ending April 2006 shows that the sponsor  received
    �12,288 by way of income  from  property.   The  tax  return  does  not
    indicate that the sponsor was  in  employment  or  received  any  other
    income, for example, from a business.

17. Turning to the  other  documentation,  there  is  a  translation  of  a
    document said to be issued by the "Government of Pakistan"  and  headed
    "Certificate of Children below eighteen years"  which  shows  that  the
    Appellant and his wife have three children aged, at  the  time  of  the
    ECO's decision, 17, 12 and 1 respectively.  There are in  addition  two
    documents relating to the Appellant's property  holdings  in  Pakistan.
    The first is from the "Office of the Tehsildar" and is dated  19  April
    2007.  It states that the Appellant owns  agricultural  property  which
    produces an annual income of 2,50,000 Pakistani rupees.   In  addition,
    he is the owner of a residential house valued at 32,00,000 Rupees  and,
    finally, he owns five shops which are rented out at  a  monthly  income
    for each shop of 1,600 rupees.  In addition, there is a translation  of
    a Land Registry document indicating that the total land  owned  by  the
    Appellant is 74.08 kanals.  This document seems to refer to  his  total
    holdings so as to cover his agricultural land, his residential house as
    well as his commercial property.  We note that the document  issued  by
    the Office of the Tehsildar seems to suggest that  the  Appellant  owns
    agricultural property of that area.  Clearly there is a difference here
    which is unexplained in the material before us.  Finally, there  is  an
    affidavit from a Mr Arif who states that he is the elder brother of the
    Appellant.  In his affidavit, Mr Arif attests that the  Appellant  owns
    commercial property and agricultural land and that he  will  take  full
    responsibility for its maintenance during the Appellant's absence.   He
    also states that he will look  after  the  Appellant's  family  members
    during his visit to the UK.  He states that  the  Appellant  wished  to
    come to the UK for the purpose of a  family  visit  to  see  his  blood
    relations and friends for two months.  There is one final  document  we
    should refer to enclosed in the bundle  which  appears  to  be  a  bank
    statement from the Allied Bank Limited showing a balance of  105,044.75
    as at 21 April 2007 and in  the  Appellant's  name.   As  this  account
    covers  the  period  of  January  to  April  2007  it  relates  to  the
    Appellant's financial circumstances after the ECO's decision and is not
    a matter that we can have regard to in deciding this appeal.

18. At the hearing, Miss Powell who appeared for the  Respondent  indicated
    that she had nothing to add to the papers that were before us.  We take
    this to mean that she relied upon the ECO's reasons for refusing  entry
    clearance but, of course, she did not challenge the documentation  that
    the Appellant put before us and which, so far as we can tell,  was  not
    before the ECO.  Likewise, Miss Powell made no submissions in  relation
    to the detailed grounds of appeal prepared by the Appellant.

19. As regards the ECO's first reason for not accepting that the  Appellant
    was a genuine visitor, the Appellant explains that he stayed for  about
    four months because he was invited whilst here to visit a number of his
    family members but because they were busy he went  on  Sundays  and  so
    remained longer than the eight week visit that he  initially  intended.
    That explanation is also repeated by the sponsor in his letter dated 20
    April 2007 to explain the Appellant's stay in the  United  Kingdom  for
    four months on his last visit.  The Appellant  also  explains  that  he
    told the Entry Clearance Officer some famous places he had  visited  in
    the UK but that the main purpose of his visit was to see family  rather
    than be a tourist.  He also points out that he is not an educated man.

20. As regards the second reason relied upon by the ECO, the Appellant says
    that he returned to Pakistan after his first visit on  2  October  2006
    and that he wanted to visit the UK  in  May  2007  to  accommodate  his
    obligations on his agricultural land - he says that he is a farmer - so
    it would be a very suitable time for him to visit during the months  of
    May, June and July 2007.

21. As regards the third reason for the refusal relating to maintenance and
    accommodation, the Appellant says that he has now  submitted  documents
    relating to his brother-in-law (the sponsor's) financial  situation  in
    the United Kingdom.

22. Finally,  in  relation  to  the  concluding  reason  for  refusing  the
    Appellant's application, the Appellant points out that he has presented
    documents relating to his property holdings in Pakistan and in  respect
    of his family who live there.

23. The burden of proof in this appeal is upon the Appellant to satisfy  us
    on a balance of probabilities that he met the requirements of paragraph
    41 of HC 395 at the date of the ECO's decision, namely 27  March  2006.
    In reaching our decision we are entitled to take into account  evidence
    relating to the circumstances appertaining at that date even though the
    evidence was not before the Entry Clearance Officer and even if it post
    dates his decision.

24. As we have  indicated  already,  Miss  Powell  did  not  challenge  the
    genuineness or contents of the documentation before us.  We accept that
    the Appellant is an agricultural farmer who owns commercial property in
    Pakistan and that his earnings are as reflected in  the  document  from
    the Office of the Tehsildar dated 17 April 2007.  We  accept  that  the
    Appellant is married and has three children all, at the relevant  date,
    under the age of eighteen.  We accept the  evidence  from  the  sponsor
    that he is a businessman who owns two properties in  Hounslow.   It  is
    not clear to us from the documentation how the  sponsor  comes  to  the
    figure  of  �20,000  as  being  his  earnings.   We  have  no  relevant
    documentation relating to the sponsor's bank accounts at  the  date  of
    decision - they all relate to a  period  some  nine  to  twelve  months
    later. However, his tax return for the  year  ended  5  April  2006  (a
    period ending one week after the decision in the appeal) shows that  he
    did earn �12,288 from property rents in the 2005-2006  tax  year.   The
    Appellant,  of  course,  has  his  own  income  as  recorded   in   the
    documentation and, as the ECO points out in his decision, the Appellant
    will bring �300 of his own money with him for the two month visit.

25. Looking at this evidence in the round, we are satisfied on a balance of
    probabilities that for a short visit of this nature the  Appellant  has
    available to him through  his  own  funds  and  those  of  his  sponsor
    sufficient to maintain himself in the United Kingdom  without  recourse
    to public funds.  Although the refusal decision refers to the issue  of
    accommodation, no specific point is made in relation to that.   In  our
    view it is clear from the sponsorship declaration - which has also  not
    been  challenged  before  us  -  that   the   sponsor   has   available
    accommodation for the Appellant.

26. For these  reasons,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  met  the
    requirement in paragraph 41 (vi) of HC 395 at the date of decision.

27. In relation to the other issues raised in the notice of decision by the
    ECO,  in  our  view  the  points  made  by  the  ECO  are   fully   and
    satisfactorily met by the Appellant in his detailed grounds  of  appeal
    and by the documentation before us.  His evidence is not challenged and
    there is no basis upon  which  we  could  rationally  reject  it.   The
    Appellant has explained - and we see  no  reason  not  to  accept  that
    explanation -why he remained in the UK on his  last  visit  beyond  the
    initially intended eight weeks for some five months.  He did so because
    of the way that he was invited by various  members  of  his  family  to
    visit them on weekends which  extended  the  period  that  he  intended
    initially to stay in the UK.  It remains the fact  that  the  Appellant
    nevertheless left the UK and returned to Pakistan prior to the  end  of
    his six months leave to enter.  The Entry  Clearance  Officer  has  not
    provided a copy of the Appellant's interview and therefore we  are  not
    in a position to know in any detail what it is that the Appellant  said
    when asked what he had done on his  previous  visit.   The  Appellant's
    explanation given in his grounds of appeal is that he named some famous
    places but the purpose of his visit was to see  family  and  not  be  a
    tourist.  In addition, the Appellant has explained why it  is  that  he
    wished to return to the United Kingdom for a family visit in  May  2007
    and also that his brother will take care  of  his  businesses  and  his
    family whilst he is away.  We accept this  explanation.   Finally,  the
    Appellant  has  provided  documentary  evidence  which  again  is   not
    challenged, and which we accept,  that  shows  that  he  has  roots  in
    Pakistan: he has a wife and three children, a home,  agricultural  land
    and commercial properties that he rents out.  There is  also  the  fact
    that on his last visit to the UK the  Appellant  returned  to  Pakistan
    prior to the end of his leave to enter.

28. Looking at all these matters in the round, we are  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant is genuinely seeking entry as a visitor to see his family and
    that he intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the visit and
    that it is not his intention to  undertake  employment  in  the  United
    Kingdom.   Thus  we  are  satisfied  that  the  Appellant   meets   the
    requirements in paragraph 41 (i), (ii) and (iii) of HC 395.

29. No issue has been taken on any other requirement in paragraph 41 of  HC
    395, therefore, for these reasons we are satisfied that at the date  of
    decision the Appellant met the requirements of paragraph 41 of HC  395.
