Representation:

For the Appellant:     Sponsor, Mr. Adou Nguessan
For the Respondent:     Mr. L Tarlow HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent has been granted permission to appeal the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll allowing the appeal of the appellant
    against the refusal of the ECO to grant her entry clearance to the UK
    as the spouse of Mr. Nguessan, a British national born in Ivory Coast
    who is present and settled in the UK.  The judge allowed the appeal
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

2.   The appellant and the sponsor are the parents of two daughters born in
    Ivory Coast on 6 February 2007 and 12 March 2009.  Both of the
    appellant's daughters are British nationals.

3.   The judge was satisfied that the sponsor is employed as a bus driver
    for London Central Bus Company.  The judge said there was ample
    evidence to show that he is in a well-paid job.  There was a letter
    from his employers (Go-Ahead - London) dated 21 January 2013 showing
    that he has been working for them since December 2006.  A further
    letter dated 10 May 2013 confirmed that the sponsor's basic salary was
    �24,941 (and although overtime is usually available, it cannot be
    guaranteed).   The P60s in the respondent's bundle for the years 2012
    and 2013 showed the sponsor's pay to be �34,995 for the tax year to
    April 2012 and �41,158 for the tax year to April 2013.  Bank statements
    had been submitted showing regular deposits of the sponsor's salary in
    his account with Nationwide.  There were also a number of payslips but,
    as the ECO observed, these did not always cover the same period as the
    bank statements.  The judge found that although the evidence confirmed
    that the sponsor was in a well-paid permanent employment, he was unable
    to satisfy the immigration rules as there was not all of the
    documentation needed to support the application.

4.   The sponsor sought to re-argue this issue because he said that he had
    provided further documentary evidence to the First-tier Tribunal to
    support his income.  However, he did admit that when the appellant made
    the application, he was not able to supply all the required documents
    because some of them were in his locker at home.

5.   On the sponsor's own evidence it is not arguable that the judge erred
    in law in her finding that the appellant was unable to satisfy the
    immigration rules for the reason given by her.

6.   The respondent was granted permission to appeal the judge's decision
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.  The grounds argued that the judge failed
    to make any reference whatsoever to current case law and made no
    findings as to whether there exist exceptional circumstances which
    would enable the appellant's application to be considered outside the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge did not identify what unjustified
    hardship would be caused by the respondent's decision.

7.   At paragraph 8 the judge found as follows:

         "As I have noted above the sponsor is the father of two British
         nationals born in Ivory Coast.  He clearly enjoys family life for
         the purposes of Article 8 with his wife and daughters.  He visits
         them in Ivory Coast when possible and his wife has visited him the
         United Kingdom (in 2012).  The three airfares for the appellant and
         her daughters to visit the United Kingdom represent a prohibitive
         sum of money, albeit that both the appellant and sponsor are both
         in full-time work.  The sponsor explained that it is very difficult
         for the family to carry on as a family unit by means of occasional,
         expensive visits by the sponsor to Ivory Coast.  As a British
         national, he cannot be expected to relocate to Ivory Coast and his
         two daughters are British nationals, entitled to enter the United
         Kingdom without leave.


8.   I accepted Mr. Tarlow's submission that before the move to consider
    Article 8 proportionality, the judge needed to consider whether there
    were compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the
    Immigration Rules as per R(Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and
    Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).   The judge's failure to consider,
    considering that the appellant could not satisfy the immigration rules,
    was an error of law such that her decision cannot stand.

9.   I heard evidence from the sponsor in order to remake the decision in
    respect of the appellant's appeal under Article 8.

10.  The sponsor said that he is a bus driver.  It is a stressful job.
    When he returns home from work he is alone.  He has two children.  His
    wife is now six months' pregnant.  He does not see his children.  If he
    wants to see his family, he has to go to Ivory Coast. He went to Ivory
    Coast twice last year and has been twice this year.  He intends to go
    again in November when his wife gives birth.  The trips to Ivory Coast
    cost a lot of money.  He would like his wife to be with him as this
    would give him the strength to carry on with his job.  He has been
    given a final warning by his employers because of his stress which
    causes him to lose concentration when he is driving the bus.  He is
    scared of flying but he has no choice if he has to see his wife and
    daughters.  The stressful situation they are in has led to arguments on
    the phone.  He loves his wife and would like the family to be together.

11.  It has not been argued by the respondent that the sponsor is unable to
    support his wife and daughters in the UK.  The appellant was unable to
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules because the sponsor
    failed to submit all the necessary documents to support his earnings.
    I accept that there is no near miss in the Immigration Rules.  However,
    balancing the appellant's failure to meet the financial requirements of
    the Immigration Rules with the evidence given by the sponsor, I find
    that there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised by
    the Immigration Rules which justify the grant of entry clearance to the
    appellant.

12.  The appellant has two daughters who are British who are now 7 and 5
    years old. They should be growing up in the United Kingdom.  They are
    being deprived of the benefits they are entitled to as British nations.
      They do not require a visa to enter the UK.  However, if they entered
    the UK without their mother, the sponsor would have to give up work in
    order to care for them due to their young age.  At a time when the
    Government is clamouring for people to return to work, it would be
    unduly harsh if the sponsor had to give up a well-paid job and be a
    stay-at-home father and live off benefits.  He has admirably maintained
    a family life with the appellant and his daughters in the best possible
    way under the circumstances.

13.  I accept the sponsor's evidence that his job is stressful.  He has
    been given a final warning by his employers as a result of not
    concentrating fully on his driving.  The sponsor is responsible for
    carrying members of the public on his bus and the nature of his job is
    such that any negligence or recklessness by him could cause harm to the
    general public. I find that this is a further compelling reason why the
    appeal of his wife should be allowed.

14.  For the above reasons, I allow the appellant's appeal under Article 8.
