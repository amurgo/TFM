                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  19th  of  May  1993.  He
    appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Clarke
    sitting at Taylor House on 9th of March 2017 in which she dismissed the
    Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated  23rd  of
    November 2015. That decision was to refuse the Appellant's  application
    for indefinite leave to remain,  the  Appellant  stating  that  he  had
    completed six years discretionary leave at that stage.  The  Respondent
    refused the application on the basis that it had not  been  shown  that
    the Appellant had completed  six  consecutive  years  of  discretionary
    leave.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 5th of August 2006, aged
    13, with entry clearance to accompany his mother  valid  from  20th  of
    February 2006 until 20th of February 2008. On  29th  of  November  2009
    discretionary leave to remain was granted valid until 29th of  November
    2012. The Appellant made further applications for leave  to  remain  on
    26th of November 2012 and March,  April  and  May  2014  but  all  were
    rejected. The application the  Appellant  made  on  9th  of  July  2014
    resulted in the grant of discretionary leave to remain valid until 26th
    of September 2017. On 13th of August 2015 two years  before  his  leave
    was due to expire the Appellant  made  an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to  remain  the  refusal  of  which  gave  rise  to  the  present
    proceedings. The Appellant has since  been  granted  further  leave  to
    remain by the Respondent valid until August 2020.

The Decision at First Instance

 3. At [8] of the determination the Judge found that the  case  involved  a
    discrete issue as to whether the Appellant had  enjoyed  six  years  of
    consecutive discretionary leave. The Judge found that the Appellant had
    not because there had been gaps in the two periods  of  leave  granted.
    The application made on 26th of November 2012 as a dependent child  was
    rejected by  the  Respondent  on  5th  of  November  2013  because  the
    Appellant had been an adult at the date of application. The  difficulty
    for the Appellant was that there was no expert  evidence  to  show  the
    Appellant was incapable of handling his own affairs at that time. As  a
    result, the Appellant was not treated as suffering a mental  incapacity
    that would have meant he could be treated  as  his  mother's  dependent
    notwithstanding he was over the age of 18. This rejection of  the  2012
    application led to what the Judge described  as  "the  fatal  break  in
    continuous leave".

 4. A number of applications followed and were rejected, in part at  least,
    because fees were not paid. Finally, a successful application for leave
    to remain on compassionate grounds was made in  July  2014.  The  first
    grant of  discretionary  leave  to  remain  had  been  granted  to  the
    Appellant before the changes made in the Immigration  Rules  came  into
    force on 9th of July 2012. The effect of the Rules was that  six  years
    continuous discretionary leave to remain was required to  establish  an
    entitlement to indefinite leave to remain but no such  leave  had  been
    given and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appellant had had  an
    initial period of entry clearance when he arrived with  his  mother  as
    her dependent. Unfortunately for the Appellant there was a gap  between
    20th of February 2008 when the Appellant's entry clearance expired  and
    28th of December 2008  when  the  Appellant  made  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain as a dependent child. This break meant  that
    the Appellant  could  not  show  continuous  leave  either.  The  Judge
    dismissed the appeal.


The Onward Appeal

 5. The Appellant appealed against this decision arguing  that  he  had  in
    fact arrived in United Kingdom on 1st of December 2001 not  on  5th  of
    August 2006. He had made an application in 2008  for  leave  to  remain
    under the 7 years concessionary  rule  but  instead  of  granting  this
    application the Respondent had granted the Appellant only  three  years
    discretionary leave from 29th of November 2009 until 29th  of  November
    2012. The Appellant had  a  disability  and  was  receiving  disability
    living  allowance.  His  mental  capacity  was  of  great  concern  and
    therefore he was considered a dependent  of  his  mother.  The  grounds
    queried why the Appellant should have been granted three years  further
    leave from September 2014 until September 2017 without  being  required
    to apply for leave from outside the country. Three years  discretionary
    leave was stopped on 9th of July 2012 for any  applicant  except  those
    who were already en route and at that time enjoyed the concession.  The
    Appellant did not seek entry clearance in 2006 because he had  been  in
    the care of social services since January 2006.

 6.  Subsequently  the  Appellant  submitted  an  amended  application  for
    permission to appeal which appears to have been drafted by  a  firm  of
    solicitors acting at the time for the Appellant. These  grounds  argued
    that the grant by the Respondent on  26th  of  September  2014  was  an
    acknowledgement that the Appellant had continued his  lawful  leave  in
    this country since 29th  of  November  2009.  The  Judge  had  not  had
    sufficient information in relation to the rejected applications to find
    that there was a gap in the Appellant's leave. There was evidence  that
    the Appellant had a history of mental health difficulties  which  meant
    he was a vulnerable adult. The Judge should have made further enquiries
    of the Respondent to ascertain why further leave was  granted  in  2014
    and whether or not the Appellant's leave was deemed to  have  continued
    since 2009 or expired.

 7. The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chapman sitting as a Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 17th of October 2017. In granting permission to appeal
    she noted that despite the fact the Appellant's appeal was confined  to
    human rights the Judge had failed to  engage  with  or  determined  the
    appeal  on  this  basis.  This  was  a  Robinson  obvious  point   that
    constituted an arguable error of law. Whilst it would appear that there
    was a gap in the continuity of the Appellant's residence  between  29th
    of November 2012 and 9th of July  2014  which  rendered  the  Appellant
    ineligible for indefinite leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  6  years
    discretionary leave, it was arguable there were errors of fact  in  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  understanding  of  the  chronology   and
    background to  the  appeal.  Those  misunderstandings  merited  further
    consideration particularly when considered through  the  prism  of  the
    Appellant's private life in the United Kingdom  since  his  arrival  in
    2001 at the age of 8 years.

 8. The Respondent replied to the grant of permission to appeal on 22nd  of
    November 2017 opposing the Appellant's appeal. The Judge  had  directed
    herself appropriately. The immigration history recounted by  the  Judge
    reflected the immigration history set out in the refusal letter.  There
    was no UK immigration entry stamp to show that a visa  issued  in  July
    2001 had been used to enter the United Kingdom. None of  the  remaining
    documents established the Appellant's residence in the  United  Kingdom
    prior to 2006. In any event the issue was not the Appellant's  date  of
    entry but whether he had accumulated six years of  discretionary  leave
    since it was granted on 29th of November 2009. The  grounds  failed  to
    deal with the two-year gap in the continuity of residence  which  would
    have broken any accumulation of  leave  to  remain  and  prevented  the
    acquisition of indefinite leave to remain. Given that the Appellant  at
    the date of hearing was already  in  possession  of  limited  leave  to
    remain it was not clear how there could be any material  error  of  law
    with regard to any assessment outside the Rules. The Appellant had been
    granted further  leave  to  remain  until  2020  by  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's letter.

The Hearing Before Me

 9. At the hearing before me the Appellant  appeared  in  person  with  his
    mother as he had before the First-tier Tribunal. His mother  spoke  for
    him  as  she  had  at  first  instance  (see  [7]  of  the   First-tier
    determination). She indicated that both  she  and  the  Appellant  were
    content for the matter to proceed without representation. I also  heard
    oral evidence from the Appellant himself.

10. For the  Respondent,  the  Presenting  Officer  indicated  he  did  not
    consider there had been an error of law. The Appellant had leave at the
    time of the hearing which lasted until 6 months after the determination
    was promulgated. The Appellant's leave had been  extended  since  then.
    The only argument was whether the Appellant should  have  been  granted
    indefinite leave. There may be  a  dispute  of  fact  as  to  when  the
    Appellant entered. The Judge had considered the matter properly looking
    at the Respondent's guidance and she had found a break in the period of
    discretionary leave. It was difficult to see where  this  appeal  could
    go. There were no removal directions because the Appellant had existing
    leave but there was a right of appeal against the Respondent's decision
    according to the Respondent's letter of 23 November 2015.

11. Speaking on behalf of her son the Appellant's mother  stated  that  she
    had entered the United Kingdom with four children but of them only  the
    Appellant now did not have a United Kingdom passport. She did not  know
    the reason why. He had arrived in the United Kingdom in  2001.  He  had
    not returned to Nigeria since then. Her  job  required  her  to  travel
    around which explained why she had left  the  United  Kingdom  and  was
    stopped by Immigration Officers when she returned in or about 2007.

12. In 2006 there had been some problems when she had been forced to  leave
    her property and social services had become involved. Her children were
    taken into care at that time. The reason why there was a gap in  lawful
    residence in 2008 was the Respondent's fault. The Appellant had made an
    in-time application, she had paid a �750 fee and then had been told  by
    the Respondent there was no fee but what she had paid was not  returned
    to her. At that point her son was  granted  three  years  discretionary
    leave (from 2009 until 2012). In 2015 he qualified for indefinite leave
    to remain. The family applied and the Appellant's  sister  was  granted
    leave.

13.  The Appellant had no home other than hers, she was the only parent  he
    knew. The only time he had ever left the United  Kingdom  was  in  2015
    when he went to his brother's wedding in France for which he had to get
    a visa. He had been in the United Kingdom since he  was  8  years  old.
    When the Appellant was in the care of social services the council wrote
    to the Nigerian High Commission when they should have  written  to  the
    Respondent. That was why the Respondent thought that the Appellant  had
    travelled but he had not.  The  Appellant's  home  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He was experiencing difficulties accessing medical  treatment.
    She had had to pay �600 for his medical treatment and he was unable  to
    go on to higher education. He was being treated differently to the rest
    of the family.

14. The Presenting Officer queried these last points as the  Appellant  had
    been granted further discretionary leave  until  August  2020  and  was
    entitled to treatment under the NHS.

15. The Appellant stated that he thought his application  would  have  been
    sorted out before now. He did not understand the Respondent's  argument
    against his application. When he went on holiday he had had  to  go  to
    the French Embassy to obtain a visa because he did not have  a  British
    passport to travel on. The problem now was that  he  wanted  to  go  on
    holiday with his girlfriend but he was having problems obtaining a visa
    to do that.

Findings

16. The first issue I have to decide is whether there is a  material  error
    of law in the Judge's determination. As the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
    pointed out when granting permission to appeal this appeal  could  only
    ever proceed under Article 8. The Judge found that the Appellant  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules. It was important for the Judge
    to make findings on that issue since any application  under  Article  8
    outside the Rules had to be looked at through the prism of  the  Rules.
    The Judge found that the Appellant  was  not  entitled  to  be  granted
    indefinite leave to remain, under the Rules, on the basis  of  6  years
    discretionary leave because of a break in that leave between  2012  and
    2014.

17. The Appellant disputes that there was any such break stating that there
    was a problem over the application forms but I found  the  evidence  of
    the Appellant's mother on this point somewhat difficult to follow. This
    was not assisted by the amended  grounds  settled  by  the  Appellant's
    previous solicitors which did not deal with the 2008 issue at  all  and
    only dealt with the 2012 to 2014 break in somewhat vague  terms.  Their
    main point was that the Respondent's  decision  in  September  2014  to
    grant discretionary leave  was  somehow  an  acknowledgement  that  the
    Appellant had had continuous leave up until that point. It was  nothing
    of the kind. The Respondent frequently grants leave to applicants after
    periods when those applicants had no leave. If the Respondent  did  not
    do that she might face criticism in the courts for having an unfair and
    inflexible policy. That the Respondent granted leave to this  Appellant
    is not to be taken as an indication that there had  been  no  break  in
    leave.

18. I accept that some of the confusion in this case  does  rest  with  the
    Respondent who has made a  series  of  decisions  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant the rationale for which has not always been  entirely  clear.
    It is not clear for example why in November 2009 when  the  Appellant's
    application for indefinite leave to remain in this country was  refused
    in line with the application made by his mother,  he  was  nevertheless
    granted three years leave to remain until  November  2012.  Nor  is  it
    clear why the Appellant's leave which at the time  of  the  hearing  at
    first instance was valid until 2017 has  again  been  further  extended
    until 2020.

19. It was a material error of law for the Judge not to deal with Article 8
    since that was the  only  basis  on  which  the  Appellant  could  have
    appealed. The Judge was right to consider whether the  Appellant  could
    first of all bring himself within the  provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules that is to say whether he had a sufficient period of  consecutive
    discretionary leave  such  that  he  then  qualified  as  eligible  for
    indefinite leave. The Judge held that the Appellant could  not  succeed
    under this route because of the break in 2012 to 2014 not  assisted  by
    the break in 2008.

20. The burden of proof of establishing that the Judge was wrong about that
    rests on the Appellant and in the absence of a very  clear  explanation
    why the Judge was wrong to say that there was such a  break,  I  cannot
    find that the Judge erred in her treatment of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    That however is not the end of the  matter  because  I  still  have  to
    remake the decision myself under Article 8 outside the Rules.

21. I appreciate the Respondent's argument that given the periods of  leave
    which have been  granted  to  the  Appellant  the  Appellant's  success
    outside  the  Rules  under  Article  8  is  not   without   difficulty.
    Nevertheless, and assuming that the Appellant is entitled to a right of
    appeal under Article 8 even if he has existing leave, it does  seem  to
    me that these grants of short periods of leave from  time  to  time  do
    represent an interference in the  Appellant's  private  life.  Clearly,
    they do not interfere to the extent  that  an  outright  refusal  would
    interfere with protected rights but the Appellant is left in a state of
    limbo with only a  precarious  immigration  status  and  not  permanent
    status. He is obviously consciously aware  that  he  has  been  treated
    differently to the rest of his family and the explanation  why  he  has
    been treated differently is, as I have indicated, not entirely clear.

22. The Appellant has had a troubled past, he was disruptive in his earlier
    years  and  he  was  referred  for  psychiatric  assistance.  He  is  a
    vulnerable party.  I agree with Judge Clarke that there is no confirmed
    diagnosis but the uncertainty of the position  cannot  be  helping  the
    Appellant  psychologically.  I  take  into  account   the   Appellant's
    vulnerabilities when ascertaining the serious  effect  on  him  of  the
    Respondent's decision. The Appellant has established a private life  in
    this country since first arriving  here.  To  the  extent  that  it  is
    relevant to ascertain the date of his arrival and thus  the  length  of
    time he has spent here and the extent of the private life developed,  I
    consider that matter. There is a dispute as  to  when  he  arrived,  he
    states that he arrived in 2001 with his mother whereas the Judge  found
    that he did not arrive until 2006. Either way, the Appellant  has  been
    in this country for at least 11 years and he  has  been  granted  leave
    until 2020 which will mean that by that time he will have been here for
    14 years.

23. The evidence that he  arrived  in  2001  appears  to  be  based  on  an
    assertion only. A photocopy of the Appellant's visa granted to  him  to
    accompany his mother is dated 20th of February 2006.  While  I  do  not
    doubt that the Appellant's mother was trying to  give  me  an  accurate
    account of matters I consider her recollection on this point to  be  at
    fault. If the  Appellant  had  entered  this  country  in  2001  it  is
    reasonable to have expected some documentary evidence to confirm it but
    there was none. I do not accept the  claim  that  he  arrived  in  this
    country in 2001. Nevertheless, the Appellant has clearly established  a
    private life in this country since 2006 having been educated  here  and
    received medical treatment for his psychological difficulties. There is
    no evidence that he has returned to Nigeria since arrival.

24. The decision not to grant him indefinite leave to remain  but  only  to
    continue with a series of grants of discretionary leave to remain is an
    interference in his private life because of the  precarious  nature  of
    his status as a result of  those  decisions.  Are  those  decisions  in
    accordance with the legitimate aim  of  immigration  control?  Arguably
    they are not because they are not pursuant to a particular  immigration
    route any longer but are simply short-term grants to tide the Appellant
    over. Assuming for these purposes that they are in accordance with  the
    legitimate  aim  of  immigration  control,  are  they  a  proportionate
    interference in the Appellant's private life given his circumstances?

25. This is something of an exceptional case because of the frequent grants
    of leave to remain apparently on compassionate grounds but with no real
    end in sight as to whether the Appellant  will  eventually  be  granted
    indefinite leave to remain. It is not clear what the Appellant needs to
    do to be able to justify indefinite leave to remain. Even if he  cannot
    show that he is entitled to indefinite leave to remain on the basis  of
    a continuous period of six years leave, he has now had leave for a very
    substantial period of time. Were he to apply on the basis of  10  years
    continuous lawful residence the same problem with the break  in  lawful
    residence would apply as was found by the Judge in the First-tier under
    the discretionary leave provisions. I do not consider  this  matter  on
    the basis that the Appellant would be able to qualify  under  paragraph
    276B of the Immigration Rules.

26. Instead I look at the matter outside the Rules as to whether there  are
    compelling and compassionate circumstances such  that  the  Appellant's
    appeal should be allowed. Whilst this is a case which  is  not  without
    difficulties I come to the view that the  Respondent's  decision  is  a
    disproportionate interference with the Appellant's right to  a  private
    life notwithstanding that the Appellant has leave  until  2020  at  the
    present time. I consider that the correct course of action  would  have
    been to have granted the Appellant indefinite leave to remain given the
    length of time he has been here and the fact that he has  not  been  in
    trouble during that time. I set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the grounds of material error of law that is that Article 8
    was not considered and I proceed to remake the decision in this case by
    allowing the appeal under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

27. It is potentially  another  matter  as  to  what  practical  effect  my
    decision will have since I have allowed the appeal outside the Rules. I
    would expect the Respondent to take my decision into account  and  give
    serious consideration to the grant to the Appellant of indefinite leave
    to remain in order to prevent further litigation  on  or  after  August
    2020.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside. I remake the decision in this case by  allowing
the Appellant's appeal against refusal to  grant  him  indefinite  leave  to
remain.

Appellant's appeal allowed

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
