Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr MacKenzie, Counsel for Axiom Stone Solicitors,
                    New Malden, Surrey
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Georgia born on 28 May  1983,  30  April
    1983, 27 August 2009 and 25 May 2016 respectively.  They  appealed  the
    respondent's decision of 28 November 2017 refusing them leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom on family or private life grounds under Article 8
    of ECHR.  Their appeals were heard by Judge of the First-Tier  Tribunal
    Monson on 14 March 2018 and dismissed in a decision  promulgated  on  3
    April 2018.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic on 31 August 2018.  The first and
    second appellants are the parents of the third and  fourth  appellants.
    They are unmarried partners.  The claim focusses on the best  interests
    of the children and the fact that the elder  child  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom for over 8 years.  The application argues that there are
    no powerful reasons which require the child and the rest of the  family
    to leave the UK. Nothing like this has been identified by the Judge and
    the Judge did not follow the correct approach.  The  permission  states
    that there is merit in the contention that the Judge's reliance on  the
    overstaying history of the adult appellants was  arguably  insufficient
    to amount to a powerful  reason  for  removal,  given  that  the  third
    appellant is a qualifying child.

 3. There is no Rule 24 response.

The Hearing

 4. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the third appellant has  been
    in the United Kingdom for 8� years and is therefore a qualifying  child
    and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  her  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  He made reference to the  case  of  MA  (Pakistan  &  Others)
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and submitted that this  case  is  presently  being
    appealed in the Supreme Court.

 5. Counsel submitted that the claim is not limited to the  effect  on  the
    third appellant, all the family must be considered.  I was referred  to
    paragraph 46 of the decision which states that from an educational  and
    emotional stability perspective it is in  the  third  appellant's  best
    interests to remain in the UK, but it goes on to state that  the  third
    appellant will have the support of  her  parents  and  grandparents  in
    adjusting to life in Georgia and in the long term it will be beneficial
    for her to learn the language of the country of which she is a citizen.
     Being bilingual  will  open  up  opportunities  for  her  which  would
    otherwise not exist and will increase her potential employability.

 6. He submitted that once a child has been in the  United  Kingdom  for  7
    years that child is a qualifying child, has put down roots and it would
    be disruptive for  them  to  have  to  move  to  another  country.   He
    submitted that that child has strong  expectations  of  being  able  to
    remain in the United Kingdom and it would be in  their  best  interests
    for this to happen.  He submitted that significant weight must be given
    to the fact that the third appellant is a qualifying child and that she
    should not have to return to Georgia unless there are powerful  reasons
    for this, particularly as she has now been in the United Kingdom for 8�
    years and has never been in Georgia.  Counsel submitted that  the  fact
    that the first two appellants have no right to be in the United Kingdom
    is not enough for the child to have to leave the  United  Kingdom  with
    them.  Their actions are not the fault of the child, but as  the  child
    has been here for more than 7 years it must be in her best interests to
    remain here with her family.

 7. I was referred to the case of MT & ET (Nigeria) [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC)
    which was promulgated on 19 March 2018 after this  hearing  but  before
    the decision was promulgated.  This deals with a child who has been  in
    the United Kingdom from aged 4 until 14.  It states that the fact  that
    a child has been in the UK for 7 years needs to  be  given  significant
    weight in the proportionality exercise.  It goes on to state that  this
    significant weight is because of its  relevance  when  determining  the
    nature and strength of  the  child's  best  interests  and  because  it
    establishes as a starting point that leave  should  be  granted  unless
    there are powerful reasons to the contrary.  The child in that case had
    embarked on a course of study leading to the taking of GCSE's.  Counsel
    submitted that the mother in that case had  used  false  documents  and
    there was more reason to dismiss that appeal  than  there  is  in  this
    case.  He submitted that in this case the third appellant's parents are
    overstayers and he submitted that that is not enough for the qualifying
    child to have to return to Georgia.

 8. Counsel submitted that at  paragraphs  41  and  42  of  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal's decision reference is made to the case of MA (Pakistan)  and
    the Judge states that the only significance of Section 117B(6) is where
    the 7 year rule is satisfied.   Then it is  a  factor  of  some  weight
    leaning in favour of leave to remain  being  granted.   The  First-Tier
    Tribunal refers to the case of EV (Philippines). Counsel submitted that
    that case is not relevant.  That case of EV states that the immigration
    history of the parents may be  relevant.   For  example,  if  they  are
    overstayers.

 9. Counsel submitted that no powerful reasons have been given for removing
    this family and the fact that they will all be  removed  together  does
    not mean that the  best  interests  of  the  third  appellant  will  be
    properly looked after.  He submitted that there is  no  evidence  of  a
    crime or an immigration scam and that the Judge should  have  corrected
    himself  by  finding  that  the  starting  point  is  that  the   third
    appellant's status should have been regularised after she had  been  in
    the United Kingdom for more than  7  years.   I  was  referred  to  the
    finding in MA (Pakistan), that it is likely to be highly disruptive  to
    expect a child in the third appellant's position to leave the  UK.   He
    submitted that this child has put down roots, the fact that  there  are
    extended relatives in Georgia is not a sufficient reason for the family
    having to return there.  He submitted that  the  fact  that  the  third
    appellant has been in the United Kingdom for over 7 years but  has  not
    accrued 7 years residence since the age of 4 is irrelevant as  that  is
    not in the legislation.  The fact that she will  be  going  to  Georgia
    with her family ignores the point of the 7-year rule and I was asked to
    find that the Judge has used too high a test and  is  contrary  to  the
    country guidance cases.  He submitted that  the  fact  that  the  third
    appellant's parents are here  unlawfully  is  not  sufficient  for  the
    claims to fail based on the country guidance case of MT & ET.  He again
    submitted that the Judge has used the wrong approach  and  there  is  a
    material error of law in the decision.

10. The Presenting Officer made his submissions  submitting  that  what  is
    clear is that the Judge was aware of the said case of MA (Pakistan) and
    has quoted it at paragraphs 41 to 43 of  his  decision.   He  submitted
    that the Judge has given this case significant  weight  and  has  given
    serious thought to whether it is in the best  interests  of  the  third
    appellant to remain in the United Kingdom or to return to Georgia  with
    her family.

11. With regard to the grounds I was asked to consider paragraph 44 of  the
    findings.  He submitted that the case of MT & ET deals with a child who
    is preparing to sit her GCSE's.  The third appellant in this case is in
    the middle of her primary education.  He submitted that the  said  case
    of EV (Philippines) is referred to at paragraph 48  of  MA  (Pakistan).
    This paragraph deals  with  how  the  proportionality  test  should  be
    applied where wider public interest considerations are in play.  In  EV
    (Philippines) it is stated that in cases such  as  this  the  need  for
    immigration control may outweigh the best interests of the child and it
    therefore is necessary  to  determine  the  relative  strength  of  the
    factors which make it in their best interests to remain here  and  also
    to take account of any factors that point the other way.  It then lists
    the number of factors which have to be considered, one of which is what
    stage the child's education has reached.  The Judge  clearly  does  not
    feel it is overwhelmingly in the child's best interests  in  this  case
    that she should not return to Georgia. The Judge finds that the need to
    maintain immigration control may well tip the  balance,  especially  if
    the other applicants have no entitlement to remain here.  The case goes
    on to state that the immigration history of the  parents  may  also  be
    relevant.  The case of EV (Philippines) is not a 7  year  case  but  he
    submitted that the same principles will apply.  He submitted  that  the
    Judge has considered whether there are any strong expectations of  this
    family to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Judge  has  clearly  given
    significant weight to the third appellant's situation and has used this
    as the starting point.

12. The Presenting Officer submitted that what I have to decide is  whether
    the Judge was right to say that  the  countervailing  reasons  in  this
    claim are  enough  for  dismissal  of  these  appellants'  claims.   He
    submitted that the extended family in this case are in touch  with  the
    appellants and help to provide for them financially.  He submitted that
    there are cultural reasons  which  would  support  the  return  of  the
    appellants to Georgia.  There are citizenship reasons and he  submitted
    that although another Tribunal might have made a different decision the
    Judge in this case has given careful  reasoning  to  his  decision  and
    there is no material error of law.

13. Counsel submitted that although the Judge was aware of the case  of  MA
    (Pakistan) powerful reasons  are  referred  to  therein  and  the  best
    interests of the third appellant lead to a strong  expectation  of  the
    family being able to remain in the United Kingdom.  He  submitted  that
    the Judge in this case has not applied the correct principles  and  the
    case of EV (Philippines) is not  a  7-year  case.   He  submitted  that
    significant weight has to be given to the third appellant's rights  and
    at paragraph 47 the Judge  states  that  he  considers  that  the  best
    interests of the third appellant lie in her returning with her  parents
    and younger sibling to Georgia, or alternatively, if he is incorrect it
    is not overwhelmingly in the child's best interests to remain  here  as
    opposed to there being best interest considerations going both ways.

14. He submitted that although the facts in the said case of MT  &  ET  are
    different,  the  same  principle  applies  and  this  family  is   more
    respectable than the family in the said case of MT & ET.  He  submitted
    that the Judge has not used the correct approach and  has  applied  the
    principles in the wrong way.

15. I was asked to allow the appeal and remit it to the First-Tier Tribunal
    for rehearing only after the Supreme Court has completed  its  decision
    in the said case of MA (Pakistan).

Decision and Reasons

16. I have to decide if there is a material error of law in the  First-Tier
    Tribunal's decision  in  this  case.   The  first  two  appellants  are
    overstayers.  The third appellant has now been here for 8� years.   The
    fourth appellant is under two years old.

17. The third appellant is  a  qualifying  child.   The  skeleton  argument
    states that if the Tribunal is satisfied that it is not reasonable  for
    her to be expected to leave the UK she  will  succeed  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv) of the Rules.  The skeleton argument also states that  it
    would be difficult for the third appellant to meaningfully integrate in
    Georgia and that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) applies.

18. It cannot be said that the first two appellants immigration history  is
    not relevant.  It has to be taken into account when the best  interests
    of the children are considered.   The  parents  are  overstayers.   The
    first appellant has been working without permission.  The  case  of  EV
    (Philippines) is relevant although it is not a 7-year case.  There  has
    to be a proportionality assessment and public interest has to be  taken
    into account.

19. I have carefully considered the First-Tier Tribunal's decision.  It  is
    clear that the Judge is aware of the length of time the third appellant
    has been in the United Kingdom or had been at the date of the decision.
     She has now been here for 8�  years  and  the  Judge  also  noted  her
    special needs.  He has noted that the first and second appellant  still
    have a relationship with both sets of parents in Georgia who help  them
    financially to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Judge has  considered
    the medical evidence on the third  appellant  which  is  that  she  has
    normal hearing in her right ear and a mild hearing  loss  in  her  left
    ear. Her speech has now  improved  and  she  is  being  educated  in  a
    mainstream primary school and progressing well.  The Judge  also  notes
    that there is a fully functioning healthcare system  in  Georgia.   The
    objective evidence refers to the English-speaking schools  in  Tbilisi.
    The Judge then refers at paragraph 39 to  the  best  interests  of  the
    children.  He makes reference to the case  of  Asemi  Moayed  &  Others
    [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) which states that it is not  the  case  that  the
    best interests principle means it is automatically in the interests  of
    any child to be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom.  It goes  on
    to state that it is in the best interests of the children  to  be  with
    both their parents.  The Judge refers to reasonableness relating to the
    third appellant and refers to the said case of MA (Pakistan) &  Others.
    He notes that it is a factor of some weight leaning in favour of  leave
    to remain being granted, that the  third  appellant  has  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for over 7 years.  Reference is made by the Judge to the
    child putting down roots and reference is made of the possibility  that
    it will be highly disruptive if the  child  has  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom, but the Judge states  that  this  may  be  less  so  when  the
    children are very young, as the focus of their lives will be with their
    family.  The child's best interests are  a  primary  consideration  and
    that is how the Judge has dealt with this.  The Judge has  referred  to
    the case of EV (Philippines) and finds it is not overwhelmingly in  the
    child's  best  interests  to  remain  in  the  UK.   A  proportionality
    assessment has to be made.  The Judge makes  reference  to  the  strong
    weight to be given to the  need  to  maintain  immigration  control  in
    pursuit of the economic wellbeing of the country and the fact that  the
    appellants have no entitlement to remain.

20. The Judge fairly states that there  are  best  interest  considerations
    which are in favour of the third appellant remaining in the UK with her
    parents and younger sibling.  However, the appellant is not, as in  the
    case of MT & ET, at a crucial stage of her education.  She is into  her
    third or fourth year at primary school only and she  has  her  extended
    family members in Georgia, including both  sets  of  grandparents.   At
    paragraph 46 the Judge gives reasons for finding that she should return
    to Georgia with her family and  states  that  when  proportionality  is
    considered it would be reasonable to  expect  the  third  appellant  to
    leave the United Kingdom  as  both  parents  have  adverse  immigration
    histories and neither parent has ever had a legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to carry on family and private life in the United Kingdom on
    a personal basis.  At paragraph 49 the  Judge  states  that  there  are
    strong reasons why  public  interest  should  prevail  and  that  these
    outweigh the qualifying child's  interests,  making  it  reasonable  to
    expect  her  to  leave  the  UK.   The  Judge  finds   that   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv) and (vi) cannot be satisfied and this finding is properly
    reasoned.


21. I have considered the case of KO (Nigeria) UKSC 53. It is  relevant  to
    consider where the parents of a qualifying child are expected to be  as
    it will normally be reasonable for the child to be with them.


22. The terms of the Rules cannot be satisfied relating to  Article  8  and
    the Judge considers Article 8 outside the Rules, and the case of Razgar
    and Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  With regard to public  interest  the
    appellants are unlawfully in the United Kingdom and place a  burden  on
    the taxpayer as  the  third  appellant  is  being  educated  at  public
    expense.  The first appellant has been working  illegally.   The  third
    appellant has been using free NHS services.  The Judge then states that
    while the first and second appellants have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the third  appellant  it  is  reasonable  to
    expect the third appellant who is  a  qualifying  child  to  leave  the
    country with them.

23. All the Judge's findings are explained.  There are no errors of law  in
    the decision.  The Judge finds it is proportionate  to  the  legitimate
    ends sought  to  be  achieved,  namely  the  maintenance  of  firm  and
    effective immigration controls and  the  protection  of  the  country's
    economic wellbeing, for this family all to return to Georgia.

Notice of Decision

I find that there is no material error of law in the Judge's decision.   The
decision  promulgated  on  3  April  2018  therefore  must  stand  and   the
appellants' appeals are dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity has been directed.
