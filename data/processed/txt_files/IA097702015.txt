Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr P Richardson of counsel, instructed by Bespoke
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kelly promulgated 25.9.15, dismissing his appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated  17.2.15  to  refuse  his
    application for leave to remain on the  basis  of  private  and  family
    life, and to remove him from the UK  pursuant  to  section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.9.15.



 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    25.2.16.

 3. The appeal was first listed in the Upper Tribunal before  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge McGinty, who adjourned  the  error  of  law  hearing  to
    enable the appellant to submit  an  application  to  amend  grounds  of
    appeal and gave directions for service of the  same  and  any  Rule  24
    reply by the Secretary of State.

 4. We have before us the amended grounds of appeal and application,  dated
    4.5.16, drafted by Mr  J  Butterworth  of  counsel,  together  with  Mr
    Duffy's Rule 24 reply, received on 20.5.16.

 5. Thus the matter came before us on 28.6.16. as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.   We  heard  submissions  of  the  representatives  for   the
    appellant and the Secretary of State and reserved our  decision,  which
    we now give.

Error of Law

 6. For the reasons briefly summarised below, we find such error of law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require the
    decision of Judge Kelly to be set aside and remade  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 7. Insofar as permission is required  to  advance  additional  grounds  of
    appeal, we consider it in the interests of justice to grant permission,
    notwithstanding the application and amended grounds are out of time, as
    pointed out by Mr Duffy.

 8. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  considered  it
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal adopted an incorrect approach  to
    the assessment of evidence in relation to the issue of the  appellant's
    credibility.

 9. The primary concern arises from the way in which �18 of the  First-tier
    Tribunal  decision  is  worded.  There,  having  relied  on  additional
    evidence only submitted by the respondent at the  appeal  hearing,  the
    judge reached the conclusion that the  "appellant  is  not  a  credible
    witness and that his evidence cannot be  accepted  as  reliable."  With
    that crucial finding, the judge then went on to consider "whether there
    is any other evidence  to  corroborate  his  claim  to  be  homosexual.
    However, I find that there is not."

10. In effect, the judge made a preliminary finding that the appellant  was
    not telling the truth about his sexuality, based on the late disclosure
    of information by the Secretary of State's representative at the appeal
    hearing. This information related to the previous application  in  2014
    for an EEA Residence Card on the basis of a durable relationship with a
    female EEA citizen, which is referred to in the refusal  decision,  but
    also information that was not referred  to  in  the  refusal  decision,
    comprising an Immigration Officer's Report as to the interview  of  the
    appellant and his alleged partner Mr Patel at the  Registry  Office  on
    27.2.15, on an attempt to  enter  into  what  the  Secretary  of  State
    considered to be a sham civil partnership. The record of the  interview
    with the appellant was adduced, but not that of the interview  with  Mr
    Patel, which was only referred to in the  summary  in  the  Immigration
    Officer's report. In summary, the information suggested  that  the  EEA
    application was a sham and that the appellant was no more than  friends
    with the EEA national. It was also asserted that the appellant admitted
    that there was no genuine relationship, and that Mr Patel admitted that
    he was not in a relationship with the appellant, did not live with him,
    and in fact was heterosexual and  had  a  girlfriend.  The  notes  also
    suggest that the appellant told the Immigration  Officer  that  he  had
    been advised that it would be easier to obtain a  visa  if  he  entered
    into a sham marriage.

11. Although the appellant's representative at the  appeal  hearing  raised
    concerns about the late service of this important information,  he  did
    not seek an adjournment to counter this information by the  calling  of
    other evidence, or seek production of the interview notes of Mr Patel's
    interview.

12. At �16 the judge reached the conclusion that notes and interview record
    were reliable and attached significant  weight  to  them,  finding  the
    officers involved had no reason to be anything other  than  honest  and
    accurate in representing what the appellant and Mr Patel told  them  on
    27.2.15.

13. The first concern raised in the grounds of appeal and advanced  in  the
    submissions before us is that rather than taking a  holistic  approach,
    assessing the  appellant's  credibility  by  taking  into  account  the
    evidence as a whole,  in  the  round,  the  judge  reached  this  early
    conclusion that  the  appellant  was  not  credible  and  assessed  the
    remaining evidence in the light of that conclusion on credibility.

14. It can be seen that after reaching his conclusion as to the appellant's
    credibility, the judge went on at  �19,  �20,  �21,  �22,  and  �23  to
    address  the  evidence  relied  on   by   the   appellant,   including:
    photographs; text-style  messages;  donations  to  a  LGBT  group;  the
    alleged absence of documentary evidence to confirm cohabitation with Mr
    Patel; and the absence of any supporting witness  evidence  to  confirm
    the appellant's alleged involvement in the gay community or at same-sex
    venues. However, it is clear that the judge's approach to this evidence
    was to view it in the light of credibility findings already  made.  For
    example, at �19 in relation to the photographs, the  judge  stated,  "I
    have already concluded that the appellant and Mr Patel  have  never  in
    fact been in a physical relationship with each  other  and  that  their
    attempt to enter into a civil partnership was for the sole  purpose  of
    trying to establish immigration rights in this  country.  Against  this
    background, I find that that the photographs were taken as part of  the
    appellant's overall plan to  mislead  the  immigration  authorities...I
    therefore do not attach any weight to these."

15. In effect, the judge's view of this evidence was tainted by the already-
    reached conclusion that the appellant's claim about his  sexuality  was
    not credible. We find that the correct approach  should  have  been  to
    view this evidence as part of the evidence as  a  whole  going  to  the
    appellant's overall credibility, rather than  dismissing  the  evidence
    because it was inconsistent with the credibility findings already made.



16. We have considered whether it might be possible to view the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal on  the  basis  that  the  judge  did  make  an
    assessment of the  evidence  as  a  whole  before  making  any  of  the
    credibility findings, recognising that the judge has to start somewhere
    when addressing evidence in relation to credibility. However, there are
    ways in which a judge  can  make  clear  that  the  evidence  has  been
    addressed as a whole before reaching any of the findings of  fact,  but
    this was not made clear in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  In
    the circumstances, we find there is an error of law in the way in which
    the First-tier Tribunal approached the credibility findings.

17.  We  have  also  considered  whether  the  error  in  relation  to  the
    credibility  findings  are  in  fact  material  in  the  light  of  the
    alternative finding at �24 of the decision that even if  the  appellant
    is homosexual he does not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(vi)
    in relation to his private life, because on the background evidence the
    judge found  that  he  could  return  to  live  in  India  without  any
    significant risk of arrest or persecution. In those circumstances,  the
    appellant would not be able to show that  there  are  very  significant
    obstacles to his integration in India.

18. We bear in mind that no ground of appeal in either the original grounds
    nor  the  amended  grounds  of  appeal  take  issue  with  the  judge's
    conclusion at �24 as to 'very significant obstacles.'  However,  it  is
    clear from �24,  �25  and  �26  that  the  conclusion  in  relation  to
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) is at least to some degree tainted by  the  flawed
    credibility findings. For example, at �25 where  the  judge  considered
    the claim that the appellant's father would try to kill him  on  return
    to India, the judge stated,  "However,  given  my  adverse  credibility
    findings in respect of the appellant and my conclusions about his claim
    generally, I find this assertion to be self-serving and I do not attach
    any weight to it."

19. It follows that we are driven to conclude that  the  error  of  law  in
    relation to the approach to the appellant's credibility is material and
    sufficient to require the decision to be set aside.

20. Returning to the issue of the late service of crucial information about
    the attempt to enter into the civil partnership at the Registry  Office
    on 27.2.15 and Mr Patel's alleged admission that this was  a  sham,  as
    stated above, we take into account that the appellant's  representative
    did not  seek  an  adjournment  to  address  this  important  evidence.
    However, in the light  of  Miah  (interviewer's  comments:  disclosure:
    fairness) [2014] UKUT 00515 (IAC), we reach  the  conclusion  that  the
    reliance on this evidence at the last minute at the First-tier Tribunal
    appeal hearing, especially when it was not raised at all in the refusal
    decision, was procedurally unfair, even though there was no application
    to adjourn.

21. In Miah and in other similar cases the President and the Upper Tribunal
    have held that disclosure of  such  material,  such  as  the  interview
    record of Mr Patel, should be  made  as  a  matter  of  course  in  the
    interests of the appellant's right to a fair hearing. The appellant  is
    entitled to know in advance the case he has to meet. He would have been
    totally unaware before the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing that  the
    Secretary of State was going to  adduce  evidence  in  which  Mr  Patel
    apparently admitted that  the  claimed  sexual  relationship  with  the
    appellant was a sham.

22. Mr Duffy was not able to explain to us why that  interview  record  was
    not disclosed at the First-tier Tribunal appeal and never has been;  it
    was not within his case papers at the hearing before us. Even if  there
    are some third-party privacy disclosure issues they could be dealt with
    appropriately by directions of the Tribunal, including for redaction of
    sensitive information, as suggested by the President in Miah.  Further,
    the President stated, "While  there  may  be  cases  where  it  can  be
    demonstrated that non-disclosure of this document did  not  contaminate
    the fairness of the  Tribunal's  decision  making  process,  one  would
    expect these to be rare."

23. In the light of the case law, we reach the conclusion that  the  appeal
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal was also flawed  for  procedural
    unfairness.

24. Given the information that was disclosed by the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative, both in relation to the EEA Residence Card application,
    and the answers in interview of the  appellant  and  Mr  Patel  at  the
    Registry Office on 27.2.15, at any future re-hearing of the decision in
    the appeal the appellant is likely to face considerable difficulties in
    establishing his  credibility.  However,  he  should  be  accorded  the
    opportunity to address the evidence fairly and for his  credibility  to
    be assessed in the light of the evidence as a whole.

25. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiate  all  other  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

26. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    we do so on the basis that this is a case which falls  squarely  within
    the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect
    of the error has been to deprive the appellant of a  fair  hearing  and
    that the nature or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, we find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

27. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     We set aside the decision.

                    We remit the making of the decision in the appeal to the
                    First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh.
