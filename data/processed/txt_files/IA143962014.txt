For the Appellant:     Mr A Adewoye, instructed by Prime Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant,  a  citizen  of  Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State  dated  13  March
    2014 to refuse his application for a residence card as confirmation  of
    a right of residence under the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (the  2006  Regulations).  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Rowlands dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 25  February
    2015. The appellant appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The relevant provisions of the 2006 Regulations  for  the  purposes  of
    this appeal are as follows:





           "Extended family member"

           8. (1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a
           person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
           regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions
           in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).
           (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the
           person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil
           partner and-
                 (a)the person is residing in a country other than the
                 United Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is
                 a member of his household;
                 (b)the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and
                 is accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or
                 wishes to join him there; or
                 (c)the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has
                 joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues
                 to be dependent upon him or to be a member of his
                 household.
           ...

 3. The evidence put forward by the appellant to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge was that he lived in Nigeria with his parents and  five  brothers
    and that his EEA national brother (the sponsor) relocated from  Nigeria
    to Germany in 1991, moved to France in 1995  and  came  to  the  UK  in
    December 2007. The appellant says that the sponsor returned to  Nigeria
    to visit a few times a year and that he supported the family  for  long
    periods as the appellant's father and mother did not get  on  well  and
    his father was in the Army and was away from home for long periods. The
    appellant says that after his father retired from the army in 1996  the
    appellant was solely dependant on the sponsor as his mother was a petty
    trader and had three other children and could not support them all. The
    appellant said that the sponsor sent money to  his  mother  to  support
    them through agencies and through friends. His mother  used  the  money
    for the appellant's upkeep and  education  and  for  the  rest  of  the
    family.  The  appellant's  case  is  that  the  sponsor  sponsored  his
    secondary and University education in Nigeria and sent  money  for  his
    uniforms and upkeep. He claims that the sponsor sent his flight  ticket
    money in 2009. The appellant says that he lived with the  sponsor  when
    he first came to the UK and that when he went  to  City  University  in
    London he stayed with a friend and the sponsor contributed towards  the
    rent and paid �100-200  into  his  account  on  a  monthly  basis.  The
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that  the  appellant  was
    unemployed and the sponsor continued to support him through payments of
    cash and paying money into his account.

 4. The appellant claims to have entered the UK in 2009 as a student. On 21
    January 2011 he was granted a Tier 1 (Post-study work) visa valid until
    21 January 2013. On 1 October 2013 he applied for an EEA residence card
    as the extended family member of his half brother, James Odia, a French
    national (the sponsor). The Secretary of State refused the  application
    on the basis that the DNA test  submitted  was  not  from  an  approved
    laboratory and was not accepted as evidence that the appellant and  the
    sponsor are related as claimed; that the receipts submitted as evidence
    of money transfers in 2008 and 2009 looked  as  though  they  had  been
    issued very recently; and that there was no evidence that the appellant
    had been residing with or had  been  dependant  on  the  sponsor  since
    entering the UK. The application was therefore refused under Regulation
    8 of the 2006 Regulations.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted that the new DNA evidence, which
    was not challenged, demonstrated that the appellant and the sponsor are
    related as claimed. In considering the issue of  dependency  the  Judge
    considered that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  were  not  credible
    witnesses finding that the appellant was particularly  evasive  in  his
    answers and that he was clearly making up some of his  evidence  as  he
    was going along. The Judge gave examples of the evidence he  found  not
    to be credible including the  appellant's  evidence  about  the  weekly
    payments of �80 from his  friend  in  December  2014  which  the  Judge
    considered were rent payments and not money for Christmas  presents  as
    claimed by the appellant. A further example was the evidence about  the
    appellant's purchase of a Mercedes car  which  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor claimed was purchased from the appellant's savings  at  a  time
    when he was being supported by the sponsor. The  Judge  concluded  that
    there is insufficient  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  ever  being
    supported by the sponsor in Nigeria. The Judge  noted  that  there  had
    been no explanation as to why the appellant was being supported by  the
    sponsor there given that his father, a retired army officer, presumably
    had a pension.

 6. The appellant relies on three main grounds in his grounds of appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal. Firstly the appellant contends that the Judge erred
    in that he failed to take account  of  the  sworn  affidavit  from  the
    appellant's father stating that the sponsor  had  sent  funds  for  the
    upkeep of the appellant. Secondly it is contended that the Judge  erred
    in failing to make  definite  findings  on  the  admissibility  of  the
    receipts from 2008 and 2009 which the respondent had considered  looked
    'new'. Although it is contended that the Judge erred  in  stating  that
    the sponsor is no blood relative of the appellant's father  whereas  he
    is the appellant's father's son this is not supported by  the  evidence
    which indicates that the appellant and sponsor share  the  same  mother
    but have different fathers. The third main  ground  is  that  that  the
    Judge failed to take account  of  the  evidence  that  the  appellant's
    parents did not  have  a  good  relationship  in  considering  why  the
    appellant's father could not  look  after  the  children.  In  granting
    permission on the basis that the first and second grounds are  arguable
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley indicated that the third  ground  has
    little merit.

 7. At the hearing before me Mr Adewoye submitted that the  Judge  did  not
    fully engage with the evidence before him in particular the appellant's
    father's affidavit and the two receipts. He submitted  that  the  Judge
    attached too much weight to one or two aspects of credibility.

 8. Ms Johnstone submitted that the findings were open  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge based on the oral and documentary evidence submitted.

Error of Law

 9. In order to establish that  he  is  an  extended  family  member  under
    regulation 8 (2) (c) the appellant  had  to  demonstrate  that  he  was
    dependant on the sponsor when in Nigeria and that he  continues  to  be
    dependant on him or is a member of his household in the UK.

10. The first and second grounds are interlinked, the first  contends  that
    the Judge  erred  in  failing  to  consider  the  appellant's  father's
    affidavits and the second that the Judge did not fully engage with  the
    two receipts submitted. I accept that the Judge  did  not  specifically
    refer to the affidavits. The affidavit dated 29 August 2013 states that
    the sponsor was  responsible  for  the  education  and  upkeep  of  the
    appellant and that funds were sent through the appellant's late  mother
    and that, since her death, receipts could not be located.

11. In light of the lack of documentary evidence the determination of  this
    appeal was largely down to the assessment of the oral evidence from the
    appellant and the sponsor. The  Judge  found  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor were not 'at all compelling or  credible'  [24]  and  that  the
    appellant had been evasive, he also concluded that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor lied to him [25]. The Judge clearly attached little  weight  to
    the oral  evidence  of  the  appellant  and  sponsor.  The  Judge  made
    significant adverse credibility findings which were open to him, on the
    basis of the oral evidence he heard and the issues highlighted  in  the
    decision.

12. In these circumstances the Judge would have required strong documentary
    evidence to establish  dependency  in  Nigeria.  The  Judge  said  that
    insufficient evidence had  been  presented  to  satisfy  him  that  the
    sponsor was ever in reality financing the appellant  in  Nigeria  [26].
    This clearly also refers to the lack of documentary evidence.

13. One  of  the  few  pieces  of  documentary  evidence  he  had  was  the
    appellant's father's affidavits.  The  affidavits  add  little  to  the
    accounts given by the appellant and the sponsor which were  subject  to
    cross-examination and were not accepted by the Judge.

14. So, whilst the Judge did  not  specifically  refer  to  this  piece  of
    evidence his general assessment as to the insufficiency of the evidence
    must have covered this  piece  of  evidence.  I  do  not  see  how  the
    affidavit could have been  considered  to  be  sufficient  evidence  of
    dependency in Nigeria on its own. It had to be considered in the  round
    on the basis of all the evidence and this is  what  the  Judge  did  at
    paragraph 26.

15. The Judge also had before him the receipts from November 2008 and  July
    2009. The Secretary of State had noted  that  these  appeared  new  and
    doubted whether these transactions had taken  place.  Contrary  to  the
    assertion in the grounds of appeal the Judge did not  have  to  make  a
    definitive finding as to  whether  the  receipts  looked  new  or  were
    admissible. The Judge  had  to  make  findings  based  on  all  of  the
    evidence. That's what he did at paragraph 26, having concluded that the
    appellant and the sponsor were not credible. In light of  that  finding
    the Judge would have struggled to reach a finding that  dependency  had
    been established in light of the lack of documentary evidence.

16. The third ground contends that the Judge failed to take account of  the
    evidence that the appellant's father and mother did  not  have  a  good
    relationship as an explanation for the fact that he did not support the
    family. However again this ground ignores the  dearth  of  evidence  to
    show that the appellant was dependant on the sponsor whilst he  was  in
    Nigeria. The appellant claims that the sponsor supported him from  1991
    until  2009  including  paying  for  his  education  at  secondary  and
    university level. Had this been the case then the appellant should have
    been able to submit documentary evidence to prove  that  regardless  of
    the role of the appellant's father.

17. In my view the Judge gave adequate reasons at paragraph 26 for  finding
    that there was a lack of explanation why the appellant's  father  would
    be unable to finance his children without the financial support of  the
    sponsor. The third ground has not been made out.

18. The Judge made findings open to  him  as  to  the  credibility  of  the
    witnesses and the inadequacy of the evidence. Accordingly there  is  no
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusion

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error on a point of law.

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. I make no anonymity direction.
