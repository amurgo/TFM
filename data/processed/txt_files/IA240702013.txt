    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Ms J Isherwood, a
           Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondents: Mr J Collins counsel instructed by J
McCarthy Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department.  I
      will refer to her as the  Secretary  of  State.  The  respondents  are
      citizens of Nigeria and mother and son. The  mother  was  born  on  12
      October 1985 and her son on 2 December 2008. I will refer  to  her  as
      the claimant, to him as her/the  son  and  to  both  of  them  as  the
      claimants. The claimant appealed  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision of 29 May 2013 to refuse to vary her leave to remain  in  the
      UK. The son appealed against the Secretary of State's decision  of  31
      May 2013 to refuse to vary his leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  the
      dependant of the claimant.


   2. The claimants appealed and their  appeals  were  heard  by  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Carroll ("the FTTJ") on 4 April 2014. Both parties were
      represented and the FTTJ heard evidence  from  the  claimant  and  her
      partner (Mr S). The claimant accepted that  she  had  not  been  in  a
      relationship akin to marriage with her partner for two years prior  to
      her application and that she did not meet the income  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules. The appeals were pursued  on  Article  8  human
      rights grounds only.


   3. Whilst the FTTJ did not in terms find the claimant and her partner  to
      be credible witnesses it is sufficiently  clear  that  she  considered
      them to be credible and accepted their evidence.  She  considered  the
      appeal exclusively on Article 8 grounds outside the Immigration Rules,
      applying Razgar principles (Razgar [2004] UKHL 27), and concluded that
      the Secretary of State's decisions would  involve  a  disproportionate
      interference with the Article 8 human rights of  both  claimants.  She
      allowed their appeals on Article 8 human rights grounds.


   4. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal, one  day  out
      of time. The First-Tier Tribunal Judge who considered the  application
      accepted the explanation for the delay and extended time  as  well  as
      granting permission to appeal. The grounds argue that the  FTTJ  erred
      in law by failing to apply the principles set out in Gulshan  (Article
      8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).


   5. The summary of the provisions of Gulshan, prepared by  the  author  of
      that determination, Cranston J, states;


        "On the current state of the authorities:


        (a)    the  maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,
        although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said  that
        they  could  constitute   an   unjustified   and   disproportionate
        interference with the ability  of  spouses  to  live  together;  he
        suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around  �13,400,  and
        highlighted the position of  young  people  and  low  wage  earners
        caught by the higher figure in the rules;
        (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there
        may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside
        them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
        whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not   sufficiently
        recognised under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v Secretary
        of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);
        (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions  such  as
        Section EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF
        (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  393  (IAC); Izuazu
        (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 45  (IAC);  they  concern  the
        practical possibilities of  relocation.  In  the  absence  of  such
        insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to  show  other  non-
        standard and particular features demonstrating that removal will be
        unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


        The Secretary of State addressed the Article 8  family  aspects  of
        the respondent's position through the Rules, in particular EX1, and
        the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge should
        have done likewise, also paying attention to the Guidance. Thus the
        judge should have considered the Secretary  of  State's  conclusion
        under EX.1 that there were no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
        the continuation of the family life outside the UK. Only  if  there
        were arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the
        rules was it necessary for him for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to
        consider  whether   there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
        sufficiently recognised under the Rules."


   6. At the hearing before me Mr Collins conceded that the  FTTJ  erred  in
      law by failing to refer to or consider Gulshan principles. However, he
      argued that this was not a material error  because,  had  the  Gulshan
      principles been properly  applied,  the  FTTJ  would  inevitably  have
      reached the same conclusion. Ms Isherwood agreed  that  this  was  the
      issue at the core of this appeal.


   7. Ms Isherwood provided me with the judgement of the Court of Appeal  in
      MM (Lebanon) & Ors, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ 985  (11  July  2014) but,
      after taking me to various passages, submitted that there was  nothing
      to indicate that Gulshan principles should not continue to be applied.
      It remained good law. She argued that the findings of the FTTJ did not
      justify the operation of the first stage trigger  in  Gulshan  or  the
      second  stage  test  of  compelling  circumstances  not   sufficiently
      recognised  under  the  Rules.  The  claimants  could  not  meet   the
      provisions of the Immigration Rules.  In  reply  to  my  question,  Ms
      Isherwood accepted that the claimant and her partner  had  always  had
      regard to and observed the Immigration Rules. They had always been  in
      this country with leave.


   8. Ms Isherwood submitted that  the  FTTJ  had  failed  to  consider  the
      economic well-being of this country or to have proper  regard  to  the
      requirements for Immigration control. However, she accepted that  this
      line of argument was not included in the Secretary of State's  grounds
      of appeal. She confirmed that there was no  criticism  of  the  FTTJ's
      findings of fact. I was asked to find that the determination contained
      errors of law, to set aside  the  decision  and  to  re-determine  the
      appeal on the evidence before the FTTJ. Were I to do so she would  not
      wish to make any further submissions.


   9. Mr Collins relied on Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim)  Pakistan  [2014]
      UKUT 85 (IAC) (26 February 2014). Like  Ms  Isherwood  he  could  find
      nothing in MM to indicate that Gulshan principles should not  continue
      to be applied. He submitted that the claimants satisfied both tests in
      Gulshan. In the reasons for refusal  letter  dated  29  May  2013  the
      Secretary of State had not considered the  Article  8  grounds  except
      under the provisions of the Immigration Rules.  Furthermore,  she  had
      not considered whether there were any exceptional circumstances  under
      the provisions of EX1. He was not arguing that this was a "near  miss"
      case and accepted that the  claimants  could  not  succeed  under  the
      Immigration  Rules.  The  claimant  and  her  partner  had  impeccable
      immigration histories and were accepted to  be  wholly  credible.  The
      claimant's partner had to all intents and purposes  become  her  son's
      father. Her son did not  see  his  natural  father.  In  reply  to  my
      question, Mr Collins accepted that  the  FTTJ  had  made  findings  in
      relation to all essential facts. The best interests of the son were  a
      paramount consideration. The FTTJ  had  properly  concluded  that  the
      claimant's partner could not be expected to  relocate  to  Nigeria,  a
      country he had not visited since he was 11 years of age.


  10. Mr Collins asked me to find that, whilst there was an error of law, it
      was not a material error or one which should cause me to set aside the
      decision. In the alternative, if I concluded that the decision  should
      be set aside, he asked me to remake the decision and allow the  appeal
      outside the Immigration  Rules  on  Article  8  human  rights  grounds
      applying Gulshan principles. The claimants did not wish to put forward
      any further evidence or submissions.


  11. I reserved my determination.


  12. I find that the FTTJ erred in law. Having concluded that the claimants
      did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules she should have
      applied  Gulshan  principles.  Firstly,  she  should  have  considered
      whether there were arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
      outside the Rules. Secondly, if this  question  was  answered  in  the
      affirmative,  whether  there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
      sufficiently recognised under the Rules. This course was  set  out  in
      the skeleton argument before her. Instead, the FTTJ moved directly  to
      an assessment of the Article 8 grounds outside the  Immigration  Rules
      applying the five stage tests in Razgar.


  13. However, I must consider whether the error  of  law  is  such  that  I
      should set aside the decision or, put another way,  whether  it  is  a
      material error.


  14. The FTTJ's findings of fact and assessment are set out  in  paragraphs
      10 to 16 of the determination in which she said;


         "10. It is not in dispute that the appellant does not  satisfy  the
         provisions of the Immigration Rule. She was not able to demonstrate
         that, as at the date of the application, she had been  living  with
         Mr S in a relationship akin to marriage for at least two years.  It
         is, however, argued with great force on  behalf  of  the  appellant
         that if it is right  that  but  for  the  two-year  requirement  of
         cohabitation, the appellant satisfies the  Immigration  Rules  then
         she is placed in a very difficult position. She cannot withdraw her
         application and apply now under the Rules as  she  would  lose  her
         leave to remain and her  right  to  work  lawfully,  by  virtue  of
         Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971. She would be placed in  the
         position  of  being  unable  to   succeed   under   the   financial
         requirements of the Immigration Rules and would be an overstayer.


         11. In considering the  appellant's  family  and  private  life  by
         reference to Article 8 I am, of course,  guided  by  the  questions
         articulated by Lord Bingham in ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  The
         respondent's decision is made in pursuit of a  legitimate  aim  and
         the  question  which  falls   to   be   considered   is   that   of
         proportionality.  I  must  consider  Lord  Bingham's   step-by-step
         approach and in so doing  recognise  that  at  all  stages  of  the
         Article 8 assessment, when deciding whether there is  a  family  or
         private life, whether any existing family or private  life  is  the
         subject of interference having grave consequences and  whether  any
         such interference is proportionate to  the  legitimate  public  end
         sought to be achieved, the approach is to take into account a  wide
         range of circumstances including the  appellant's  previous  family
         and personal circumstances and likely developments in the future. I
         must also consider the consequences of  the  respondent's  decision
         upon all members of  the  appellants'  family  unit  and  the  best
         interests of the first appellant's child in the United Kingdom.


         12. I have  had  the  benefit  of  oral  evidence  from  the  first
         appellant and Mr S and am satisfied that the  relationship  between
         them is one of great mutual commitment. They  intend  to  marry  at
         some point in the future, when the  first  appellant's  immigration
         status is resolved. The first appellant, Mr S  and  (the  son)  all
         enjoy a family life together and I  am  satisfied  that  Mr  S  has
         assumed the role of (the son's) father, since he began to live with
         both appellants in May 2012. The first  appellant  says  that  (her
         son) believes that Mr S is his biological father and refers to  him
         as "daddy". Mr S has been involved with all aspects of (the  son's)
         day-to-day care since he  and  the  first  appellant  began  living
         together.


         13. It was argued at the  hearing  that  Mr  S  could  relocate  to
         Nigeria to continue his family life there with the first  appellant
         and (the son). He has, however, been living in the  United  Kingdom
         for 30 years, having travelled here first when he was  11  for  the
         purposes of his education.  He  has  not  since  then  returned  to
         Nigeria. He is a British national and, as  an  EU  citizen,  cannot
         properly be expected to relocate to Nigeria and lose the benefit of
         his EU citizenship.


         14. The respondent's decision amounts to an interference  with  the
         family life of the appellants' family unit. In considering the best
         interests of (the son), I note he is still comparatively young  but
         all his life has been spent in the United Kingdom where he  is  now
         being educated and where all his immediate family and  social  ties
         are. Both the first appellant and Mr S have  been  entirely  candid
         about the presence of family members in  Nigeria  where  the  first
         appellant's mother continues to live. However, separation  of  (the
         son) from the father figure in his life, namely Mr  S,  would  have
         nothing but an adverse impact upon him.


         15. The first appellant has been lawfully  present  in  the  United
         Kingdom since November 2004. She has had various grants of leave to
         remain as a student and then as a post study worker. For  the  last
         five years she has been working  for  a  finance  company  and  her
         present salary is �21,500 per year (excluding bonuses).  The  first
         appellant's sister is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom.
         The first appellant has an extensive  network  of  friends  in  the
         United Kingdom and is a very committed member of  her  church  (see
         letter from the  church  pastor  at  page  56  of  the  appellant's
         bundle).


         16.In the light of all the evidence, in particular relating to  the
         strong family life existing between the first appellant, Mr  S  and
         (the son), I find  that  the  respondent's  decision  under  appeal
         prejudices the appellant's family and  private  life  in  a  manner
         sufficiently serious to give rise to a breach  of  the  fundamental
         rights protected by Article 8."


  15. The findings of fact contained in these paragraphs are not disputed by
      the Secretary of State. Mr Collins  accepts  that  all  the  essential
      facts are set out.


  16. On these facts I find that any judge  properly  directing  himself  or
      herself would have come to the conclusion  there  were  arguably  good
      grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules.  I  note  that
      the test is only that of "arguably good grounds" which is lower than a
      test of "good grounds".


  17. The grounds of appeal do not argue that the FTTJ's assessment  of  the
      Article 8 grounds outside the  Immigration  Rules  applying  the  five
      stage Razgar tests is intrinsically flawed. The grounds argue that the
      error  was  to  make  a  freestanding  Article  8  assessment  without
      considering  whether   there   were   compelling   circumstances   not
      sufficiently recognised  under  the  Rules.  I  find  that  any  judge
      properly  directing  himself  or  herself  would  have  come  to   the
      conclusion  that  this  was  a  case  where  there   were   compelling
      circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the  Rules.  These
      circumstances  are  contained  in   the   passages   in   the   FTTJ's
      determination which I have set out but in summary they are as follows.
      The best interests of the son, which are a primary  consideration.  It
      is important that he should able to live with the claimant and  Mr  S.
      The son regards Mr S as his father and is settled and  doing  well  at
      school. Mr S cannot properly (or reasonably) be expected  to  relocate
      to Nigeria. The claimant and Mr S are law abiding  citizens  who  have
      always observed the requirements of the Immigration Rules and remained
      in this country with leave to be here. This is a factor which impinges
      on the public interest in the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
      control which is either an aspect of the  prevention  of  disorder  or
      crime or the economic well-being of the country, or both. Both of them
      are working and not relying on public support. The claimant and  Mr  S
      are in a settled relationship  with  "great  mutual  commitment".  The
      claimant is in the invidious position set out in paragraph 10  of  the
      determination where, if this appeal fails, the Rules will prevent  her
      from attempting to achieve any other lawful way of remaining  in  this
      country. Finally, the claimant has an extensive network of friends  in
      this country including those derived from her work and church.


  18. Had I reached the conclusion that the was an error of  law  such  that
      the decision should be set aside I would, in  remaking  the  decision,
      have found that there were arguably good grounds for granting leave to
      remain outside the Rules and that there were compelling  circumstances
      not sufficiently recognised under the Rules to allow  the  appeals  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds outside the Immigration Rules.


  19. The FTTJ did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  but  I  consider  it
      necessary to do so in order to protect the interests of the son.


  20. I make an order  under  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any
      matter likely to lead members of the public to identify the  claimant,
      her son or any members of their family.


  21. I dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal and uphold the  decision  of
      the FTTJ.
