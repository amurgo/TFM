For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Background

1     This is the resumed hearing of  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent dated 19 January 2017 refusing the appellant
    entry clearance as  a  dependent  child  under  paragraph  297  of  the
    immigration rules, and hence  refusing  his  human  rights  claim.  The
    application was made at a time when the appellant was 11 years old.  He
    is now 13. The application was made on the basis that  the  appellant's
    father, BMT ('the Sponsor'), present and settled in the UK, was  solely
    responsible for the appellant's upbringing.

2      The  respondent  considered   the   evidence   submitted   with   the
    application, including evidence contained within an interview with  the
    sponsor conducted on  18  January  2017.  The  respondent  refused  the
    application for reasons set out in the original decision of 19  January
    2017: the appellant appeared to have a relative in Bangladesh, GT,  who
    was said to take a 'very active' role in looking after  the  appellant;
    had been responsible for his 'everyday care', and had  taken  important
    decisions about his upbringing. The respondent was of the view that the
    sponsor was  therefore  not  solely  responsible  for  the  appellant's
    upbringing.

3     Subsequent to the  appellant  giving  notice  of  appeal  against  the
    decision, the decision was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager on 18
    April 2017. The ECM suggested that responsibility for  the  appellant's
    care from birth appeared to have  been  between  the  sponsor  and  the
    appellant's mother; and since the sponsor obtained a custody  order  of
    the appellant in 2009, responsibility  appeared  to  have  been  shared
    between the sponsor, the appellant's mother, and other  family  members
    in Bangladesh. The ECM was thus not satisfied that the sponsor had sole
    responsibility for the appellant's upbringing.

4     The appellant's appeal against the  original  decision  was  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andrews on 3 November  2017,  and  the
    appeal dismissed in the judge's decision of 16 November 2017.

    My previous decision

5     In a decision dated 5 September 2018,  I  found  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law in making that decision, and set it aside. That
    error of law decision is set out below at Annex A.  I found as a matter
    of fact that a letter from the appellant's current school CGSC dated 15
    November 2016 had  not  been  before  the  judge,  and  the  judge  had
    therefore clearly not erred as alleged  in  failing  to  take  it  into
    account.

6     However, my reasons for finding that an error of  law  had  been  made
    were, in summary, that although the judge had expressed the  view  that
    the appellant's case could have been supported by other  evidence,  the
    judge had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting the reliability
    of the evidence actually provided. Further, the judge's  reasoning  was
    in some respects circular, having found  at  the  outset  of  paragraph
    [38], considering all the evidence in the  round,  that  the  sponsor's
    evidence was not credible, but thereafter dismissing other elements  of
    the evidence 'in the light of' the finding just given.

    Rehearing/changes of circumstances

7     The principal reason why the matter could not be  reheard  immediately
    on 28 August 2018 was that I was informed on that date that the sponsor
    had then recently  changed  his  residence  and  employment.  It  is  a
    requirement for the satisfaction of paragraph 297  of  the  immigration
    rules that  an  applicant  for  entry  clearance  under  that  rule  be
    adequately maintained and accommodated,  and  whether  the  immigration
    rules are met is a significant consideration to take  into  account  in
    assessing the proportionality  of  the  decision  under  appeal.  Under
    paragraph 297, maintenance would be deemed to be adequate if the income
    of the household including the applicant  would  match  or  exceed  the
    level of means tested benefits that such a  family  may  receive,  plus
    housing costs. However, on 28 August 2018, no  new  evidence  had  been
    provided by the sponsor regarding his new residence or employment.  The
    matter was therefore adjourned and  was  relisted  for  hearing  on  10
    January 2019. All issues remained to be determined in the appeal.

    The adjourned hearing

8     For the adjourned hearing, I had before me three bundles  of  evidence
    from the appellant; the original bundle before the  First-tier,  'AB1',
    comprising 10 items over 86 pages; a second  bundle  prepared  for  the
    original hearing before me in the Upper Tribunal  on  28  August  2018,
    'AB2',  consisting  of  13  items  over  35  pages;   and   a   further
    supplementary bundle for the present hearing, 'AB3', consisting  of  19
    items over 207 pages.

9     I have considered all of  the  documents  before  me  in  making  this
    decision. The fact that I have not mentioned a particular document does
    not mean that have not taking it into account. In this appeal,  I  have
    made findings of fact on the balance of probabilities.

    Evidence

10    The sponsor gave evidence before me in the Bangali  language,  Sylheti
    dialect, with the assistance of Mr Hoque, court interpreter. I  ensured
    that the sponsor and interpreter could understand one another.

11    The sponsor adopted the contents of his witness  statements  dated  26
    October 2017, 2 November 2017, and 29 December 2018.

12    Under cross-examination from Mr Tan, the sponsor  confirmed  that  the
    appellant was now studying at a school 'CGSC', where he had enrolled in
    January 2016. When asked when the application had been made  to  enroll
    the appellant at that school, the sponsor stated that  the  school  had
    sent him a form and he had signed it, but he could not remember exactly
    the date. He stated again that he had signed the form and sent  it  off
    and sent the money to them to admit the appellant. The  sponsor  stated
    that he had been in the United Kingdom when he had signed the form.

13    It had been the sponsor's decision to enroll  the  appellant  of  that
    school. Mr Tan pointed out  that  a  letter  from  the  CGSC  dated  15
    November  2016  regarding  the  appellant  (AB3  page   65)   did   not
    specifically state that the sponsor had been involved in enrolling  the
    appellant at the school. The sponsor  stated  that  he  had  spoken  to
    school over the phone. They emailed him and the sponsor had sent it off
    the sponsor had also spoken to the Principal.

14    When asked how often the sponsor was in contact with  the  school,  he
    stated that this was very often, he rang them and spoke to  the  Hostel
    Supervisor and the Principal, asking about progress of  the  appellant.
    This was at least 20 times a month. He usually used  a  call  card  for
    this purpose; it was expensive to dial  directly  from  his  phone.  He
    would speak to the appellant directly  on  his  mobile,  and  sometimes
    using a calling card. The sponsor also used EMO /IMO,  an  app  on  his
    phone to make calls.

15    The sponsor was asked whether there was any evidence  in  the  bundles
    about contacting the school by email. The sponsor stated  that  he  had
    received a document from school via email; he would write  to  them  by
    email if he needed to sign or send any documents by email but otherwise
    he would talk to them.

16    Mr Tan directed the sponsor's attention to a document at AB3 page  64,
    which appeared to be an email from the school to the sponsor  dated  25
    December 2018. Within the body of  the  email  (and  possibly  also  by
    attachment) there appeared to be a scanned  image  of  the  appellant's
    school report for the third semester in 2018. Mr Tan asked if this  had
    been the first time that the sponsor had seen the report.  The  sponsor
    said that this was the last report that they had sent him.  When  asked
    this question again, the sponsor said that this was the first  time  he
    had got that report, in the email of 25 December  2018.  Mr  Tan  asked
    then if that were the case, how did  the  image  contained  within  the
    email appear to have  the  sponsor's  signature  placed  upon  it.  The
    sponsor said that it was sent to him; it did not have his signature  on
    it. He printed it out, signed it and sent it  back  to  them  with  his
    signature. In clarification, I asked the sponsor whether he had seen  a
    version of that report prior to 25 December 2018. He stated  that  when
    he first received, he printed it out, signed it and  sent  it  back  to
    them, all on the same day.

17    On resuming cross-examination after  the  lunch  adjournment,  Mr  Tan
    asked if it was correct that the appellant  had  no  contact  with  his
    mother since 2009, and that she had no interest in the  appellant.  The
    sponsor confirm that was  correct.   Mr  Tan  asked  whether  it  would
    therefore be correct that the mother would have no  idea  which  school
    the appellant attended.  The  sponsor  stated  no,  and  that  she  had
    remarried to someone else. Mr Tan referred the  sponsor  again  to  the
    letter from the school dated 15 November 2016.  The  sponsor  confirmed
    that his nephew had posted this to him. When asked by Mr  Tan  why  the
    school had written the letter, the sponsor stated that  he  had  wanted
    them to present the circumstances of his child; he had  asked  them  to
    write it. Mr  Tan  asked  the  sponsor  why,  if  it  was  correct  the
    appellant's mother had had no contact with the  appellant  since  2009,
    did the school letter state that "We observe  little  or  no  responses
    from his mother". The sponsor suggested that it was the rule  that  the
    mother's name must be on the letter as well. I  asked  the  sponsor  to
    clarify whether the appellant's mother  had  been  in  touch  with  the
    school at all, and the sponsor said no.

18    The sponsor confirmed that he sent money  to  the  appellant  by  bank
    transfer to his account. When it arrives in that account, sometimes the
    sponsor's nephew, or sometimes the school superintendent  takes  it  to
    the appellant. The sponsor had arranged with the bank manager that  the
    superintendent could withdraw money, because the appellant was still  a
    minor.

19    The sponsor stated  that  his  current  two  jobs  were  at  Staffline
    Agency, working at Hollands Pies as  a  production  operator,  and  his
    other job was  at  SK  Enterprises  as  a  marketing  assistant,  since
    September 2018. Mr Tan asked the sponsor when the very first  time  had
    been that he had worked for SK Enterprises. The sponsor stated that  he
    could not remember 'the other one'. When asked what he  meant  by  'the
    other one', the sponsor stated that he could  not  remember  the  first
    time he had worked there - although he could remember the  second  time
    he started marketing for them. He stated that he had previously  worked
    for them as a 'volunteer', although he stated that they did pay  him  -
    �172, but it was voluntary.

20    Mr Tan asked  if  Syed  Baplu  Uddin  (a  person  named  in  documents
    associated with SK Enterprise) had  any  other  business.  The  sponsor
    confirmed that he used to have a restaurant business. The sponsor  also
    stated that presently, apart from SK Enterprises, Mr Uddin also  has  a
    letting agency and he also issued  'health  certificates'  relating  to
    housing.  Mr Tan asked the sponsor if it was correct that Mr Uddin  had
    prepared the accommodation report in  the  present  case.  The  sponsor
    confirmed that that was correct. Mr Tan  suggested  there  were  issues
    with a number of items of evidence from SK  Enterprise,  and  suggested
    that given that the accommodation report was prepared by Mr Uddin,  the
    same person that was owner  of  SK  Enterprise,  that  the  report  was
    doubtful. The sponsor stated that the  accommodation  report  was  100%
    reliable. When asked if the sponsor had any  connection  with  Mohammed
    Nasir Yaqoob other than being his landlord, the sponsor said no. Mr Tan
    had no further questions.

21    At my request the sponsor was asked some further questions to  explain
    the relevance of certain telephone bills which  were  contained  within
    the appellant's evidence. He was asked for the appellant's mobile phone
    number in Bangladesh, which he gave; ending 7938. When asked  if  there
    was any  evidence  that  that  was  a  telephone  number  held  in  the
    appellant's name,  the  sponsor  stated  that  there  was  no  specific
    documentation about that, but that this had been the  telephone  number
    that had been entered onto the  original  application  form  for  entry
    clearance for the appellant. The sponsor recalled phoning  the  college
    only once directly on his mobile; most of the time it  was  by  calling
    cards.

    Submissions

22    In submissions, Mr Tan argued that the maintenance  and  accommodation
    requirements of the immigration rules were not met,  arguing  that  the
    evidence relating to the sponsors employment at S K Enterprise was  not
    reliable, pointing out that the accommodation  report  had  essentially
    come from the same source. However,  no  issue  was  taken  as  to  the
    sponsor's employment Staff line. Further, there were no  utility  bills
    in the sponsor's name  at  the  new  address  of  [~],  Haslingden.  In
    relation to the sponsor's evidence in support of the  proposition  that
    he was solely responsible  the  appellant's  upbringing,  and  that  he
    provided financial support for the appellant, Mr Tan argued that  there
    was no evidence to establish that monies  allegedly  remitted  for  the
    benefit of the appellant were actually received in Bangladesh.

23    In relation to contact, Mr Tan argued that there was  little  evidence
    of direct telephone contact between the sponsor  on  appellant  in  the
    sponsor's '3' mobile phone bill and they were all 1 minute long (and  I
    note charged at �1.21 including vat for that minute).

24    Mr Tan argued that the sponsor's evidence about how  he  had  been  in
    contact with the school was inconsistent, having initially stated  that
    this was by telephone, but then accepting that he had email contact  as
    well. The sponsor's evidence as to how his signature came to  be  shown
    on a scanned attachment sent to him by email on 25 December  2018  made
    no sense. The document dated 29 December 2015 regarding the appellant's
    admission to his current school does  not  explicitly  state  that  the
    sponsor was involved in the enrolment process. The appellant's mother's
    name was recorded on that admission form.  Further, the letter from the
    school dated 15 of November 2016, in stating that 'We observe little or
    no responses from his mother' suggested that at least some contact  had
    been made between the mother and the  school,  which  contradicted  the
    sponsor's evidence that the appellant's mother had had no input in  his
    life since 2009.

25    Further, the letter at page 68 of AB3 from Md  Jahirul  Haque,  Hostel
    Super & Accountant, asserted that no one comes to see the appellant  at
    the school hostel except the sponsor as his father  so  far.  This  was
    inconsistent with other evidence in which the sponsor's nephew was said
    to visit the appellant.

26    Mr Chowdhury referred to his skeleton arguments previously  filed.  He
    referred to the telephone number of  the  appellant,  recorded  in  the
    sponsor's  telephone  records,  and  crossed  referred  this   to   the
    appellant's telephone number given  at  question  24  of  the  original
    application form,  as  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  contact  with  the
    appellant. He referred to evidence of telephone contact  in  AB3  pages
    93, 102, 113, 124, and 132. I permitted a further question to be put as
    to the duration of the  calls:  the  sponsor  stated  that  this  arose
    because when the appellant rings him, the appellant gives the sponsor a
    missed call, making a short connection only. There is a minimum  �.1.00
    charge every time the sponsor makes a call to the appellant.

    Discussion

    Relevant law

27    Paragraph 297 of the immigration rules provides, insofar as  relevant:



         "Requirements for indefinite leave to enter the United  Kingdom  as
         the child of a parent, parents or a relative present and settled or
         being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom

         297.     The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:

         (i)      is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join  a  parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

             ...

             (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
             sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and

         (ii)     is under the age of 18; and

         (iii)    is not leading an independent life, is  unmarried  and  is
         not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit;
         and

         (iv)     can, and will, be accommodated adequately by  the  parent,
         parents or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse
         to public funds in  accommodation  which  the  parent,  parents  or
         relative the child is seeking to join, own or  occupy  exclusively;
         and

         (v)      can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents, or relative the child is seeking to join, without recourse
         to public funds; and

         (vi)     holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry  in
         this capacity; and

         (vii)    does not fall for refusal under the  general  grounds  for
         refusal."

28    TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e): "sole  responsibility")  Yemen  [2006]  UKAIT
    00049 provides:

         ""Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be decided  upon  all
         the evidence. Where one parent  is  not  involved  in  the  child's
         upbringing  because  he  (or  she)  had  abandoned   or   abdicated
         responsibility, the issue may arise between  the  remaining  parent
         and others who have day-to-day care of the child abroad.  The  test
         is whether the parent has continuing control and direction over the
         child's upbringing, including making all the important decisions in
         the child's life. However, where both parents  are  involved  in  a
         child's upbringing, it will be exceptional that one  of  them  will
         have "sole responsibility".

    and

         "52.     Questions of "sole responsibility" under  the  immigration
         rules should be approached as follows:

             i.  Who has "responsibility"  for  a  child's  upbringing  and
             whether that responsibility is "sole" is a factual  matter  to
             be decided upon all the evidence.

             ii. The term "responsibility" in the immigration rules  should
             not to be understood as a theoretical or legal obligation  but
             rather as a practical one which, in each case, looks to who in
             fact  is  exercising  responsibility  for  the   child.   That
             responsibility may have been for a short duration in that  the
             present arrangements may have begun quite recently.

             iii.      "Responsibility" for a  child's  upbringing  may  be
             undertaken by individuals other than a child's parents and may
             be   shared   between   different   individuals:   which   may
             particularly arise where the child remains in its own  country
             whilst the only parent involved in its  life  travels  to  and
             lives in the UK.

             iv. Wherever the parents are, if both parents are involved  in
             the upbringing of the child, it will be exceptional  that  one
             of them will have sole responsibility.

             v.  If it is said that both are not involved  in  the  child's
             upbringing, one of the indicators for that will  be  that  the
             other has abandoned or abdicated his responsibility.  In  such
             cases, it may well be justified to find that  that  parent  no
             longer has responsibility for the child.

             vi. However, the issue of sole responsibility is  not  just  a
             matter between the parents. So  even  if  there  is  only  one
             parent involved in the child's upbringing, that parent may not
             have sole responsibility.

             vii.      In the circumstances  likely  to  arise,  day-to-day
             responsibility (or decision-making) for  the  child's  welfare
             may necessarily be shared with others (such  as  relatives  or
             friends) because of the geographical  separation  between  the
             parent and child.

             viii.     That, however, does not prevent  the  parent  having
             sole responsibility within the meaning of the Rules.

             ix. The test  is,  not  whether  anyone  else  has  day-to-day
             responsibility, but whether the parent has continuing  control
             and direction of the child's upbringing including  making  all
             the  important  decisions  in  the  child's  life.   If   not,
             responsibility is shared and so not "sole".

29    I have also had regard to the  provisions  of  Part  5A,  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('NIAA 2002').

    Findings of fact

30    Although I have set aside the decision of  Judge  Andrews,  there  are
    certain findings made within the judge's decision which I  am  able  to
    agree with, such matters begin properly supported by evidence.

31    Although certain challenges had been made by  the  Presenting  Officer
    before Judge Andrews in  November  2017  regarding  the  sponsor's  own
    immigration history, and  the  reliability  of  the  Bangladeshi  court
    documentation granting the sponsor custody of the appellant in 2009, no
    such arguments were advanced before me, and I have no reason  to  doubt
    the reliability of the evidence relied on by  the  appellant  that  the
    sponsor gained sole custody of him in 2009.

32    As far as the respondent's original decision letter suggests  that  GT
    is the appellant's brother rather than cousin, I accept that  they  are
    cousins; I accept the written evidence given by GT and the sponsor that
    it may be customary for near relations  to  refer  to  one  another  as
    brother in Bangladeshi society, and I have also taken into account GT's
    birth certificate, which shows that his father is  someone  other  than
    the sponsor.

33    The appellant lives in the school hostel about  65  km  where  he  had
    previously lived with his grandmother.  The grandmother is now 81 years
    old.

34    The sponsor regularly calls the appellant, but the calls  recorded  in
    the phone bill are of short duration only; typically  being  billed  as
    calls of one minute. I did not follow the sponsor's explanation  as  to
    why this was the case. However, I also take into account the  sponsor's
    oral evidence that he additionally called the appellant  using  a  call
    card.  I accept that there is regular telephone  communication  between
    the two.

35    There is evidence that the sponsor has occasionally  sent  parcels  to
    the appellant. I am prepared  to  accept  that  the  sponsor  had  sent
    clothing to the appellant, as asserted.

36    I accept that the sponsor travelled to Bangladesh from  November  2009
    to July 2011, November 2011 to May 2012, and  from  June  to  September
    2015. This represents two years and seven months that the  sponsor  has
    spent in Bangladesh since he moved to the UK in 2009. He has  not  been
    to Bangladesh since September 2015.

37    I consider the school letter dated 15 November 2016 at  AB3  page  65.
    This letter includes the following passage:

         "His father ...  lives in the United  Kingdom  who  bears  all  his
         expenses enquires of his well-being  and  progress  in  study.   We
         observe little  or  no  responses  from  his  mother.  She  neither
         communicates with him nor enquires of his well-being."

38    Mr Tan suggests that the reference to 'little  or  no'  response  from
    the appellant's mother suggests  that  there  must  be  at  least  some
    contact from her.  I find that that sentence  must  be  read  alongside
    what follows, which is that  she  neither  communicates  with  him  nor
    enquires of his well-being.

39    I also consider the school admission form at AB2 page 77 completed  in
    December 2015.  Although the names of both the appellant's  mother  and
    father are set out at the outset of that form, the document  is  signed
    by the sponsor, and not the appellant's mother. I do not think that the
    inclusion of GT's name, and that of another person, at point 7  of  the
    form as 'local guardian (in absence of the parent)' sheds much light on
    the issue as to who has sole responsibility  for  the  the  appellant's
    upbringing.

40    I am prepared on balance to find that the appellant's mother does  not
    have any input to the appellant's care or upbringing.

41    I take no adverse point regarding the sponsor's evidence as to how  he
    received the 3rd semester report on 25  December  2018;  I  accept  his
    explanation regarding having received it, signed it, and sent  it  back
    to them again. The fact that he also occasionally receives emails  from
    them is understandable.

42    However, I have grave doubts  about  the  reliability  of  information
    contained in a letter from Md Jahirul Haque,  said  to  be  the  Hostel
    Super & Accountant of CGSC, at AB3 page 68.  The letter is undated, but
    refers to his having emailed the sponsor result cards for the  1st  and
    2nd term examinations for the appellant. The letter also refers to  the
    fact that the author had sent the card attached with  a  photograph  of
    the appellant. The index to AB3 identifies  item  12  of  the  evidence
    contained therein, at pages 68 to 73, as being 'Reference  letter  from
    Hostel Super & Accountant along with the school  progress  report'.  At
    AB3 page 69 there is a photograph of the appellant holding  a  progress
    report card, but no dates can be seen on the card. AB3 page 70 seems to
    be an unrelated photograph of the appellant and sponsor  at  a  results
    publication ceremony for the year  2014  to  2015  at  the  appellant's
    previous school.  At AB3 page 71 there is a progress  report  card  for
    CGSC, year 2018.  That document has a similar  appearance  to  the  one
    shown at page 69 being held by the appellant,  although  there  are  no
    actual results shown on the document at page 71. Pages 72  and  73  are
    the appellant's actual results for the 1st and 2nd  semesters  of  2018
    respectively.  The  2nd  semester  report  was  signed  by  the  school
    Principal on 19 September 2018.

43    Taking into account the description within the  bundle  index  of  the
    evidence contained at pages 68-73, and the evidence  itself  (save  for
    the photograph at page 70), I find that although  undated,  the  letter
    from the Hostel Super & Accountant at page 68 must have  been  prepared
    on a date after 19 September 2018, as the letter refers to  the  author
    having forwarded the other documents, set out nearby within the bundle.



44    I then consider the following extract within that letter :

         "The  school  authority  and  I  myself  are  enormously  glad  and
         delighted with you.  Because,  in  spite  of  your  busy  time  and
         activities, you are enthusiastically attentive to him, bearing  all
         his expenditures, such as health, treatment, study, private  tutor,
         books & notebooks, pens & pencils, uniform, cloths, food &  fruits,
         and above all, school & hostel fees & expenses.

         I would also like to mention that none (sic) comes to  see  him  at
         the  school  hostel,  except  you  as  his  father  so  far.  As  a
         consequence, he always suffers from mental agony and tension."

45    However, it is to be noted that  the  appellant  has  resided  at  the
    hostel at CGSC since early 2016, and there  is  no  evidence  that  the
    sponsor has visited the appellant since 2015.  Further,  the  statement
    from GT at AB2 page 57, dated 12 October 2017, states "When I go to his
    school to give him money sent by his father, he always asks me when  he
    can go to his father."  The letter from the Hostel Super &  Accountant,
    which I have found must have been  written  after  19  September  2018,
    which suggests that no one comes to see the appellant  other  than  the
    sponsor, is therefore contradicted by both the evidence of GT and  that
    of the sponsor himself.   I find that the content  of  this  letter  is
    unreliable and it diminishes the weight that  I  can  attached  to  the
    sponsor's assertions about the extent of  his  responsibility  for  the
    appellant's care and upbringing.

46    When undertaking my overall assessment as to who  has  has  continuing
    control and direction of the appellant's upbringing, I also  take  into
    account the sponsor's evidence regarding the proposed  maintenance  and
    accommodation of the appellant in the United Kingdom.   Any  issues  of
    credibility over the sponsor's evidence in that regard  may  affect  my
    assessment of the credibility of the sponsor's evidence about his  role
    in the appellant's upbringing.

47    Although disputed by Mr Tan, I accept that the sponsor has moved to  a
    new address in Haslingden. There is within AB3 a copy of the  sponsor's
    assured short hold tenancy commencing 27 March 2018 at the new address,
    and the sponsor's Staffline payslips, his  most  recent  Barclays  bank
    account, and his '3' mobile phone statements show that address.

48    There is no issue taken by the respondent as  to  the  reliability  of
    the sponsor's evidence that he is currently employed by Staffline.  The
    sponsor asserts in his witness statement of 29 December  2018  that  he
    works for them for 30 hours week as a production  operative,  receiving
    an average of �195 net weekly in that employment, which is  indeed  the
    average of all of the Staffline payslips contained at AB3 pages  32-44.
    However, to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  adequate  maintenance,  the
    appellant accepts in his  skeleton  argument  that  he  would  need  to
    demonstrate an income of �206 per week.  The  sponsor  therefore  falls
    short on his Staffline employment alone.

49    However, I have very  grave  concerns  over  the  reliability  of  the
    sponsor's evidence that he is also employed  at  SK  Enterprises  as  a
    marketing assistant.  The sponsor asserts that he commenced  employment
    with this company in September 2018. Mr Tan asked  what  the  sponsor's
    previous connections with this company might be.  The sponsor  appeared
    to accept that he  had  worked  'voluntarily'  for  the  company  at  a
    previous point  in  time,  but  was  unable  to  state  the  period  of
    employment.  His assertion that the work was voluntary also made little
    sense, as he accepted that he had been paid for that employment.

50     I  note  the  following  evidence  regarding   the   sponsor's   past
    employment.  Before the original judge, there was a letter  from  Green
    Bangla Indian Restaurant, 61 Marsden Road, Burnley, written by Mr  S  B
    Uddin, Sole Proprietor, dated 14 November 2016 which stated as follows:



         "This is to confirm that Mr (BMT) of (address given)  is  currently
         employed at the above mentioned establishment.

         Mr (T)'s current employment status  is  on  a  permanent  part-time
         basis, (sic) Mr (T)'s net wages is in the  region  of  �172.80  per
         week. Mr (T) has worked with the establishment for quite some  time
         now and have found him to be a very hard-working colleague.  He  is
         highly organised, has great communication skills and I have  always
         been very impressed with the way that he has approached work.

         For any more quiries (sic) please do not hesitate to contact me  on
         the above contact details."

51    At AB2 page 84 there is a  letter  from  S.K.  Enterprise  Haslingden,
    written by Syed Paplu Uddin, dated 18 October 2017. At the top  of  the
    letter the business address of SK Enterprise is given as  32  Blackburn
    Road, Haslingdon, and telephone numbers and an email address are given.
     The body of the letter is identical in content to  the  letter  quoted
    above from  S  B  Uddin  of  Green  Bangla  Restaurant,  including  the
    grammatical and spelling errors noted above.  This  letter  appears  to
    relate to the sponsor's previous period of employment at SK Enterprises
    which the sponsor described as voluntary. The sponsor could  not  state
    the period for which he had worked for SK Enterprise in  this  previous
    capacity, whereas the letter of 18 October 2017 refers to  the  sponsor
    having worked for SK Enterprise for 'quite some time now'.

52    At AB3 page 48 there is a letter dated 13 September 2018 from a  Mr  K
    Ahmed, bearing the header 'SK Enterprise, Blackburn  Road,  Haslingden.
    A mobile phone number is given, but no full street address, or landline
    or email contact details are given. The body of  the  letter  is  again
    identical to the content  of  the  letters  mentioned  above  dated  14
    November 2016, and 18 October 2017,  again  including  grammatical  and
    spelling errors.

53    The inescapable conclusion arrived at when considering  these  letters
    is that they were created by the same person, or by  persons  connected
    to one another, using an electronic template created some time ago.

54    I also consider the remittance receipts relied upon by the sponsor  to
    demonstrate that he has sent money to the appellant over  a  period  of
    time. There are many such receipts, all being produced by  'S.K.  Money
    Transmitter', of 32 Blackburn Road, Haslingden. The telephone and email
    address given for that business are the same as the  details  given  in
    the SK Enterprise letter dated 18 October 2017.

55    There is  also  the  property  inspection  report  from  INA  Sales  &
    Lettings dated 13 September 2018 written by Mr Syed Bablu Uddin at  AB3
    page 13-14. The address given for that company is  32  Blackburn  Road,
    Haslingden. The landline number given is the same as for SK  Enterprise
    and SK Money Transfers.

56    I am prepared to accept that Mr Uddin is a local businessman  and  may
    well have had a number of  different  business  interests.  I  am  also
    prepared to accept that he may have more than one business operating at
    the address of 32 Blackburn Road, Haslingden; that  address  was  given
    for SK Enterprise in the letter  18  October  2017,  for  INA  Sales  &
    Lettings in its report  of  13  September  2018,  and  on  the  various
    receipts from SK Money Transmitter.

57    Accepting also, at least as a possibility, that the sponsor  may  have
    been employed by Mr Uddin  originally  at  a  restaurant,  then  at  SK
    Enterprise, and then again  at  SK  Enterprise,  I  do  not  accept  as
    reliable the evidence supporting that proposition.  The  three  letters
    relating to those alleged periods  of  employment  are  identical.   No
    specific dates are given for the periods of  employment.  There  is  no
    explanation in the SK Enterprise letter of  18  October  2017  why  the
    sponsor's employment with the same person (Mr Uddin) at the  restaurant
    came to an end. There is no explanation  given  in  the  SK  Enterprise
    letter of 13 September 2018 why the sponsors' earlier employment  there
    came to an end, and why he has been re-employed  there.   There  is  no
    reference in either letter from SK Enterprise to suggest that the first
    period of employment was casual or 'voluntary' as the sponsor  put  it;
    both letters described the sponsor's  employment  at  that  company  as
    being on a permanent part-time basis.

58    I therefore have very considerable doubts  that  any  of  these  three
    letters give reliable evidence of the sponsor's employment.

59    Payslips from SK Enterprise at AB3 pages 45-47, are marked  month  11,
    30/11/2018;  month  10,  01/10/2018-31/11/2018  (sic);  and  month   9,
    01/09/2018-30/09/2018  respectively.  The  figures  on  the  pay  slips
    suggest a pay per week of �187.92, but  the  payslips  state  that  the
    payment method is monthly, and each shows a nett pay of �751.68.  There
    are a number of issues here:

    (i)    The dates given on the month 10 payslip appear to be for  period
         01/10/2018 to 31/11/2018 i.e. 2 months.

    (ii)   There are no deductions for tax or national insurance on any  of
         the payslips.

    (iii)  If the payslips are for work done over a month (which is  longer
         than 4 weeks), there is no explanation as to why the total nett pay
         appears to be simply 4 x the weekly wage of �187.92.

    (iv)   There are no credits in the Sponsor's  bank  account  which  are
         clearly from SK Enterprise (as opposed to the credits  from  salary
         from Staffline, which are shown). There are however weekly  credits
         to the sponsor's bank account of  �187.92,  but  these  are  mostly
         deposits made at Barclays Rawtenstall branch, and one, on 1 October
         2018, is a transfer from the sponsor's own savings account.

60    Mr Tan had suggested to the sponsor  in  cross  examination  that  the
    documentation from SK Enterprises was suspect. I agree.  I  find  on  a
    balance of probabilities  that  the  sponsor  is  not  employed  at  SK
    Enterprise. In addition to the appellant therefore failing to meet  the
    maintenance  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules,  the  sponsor's
    dishonesty about his alleged employment with S K Enterprise  causes  me
    concern about the reliability of the money transfer receipts,  from  SK
    Money Transfer, operating at the same business address as SK Enterprise
    and INA Sales & Lettings. I cannot see any  cash  withdrawal  or  debit
    from the sponsor's bank account around 2 July 2018,  correlating  to  a
    payment of �140.12 to SK Money Transfer shown on a receipt at AB3  page
    79, and I cannot see any cash withdrawal  or  debit  from  the  account
    around 5 September 2018 correlating to a payment of �144.06 to SK Money
    Transfer shown on a receipt at AB3 page 77.

61    I find  that  the  sponsor  has  not  established,  to  a  balance  of
    probabilities, that he has sent the appellant the monies asserted.

62    The above findings significantly  undermine  the  sponsor's  assertion
    that he has had sole responsibility for the appellant's  upbringing.  I
    find that the sponsor's evidence is so fundamentally undermined that  I
    am unable to accept his  evidence  about  what  support  the  appellant
    receives, and from whom, and who it is that has continuing control  and
    direction of  the  appellant's  upbringing  including  making  all  the
    important decisions in his life. I therefore find  that  the  appellant
    has failed to  demonstrate  that  he  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules for entry clearance under paragraph 297(1)(e).

63    Insofar as the appellant  seeks  entry  under  297(1)(f)  ('there  are
    serious and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations  which  make
    exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have  been
    made for the child's care'), the appellant  has  not  established  that
    there are any serious or  compelling  family  or  other  considerations
    making his exclusion from the United Kingdom undesirable; the sponsor's
    unreliable evidence  results  in  it  being  wholly  unclear  what  the
    appellant's circumstances are in Bangladesh, other than that he appears
    to be a boarder at a privately  paying  school.   The  requirements  of
    297(1)(f) are not met.

64    Although I accept that the sponsor has visited the appellant on  three
    occasions since 2009, and that they have a family life together, I find
    that the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance,  and  to  refuse  the
    appellant's human rights claim does not  represent  a  disproportionate
    interference in the family life between the appellant  and  sponsor.  I
    take into account that the appellant does not meet the requirements  of
    the immigration rules, and that the maintenance of immigration  control
    is in the public interest (s.117B(1) NIAA  2002).   I  am  prepared  to
    accept that the appellant speaks English; I accept that he does in fact
    attend CGSC, and that this is an English medium school  (AB3  page  71)
    and that the appellant has performed  well  in  his  study  of  English
    (report, AB3 page 64).

65    Having  found  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the  maintenance
    requirement for entry  clearance  under  paragraph  297,  I  take  into
    account that he would thus not be financially independent  (s.117B(3)).
    Sections 117B(4)-(6) do not appear to be relevant, this being an appeal
    relating to the refusal of entry clearance and appellant is  outside of
    the United Kingdom.

    Decision

66    The appellant's appeal against refusal of his human  rights  claim  is
    dismissed.

Annex A: Decision of 5.9.18 following hearing of 28.8.18:



DECISION AND REASONS

1     The appellant, a national of Bangladesh, appeals against the  decision
of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Andrews  dated  16  November  2017,
dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  of  19
January 2017, refusing him entry clearance and  refusing  his  human  rights
claim.

2     The appellant, a minor aged 11 at date of application and 12  at  date
of appeal, applied for entry clearance to enter the United  Kingdom  as  the
dependent child of his father BMT ('the Sponsor') under paragraph  297(1)(e)
of  the  immigration  rules  on  the  basis  that  the  Sponsor   had   sole
responsibility for the appellant's upbringing. The respondent  rejected  the
application on the grounds that the appellant had  not  established  to  the
respondent's satisfaction that the Sponsor was solely  responsible  for  the
appellant's upbringing. The respondent queried whether  another  individual,
GT, described  as  either  cousin  or  brother  of  the  appellant,  or  the
appellant's grandmother, might  have  shared  some  responsibility  for  the
appellant's  upbringing.  No  other  issues,  for   instance   adequacy   of
maintenance or accommodation, were raised in the decision.

3     The appellant  appealed  against  that  decision,  the  matter  coming
before the Judge on 3 November 2017. Mr Chowdhury,  who  appears  before  me
today, also  appeared  before  the  Judge  on  that  occasion.  The  sponsor
attended and gave oral evidence. There were  also  witness  statements  from
GT, who asserted that he was in fact the appellant's cousin (nephew  of  the
Sponsor), and from the appellant's grandmother.

4     The Judge  referred  at  [9]  to  the  evidence  before  him,  and  in
particular at [9(iv)] to a second  'bundle'  of  appellant's  documents  (in
fact, they were loose) handed up on the day  of  hearing,  which  the  Judge
referred to as 'AB2'.

5     The his decision, the Judge held: at [22] that the  Sponsor  had  been
granted custody of the appellant since 2009; at [24] that GT was the  nephew
of the Sponsor, and therefore cousin, not a brother  to  the  appellant;  at
[26(i)] that the appellant's grandmother lived 65 km  away  from  where  the
appellant lived in a school hostel; and at [27] that the  Sponsor  had  been
present in Bangladesh for periods of  time  between  the  2009  and  a  2015
totalling two years and seven months. Although the Judge found at [29]  that
the appellant's mother had lived in Bangladesh since 2009, there appears  to
have been no positive evidence at all  that  she  had  had  any  contact  or
dealings with the appellant since that time.

6     The Judge's reasons for dismissing the appeal are essentially set  out
[35] to [39].  At [35] the Judge states:

    'The Sponsor says that no one  else  has  any  responsibility  for  the
    appellant's upbringing. GT and the appellant's mother (sic - should  be
    grandmother) say the same (see AB57 and AB60). But if that were true, I
    would expect the sponsor to have provided evidence of this from someone
    other than his close family members.'

7     The Judge then suggested that he would have expected  to  see  letters
from the hostel  superintendent,  the  college  principal,  the  appellant's
doctor, or from anyone else in Bangladesh such as friends or members of  the
local community confirming that no  one  other  than  the  sponsor  had  any
responsibility for the appellant's upbringing [35].  The  Judge  noted  that
the sponsor had signed the appellant's school  reports,  but  observed  that
none of  the  reports  actually  mentioned  the  sponsor.  The  sponsor  had
provided no evidence of him having contact  with  the  appellant's  teachers
[36].  Although there was evidence of three extended  visit  to  Bangladesh,
there was very  little  evidence  of  the  sponsor's  involvement  with  the
appellant during those visits [37].

8     The Judge concluded at [38]-[39]:

    "38.   Having considered all the evidence in the round, I do  not  find
    the sponsor's  evidence  credible,  in  respect  of  his  claimed  sole
    responsibility for the appellant. In the light of this finding, I  also
    find not credible GT's, and the appellant's mother's (sic), evidence on
    this issue. The weight of the evidence points to  the  conclusion  that
    one or more persons in Bangladesh has at least some responsibility  for
    the appellant's upbringing. Such a person might be GT, who is  said  to
    be the appellant's guardian on the appellant's application form (in the
    RB) and on the November 2016 Sample  Declaration  form  (in  the  AB2).
    And/or it might be someone else.

    39.    Having considered all the evidence in the round I  find  on  the
    balance of public probabilities that the sponsor  does  not  have  sole
    responsibility for the  appellant's  upbringing.  The  requirements  of
    paragraph 297(1)(e) are not met in this case either on the date of  the
    appellant's application, the date of the ECO's decision, or on the date
    of the hearing before me."

9     The Judge then considered the best interests of  the  appellant  under
section 55 at Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  at  [40]  to
[49], and any interference with the appellant's right  to  family  life  for
the Sponsor, at [50] -[56].  It is to be noted that the  Judge  accepted  at
[51] that family life did exist as between the  appellant  and  the  Sponsor
and at [53] that the respondent's decision amounted to an interference by  a
public authority with that right, but held in the light of certain  factors,
including that  the  immigration  rules  were  not  satisfied  [55(i)],  the
decision was not disproportionate.

10    The appellant applied for permission to appeal in  grounds  of  appeal
dated 27 November 2017 arguing in summary that:

    (i)    in finding at [35] that there  was  an  absence  of  documentary
    evidence from the school principal, the Judge had failed to  take  into
    account a document that had been submitted to  the  Tribunal,  being  a
    letter dated 15 November 2016 from that principal;

    (ii)   there was adequate evidence before the Judge to  have  satisfied
    him that the  Sponsor  had  sole  responsibility  for  the  appellant's
    upbringing, including other documents from the school  such  as  school
    reports which the Sponsor had signed;

    (iii)  the Judge failed to give any adequate  reasons  for  finding  at
    [38] that the evidence of GT and the sponsor's mother was not credible;



    (iv)   the Judge's findings on the best interests of the appellant, and
    on proportionality were unsustainable.

11    Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge of the First  tier
Tribunal Farrelly on 16 April 2018. The appellant  renewed  his  application
in redrafted grounds dated 11 May 2018 essentially making the  same  points,
although  before  me  today  Mr.  Chowdhury  does  not  seek  to  rely  upon
paragraphs 5 and 7 of those grounds which erroneously  argue  that  if  only
one biological parent is involved in the care of  an  appellant,  then  that
parent  must  be  deemed  to  have  sole  responsibility  for  the   child's
upbringing. That is a misdirection  in  law,  and  is  clearly  contrary  to
relevant authority, including the case of  TD  (Paragraph  297(i)(e):  "sole
responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049.

12    Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  renewed  grounds  by  Upper
Tribunal Judge Kebede on 26 June 2018, remarking that although she  had  not
been able to locate the letter of 15 November 2016 in  the  court  file,  if
such evidence was before the  Judge  it  was  arguable  that  a  failure  to
consider  such  evidence  was  material  to  his  findings   on   the   sole
responsibility. On that basis  the  grounds  were  arguable.  Permission  to
appeal was said to be granted generally on the face of grant  of  permission
to appeal.  There is no rule 24 response from the respondent.

13    A new bundle  has  been  submitted  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for  the
purposes of the hearing before me. Included in this  bundle  is  the  letter
dated 15 November 2016 from Mr. MA Shahio, Principal  of  Cambridge  Grammar
School and College stating in summary that the appellant, being the  son  of
the Sponsor, had been reading at the school since January  2016  and  stayed
in the school hostel. It stated that "His father ...  lives  in  the  United
Kingdom who bears all his  expenses  and  inquires  of  his  well-being  and
progress in study. We observed little or no responses from his  mother.  She
neither communicates with him nor inquires of his well-being."

14    However at the outset of the hearing  today  at  I  took  considerable
time to establish between the parties what material had in fact been  placed
before the First tier Judge (as  opposed  to  contained  within  the  bundle
submitted for the present hearing before me). There was on the court file  a
copy of a bundle of evidence  that  with  a  covering  letter  dated  simply
October 2017 running to some 86 pages. This was 'AB' as referred to  by  the
Judge. There were also some loose documents, fitting the  description  given
by the Judge at[9(iv)], and described by him as 'AB1'. Amongst these  papers
where some money transfer receipts.  Although the Judge does  not  refer  to
money transfer receipts at [9(iv)], they are referred to at [26(iii)].

15    Having myself undertaken a thorough examination of the content of  the
Tribunal file, it was apparent that there was no copy of the  letter  of  15
November 2016 on file, other than  in  the  new  bundle  submitted  for  the
purposes of the Upper Tribunal hearing. I asked  Mr.  Bates  what  documents
were contained within the  respondent's  file.  Unfortunately  the  original
file for the respondent is not in Mr. Bates' possession  but  material  from
that file  had been scanned and  provided  to  him  by  colleagues  for  the
purposes of today's hearing. Mr Bates informed me that there was no copy  of
any letter dated 15 November 2016 contained within his scanned material.

16    I ruled at the hearing that I was  not  satisfied  that  the  document
dated 15 November 2016 was in fact before the First tier  Judge.  The  Judge
set out in some detail in his decision what evidence had been  submitted  on
the day, and there was no sign of such a document in the Tribunal file,  and
although the original of the respondent's file  was  not  present  in  court
today, neither had any copy of that letter been scanned and provided to  Mr.
Bates by his colleagues. I therefore not only rule that  such  document  was
not before Judge but naturally, the appellant's ground of  appeal  that  the
Judge erred in law failing to take that document into account fails.

17    However, the appellant  argues  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence
before the Judge for him to have found on a balance  of  probabilities  that
that the Sponsor did have sole responsibility for the  appellant,  and  that
the Judge had erred in failing to give reasons which were  adequate  in  law
for rejecting the credibility of the evidence  given  in  letters  from  the
Sponsor's nephew and mother which confirmed in effect that the  Sponsor  has
sole responsibility for the appellants upbringing.

18    Although the judge expressed the view that the appellant's case  could
have been supported by other evidence, I find that the Judge has  failed  to
give  adequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the  reliability  of  the  evidence
actually provided.  In relation to the evidence of the Sponsor's nephew  and
mother, the Judge's reasoning at [38] (set out above) is confused. It  seems
to me that the first sentence purports to take  all  the  relevant  evidence
into account in the round in  determining  the  Sponsor's  credibility,  but
then in the second sentence refers to the evidence of the  Sponsor's  nephew
and mother, and purports to reject it 'in the light  of'  the  finding  just
given in the first sentence.  These two sentences, juxtaposed, do not  stand
scrutiny. The latter evidence was clearly relevant  to  the  credibility  of
the Sponsor's evidence, and the way that the Judge's reasoning  is  set  out
suggests that the Judge failed to take  the  latter  evidence  into  account
when assessing the Sponsor's  credibility,  and  then  failed  to  give  any
reasons, other than his earlier rejection of the Sponsor's credibility,  for
the rejection of the latter evidence.  The  Judge  has  not  taken  all  the
evidence into account, in the round.

19    Further, I also find it unsatisfactory that the Judge  fails  at  [38]
to  identify  with  any  clarity  who,  other  than  the  Sponsor,  has  had
responsibility for the appellant's upbringing, or to what extent,  given  in
particular that "The  test  is,  not  whether  anyone  else  has  day-to-day
responsibility, but whether the parent has continuing control and  direction
of the child's upbringing including making all the  important  decisions  in
the child's life" (TD, para 52(ix)). The Judge's conclusion  appears  to  be
that  'one  or  more  persons'  in  Bangladesh  has  had  'at  least   some'
responsibility for the appellant's upbringing, which might be GT  and/or  it
might be someone else. This falls short of a finding someone other than  the
Sponsor has had a degree of responsibility for the appellant such  that  the
Sponsor has not had continuing control and direction of his life,  including
making all the important decisions in his life. This  issue,  combined  with
the Judge's error in the way that he treated the evidence of  the  Sponsor's
nephew and mother, result in my finding  of  the  Judge's  decision  is  not
sustainable.

20    I set aside the Judge's decision.

21    Although an interpreter was present for me to re-hear  the  appeal,  I
adjourned the re-hearing of the appeal at the appellant's request. This  was
because it transpired that the Sponsor  has  moved  home,  and  changed  his
employment, such that he has, in the last  month,  commenced  two  new  part
time  jobs.  Although  the  adequacy  of  the  appellant's  maintenance  and
accommodation  was  not  a  matter  raised  in  the  respondent's   original
decision, the appellant submitted evidence of his  then  employment  to  the
First tier Tribunal. This was no doubt  to  dispel  any  question  over  the
adequacy of the appellant's maintenance. In any event,  whether  or  not  it
was considered necessary to adduce evidence of the Sponsor's  employment  at
the First tier hearing, it should have been apparent  to  those  acting  for
the appellant that further evidence was necessary to  address  the  question
of whether the appellant would,  at  the  time  of  re-making  the  decision
before the Upper Tribunal, be adequately maintained and accommodated.

22    Standard directions issued in this  appeal  provided  at  paragraph  4
that there is a presumption that, in the  event  of  the  Tribunal  deciding
that the decision of the FtT is to be set aside as erroneous in law, the re-
making of the decision will take place at the same  hearing,  based  on  the
original evidence and any fresh evidence submitted under Rule 15(2A) of  the
procedure rules, and, as per paragraph 6(iv) of the directions,  any  notice
under Rule 15(2A) was to be filed no later than 10 working days  before  the
appeal  hearing.  Notwithstanding  that  the  appellant  in  this  case  had
specifically requested that an interpreter be booked  for  today's  hearing,
and therefore appears to have wished, if possible, to have  the  appeal  re-
heard at the present hearing, no such  application  under  Rule  15(2A)  has
been made.

23    However, although it is unfortunate that such  new  evidence  has  not
been  filed  and  served,  I  appreciate  that  the  Sponsor's   change   of
circumstances are quite recent. I reject  the  suggestion  by  Mr  Chaudhury
that  it  is  procedurally  unfair  for  the  issues  of   maintenance   and
accommodation being raised at this  re-hearing  of  the  appeal  before  the
Upper Tribunal. I find that it is not  the  case  that  the  respondent  has
raised these issues, but rather that it  is  the  change  in  the  Sponsor's
circumstances which causes the issues to be raised. I find  that  Mr  Bates,
in indicating to me that he is not prepared  to  accept  on  behalf  of  the
respondent, in the absence of any documentary evidence, that  the  appellant
would  still  be  adequately  maintained  and  accommodated,  acts  entirely
fairly.

24    The appeal is adjourned to the first available date after 4 weeks,  to
be re-listed before me.

25    The appellant is directed to file and serve any  further  evidence  on
which he relies, and to provide a notice under Rule 15(2A), 5  working  days
before the re-hearing of the appeal.



Decision

The decision involved the making of an error of law.

I set aside the decision.

I adjourn the re-making of the appeal, for further hearing before the  Upper
Tribunal.
