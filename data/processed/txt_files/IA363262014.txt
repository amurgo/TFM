Representation:
Appellant   Miss Evans (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and is now thirty-nine years  of
    age. She applied on July 4, 2014 for a residence card pursuant  to  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.  The  respondent   refused   her
    application on September 3, 2014 because  she  was  not  satisfied  the
    sponsor was a qualified worker.

 2. The appellant appealed  that  decision  on  September  16,  2014  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  and
    regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations.

 3. The matter came before Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pickup  on
    November 24, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on November 26, 2014 he
    upheld the refusal and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 4. The respondent applied for permission to appeal  on  December  8,  2014
    submitting the Tribunal had erred but permission to appeal was  refused
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Osborne on January  22,  2015.  The
    grounds were renewed  and  extended  on  February  5,  2015  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Warr found the grounds arguable.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction pursuant to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and I see
    no reason to make an order now.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 6. Miss Evans submitted that there were  two  issues  that  needed  to  be
    considered in this appeal. The first issue was whether the sponsor  was
    genuinely in work and she submitted that the Tribunal had misunderstood
    the facts and in particular  had  erred  with  regard  to  whether  the
    appellant would have to pay tax or National  Insurance.  Evidence  from
    the government's own website demonstrated that the appellant would  pay
    neither National Insurance nor tax because his income fell beneath  the
    taxable threshold in force at the  time.  The  Tribunal  had  drawn  an
    adverse credibility finding on the failure  by  the  appellant  to  pay
    National Insurance and this erroneous finding undermined the Tribunal's
    conclusion that the sponsor was not a genuine worker. The second  issue
    was that the Tribunal erred in its approach to the ratio of benefits to
    salary. Neither the appellant nor the sponsor  disputed  they  were  in
    receipt of benefits. If the Tribunal concluded the sponsor was working,
    then the evidence was he worked for 24 hours a week. Case law  confirms
    that part-time workers are qualifying workers and  accordingly  if  the
    Tribunal concluded the sponsor was a genuine worker then it should have
    gone on to find that he was a qualifying  worker  and  the  appellant's
    application should have been allowed.


 7. Mr Harrison relied on the Rule 24  response  dated  May  12,  2015.  He
    submitted that the Tribunal had provided a  detailed  analysis  of  the
    appellant's claim and had given reasons  for  rejecting  the  sponsor's
    claim to be employed. It had been open to the Tribunal to conclude that
    the failure to disclose the other bank account in  which  the  benefits
    were paid was relevant. The grounds were merely a disagreement with the
    Tribunal's findings.  The  Tribunal  had  made  a  number  of  findings
    relating to be disingenuous nature of the evidence and  those  findings
    were open to it. An allegation of perversity was a  high  threshold  to
    satisfy and the grounds did not reach that threshold. The appeal should
    be dismissed.

    FINDINGS ON ERROR IN LAW

 8. Both representatives agreed there were two elements to this appeal. The
    first element concerned whether the sponsor was genuinely in employment
    and the second issue was whether that work was marginal  or  ancillary.
    Mr Harrison conceded during an exchange with me that in  light  of  the
    decision of DM Levin v Staatssecretaris van  Justice  [1982]  EUECJ  R-
    53/81 part-time workers came within the 2006 Regulations.  Mr  Harrison
    accepted  that  if  the  sponsor's  employment  was  genuine  then  his
    employment would be neither marginal nor ancillary.


 9. The issue therefore for me  was  whether  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in
    finding the sponsor was not in genuine employment.  It  is  clear  from
    the Tribunal's determination that the  sponsor's  previous  employment,
    the  appellant's  previous  determination  and  the  sponsor's  current
    employment were all considered in  assessing  the  genuineness  of  the
    sponsor's employment.

10. On April 2, 2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Dennis dealt with the
    appellant's earlier application on the  papers  and  expressed  serious
    concerns with documents that  had  been  produced  in  support  of  the
    sponsor's claim to be  employed.  He  found  insufficient  evidence  of
    employment and refused the appeal.

11. In this current appeal  a  letter  from  HMRC  was  produced  and  this
    confirmed the sponsor commenced employment with his current employer on
    June 2, 2014. Whilst the Tribunal had a number of  concerns  about  the
    employer  it  concluded  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    sponsor's employer was both  active  and  genuine.  The  Tribunal  also
    accepted that the sponsor's National Insurance number appeared both  on
    the HMRC letter and the sponsor's wage  slips  although  commented  the
    content in the HMRC letter was based on  information  provided  by  the
    appellant.

12. The Tribunal examined the sponsor's  letter  and  considered  the  wage
    slips and concluded that the sponsor's gross income would be �7874  per
    annum.  This was identical to the  income  the  sponsor  had  with  his
    previous employer and the Tribunal found this curious. Miss  Evans,  in
    submissions, argued that the Tribunal had made an  unnecessary  adverse
    finding about the sponsor's income. The sponsor was  paid  the  minimum
    wage and consequently his income with both employers would be the same,
    as long as his hours were similar.   Additionally,  she  submitted  the
    Tribunal had erred in paragraph [23] of its determination when it found
    that National Insurance deductions  should  have  been  made.  Evidence
    produced to demonstrate the Tribunal's error confirmed that no National
    Insurance by the sponsor was payable as he only earned �151.04 a  week.
    Miss Evans submitted that the  Tribunal's  approach  to  the  sponsor's
    earnings undermined its assessment of whether the sponsor was  actually
    employed.  By erroneously  concluding  the  sponsor  should  have  paid
    National Insurance the Tribunal had erred.

13. The Tribunal had accepted that a sum matching the figure  on  his  wage
    slip was paid into his bank account albeit it  was  not  paid  by  bank
    transfer as suggested on the wage slip. However, at paragraph [25]  the
    Tribunal concluded that this evidence was insufficient to prove he  was
    genuinely employed is claimed. The reasons given were:

     a. The wage slips suggested monies paid by bank transfer whereas  they
        were paid by cash.
     b.  It was odd and not credible that no National Insurance  deductions
        were made.
     c.  The sponsor had been less than forthright by failing  to  disclose
        the extent of state support.

14. There was clearly evidence before the Tribunal, in  the  form  of  wage
    slips and credit entries in  a  bank  account,  that  the  sponsor  was
    receiving an income from somewhere. The Tribunal did not accept that he
    was employed as claimed for the reasons set out in paragraph [15] above
    but one of those findings was based  on  the  fact  National  Insurance
    deductions should have been made.


15. I accept Mr Evans's submissions that no National Insurance was payable.
     The Tribunal erred when it found  that  it  was  odd  and  simply  not
    credible that no deductions were made. This finding was  an  assumption
    based on no evidence and was contrary to the government's  own  tables.
    In addition, the Tribunal did have a letter from HMRC, wage  slips  and
    credit entries matching those wage slips and these were evidence  of  a
    regular income.

16. I find that Miss Evans's submissions  amounted  to  more  than  a  mere
    disagreement and I find the Tribunal erred when finding the sponsor was
    not actually employed.

17. Having found the sponsor was employed I remind myself that Mr  Harrison
    accepted that part-time employment was  sufficient  to  meet  the  2006
    Regulations. The fact the sponsor and the appellant income was made  up
    of salary and tax credits did not mean the sponsor was not a  qualified
    worker in light of  the  fact  part-time  working  is  covered  by  the
    Regulations. If the government allows part-time workers  to  supplement
    their wages with tax credits then neither the sponsor nor the appellant
    could be criticised for taking advantage of such a system.

18. I am satisfied there was sufficient evidence before the Tribunal of the
    sponsor's earnings and in light of the fact  the  Tribunal  erroneously
    took into account the absence  of  National  Insurance  payments  I  am
    satisfied there was a material error.

    DECISION


19. There was a material error.  I set aside the decision and I remake  the
    decision and grant the appellant a residence card.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Although I have allowed the appeal I make no fee award because  one  of  the
factors that led me to  allow  the  appeal  was  the  evidence  relating  to
National Insurance levels.
