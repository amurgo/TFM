                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 19th June 1983.

 2. His immigration history shows that he first entered the United  Kingdom
    on 1st April 2011 with entry clearance conferring leave to enter  until
    29th July 2013 as a Tier 4 (General) Student.  On  the  day  his  leave
    expired, the Appellant submitted a combined application  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system and for a biometric  residence  permit.   This  application  was
    refused by the Respondent on 5th October.  Putting matters briefly, the
    application was refused because the Appellant submitted a  CAS  from  a
    different college  to  that  mentioned  in  his  application.   On  his
    application form he stated that he wanted to attend  London  School  of
    Advanced Studies to complete a level 6 diploma in management.  However,
    his CAS stated that he wanted to attend Northam College to complete  an
    extended diploma in business and administration.

 3. The Home Office wrote to the Appellant on 13th September 2013  (a  copy
    of the letter is on the file) asking him to confirm which  college  and
    which course he wished to apply for.  Home Office records show that  no
    reply was received to that letter despite the fact that he was  written
    to twice and given a final deadline within which to respond.  After the
    deadline expired the refusal was issued.

 4. The Appellant's former representatives submitted a Notice of Appeal  on
    18th October 2013 requesting an oral hearing.  The Tribunal file  shows
    that the correct fee was paid.  There appear to be two  different  sets
    of Grounds of Appeal attached to the Notice  of  Appeal.   One  set  of
    grounds is in large type and extends to eleven paragraphs.   The  other
    set of grounds is in a  smaller  typeface  and  extends  to  only  nine
    paragraphs.  The grounds are similar but not identical.   None  of  the
    grounds explain why the Appellant submitted  a  CAS  from  a  different
    college to  that  mentioned  in  his  application.   The  grounds  also
    purported to rely on Article 8 ECHR.

 5. The Appellant's appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J
    M Hollingworth at Nottingham on 28th July 2014.  The Appellant did  not
    attend and there was no explanation for his absence.  The determination
    refers to the fact  that  the  appeal  had  been  listed  before  Judge
    Hollingworth  on  an  earlier  occasion.   A  paper  hearing  had  been
    requested but the Respondent's representative asked for an oral hearing
    and the  appeal  was  adjourned  for  that  reason.   In  view  of  the
    Appellant's unexplained absence and in the absence of any  evidence  to
    rebut the assertions contained in the Respondent's refusal  letter  the
    judge was not satisfied that the requirements of the relevant Rules had
    been met.  Similarly, in the Appellant's absence,  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that his claim under Article 8 had been made out.

 6. The Appellant's former representatives, SZ  Solicitors,  wrote  to  the
    Tribunal on 25th July 2014 (three days prior  to  the  appeal  hearing)
    stating that they were no longer representing the  Appellant  and  that
    any future correspondence should be addressed to the Appellant  at  his
    residential address in Derby.  The  letter  made  no  reference  to  an
    appeal bundle or any wish on the Appellant's behalf to have the  matter
    determined on the papers.

 7. The Appellant submitted an application for permission to  appeal  which
    was received by the Tribunal on 9th September  2014.   The  grounds  in
    support argued that the  First-tier  Judge  had  failed  to  take  into
    account a witness  statement  which  the  Appellant  had  submitted  in
    support of his appeal.  He also pointed out that he was not  prohibited
    from requesting a paper hearing despite the fact that he had  paid  the
    full fee of ï¿½140 for an oral  hearing  previously.   The  Appellant  is
    quite right in stating that if he changes his mind and wishes  to  rely
    on written evidence rather than personal  attendance  then  that  is  a
    choice which is open to him.

 8. The Respondent's representative submitted a Rule 24  response  on  11th
    November 2014.  The response argued that the First-tier Judge  directed
    himself appropriately and made no error of law.  The grounds point  out
    that the Appellant did not attend the appeal hearing, the matter having
    previously been adjourned.  No argument was advanced on behalf  of  the
    Appellant.  The Respondent's records revealed that he did not reply  to
    the letter sent to him seeking  confirmation  as  to  which  course  he
    proposed to follow.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier Tribunal  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  O'Garro  on  13th  October  2014.   Judge  O'Garro
    considered that the Appellant had given an  explanation  for  the  late
    filing of his appeal and that there were  special  circumstances  which
    merited an extension of time.  However, the judge failed to identify an
    arguable error of  law.   Accordingly,  when  the  matter  came  before
    Designated Judge Garratt for an error  of  law  hearing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, the Designated Judge decided to  refer  the  matter  back  to
    Judge O'Garro because, although she had extended time, she  had  failed
    to identify an arguable error of law.

10. On 16th December 2014 Judge O'Garro issued a further decision  granting
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  This time,  Judge  O'Garro
    explained that in her view the Appellant had provided arguable  grounds
    for appealing, namely his  assertion  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    failed to take into account his witness statement.

11. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal on 9th April 2015.
     The Appellant failed to attend and no explanation was offered.   I  am
    satisfied from the file that notice of hearing was duly sent to him  at
    the correct address by first-class post on  23rd  February  2015.   The
    Respondent was represented by Mr McVeety who relied on a  further  Rule
    24 response filed on behalf of the Respondent  and  dated  9th  January
    2015.

12. Mr McVeety produced a copy of the UKBA computerised records which shows
    that a letter was sent to the Appellant as mentioned above  asking  him
    to clarify which course he wished to pursue.   The  records  also  show
    that despite a reminder  and  a  deadline  being  given  there  was  no
    response from the Appellant.

13. The Appellant has submitted a witness statement dated 21st May 2014 and
    a letter dated 17th September 2013 which purports to confirm  that  the
    Appellant wished to pursue the course at Northam  College  rather  than
    the London School of  Advanced  Studies.   The  letter  appears  to  be
    unsigned and is headed "Computer Copy".  There is nothing to show  that
    these documents had been submitted to the Tribunal prior to the  appeal
    hearing before Judge P J M Hollingworth on 28th July 2014.  The wording
    of the determination strongly suggests that there was  no  evidence  in
    documentary form from the Appellant at the appeal hearing.  Despite the
    fact that the Appellant apparently  still  lives  in  Derby,  which  is
    within easy travelling  distance  from  Stoke-on-Trent,  the  Appellant
    failed without explanation to attend the error of law  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  If, which I do not accept, the First-tier Judge failed
    to take into account a witness statement and/or other  documents  which
    the Appellant had submitted, that the error would be immaterial because
    the Appellant has failed to deal with the original reasons for refusal.

14. I am well aware that time spent studying in the UK can,  in  theory  at
    least, give rise to a private life within the terms of Article 8  ECHR,
    but a grant of leave to enter or remain as a student  is  time  limited
    and the expectation is that the student will return home at the end  of
    the course of study.  The Appellant has adduced no evidence to  explain
    why Article 8 is engaged in this appeal and in the absence of any  such
    evidence I find that the Article is not engaged.

NOTICE OF DECISION

15. In conclusion, I find that the making of the decision by the First-tier
    Tribunal did not involve the making of a material error on a  point  of
    law.  I direct that the determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
