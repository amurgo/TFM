                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D Evans instructed by Asylum Justice


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the respondent (HIH).  A failure to comply  with
    this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Introduction

 3. This  determination  comprises  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    remaking the decision in respect of the appellant's  asylum  claim  and
    his claim under Art 3 of the ECHR following  my  decision  sent  on  28
    August 2020 that the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Rhys-Davies) materially
    erred in law in dismissing the appellant's appeal on asylum grounds and
    under Art 3 of the ECHR.

 4. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq who comes from Galabat in the Diyala
    governorate.  He was born  on  10  February  1992  and  is  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity.

 5. He arrived in the United Kingdom clandestinely on 2 November 2018.   He
    was arrested and claimed asylum on that date.  On  16  July  2019,  the
    Secretary of State refused the  appellant's  applications  for  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and under the ECHR.

 6. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard on 28  October  2019  by  Judge  Rhys-Davies.   He  accepted  the
    appellant's asylum claim based upon a risk from Hashd al-Shaabi in  his
    home area.  Further, the judge  found  that  the  appellant  could  not
    internally relocate to the IKR as he would have no  family  or  support
    network there.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was granted by
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Woodcraft) on 30 December 2019.

 8. The appeal was initially listed before me  on  23  July  2020.   In  my
    decision, sent on 28 August 2020, I allowed the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal to the extent that it challenged the  judge's  finding  that  it
    would be unreasonable or unduly harsh for the appellant  to  internally
    relocate to the IKR.  The appeal was adjourned in order to re-make  the
    decision in the UT.

The Resumed Hearing

 9. The resumed hearing was re-listed at Cardiff Civil Justice Centre on 26
    November 2020.  As a result of the  COVID-19  crisis,  the  appeal  was
    heard remotely by Skype for Business.  I was based in the Cardiff Civil
    Justice Centre in court and Mr Evans, who  represented  the  appellant,
    and Mr Howells, who represented the  Secretary  of  State,  joined  the
    hearing remotely by Skype for Business.

10. In addition, the appellant joined the hearing by Skype  and  gave  oral
    evidence through an interpreter who also joined the hearing by Skype.

11. In addition to the oral evidence  from  the  appellant,  the  appellant
    relied upon an updated witness statement  dated  27  August  2020.   In
    advance of the hearing, Mr Howells indicated that there were two up-to-
    date CPINs, "Internal  Relocation,  Civil  Documentation  and  Returns,
    Iraq" (June 2020) and "Security and Humanitarian Situation, Iraq"  (May
    2020).  In the result, neither of those documents was  referred  to  in
    the submissions.  Without objection from either party, those  documents
    were,  nevertheless,  admitted  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the   Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

The Issues

12. It was common ground between the  parties  that  the  sole  outstanding
    issue was whether the appellant  could  reasonably  and  without  undue
    harshness internally relocate to the IKR.

13. A number of preserved findings arose from Judge Rhys-Davies' decision:

          i) The appellant is at real risk of persecution  from  Hashd  al-
             Shaabi in his home area because of his ethnicity.

         ii) There is not a reasonable likelihood that he  would  obtain  a
             sufficiency of protection in his home area.

        iii) Although the appellant is not at risk of persecution in Kirkuk
             (where his family has moved), there is a real risk of  serious
             harm arising from  indiscriminate  violence  contrary  to  Art
             15(c) of the Qualification Directive in Kirkuk city.

         iv) The appellant  would  be  able  to  obtain  a  sufficiency  of
             protection from his persecutors in the IKR.

          v) The appellant has family in Kirkuk whom he could  contact  and
             who could obtain a CSID card for him.

14. It was also common  ground  between  the  parties  that  the  issue  of
    internal relocation turned upon one factual issue.  That factual issue,
    in effect, rested on the credibility of the appellant and an assessment
    of his evidence.  The appellant's evidence is that he  has  a  maternal
    and paternal uncle who live in the IKR but he (and his other family  in
    Iraq) have lost contact with his uncles and he would  not  be  able  to
    contact them in order to provide him support if he were to live in  the
    IKR.

15. In his submissions, Mr Howells accepted that if the appellant would not
    have the support of an uncle in the IKR then it would  be  unreasonable
    or unduly harsh to expect him to relocate there in the light  of  paras
    (27) and (28) of  the  headnote  in  SMO  and  Others  (Article  15(c);
    identity documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT 400  (IAC).   By  contrast,  Mr
    Howells submitted that if the appellant could  rely  on  an  uncle  for
    support then it would not be unduly harsh or unreasonable to expect him
    to relocate to the IKR and he relied on paras (26) and (28) of SMO  and
    Others.

16. Mr Evans submitted that if the appellant is found to  be  credible  and
    his evidence accepted that he  was  unable  to  contact  and  therefore
    obtain support from his uncles in the  IKR,  then  internal  relocation
    would not be reasonably open to him.  However, he accepted that if  the
    appellant could rely on an uncle in the IKR for support, then  internal
    relocation would probably not be unreasonable and would not  be  unduly
    harsh.

17. Both representatives' submissions focused on the  appellant's  evidence
    given orally at the hearing and in his  asylum  interview  and  witness
    statements.  The submissions focused upon the appellant's  credibility.



The Law

18. In relation to the appellant's asylum claim, it is  accepted  that  the
    appellant is at real risk of persecution in  his  home  area  where  he
    would be unable to obtain a sufficiency  of  protection.   It  follows,
    therefore, that in his home area he would be exposed to a real risk  of
    serious ill-treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR.

19. The issue is one of internal relocation and, it is only  suggested,  to
    the IKR.

20. Paragraph 399O of the  Immigration  Rules  (reflecting  Art  8  of  the
    Qualification Directive) is as follows:



         "399O(i)   The Secretary of State will not make:

                  (a)    a grant of refugee status if in part of the country
                  of origin a person would not have a well founded  fear  of
                  being  persecuted,  and  the  person  can  reasonably   be
                  expected to stay in that part of the country; or

                  (b)    a grant of humanitarian protection if in  part  of
                  the country of return a person would not face a real  risk
                  of suffering serious harm, and the person  can  reasonably
                  be expected to stay in that part of the country.

             (ii)   In examining whether a part of the country of origin or
             country of return meets the requirements in (i) the  Secretary
             of State, when making a decision on whether to grant asylum or
             humanitarian protection,  will  have  regard  to  the  general
             circumstances prevailing in that part of the  country  and  to
             the personal circumstances of the person.

             (iii)  (i)  applies  notwithstanding  technical  obstacles  to
             return to the country of origin or country of return."


21. There are two limbs:

      a) will the appellant be exposed to a real risk of serious harm in the
         place of proposed internal relocation (here the IKR)?; and

      b) if not, will it be unreasonable (or unduly harsh) for the appellant
         to live in the place of proposed relocation (here the IKR)?

22. This appeal is only concerned with limb (b).

23. The approach to 'reasonableness' and 'unduly harsh' was analysed by the
    House of Lords in Januzi v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5 and  AH  (Sudan)  v  SSHD
    [2006] UKHL 49.  The Court of Appeal provided a helpful summary of  the
    law, drawing together the earlier cases, in  AS  (Afghanistan)  v  SSHD
    [2019] EWCA Civ 873.  At [61] Underhill LJ (with whom  King  and  Singh
    LJJ agreed) said this:


         "61.  I start by  summarising  the  essential  points,  so  far  as
         relevant to this appeal, established by the authorities  about  the
         nature of the exercise required by article 8 of  the  Directive.  I
         emphasise that this is not intended as a comprehensive analysis  of
         all the issues raised by the authorities to which I have referred.


             (1) By way of preliminary, internal  relocation  is  obviously
             not an alternative  where  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the
             applicant for asylum will suffer persecution, or serious  harm
             within the meaning of  article  15  of  the  Directive  (which
             includes treatment which would be contrary to article 3 of the
             ECHR), in the putative safe haven. We are concerned with cases
             where there is no such risk.
             (2) The ultimate question is whether in such  a  case  "taking
             account  of  all  relevant  circumstances  pertaining  to  the
             claimant and his country of origin, ... it  is  reasonable  to
             expect the claimant to relocate or whether it would be  unduly
             harsh to expect him to do so". That is the formulation of Lord
             Bingham in Januzi, repeated in AH (Sudan).  It  pre-dates  the
             Directive and is not identically worded:  in  particular,  the
             reference to whether relocation would be "unduly harsh" is not
             present  in  article  8  but  derives  from  the  UNHCR   2003
             Guidelines (see Januzi, para. 20). But it  was  common  ground
             before us that it states the test required by  article  8  [of
             the Qualification Directive]. When in  doubt  it  is  to  that
             question that tribunals should return.
             (3) The test so stated is one of great generality  (save  only
             that it excludes any comparison of the  conditions,  including
             the  degree  of  respect  for  human  rights,  between   those
             obtaining in the safe haven and those of the country of refuge
             - this being the ratio of Januzi). It  requires  consideration
             of all matters relevant to the reasonableness  of  relocation,
             none having inherent priority over  the  others  (AH  (Sudan),
             para. 13). This is the same as Lady Hale's description of  the
             necessary assessment as "holistic" (AH (Sudan) paras. 27-28).
             (4) One way of approaching that assessment is to  ask  whether
             in the safe haven the applicant can lead "a relatively  normal
             life without facing undue hardship ... in the context  of  the
             country concerned".  That  language  derives  from  the  UNHCR
             Guidelines and is quoted by  Lord  Bingham  with  approval  in
             Januzi (para. 20) and also used by Lord Hope (para.  47);  but
             it does not appear in  the  Directive  or  in  Lord  Bingham's
             formulation of the test, and it should not  be  treated  as  a
             substitute for the latter. Rather, it is  a  valuable  way  of
             approaching the reasonableness analysis - "one touchstone", as
             Lord Brown puts it (AH (Sudan) para. 42). Its value is because
             if a person is able to lead in the safe haven a life which  is
             relatively normal for people in the context of his or her  own
             country, it will be reasonable to expect them  to  stay  there
             (AH (Sudan), para. 47).
             (5) It may be reasonable, and not unduly harsh,  to  expect  a
             refugee to relocate even if conditions in the safe haven  are,
             by the standards of the country of refuge, very bad.  That  is
             part of what is decided by Januzi  itself,  and  the  passages
             quoted at paras. 34 and 35 above  reinforce  it.  It  is  also
             vividly illustrated by the outcome of AH  (Sudan),  where  the
             House of Lords upheld the decision of  the  AIT  that  it  was
             reasonable for Darfuri refugees to be expected to relocate  to
             the camps  or  squatter  slums  of  Khartoum.  That  may  seem
             inconsistent with the suggested approach of asking whether the
             applicant would be able lead a "relatively normal life" in the
             safe haven; but the reconciliation lies in  the  qualification
             "in the context of the country concerned".
             (6) Point (5) does not mean that it will be reasonable  for  a
             person to relocate to a safe haven, however bad the conditions
             they will face there, as long as such conditions are normal in
             their country.  Conditions  may  be  normal  but  nevertheless
             unduly harsh: this is the point emphasised by Lady Hale in  AH
             (Sudan) and is exemplified by AA (Uganda).
             (7) The UNHCR Guidelines contain a full discussion of  factors
             relevant to the reasonableness analysis. These  are  described
             by Lord Bingham as "valuable" and partly quoted by him (Januzi
             para. 20); and at para. 20 of her opinion in AH  (Sudan)  Lady
             Hale endorses a submission made in that case  by  UNHCR  which
             summarises the factors  in  question.  A  decision-maker  must
             consider those factors, so  far  as  material,  in  each  case
             (though it  does  not  follow  that  everything  said  in  the
             detailed discussion in the Guidelines is authoritative).
             (8) The assessment must in each case be conducted by reference
             to  the  reasonableness  of  relocation  for  the   particular
             individual."

24. In SMO and Others, the Upper Tribunal dealt with returns  by  Kurds  to
    the IKR at paras (20)-(28) of the headnote.

25. In this appeal, as a result of Judge  Rhys-Davies'  preserved  finding,
    the appellant will have a valid CSID and so can safely return  to  Iraq
    and travel to the IKR (see paras (21)-(25) of the headnote in  SMO  and
    Others).

26. At para (26) of the headnote, the UT recognised that it was unlikely to
    be "unduly harsh" for a Kurd with family members living in the  IKR  to
    relocate there:

         "If P has family members living in the  IKR  cultural  norms  would
         require that family to  accommodate  P.  In  such  circumstances  P
         would, in general, have sufficient assistance from the family so as
         to lead a 'relatively normal  life',  which  would  not  be  unduly
         harsh.  It  is  nevertheless  important  for   decision-makers   to
         determine the extent of any assistance likely to be provided by P's
         family on a case by case basis."

27. For Kurds without assistance from family in the IKR  the  position  was
    fact-sensitive taking into account a number of factors as  set  out  in
    paras (27)-(28) of the headnote in SMO and Others as follows:



        "27.    For Kurds without the assistance of family in  the  IKR  the
           accommodation options are limited:


           (i)     Absent special circumstances it is not reasonably likely
              that P will be able to gain access  to  one  of  the  refugee
              camps  in  the  IKR;  these  camps  are   already   extremely
              overcrowded and are closed to  newcomers.  64%  of  IDPs  are
              accommodated in  private  settings  with  the  vast  majority
              living with family members;


           (ii)    If P cannot live with a family member, apartments in  a
              modern block in a new neighbourhood are available for rent at
              a cost of between $300 and $400 per month;


           (iii)  P could resort  to  a  'critical  shelter  arrangement',
              living in an unfinished  or  abandoned  structure,  makeshift
              shelter, tent, mosque, church or squatting  in  a  government
              building.  It would be unduly harsh to require P to  relocate
              to the IKR if P will  live  in  a  critical  housing  shelter
              without access to basic necessities such as food, clean water
              and clothing;


           (iv)  In considering whether P would be able  to  access  basic
              necessities, account must be taken of the  fact  that  failed
              asylum seekers are entitled to apply for a  grant  under  the
              Voluntary Returns Scheme, which could give P access to �1500.
              Consideration should also be given to whether  P  can  obtain
              financial support from other sources such as (a)  employment,
              (b) remittances from relatives abroad, (c)  the  availability
              of ad hoc charity or by being able to access PDS rations.


        28.    Whether P is able to secure employment must be assessed on  a
           case-by-case basis taking the following matters into account:


           (i)     Gender. Lone women are very  unlikely  to  be  able  to
              secure legitimate employment;


           (ii)     The unemployment rate for Iraqi IDPs living in the IKR
              is 70%;


           (iii)    P cannot work without a CSID or INID;


           (iv)   Patronage and nepotism continue to be important  factors
              in securing employment. A returnee with family connections to
              the region will have a significant advantage in that he would
              ordinarily be able  to  call  upon  those  contacts  to  make
              introductions to prospective employers and to vouch for him;


           (v)     Skills, education and experience. Unskilled workers are
              at  the  greatest  disadvantage,  with  the  decline  in  the
              construction industry reducing the number of  labouring  jobs
              available;


           (vi)   If P is from an area with a marked association with ISIL,
              that may deter prospective employers."

The Appellant's Evidence

    The Witness Statements

28. In his first  witness  statement  dated  24  October  2019,  which  the
    appellant adopted in his oral evidence, the appellant said  this  about
    his family in Iraq.  The appellant's account is  that  his  mother  and
    sister lived with his brother-in-law in Kirkuk city where they had fled
    following the threats from Hashd al-Shaabi.  At para 19  the  appellant
    said:

         "I have lost all contact with my family, I have not spoken to  them
         at all and I fear that my brother is dead".

29. Then at para 20 he said this:

         "It is impossible for me to move to the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.   I
         have never even been there in my life.  I do not know anyone  there
         and I do not have any form of education to be able to survive".

30. In his more recent statement, dated 27 August 2020, the appellant dealt
    in some detail with his family in Iraq:

         "1.  I wish to further elaborate on why I am unable  to  return  to
             the IKR, and specifically, why I cannot contact my uncles.   I
             can confirm that I have never been  asked  to  comment  on  my
             relationship with my uncles in detail,  neither  by  the  Home
             Office or my current and previous representatives.

         2.   I do not have contact information for my uncles,  and  neither
             do my other immediate family.  This stems from  a  dispute  we
             had with them after my father died in 2005.

         3.   After my father died, there was the issue of money, and how it
             should be  distributed.   Sadly,  my  uncles  took  the  money
             without consulting my mother on the basis  that  they  thought
             they deserved it more than her.  My mother would try to  plead
             with them that they cannot take all of the money, but they did
             not listen.

         4.   I think the last  time  we  had  any  contact  with  them  was
             sometime between 2005-08.  I am not  sure  exactly  when,  but
             whenever it was between those years, the contact was not of  a
             pleasant nature.  The money issue completely split  apart  our
             family, and after that my uncles ceased contacting us  and  we
             them.

         5.   I believe they still live  in  or  around  the  IKR,  that  is
             because they have always lived in  Kurdistan,  not  because  I
             have any particular contact details or addresses.   I  do  not
             know how we would even get back in contact with them as like I
             said, my mother has not spoken to them for over a decade.

         6.   Even if I was able to somehow find their contact  details  and
             visit them, I am certain they would not help  me.   They  have
             not reached out to us, despite them taking the money that  was
             owed to us, for over a decade.  As is often  the  case  around
             issues of money and inheritance in Kurdistan, this  can  cause
             considerable tension and conflict.

         7.   There is the potential that if I were to contact them and  ask
             for their help, they would assume I'm trying to get the money,
             or going to ask for money.  I can imagine  that  at  the  very
             least, there would be an argument, as in any case, we are  not
             on good terms considering what has happened.

         8.   If I were to be returned to the IKR, I would be alone, without
             any connections or support.  The family that I do have  there,
             my uncles, would not help me and there is a  very  real  risk,
             due to money being involved,  that  they  will  see  me  as  a
             threat.  This is even if I were able to  contact/locate  them,
             as we have not been in contact with them for over a decade".

    Oral Evidence

31. In his oral evidence, the appellant adopted both  statements.   He  was
    not asked any further questions in examination-in-chief and  there  was
    no re-examination.

32. In cross-examination, the  appellant  confirmed  that  he  was  not  in
    contact with his mother, his brother, his sister or  brother-in-law  in
    Iraq.  He said he had had no contact with them since he left Kurdistan.
     He said he had no contact with anybody in Iraq since he had left.   He
    said that when he left Iraq his mother and sister were  living  in  his
    brother-in-law's house in Kirkuk.  He  had  no  information  about  his
    brother.

33. The appellant confirmed that he had lived in his brother-in-law's house
    on a couple of occasions totalling six months.  He said that he did not
    know the address and that there were no addresses "in  Kurdistan".   He
    said he only knew the name of the city.  When asked why he  said  there
    were no addresses in Kirkuk, he said you can refer to an area  and  his
    brother-in-law lived in an area called "Shorijah".  He was asked how it
    was people could send and receive post  in  Kirkuk  if  there  were  no
    addresses and he replied that there were no such postal  addresses  "in
    Kurdistan", just the area.

34. The appellant said that his brother-in-law  did  not  have  a  landline
    telephone but that he did have a mobile.  However,  when  asked  if  he
    knew the number, the appellant said he did not.  He was asked  why  and
    he said that at that time only his mother had a mobile phone  and  that
    he was an illiterate person.  His brother-in-law's number was saved  in
    his mother's mobile phone.  He was asked whether he had  had  a  mobile
    phone in Iraq; he replied "not really" but that sometimes  he  had  his
    mother's mobile phone.  He was asked whether he had a mobile  phone  in
    the UK and he said that he did have one.  He was asked why, if  he  was
    illiterate, he was able to have a phone in the UK but not in Iraq.   He
    said that he used a mobile phone in the UK and that he  learnt  English
    from some sites which were saved by friends on his phone.

35. The appellant was asked about an answer he gave  at  para  6.2  of  his
    screening interview where he was asked whether  he  would  be  able  to
    obtain a police report from Iraq and that he had said that he would  be
    able to do so but how  could  he  have  said  this  if  there  were  no
    addresses for his family and he did not know any  phone  numbers.   The
    appellant agreed that he had said that and that he had thought he would
    be able to obtain the report but that when  he  found  out  he  had  no
    contact details or phone numbers he was not able to do so.  He said  he
    was new in the country and when he thought about the matter he realised
    he could not do that.

36. The appellant was asked about the questionnaire he had  completed  with
    his solicitors about six months after he arrived in the UK.  He said he
    remembered completing it.  He was asked why at page 11  of  19  he  had
    said that his "mother and sister were still in Kirkuk" and how  did  he
    know that if he was not in contact with them.   The  appellant  replied
    that he had not said that.  He had said he  had  no  information  about
    them but that they were in Kirkuk when he left.

37. The appellant was asked whether he had  made  any  attempt  to  contact
    relatives in Iraq from the UK.  He said he wished he  was  able  to  do
    that but his mother was of an age  when  she  did  not  understand  the
    internet and that was true for his sister and brother-in-law  as  well.
    He said that he had had help from a friend to connect  to  the  hearing
    today.  He had not been able to do it himself.  He was asked whether he
    had tried to trace his family through the Red Cross and  he  said  "not
    really" but he went on to say that friends  had  approached  the  Iraqi
    Embassy but they could not help.

38. The appellant was asked about his brother-in-law who had paid an  agent
    to help him come to the UK.  He agreed that he was close to his brother-
    in-law who had been arrested instead of  him.   He  said  that  he  had
    helped  the  appellant  to  leave  Kurdistan  when  his  brother-in-law
    realised it was unsafe.  When asked whether  his  brother-in-law  would
    want to know if he reached the UK safely, and know  how  the  appellant
    was doing, he said "yes obviously" and that he had probably  tried  but
    his brother-in-law had not arranged his exit; he had done that  through
    a friend in Kirkuk.

39. The appellant agreed that he had a maternal and paternal  uncle  living
    in the IKR but he was not sure where.  He said that his maternal  uncle
    was in the Peshmerga.  His paternal uncle, with whom  he  had  not  had
    contact for a long time, was, as far as he was aware,  a  driver.   The
    appellant was asked about his answers  in  his  asylum  interview  (Q8)
    where he had said that the employment of his uncles was the  other  way
    around; his paternal uncle was in the Peshmerga and his maternal  uncle
    was a taxi  driver.   The  appellant's  explanation  was  that  he  had
    panicked and that he was fasting on  that  day  and  very  tired.   The
    interview had been delayed and he had made a mistake.  It  was  pointed
    out to him that his solicitors had, after the interview, contacted  the
    Home Office to correct some of his answers.  They had not corrected his
    answer to Q8 in his asylum interview.  He said there must have  been  a
    mistake and that he had taken two of his friends to interpret.

40. He was asked whether he had received any news about his uncles after he
    lost contact between 2005 and 2008.  He said that everything he knew he
    had heard from his mother.  From 2008 they had  disappeared  and  there
    had been no further contact.  The appellant confirmed that he could not
    obtain the support of either of his  uncles  as  he  had  no  means  of
    contacting them.  He said that his uncles had taken everything from his
    father.  He said his father had had land and they  sold  it  after  his
    father died.  He did not know whether the land was in his father's name
    because he was a child then.  The only thing he knew is that they  sold
    the land and they took everything, they took the money.

41. The appellant was asked about his earlier evidence in which he had said
    that the family had four farms.  He was asked how that  was  consistent
    with him saying that his uncles had taken everything.  He said that the
    land in the villages was not good and it was not worth them  trying  to
    get it.

42. The appellant was asked about his answer in his asylum interview  (Q66)
    that his father and paternal uncle had a conflict but that he  had  not
    mentioned the family dispute until his recent statement.  He said  that
    he always mentioned that dispute which was when his father  was  alive.
    There was nothing said about the  family  dispute  because  nobody  had
    asked him about it.  He was asked why he  had  mentioned  the  conflict
    with the paternal uncle but had not mentioned  the  conflict  with  the
    maternal uncle and, again, he said no one asked  him  to  mention  that
    either.

43. The appellant was asked about his asylum interview (Q66) when  he  said
    that his paternal uncle lived in Jalawla  and  his  maternal  uncle  in
    Kirkuk and how did he know that at the time of  his  asylum  interview.
    He said he was not sure where they  lived.   He  heard  this  from  his
    mother.  If he knew where they lived he would try to speak to them  and
    ask them to support him.  He was asked why, in his asylum interview, he
    referred to his uncles in the present tense and that this showed he was
    in contact with them or knew where they were at the time.   He  replied
    that he had never said he was in contact with them and that at the time
    of his asylum interview he had said that he heard these things from his
    mother.  The appellant denied that he had invented the  family  dispute
    and that at the asylum interview he was not  asked  about  the  dispute
    between his father and uncles.  The appellant said that his father died
    in 2005 and that his uncles had taken everything.  "They left us and we
    didn't know anything about them".

44. The appellant  accepted  that  he  had  no  mental  health  issues  but
    physically he did have a problem with his knee caused in Iraq by  Hashd
    al-Shaabi.  He agreed that he was a farmer in Iraq.  He  said  that  he
    had been told by a college in the UK that they did not have  space  for
    him and he was waiting for a reply to an email from them.  He said that
    he was not aware that if he voluntarily returned to Iraq he could apply
    for a �1,500 grant.  He said that even if he had the money he could not
    go back because his life was not safe.

The Submissions

45. As  I  have  already  indicated,  it  was  common  ground  between  the
    representatives that the factual issue, namely  whether  the  appellant
    would be able to contact his uncles in the IKR to support  him,  turned
    on the credibility of the appellant.

    The Respondent

46. Mr Howells submitted that the appellant claims were not  credible  that
    he had not been in contact with his  immediate  family  -  his  mother,
    brother, sister and brother-in-law - for four years and that he was not
    to be able to contact them.  He invited me to  reject  the  appellant's
    evidence on this issue.

47. First, Mr Howells submitted that  the  appellant's  brother-in-law  had
    paid for his journey to the UK which  showed  that  he  cared  for  the
    appellant and that it was most unlikely that he would have  no  contact
    with the appellant in the UK.

48. Secondly, the appellant had stayed with his  brother-in-law  in  Kirkuk
    for six months over several occasions and it was likely  that  he  knew
    his address.  Mr Howells submitted  that  the  appellant's  claim  that
    there were no addresses in Kirkuk lacked  credibility.   There  was  no
    document of any attempt to contact his relatives including through  the
    Red Cross.  He had left his family in Kirkuk which is a major city.

49. Thirdly, Mr  Howells  relied  upon  the  fact  that  in  his  screening
    interview the appellant had said that he would  be  able  to  obtain  a
    police report.  This indicated that when he arrived in the  UK  he  had
    contact details of his family in Iraq and was  able  to  contact  them.
    Yet, he now claimed he had no way of contacting his family.  Mr Howells
    pointed out that his representatives completed a questionnaire with the
    appellant and on this form (at page 11 of 19) the appellant had  stated
    his mother and sister were still in  Kirkuk.   This  also,  Mr  Howells
    submitted, indicated that the appellant was in contact  with  relatives
    after arriving in the UK contrary to what he now claimed.

50. Fourthly, relying on [392] of SMO and Others, Mr Howells submitted that
    the UT had noted that Iraq was a collectivist society where the  family
    is all important.  Although this was said in the context  of  obtaining
    details of an individual's entry in the "Family Book", it also  applied
    to a general contract between Iraqis in the UK and Iraq.

51. Fifthly, Mr Howells submitted it was likely that the appellant's mother
    would  have  the  contact  details  of  his  two  uncles  in  the  IKR.
    Consequently, if he was in contact with (or could re-establish  contact
    with) his immediate family, he should  be  able  to  find  out  contact
    details of his uncles.

52. Sixthly, Mr Howells invited me to reject the appellant's account of why
    he had lost contact with his uncles somewhere  between  2005  and  2008
    because they had taken all his father's money after his death in  2005.



53. Mr Howells pointed out the inconsistency in the appellant's evidence in
    his asylum interview and now as to the employment of  his  uncles.   He
    had switched their employment as being a Peshmerga and taxi  driver  in
    his evidence.  Further, in his asylum interview  he  had  stated  where
    each uncle was but today he could not say where they were.

54. Further, the appellant had not mentioned the family dispute  until  his
    statement for this hearing.  That was about two years after his  asylum
    application.  It was now, of course, the main issue  whether  he  could
    rely on his uncles for support.  In his asylum interview, the appellant
    had not referred to the family dispute in the way that he now did.  All
    he had said was that his father, when he was alive, had a dispute  with
    his paternal uncle (see Q66).

55. Further, Mr Howells relied on the fact that the appellant said  in  his
    recent statement that his uncles had  taken  all  his  family's  money.
    But, in his oral evidence,  he  had  said  they  had  taken  everything
    including the land.  That was inconsistent with his evidence,  as  part
    of his asylum claim, that his family had owned four farms  and  one  of
    those had been taken by the Hashd al-Shaabi.

56. Mr Howells also  relied  on  the  appellant's  answers  in  his  asylum
    interview where he referred to his maternal uncle's occupation  in  the
    present tense but also said that his paternal uncle was  still  in  the
    Peshmerga.  That had been corrected, by an  amending  letter  from  the
    appellant's representatives after the interview, that  he  had  been  a
    member of the Peshmerga as long as the appellant could remember.  There
    had been no other amendment to that evidence.  Likewise (at  Q66),  the
    appellant had said that his uncles were in Jalawla and Kirkuk - both in
    the present tense - even though the appellant had claimed that  he  had
    lost contact with them for at least ten years.  At Q67,  the  appellant
    had not mentioned that they had lost contact for at  least  ten  years,
    but rather had said that he had not seen much  of  his  paternal  uncle
    since his father died.

57. Mr Howells submitted that it was in the appellant's interest  to  claim
    that he could not rely on his two uncles for support,  given  that  the
    issue was now focused upon that if he returned to the IKR.  He  invited
    me to find that the appellant lacked  credibility  and  to  reject  his
    evidence and to find that he could contact and would have  the  support
    of at least one uncle in the IKR.  His appeal should be dismissed under
    the Refugee Convention and Art 3 of the ECHR.

    The Appellant

58. Mr Evans agreed that the factual issue effectively  came  down  to  the
    credibility of the appellant.

59. First, he reminded me that Judge Rhys-Davies had found the appellant to
    be credible in his evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

60. Secondly, Mr Evans submitted that the  appellant  had  been  consistent
    about his lack of contact with relatives in the  IKR  and  Iraq.   That
    consistency had "flowed" up to this hearing.

61. Thirdly, Mr Evans relied on the fact that the appellant was illiterate,
    he had little education and his only work experience was farming.   His
    illiteracy was important when considering why he cannot remember  phone
    numbers of, for example, his mother or brother-in-law.  It was not,  he
    submitted, unreasonable or unlikely that a  person  in  that  situation
    would not be able to remember the numbers.

62. Fourthly, Mr Evans submitted that central to the appellant's claim  was
    he had not had contact with his uncles since 2005-2008.  He reminded me
    that the appellant  does  remember  the  last  contact  was  unpleasant
    because of the dispute with his father.  He submitted that it was clear
    that the knowledge of his uncles came from his mother and not  his  own
    knowledge.  He submitted that it was not unreasonable for the appellant
    not to remember addresses given his illiteracy.  Mr Evans also  pointed
    out that when the appellant said, in his oral evidence, that there were
    no addresses he was talking about the IKR, not Iraq.

63. Fifthly, Mr Evans  submitted  that  the  appellant's  evidence  was  in
    relation to his mother and sister that, when he  had  left  Iraq,  they
    were in Kirkuk.  He submitted that  the  appellant  genuinely  believes
    that and does not know how to contact his uncles when he cannot get  in
    contact with his mother.  He has had  no  contact  with  his  immediate
    family since he left Iraq.  He has made attempts through friends at the
    embassy to do so, but without success.  It  was,  Mr  Evans  submitted,
    clear  from  the  appellant's  evidence  that  his  brother-in-law  had
    entrusted a friend to arrange the appellant's exit from Iraq  and  that
    he (the appellant) was not aware whether his brother-in-law  had  tried
    to contact him as he had no contact with his brother-in-law.

64. Sixthly, in relation to his answer in his screening interview  that  he
    would be able to obtain a police report, the  appellant  had  explained
    that, when he realised he had no  contacts,  that  would  be  virtually
    impossible.  It seems that it was his hope when he came to the UK  that
    he would be able to do so.

65. Seventhly, as regards the appellant's answers in  interview,  Mr  Evans
    submitted that I should not read anything into the use  of  present  or
    past tenses, in particular given that the appellant's evidence was that
    there had been a misinterpretation.

66. Eighthly, as regards the appellant's failure to mention that his uncles
    had taken the family  property  after  his  father's  death,  Mr  Evans
    submitted that the appellant had mentioned that there was "some kind of
    conflict" between his father and paternal uncle at Q66.  There had been
    no further questions and the interviewer had moved on to another topic.
     The appellant had been clear (at Q67) that he had not had much contact
    with his paternal uncle after his father's death.

67. Finally, Mr Evans submitted that it  was  reasonably  likely  that  the
    appellant would struggle to trace his uncles in the IKR and that  would
    leave him without familial or family support in  the  IKR.    Mr  Evans
    invited me to accept the appellant's evidence that he would not be able
    to obtain the support of his uncles because of  the  dispute  and  that
    internal relocation to the IKR was, therefore, unreasonable and  unduly
    harsh.  He invited me to allow the appeal on that basis.

Discussion and Findings

68. In reaching my findings, I bear in mind that the standard of  proof  is
    the lower one applicable in international protection  cases,  namely  a
    reasonable likelihood or real risk.  The appellant bears the burden  of
    establishing the underlying facts.

69. I also bear in mind that Judge Rhys-Davies, having heard the  appellant
    give evidence at the First-tier Tribunal hearing, found  the  appellant
    to be credible and, in essence, accepted his account that gave rise  to
    his asylum claim and claim under Art 3 of the ECHR.

70. In relation to that, I make the following points.  I have also had  the
    benefit of hearing the appellant give oral evidence and to  assess  his
    credibility directly  on  the  focussed  issues  in  this  appeal  now.
    Further, Judge Rhys-Davies did not accept all the appellant's evidence.
     He appears to have accepted, for instance, that  the  appellant  could
    contact his relatives in Iraq to obtain a replacement CSID (see para 35
    of his determination).  Finally, and  I  will  return  to  this  matter
    shortly, the appellant did not raise in his written statement  or  oral
    evidence before Judge Rhys-Davies his explanation why  his  family  had
    lost contact with his uncles and that he would not be able  to  contact
    them now, namely that following his father's death in 2005  his  uncles
    had taken his father's money ("everything").

71. I also bear in mind in assessing the appellant's evidence that  he  has
    little education.  He left school at an early age.

72. Mr Evans relied upon the consistency in the appellant's evidence up  to
    the present hearing.  Whilst that is, in general, correct, it does  not
    detract from the fact that the appellant did not raise the  explanation
    that he now makes as to why his  family  lost  contact  with  both  his
    uncles as a result of their taking his father's property when  he  died
    in 2005.

73. Mr Evans relied  upon  the  fact  that  the  appellant  in  his  asylum
    interview (Q66) said that his paternal uncle "did not get on well  with
    my father because they had some  kind  of  conflict".   That  makes  no
    mention of the appellant's other, maternal uncle.  Further, of  course,
    it relates to "some kind of conflict" whilst the appellant's father was
    alive rather than a conflict which arose, on the  appellant's  evidence
    now, between his uncles and the appellant's family after  his  father's
    death.  Whilst the appellant was not asked for any further  explanation
    of that in his interview, which might explain why he  gave  no  further
    evidence in his interview concerning that, it does not explain  why  he
    did not raise this issue at the hearing before Judge Rhys-Davies.   His
    witness statement for that hearing made no reference to it and  it  was
    not raised in his oral evidence.  Yet,  before  Judge  Rhys-Davies  the
    issue of whether he could contact his uncles  was  a  live  issue  upon
    which, as in the hearing before me, was significant to the  outcome  of
    the appellant's asylum claim.  I simply do not accept that if this part
    of his account as now raised was true, the  appellant  would  not  have
    mentioned that to his representatives so that it would have been raised
    in his written evidence or in his  oral  evidence  before  Judge  Rhys-
    Davies.  The appellant has offered no  plausible  explanation  for  his
    failure to raise this matter as part of his  evidence  in  his  earlier
    hearing.  It was only raised for  the  present  hearing  in  a  further
    witness statement

74. Further, the appellant's evidence on this matter  is  not,  in  itself,
    consistent either internally or with his  previous  evidence.   In  his
    further written statement, the appellant says that his uncles took  his
    father's "money" after his father's death.  In his oral evidence before
    me, the appellant said that his uncles took "everything", including his
    father's land.  When it was pointed out to him that he  had  previously
    claimed that, even though one farm had been occupied by the  Hashd  al-
    Shaabi, his family still  had  "three  other  farms",  the  appellant's
    explanation was, in essence, that only  one  of  the  farms  was  worth
    taking.  I was left with the clear impression that  the  appellant  had
    failed to realise that what he  had  said  in  his  oral  evidence  was
    inconsistent with his earlier account as to his family's  ownership  of
    land and it seizure which was integral to his asylum claim.   There  is
    no suggestion that any of the land - namely the four farms which formed
    part of his asylum claim - were other than his father's.  In  my  view,
    the appellant's explanation is unsatisfactory and fails to explain  the
    inconsistency which, as a result of what he said in his oral  evidence,
    became all too apparent.  There is no explanation why his uncles  would
    only sell one farm, leaving the appellant's  family,  with  four  other
    farms which were part of the appellant's evidence in his asylum claim.

75. Also, I do not accept the appellant's evidence  attempting  to  explain
    why he has no knowledge of the  whereabouts  of  his  immediate  family
    which he left in Kirkuk and his inability to contact them.   His  claim
    that there are "no addresses" that  would  allow  him  to  contact  his
    mother and sister and brother-in-law was unsupported by any  background
    evidence that Kirkuk city does not have addresses to which  post  could
    be sent.  Indeed, the appellant's explanation was by reference, not  to
    Kirkuk city, but to "Kurdistan" of which Kirkuk city is not  part.   It
    is in central Iraq, not the IKR.

76. Likewise, the appellant's explanation that he does not know any  mobile
    phone numbers, in particular of his brother-in-law, so  as  to  contact
    him is, in my judgment, implausible.  I have regard to  the  fact  that
    the appellant has little education.  However,  as  the  Upper  Tribunal
    noted in [392] of SMO and Others, the use of mobile phones is  high  in
    Iraq.  The appellant recognised that his brother-in-law  had  a  mobile
    phone and that  his  mother  had  some  access  to  it.   Clearly,  the
    appellant's brother-in-law is part of a close family since he has taken
    in the appellant's mother and, whilst the appellant was  in  Iraq,  the
    appellant also.  His brother-in-law also paid for the appellant to come
    to the UK, whether he did so personally or through an agent is  largely
    irrelevant.  Either way the closeness and concern of the brother-in-law
    for the appellant is demonstrated.  I do not accept that the  appellant
    would leave Iraq without having with him a record  of  his  brother-in-
    law's mobile phone number as a means of contact between them  when  the
    appellant came to the UK.  The appellant accepts that he uses a  mobile
    phone in the UK, even if he did not have  one  in  Iraq.   Despite  the
    appellant's educational background, I do not accept that the  only  way
    that he is able to use a mobile phone is through the assistance of  his
    friends, as he claimed, providing him with sites saved on the phone  to
    learn English.  I do not accept that the appellant could not engage  in
    the simple function of "dialling" a phone number in Iraq.

77. Mr Howells placed some reliance upon  specific  answers  given  by  the
    appellant in his asylum interview.  He relied upon the  change  in  the
    appellant's  evidence,  between  the  asylum  interview  and  his  oral
    evidence, as to which of his uncles was a taxi driver and which was  in
    the Peshmerga.  He also relied upon the specific use of tenses  in  the
    appellant's asylum interview when he referred to his maternal uncle  as
    being a taxi driver (in the present tense) and his paternal uncle being
    a member of the Peshmerga (in the past tense).  He also relied  on  the
    fact that the appellant said that his paternal uncle was in Jalawla and
    his maternal uncle in Kirkuk both in the present tense.  That was said,
    despite the fact that the appellant claimed that he  had  lost  contact
    with them (as had his family) for at least ten years.  Mr Howells  also
    relied on the fact that the  appellant's  legal  representatives  in  a
    letter to the Home Office following the interview (dated 13 May 2019 at
    Annex C of the respondent's bundle) corrected certain answers but  none
    of these in any material way.

78. Whilst Mr Howells'  submissions  on  these  issues  are,  in  my  view,
    potentially consistent with my conclusion that the appellant's  account
    on the matter in issue now is not to be accepted,  in  themselves  they
    would not lead me to reach that conclusion.  They are relatively  minor
    discrepancies and may be explicable by the tense used in translation.

79. More telling is the appellant's answer in his screening  interview  (at
    paras 6.2 and 6.3) that he might be able to obtain a police report.  If
    it was, as it has always previously been, the appellant's case that  he
    had no means of contacting his immediate family or uncles, it would  be
    wholly incongruous of him to state that he could obtain a police report
    from Iraq and, as  Mr  Howells  submitted,  the  answer  given  by  the
    appellant in his  screening  interview  was  not  contradicted  in  the
    questionnaire submitted, about  five  months  which  did  not  seek  to
    correct any misapprehension by the appellant.  Indeed, at page 11 of 19
    of the questionnaire the appellant informed the Home  Office  that  his
    "mother and sister still in Kirkuk" suggesting that  he  was  aware  of
    their current situation, despite his claim that  he  has  not  been  in
    contact (and does not have the means of contacting) his family in  Iraq
    since he left.

80. For these reasons, I  reject  the  central  parts  of  the  appellant's
    evidence that he has lost contact with his family in Kirkuk where  they
    remain.  I do not accept that his family in Iraq has lost contact  with
    his uncles in the IKR as a result of a falling out in the  family  over
    property taken by the appellant's uncles after his  father's  death  in
    2005.

81. In my judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood that the appellant has
    retained the ability to contact his immediate family  in  Kirkuk  city.
    That family includes his mother, his sister and brother-in-law.   I  do
    not accept that the appellant's family lost contact with his two uncles
    who live in the IKR (on the appellant's evidence)  as  a  result  of  a
    family dispute arising after the death of his father.  I bear  in  mind
    the background evidence, and what was said in SMO and Others at  [392],
    about the collectivist society in Iraq and the importance of family and
    family connections.  I find that the appellant is reasonably likely  to
    be able to contact by telephone or otherwise, for example by post,  his
    immediate family in Kirkuk city and, even if he does not currently know
    where his uncles live in the IKR or have their contact  details,  I  am
    satisfied that his immediate family will be able to  provide  him  with
    those contact details which they retain.  In particular, the brother of
    the appellant's mother is one of the uncles in the IKR.

82. Given that I do not accept that there has been any dispute between  the
    appellant's immediate family and his two uncles, I  am  satisfied  that
    his uncles would be in  a  position  to  accommodate  and  support  the
    appellant in the IKR.

83. Mr Evans  accepted  that  on  those  findings,  it  would  probably  be
    reasonable and  not  unduly  harsh  for  the  appellant  to  internally
    relocate to the IKR.  He made no  submissions  to  support  a  contrary
    finding.

84. Having regard to paras (27) and (28) of the headnote in SMO and Others,
    I am  satisfied  that  the  appellant,  who  would  have  access  to  a
    replacement CSID, to accommodation and support from his uncles together
    with their "patronage" and potential nepotism, could live in  the  IKR,
    for as long as necessary, with family support until such time that  the
    appellant becomes self-sufficient through work.   I also bear  in  mind
    the voluntary repatriation payment available for the UK Government.

85. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the appellant can reasonably  be
    expected to internally relocate to the IKR.  On that basis, his  claims
    for asylum and under Art 3 of the ECHR do not succeed.

Decision

86. For the reasons set out in my decision of 30 July 2020 the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds and under Art 3 of the ECHR involved the making of an error  of
    law.  That decision was set aside.

87. I re-make the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal on asylum  and
    humanitarian protection grounds and under Art 3 of the ECHR.
