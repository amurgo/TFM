                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants, citizens of El Salvador have been granted permission to
    appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Maciel  who  dismissed
    their appeals on the basis that they would not be at risk on return  to
    their country of origin.

 2. The appeals were heard in the Upper Tribunal on  22  April  2016  by  a
    Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (DUTJ Archer).   Unfortunately,  due
    to ill health he has been unable to complete his written decision.

 3. By letter dated 24 August 2016 the Appellants' solicitors wrote to  the
    Upper Tribunal pointing out that the Presenting  Officer  had  conceded
    the appeal on 22 April and that the judge had allowed the appeal at the
    hearing.  The letter is accompanied by a copy of an email from a Senior
    Presenting Officer, Irwin Richards in terms that he had not opposed the
    appeal insofar as it alleged error of law by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and that it had been agreed by both parties the matter should  go  back
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a full days hearing.  He did not believe
    that any of the findings were to be preserved.  He had no objection  to
    the matter proceeding, yet agreed without the need for a further  Upper
    Tribunal hearing.

 4. Accordingly, I am satisfied that written reasons pursuant to Rule 40(3)
    of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 is  not  required
    as the decision remitting the case to the First-tier Tribunal was  made
    with the consent of the parties.

 5. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside  and  the  case
    remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  further  decision  by  a
    differently constituted tribunal.
