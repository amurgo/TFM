Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Muquit, of Counsel, instructed by A & P
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. E. Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Sri Lanka, has been granted permission  to
    appeal the determination of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Prior who,
    following a hearing on 9 July 2014,  dismissed  his  appeal  on  asylum
    humanitarian protection and human rights grounds against a decision  of
    the respondent of 4 October 2013 (served on 8 October 2013)  to  remove
    him from the United Kingdom having refused his asylum claim for reasons
    given in a letter dated 4 October 2013.

 2. The appeal heard by Judge Prior had been  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Pickup  who  found  that
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Rowlands had materially erred  in  law
    in dismissing the appellant's appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection
    and human rights grounds in his determination of 18 November 2013.

 3. Judge Prior assessed the credibility of the evidence before him at [24-
    30] of the determination and then said, at [31], as follows:

             "31.  Having  regard  to  all  the  evidential   considerations
             identified by me above  I  concluded  that  the  appellant  was
             totally lacking [sic] credibility. It was in the light of  that
             conclusion that I approached the evidence of the medical report
             of Dr. Martin on the appellant's scarring."

 4. It is therefore plain that Judge Prior assessed the credibility of  the
    appellant's evidence about the basis of his asylum claim  in  isolation
    from the medical report of Dr.  Martin  on  the  appellant's  scarring.
    Furthermore, he considered the medical  report  in  the  light  of  his
    negative credibility assessment. He should have considered all  of  the
    evidence, including the medical report, in the round in order to assess
    credibility and make his findings of  fact  (Mibanga  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    367).

 5. If Judge Prior had not made this error, he might have taken a different
    view of the credibility of the appellant's evidence not only about  his
    alleged experiences in Sri Lanka but also about his alleged  activities
    in the United Kingdom.

 6. Accordingly, I am satisfied  that  the  determination  of  Judge  Prior
    involved the making of an error of law such that it  falls  to  be  set
    aside. I set it aside in its entirety.

 7. At the hearing, Mr. Tufan accepted  that  Judge  Prior  had  materially
    erred in law and that his determination fell to be  set  aside  in  its
    entirety.

 8. The parties agreed that this case should be remitted to the FtT  for  a
    fresh hearing.

 9. I am mindful of the fact that this case was remitted previously to  the
    FtT. Having regard to para 7 of the Practice Statement and the Court of
    Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo) & Others [2012]  EWCA  Civ  327,  I  am
    satisfied that Practice Statement 7(2)(a) and (b) apply in this case.

10. I therefore remit this appeal to the FtT and direct that  the  decision
    on the appeal be re-made by a judge other than Judge  Prior,  Judge  K.
    Heynes and Judge P. Rowlands.

      Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside
    in its entirety. This case is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
    the decision on the appellant's appeal to be re-made by a Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Prior, Judge K. Heynes  and  Judge
    P. Rowlands.
