                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Ghaffar promulgated on 24th July 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a female Sri Lankan citizen born 29th  September  1988
    who, in January 2013, applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom
    as the spouse of Seevaratnam Sutharsan (the Sponsor) who is settled  in
    the United Kingdom.

 3. The application was refused on 22nd  April  2013,  the  Respondent  not
    accepting that the Appellant satisfied the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The  Respondent  contended  that
    the requirements of paragraph 2(b) and (c) of Appendix FM-SE  were  not
    satisfied as letters from the Sponsor's employers did not  contain  all
    of the specified information, and bank  statements  submitted  did  not
    show the Sponsor's salary was paid into the account.  It was  therefore
    not accepted that evidence had been provided to prove that the  Sponsor
    earned a minimum of �18,600 per annum.

 4. The application was also refused on the ground that  it  had  not  been
    proved that adequate accommodation was available,  and  the  Respondent
    considered Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention  on  Human  Rights
    (the 1950 Convention) but decided that refusal of entry  clearance  did
    not breach Article 8.

 5. The appeal was heard by Judge Ghaffar on  8th  July  2014.   The  judge
    found that adequate accommodation would be available,  but  found  that
    the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules were not  satisfied
    and therefore dismissed the appeal.  The  judge  declined  to  consider
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

 6. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Following the grant of permission I heard representations on behalf  of
    both parties at a hearing on 10th October 2014.  I found that the judge
    had not erred in dismissing the appeal on financial  grounds,  but  had
    erred in not considering Article 8 outside the rules, which meant  that
    there had been no proportionality assessment.  I made this  finding  on
    the basis that in this case the Immigration Rules were not  a  complete
    code, this was an out of country appeal, and the  Appellant  could  not
    rely upon section EX.1 of Appendix FM.

 7. I therefore set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    preserved the findings in relation to the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    dismissal of the appeal on those grounds.  The  hearing  was  adjourned
    for further evidence to be given in relation to Article 8.

 8. The grounds seeking permission to appeal, the grant of permission,  and
    my reasons for setting aside the decision in relation to Article 8, are
    contained in full in my decision dated  13th  October  2014  which  was
    promulgated on 17th October 2014.





The Hearing - 28th November 2014

Preliminary Issues

 9. I ascertained that I had  all  documentation  upon  which  the  parties
    intended to rely.  I had all the documentation which  had  been  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

10. I was told  that  the  Sponsor  would  be  giving  evidence,  and  both
    representatives indicated that they were ready to proceed and there was
    no application for an adjournment.

Oral Evidence

11. The Sponsor gave evidence with the  assistance  of  an  interpreter  in
    Tamil.  I was satisfied that there was no difficulty in  communication.



12. The Sponsor adopted as his evidence his  witness  statement  dated  4th
    July 2014 which is briefly summarised below.

13. The Sponsor has indefinite leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  and
    has lived in this country since 13th October 2000.   The  Appellant  is
    his spouse  and  he  believes  that  he  can  adequately  maintain  and
    accommodate her.

14. The Sponsor provided evidence with the entry clearance application that
    he had employment with Supersave  Express  and  Southfield  Newsagents.
    His salary from Supersave was paid directly into his bank account,  but
    his salary from Southfield Newsagents had been paid in  cash  which  is
    why it was not possible to see the exact salary going into the account.



15. At the date of making his statement the Sponsor  no  longer  worked  at
    Supersave Express but still worked at Southfield Newsagents.

16. The Sponsor's bank account had to be closed down in April 2013  because
    of some fraudulent activity when his bank account was  hacked  into  by
    some fraudsters.  The Sponsor had not sorted the problem out  with  the
    bank, and therefore it looks as though he has a very bad credit  rating
    and he has not been able to open any new bank accounts.

17. The Sponsor was not questioned by Ms Walker but was  cross-examined  by
    Mr Parkinson.  The Sponsor accepted that he married  the  Appellant  in
    Sri Lanka and lived together with her in Sri Lanka after their marriage
    before returning to the United Kingdom.  The  marriage  took  place  on
    26th October 2012 and the Sponsor spent just over a month in Sri Lanka.



18. The Sponsor had mentioned in his witness  statement  that  he  had  not
    returned to Sri Lanka to visit his wife because he did not think it was
    safe.  He explained to  Mr  Parkinson  that  at  night,  in  Sri  Lanka
    strangers call at houses and demand money.  The Sponsor confirmed  that
    he had travelled to Sri Lanka on his own passport.

The Respondent's Submissions

19. Mr  Parkinson  pointed  out  that  the  appeal  had  failed  under  the
    Immigration Rules because inadequate evidence  had  been  provided,  to
    prove that the Sponsor earned �18,600 per annum which was the  required
    minimum annual salary.

20. Mr Parkinson submitted that there  needed  to  be  a  good  reason  why
    Article 8 was to be considered outside the Immigration  Rules,  and  in
    this case he could see no such reason.  I was reminded that in relation
    to Article 8, there was no "near miss" principle

21. I was asked to attach significant weight to the fact that the financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules could not be satisfied, and  that
    this should be taken into account if I found Article 8  to  be  engaged
    and considered proportionality.  I was asked to  find  that  there  was
    nothing to stop the Sponsor returning to Sri Lanka and enjoying married
    life with the Appellant.

The Appellant's Submissions

22. Ms Walker pointed out that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  in
    not considering Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules, and  therefore
    Article  8  should  be  considered,  and  the  main  issue  related  to
    proportionality.

23. I was asked to accept that the Sponsor and  Appellant  had  established
    genuine family life and that refusal of entry clearance interfered with
    that family life.

24. Ms Walker accepted that section 117B of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) stated that maintenance of effective
    immigration controls is  in  the  public  interest.   I  was  asked  to
    consider whether refusal of entry clearance was proportionate given the
    circumstances of this case, and although the Appellant  had  failed  to
    meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules, I  was  asked
    to consider the  underlying  purpose  of  the  rules,  which  was  that
    adequate maintenance must be available  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    rules stated that the Sponsor must have an annual income  of  at  least
    �18,600, and I was asked to conclude that the Sponsor had this  income,
    even though the required evidence had not been submitted to prove it.

25. If I accepted that the Sponsor earned in excess of �18,600, then  there
    would be no need to refuse entry clearance  in  the  interests  of  the
    economic well-being of the United Kingdom.  I was referred to paragraph
    55 of Patel and Others  [2013]  UKSC  72  in  support  of  Ms  Walker's
    submission that it was not a "near miss" case, and it was  relevant  to
    consider the nature of the Appellant's failure to meet the rules.

26. I was asked to find that it would not be proportionate for the  Sponsor
    to return to Sri Lanka as he is settled in  this  country  and  has  an
    established life here.  Ms  Walker  submitted  that  the  issue  to  be
    decided was whether it would be proportionate for the Appellant to make
    a new application rather than be granted leave  to  enter  outside  the
    Immigration Rules in reliance upon Article 8.  I was  asked  to  accept
    that there is some uncertainty as to how  long  a  further  application
    would take bearing in mind the Sponsor's  difficulties  with  his  bank
    account.  He would have to  open  a  new  bank  account  and  it  would
    therefore take at least six months for his salary to be paid into  that
    account, and there would thereafter be a further period of  two  months
    (which is apparently the visa processing time in Sri  Lanka)  before  a
    decision would be made.  On that basis I was asked to find that refusal
    of entry clearance is disproportionate and the appeal should be allowed
    under Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

27. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

28. In considering Article 8 I have taken into account  all  the  evidence,
    both documentary and oral, that has been  placed  before  me.   I  have
    considered that evidence in the round.

29. In my view  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  I indicated this when setting aside the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The Appellant in this  appeal  would  not  be
    able to rely upon EX.1 and therefore the rules in this case are  not  a
    complete code.  I take into account the guidance given by the Court  of
    Appeal in paragraph 135 of MM  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  in  making  this
    decision.

30. I therefore consider Article 8 taking into account the  guidance  given
    by the House of Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 which indicates that the
    following questions should be considered;

    1.   Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority
         with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?

    2.   If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    3.   If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

    4.   If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society  in
         the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
         well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
         for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
         the rights and freedoms of others?

    5.   If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate public
         end sought to be achieved?

31. The decision in Beoku-Betts  [2008]  UKHL  39  means  that  I  have  to
    consider the family life of all members of the  family,  not  only  the
    Appellant.  In this case that means the family life of the  Sponsor  as
    well as the Appellant.

32. I conclude that Article 8 is engaged.  The Appellant  and  Sponsor  are
    married.   There  is  no  dispute  as  to  the  genuineness  of   their
    relationship.   Although  Razgar  related  to  a  removal  case,  I  am
    satisfied that the guidelines are appropriate when considering an entry
    clearance application.

33. I find that refusal of entry clearance is an interference  with  family
    life, with consequences  of  such  gravity  as  potentially  to  engage
    Article 8.

34. I find that the proposed interference with family life is in accordance
    with the  law  because  the  Appellant  cannot  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM which are necessary in order to be  granted
    entry clearance.

35. I conclude that the proposed interference is necessary in a  democratic
    society in the interests of maintaining effective immigration control.

36. The issue is whether the refusal of entry clearance  is  proportionate.
    I have taken into  account  paragraph  117B  of  the  2002  Act.   This
    confirms that maintenance of  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest.

37. The Appellant could not  satisfy  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules because the Sponsor's bank  statement  did  not  show
    payments of salary from both his employments into the account, and  the
    letter from one of his employers did not specify his annual salary.

38. I have to consider whether it is appropriate to disregard the fact that
    it  has  not  been  proved  that  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules can be satisfied, and allow this appeal under Article
    8.  It is clear that there is no  "near  miss"  principle,  and  as  Ms
    Walker drew my attention to Patel, I have considered the principles set
    out by the Supreme Court and set out below paragraphs 55 and 56 of that
    decision;
      1. Thus the balance  drawn  by  the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality. I said much  the  same  in  Rudi.
         Although I rejected the concept of a "near-miss principle",  I  did
         not see  this  as  inconsistent  with  the  Collins  J's  words  in
         Lekstaka:

             "Collins J's statement, on which the  court  relied  [in  SB],
             seems unexceptionable. It is saying no more,  as  I  read  it,
             than that the practical or compassionate considerations  which
             underlie the policy are also likely  to  be  relevant  to  the
             cases of those who fall just outside it, and  to  that  extent
             may add weight to their argument for exceptional treatment. He
             is not saying that there arises any presumption or expectation
             that the policy will  be  extended  to  embrace  them."  (para
             31(ii))

         (My reference to "exceptional treatment" needs to be  read  now  in
         the light of Huang para 20 in which Lord Bingham made  clear  that,
         contrary to previous  Court  of  Appeal  case  law,  there  was  no
         separate "test of exceptionality.")

      1.  Although  the  context  of  the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality, I agree with Burnton LJ that this
         cannot be equated with a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding  scale"
         principle, as argued for by Mr Malik. That approach is  unsupported
         by Strasbourg authority, or by a proper reading of  Lord  Bingham's
         words. Mrs Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the  rules
         did not turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317,
         but on the application of the family  values  which  underlie  that
         rule and are at the heart also of Article 8.  Conversely,  a  near-
         miss under the rules cannot provide substance  to  a  human  rights
         case which is otherwise lacking in merit.

39. I also remind myself of the first sentence of  paragraph  57  of  Patel
    which is set out below;

    57.  It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
    dispensing power.

40. In my view the Sponsor in this appeal has failed to prove  he  has  the
    required minimum annual salary of �18,600, because  he  has  failed  to
    provide the specified evidence which is mandatory.  It is said that the
    Sponsor still has employment and therefore a new application  could  be
    made by the  Appellant  but  Ms  Walker  submitted  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate to require this, as it would take six months  for  the
    Sponsor to establish a new bank  account,  and  a  further  two  months
    thereafter for the application to be processed.

41. I find no satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the Sponsor
    has decided not to open a new bank account,  given  that  his  previous
    account was  closed  as  long  ago  as  April  2013.   Even  if  a  new
    application would  take  eight  months,  I  do  not  find  this  to  be
    disproportionate.

42. I do not find that it is appropriate to disregard the lack of specified
    financial evidence which is required in order for entry clearance to be
    granted under the rules.  I set out below part of paragraph 16 of Huang
    [2007] UKHL 11;

    16.  The authority will wish to consider and weigh all  that  tells  in
         favour of the refusal of leave which is challenged, with particular
         reference to justification under  Article  8(2).   There  will,  in
         almost any case, be certain general considerations to bear in mind:
         the general administrative desirability of applying known rules  if
         a system of immigration control is  to  be  workable,  predictable,
         consistent and fair as  between  one  applicant  and  another;  the
         damage to good administration and effective control if a system  is
         perceived  by  applicants  internationally  to  be  unduly  porous,
         unpredictable or perfunctory;

43. Referring to paragraph 117B(iii) it states that it  is  in  the  public
    interest and in particular in the interests of the economic  well-being
    of the United Kingdom that persons seeking to  enter,  are  financially
    independent, I do not find, due to  the  lack  of  specified  financial
    evidence, that this has been proved in the Appellant's case.

44. I conclude that the weight to  be  given  to  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining effective immigration control outweighs the  weight  to  be
    given to the wish of the Appellant to be granted  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom, despite not meeting the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules.  The decision to refuse entry  clearance  is  proportionate  and
    does not breach Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and  was  set  aside.   I  substitute  a  fresh  decision  as
follows.

I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  There  was  no
application for anonymity before the Upper Tribunal, and no anonymity  order
is made.
