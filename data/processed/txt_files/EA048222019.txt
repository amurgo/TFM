                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 10  February  2020  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Bowler which dismissed the appellant's appeal
    against the respondent's decision of 29 August 2019 to  refuse  him  an
    EEA residence card as the extended family member of his brother.

 2. The appellant is a Nigerian national,  born  on  1  January  1964.  His
    immigration history is that he came to the UK on 12 November 2010  with
    leave to remain until 11 November 2012.  That leave was granted on  the
    basis of his employment at the Nigerian High Commission in London.   On
    8 August 2012, the appellant applied for an EEA residence card but this
    was refused on 14 February 2013. The  appellant  applied  on  the  same
    basis on 17 June 2019 leading to the refusal  of  29  August  2019  and
    these proceedings.

 3. The appellant's claim before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that  before
    coming to the UK he had been financially dependent on  his  brother,  a
    French national, and had also been a member of his brother's household.
    The appellant also maintained that he had been dependant on his brother
    throughout his time in the UK and was also a member  of  his  brother's
    household here.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept that the  appellant  could  show
    that he was dependent on his brother  or  a  member  of  his  brother's
    household either before or after he came to the UK.

 5. In paragraph 26 the judge found that the appellant could not be said to
    be have been living in his brother's household prior to coming  to  the
    UK. That finding is not challenged here.

 6. The judge also found that the appellant  had  not  shown  that  he  was
    dependent financially on his brother whilst  he  remained  in  Nigeria.
    The judge considered that the evidence of money  being  sent  from  the
    brother to the appellant in Nigeria was unclear; see paragraphs  28  to
    33. The judge therefore proceeded to assess it against the a  whole  in
    order to see if this could clarify the evidence  on  prior  dependence.
    The judge found that the evidence of  the  appellant  and  his  brother
    about dependence and membership of the brother's household  in  the  UK
    was not credible and undermined the evidence on prior dependency.

 7. There were a number of reasons that the judge reached this  conclusion.
    Firstly, the appellant's  evidence  was  that  he  had  worked  in  the
    Nigerian High Commission from 2010 to 2012 and then as  a  cleaner  for
    three months in 2012, stopping work in early  2013.   The  judge  found
    that this was not consistent with bank statements  in  the  appellant's
    bundle showing that as late as January 2014 the appellant continued  to
    receive payments which appeared to be earnings from work; see paragraph
    35 of the decision.

 8. Secondly, the appellant's brother maintained that only he had supported
    the appellant in the UK. This was not consistent with  the  appellant's
    bank  accounts  which  showed  significant  amounts  of   money   being
    transferred to the appellant from someone in Nigeria from January  2014
    until March 2015.  As the  judge  sets  out  in  paragraph  36  of  the
    decision, these were large amounts of between �300 and over �1,200.

 9. The judge concluded in paragraph 37  that  the  evidence  of  both  the
    appellant and his brother on the appellant's finances in the UK was not
    consistent with the documentary evidence.

10. The grounds of appeal maintain that the  judge  failed  to  assess  the
    evidence on financial support from the appellant's brother  in  the  UK
    correctly. The grounds do not dispute, however,  that  the  appellant's
    bank accounts show earnings at a time when the appellant's evidence was
    that he was not working. They do not dispute  that  the  bank  accounts
    show income from Nigeria at a time when the appellant and  his  brother
    maintain he was only supported by the brother. The  judge  was  clearly
    entitled to find that the evidence was inconsistent and draw an adverse
    credibility finding The ground arguing that the judge failed to make  a
    proper assessment of how much money the appellant  was  receiving  from
    these different sources is without merit. Such an  assessment  was  not
    required where the evidence on the appellant's financial situation  was
    unreliable.

11. In paragraphs 38 to 40 the First-tier Tribunal found that the  evidence
    of the appellant and  his  brother  on  the  appellant  living  in  the
    brother's household in the UK was also not consistent. The  appellant's
    evidence, recorded in paragraph 38 and set out in his witness statement
    in paragraph 6, was that he lived with  his  brother  from  2012  until
    2015.  He then went to live with  a  partner  and  moved  back  to  his
    brother's home in 2019.

12. The brother's oral evidence, recorded by the judge in paragraph 38, was
    that the appellant "only started to live with him last  year  and  that
    previously he would simply visit".  The brother's witness statement set
    out:

         "7.  When Emma arrived in the UK in November 2010, he  was  staying
             at the Nigerian High Commission but would come and  stay  with
             me as and when.  I have been providing financial assistance to
             Emma since his arrival in the UK and he has  continued  living
             with me since last year"

    and:

         "9.  I confirm that I provided Emma with financial  support  before
             he entered the UK, that before I left Nigeria  he  was  living
             with me, and that he has resided with me since last  year  and
             that I have been financially supporting him."

13. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bowler  found  in  paragraph  39  that  these
    accounts were inconsistent, amounting to a "significant difference, not
    one of detail".  The appellant's account was of cohabitation  in  2012-
    2014  and  from  2019  onwards.  The  brother's  evidence  referred  to
    cohabitation since 2019.

14. The grounds maintain that the judge misread the evidence  when  finding
    an inconsistency in the evidence of the appellant and  his  brother  on
    when they lived  together.  The  statement  of  the  brother  that  the
    appellant "has continued living with me since  last  year"  should  not
    have been interpreted as meaning that cohabitation had only started  in
    2019. It should have  been  understood  as  meaning  that  cohabitation
    recommenced in 2018 after the earlier period of  living  together  from
    2012 to 2015.  The statement that the appellant "has  continued  living
    with me since last year" was  not  inconsistent  with  the  appellant's
    evidence.

15.  The  grounds  also  maintained  that  even  had  there  had  been   an
    inconsistency, the First-tier Tribunal should have put the point to the
    appellant and his brother so that they had an  opportunity  to  address
    it.

16. It is not my  judgment  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  the
    assessment of the evidence of the appellant and  his  brother  on  when
    they lived together in the UK. The judge had the benefit  of  the  oral
    evidence of the  appellant  and  his  brother.  The  brother's  witness
    statement indicated that the appellant had lived with him  since  "last
    year" and "that previously he  would  simply  visit".   The  judge  was
    entitled to find that this evidence was not consistent with that of the
    appellant who referred to cohabitation from 2012 to 2015.

17. The appellant maintains that an unfairness arose where  the  point  was
    not one that was raised specifically in the respondent's decision or by
    the HOPO at  the  hearing  and  that  he  should  have  been  given  an
    opportunity to address the judge's concerns. However, the  question  of
    whether the appellant was a member of his brother's household in the UK
    was clearly one of the  issues  that  the  parties  knew  they  had  to
    address; see paragraph 18 for example, setting out the submissions made
    for the appellant at the First-tier Tribunal  hearing  which  refer  to
    this point. There is no requirement for a judge to  put  all  potential
    inconsistencies that arise from the evidence to an  appellant.  If,  as
    here, an appellant is represented by specialist  immigration  advisors,
    those advisors can be expected  to  deal  with  any  potential  adverse
    inferences that arise, in re-examination and  in  submissions.  In  the
    context of this appeal, the First-tier Tribunal  was  not  required  to
    highlight the inconsistency and seek further evidence or submissions on
    the point.

18. For these reasons, I did not find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in
    finding  that  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  and  his  brother  on
    cohabitation in the UK was inconsistent. The judge was entitled to find
    that this evidence undermined the claim that  the  appellant  had  been
    dependent on his brother prior to coming to the UK. The judge was  also
    entitled to find the appellant's claim to have been dependent whilst in
    Nigeria was undermined by the inconsistent evidence  on  his  financial
    situation in the UK and the inconsistent evidence on cohabitation.

19. For these reasons I do not find that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal discloses an error on a point of law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not  disclose  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
