                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. FP (Return - Cabinda - Non-Luandan)  Angola  CG  [2003]  UKIAT  00204  no
   longer provides an accurate assessment of country conditions.  It  ceases
   to be country guidance.

2. There is significant evidence of human rights  abuses,  including  within
   Cabinda  and  affecting  Cabindans,  problems  of  arbitrary  arrest  and
   detention,  ill-treatment   in   detention,   poor   prison   conditions,
   restrictions on freedom of expression, government action against  protest
   and limitations in the legal system and security  laws.   However,  these
   problems do not render all those returning to Angola or Cabinda to be  at
   risk of serious harm, whether or not they are Cabindans.

3. Unless there exists a situation in which there  is  generalised  violence
   or armed conflict at a very high level (which is not the  case  here)  in
   order to establish a real risk of harm, an individual  has  to  establish
   that, by reason of circumstances as  they  relate  to  him,  there  is  a
   reasonable likelihood he will come into contact with the authorities in a
   way that will result in his detention.

4. The Angolan authorities do not equate  being  a  Cabindan  with  being  a
   member of or supporter of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave  of
   Cabinda (FLEC).

5. The evidence fails to establish that FLEC currently operates at  a  level
   such as to represent a real threat to the  Angolan  authorities  although
   they are keen to take measures to ensure that there is no  resurgence  of
   its activities. Nor does the evidence establish that  FLEC  reflects  the
   views and aspirations of a majority  of  Cabindans,  notwithstanding  the
   fact that the Cabindan sense of social identity remains very  strong  and
   separation from Angola remains an aspiration shared by many.  The Angolan
   authorities readily understand the distinction between FLEC membership or
   support and Cabindan self-assertion.

6. There is clear evidence of normal security checks at airports,  including
   Luanda airport on arrival.  Those checks are likely to  be  thorough  and
   directed towards establishing the identity of  the  person  entering  the
   country.

7. There are no obstacles in a returnee to Luanda airport making  an  onward
   journey to Cabinda. The finding in FP that travel to Cabinda from  Luanda
   is excluded as a practical possibility is no longer correct.

8. Language is a distinctive method of identification but identification  as
   a Cabindan is not sufficient to establish a real risk.

9. A person of Cabindan origin returning to Angola will not  in  general  be
   at real risk of ill-treatment by reason of his or  her  Cabindan  origin.
   Such a person is reasonably likely to be detained (with the  accompanying
   risk of ill-treatment) only  if  he  or  she  has  a  history  of  active
   involvement with FLEC (or one of its factions, such as FLEC-PM  or  FLEC-
   FAC).  Excluded from those at risk are  individuals  formerly  associated
   with the pro-government FLEC-Renewal (FLEC-Renovada) or Antonio Bembe.

10. A person's Cabindan origin will  not,  in  general,  preclude  him  from
   living or working in Luanda or some other part of Angola.


Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Angola and comes from the  exclave  of
       Cabinda[1], formerly Portuguese Congo. Cabinda is separated from the
       rest of Angola by a narrow  strip  of  territory  belonging  to  the
       Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is,  therefore,  geographically
       separate from the rest of Angola,  bordered  to  the  north  by  the
       Republic of the Congo and to the west  by  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  It
       covers a little over 3000 square miles. The Treaty of Simulambuco of
       1885 created Cabinda as a  protectorate  of  the  Portuguese  Crown.
       Cabinda was, however, treated as a district of Angola and, in  1975,
       was reconfirmed as part of Angola, although geographically distinct.
       It is unsurprising that ethnically and linguistically the  Cabindans
       are distinct from the remainder of Angolans. These distinctions  led
       to low intensity guerrilla warfare in the 1970s and  1980s  until  a
       peace agreement was brokered in  July  2006  when  a  ceasefire  was
       negotiated by a group purporting to  represent  the  Front  for  the
       Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) although a  faction  (or
       factions) of FLEC continues  to  maintain  that  the  agreement  was
       effected without their authority or mandate.

The population of Cabinda


    2. According to the COI report for Angola dated 1 September  2010  (the
       last such report to have been produced  by  the  Home  Office),  the
       population of Cabinda stands at around  300,000  indigenous  people,
       although out of this number only one third live in the territory  of
       Cabinda. The other two thirds inhabit the  surrounding  areas  in  a
       generally stable state on Congolese  and  Zairian  territory.  This,
       perhaps, accounts for the significant differences that exist in  the
       background material as to the population of Cabinda.

Immigration history

    3. The appellant was born on 20 November 1987. He arrived in the United
       Kingdom in November 2010 avoiding immigration controls. He was  then
       aged 23. He was arrested  on  29  November  2010  under  immigration
       powers and a decision was made on 8 December 2010 to remove  him  as
       an illegal entrant. He claimed asylum on 14 December 2010 which  was
       subsequently refused on 11 January 2011.

    4. His appeal against the removal decision was heard by  Judge  Handley
       on 7 March 2011. The appellant claimed that when he was five or  six
       years old his parents had been arrested and killed  by  the  Angolan
       army because of their involvement with FLEC. He said that, following
       their deaths, his uncle took him to the DRC where  he  grew  up  and
       attended school. He claimed that his uncle was a leader of FLEC  and
       that he assisted his uncle until he was arrested by  the  DRC  Army.
       Eventually he was taken to the Cabinda border where he was  arrested
       by the Angolan army.  He was detained, interrogated and ill-treated.
       The appellant said that his uncle then arranged for his  release  in
       November 2010 at which point he travelled  to  the  United  Kingdom.
       Although the respondent accepted that the appellant was  an  Angolan
       national from Cabinda, she rejected his account  of  involvement  in
       FLEC and decided the appellant  could  therefore  return  to  either
       Angola or Cabinda.


The preserved findings of fact

    5. Judge Handley, having considered the evidence,  concluded  that  the
       appellant was not a member of  FLEC.   Nor  had  he  been  detained,
       tortured or escaped  as  he  had  claimed.  He  concluded  that  the
       appellant would be returned to Luanda and that it  was  likely  that
       the appellant would be able to fly from  there  to  Cabinda,  if  he
       chose to do so.

The error on a point of  law  and  setting  aside  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge's determination

    6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the  basis
       that it was arguable that Judge Handley had failed to apply what was
       the current Country Guidance contained in FP (Return - Cabinda - Non-
       Luandan) Angola CG [2003]  UKIAT  00204.   At  the  hearing  of  the
       appeal, Judge J.M. Holmes sitting as a Deputy  Judge  of  the  Upper
       Tribunal decided that there was an error of  law.  The  findings  of
       fact we have set above were not disturbed.   His  decision  will  be
       found as appendix 1 to this determination. On  the  basis  of  those
       findings we set aside the decision of Judge Handley and re-make  the
       decision.

FP (Return - Cabinda - Non-Luandan)

    7. In July 2003, a panel of the IAT chaired by its  President,  Ouseley
       J, decided FP (Return -  Cabinda  -  Non-Luandan)  Angola.   FP,  an
       Angolan national born in Cabinda, had left Cabinda in June 2001. The
       Adjudicator concluded that FP had been a member of FLEC in 1999  and
       that his father had also been a member of FLEC and had been  killed.
       However, he was not satisfied  that  FP  had  left  Angola  for  the
       reasons he claimed but concluded he could safely return  to  Cabinda
       because he would neither suffer any problems from  members  of  FLEC
       nor from the Angolan authorities at whose hands he had  suffered  no
       ill-treatment in the past.

    8. The removal directions were set to Angola  itself  and  not  to  the
       Cabinda enclave and would be effected by return to Luanda.   FP  was
       not from Luanda and did not speak Portuguese, the language  normally
       spoken in Angola.  He spoke only French and Kikongo.  He claimed the
       Angolan authorities at Luanda Airport would recognise that  he  came
       from Cabinda where the conflict between the  independence  movements
       and the Angolan government had flared up.  It was said  that,  as  a
       member of FLEC, he would  be  at  risk  of  being  identified  as  a
       Cabindan supporter of FLEC, and therefore at risk of torture.

    9. The Tribunal heard evidence that,  whilst  the  Cabindan  separatist
       struggle was being played out in Cabinda, the  rest  of  Angola  had
       recently been involved in a lengthy civil war between the  two  main
       political factions, the  Popular  Movement  for  the  Liberation  of
       Angola (MPLA), the political party that has ruled Angola  since  the
       country's independence from Portugal in 1975 and the National  Union
       for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Even if  FP  were  not
       regarded as a FLEC supporter, the objective evidence showed that the
       only people who could be returned to Angola were those who had  come
       from Luanda and had connections there, because of the conditions  of
       life in Luanda as the war between the Angolan government  and  UNITA
       had only recently ended. A peace  accord  between  the  two  warring
       factions was signed in  April  2002,  the  demobilisation  of  UNITA
       rebels had been completed by the end  of  July  2002  and  a  formal
       agreement on the timescale for  discussions  on  reconciliation  and
       reintegration of UNITA supporters reached in September 2002.


   10. The aftermath of the  civil  war  had  resulted  in  a  humanitarian
       crisis.  The general conditions of  life  in  Luanda  reflected  the
       extent of internal displacement caused by the civil war.  31% of the
       population, some 4.3 million, were estimated to have been internally
       displaced with some 435,000 having fled to  neighbouring  countries.
       Luanda's population itself had swollen  to  many  times  its  normal
       size; some 500,000 war-displaced people were then living in 20 camps
       in the Luanda area.  In July 2002, the  UN's  emergency  relief  co-
       ordinator had described the  humanitarian  situation  in  Luanda  as
       critical.  The Tribunal in FP described conditions for many there as
       'wretched'.  It was only possible to remove people to Luanda and the
       UK government had agreed, in consultation with UNHCR,

         that nobody should be returned to Angola  who  has  not  previously
         lived in Luanda or who does  not  have  close  current  connections
         there.

   11. Whilst the Respondent  pointed  out  correctly  that  there  was  no
       evidence that Cabindans as such were  persecuted  or  treated  worse
       than any other group, the Secretary of State stated that the  policy
       on return, which drew upon UNHCR advice, was related to the need for
       careful phasing of returns to Luanda  because  of  the  overload  of
       displaced persons there but was not a concession that conditions  in
       Luanda amounted to the level of  ill-treatment  which  would  breach
       Article 3 ECHR.


   12.  Travel  to  Cabinda  from  Luanda  was  excluded  as  a   practical
       possibility, resulting in returnees  being  required  to  remain  in
       Luanda in the critical conditions then existing.  The  October  2002
       CIPU Report showed how difficult internal movement  in  Angola  then
       was: even if the illegal roadblocks, checkpoints,  and  hatreds  had
       diminished, landmines remained  a  prevalent  hindrance  to  travel.
       None of the background  evidence  dealt  with  the  availability  of
       shipping between Luanda  and  Cabinda  to  civilians.   An  overland
       journey was effectively ruled out.

   13. The panel identified the real issue as being how the authorities  in
       Luanda might view the appellant upon arrival in  Luanda,  given  the
       Angolan authorities' view  of  the  separatist  aspirations  of  the
       Cabindan people.

   14. IRIN news reports of December 2002 and January 2003  suggested  that
       the Angolan army was attacking  civilians  in  Cabinda  and  abusing
       their rights, as well as seriously ill-treating former UNITA  rebels
       held in camps.  The situation in Cabinda was supported by an Amnesty
       International report of 13 December 2002  which  detailed  arbitrary
       arrests of civilians and spoke  of  an  upsurge  in  fighting,  with
       attacks  on  civilians,  arrests,  and  rapes.   FLEC  factions  had
       responded in kind.  The panel gloomily sought to predict  what  this
       might bring:

         It may be that the developing peace with UNITA has freed the  hands
         of the Angolan government and army to deal  with  the  independence
         movement in Cabinda, so as to reinforce its control over  the  oil-
         rich enclave.

   15. These considerations informed the approach likely to be  adopted  by
       the Angolan authorities.  The authorities were  well  aware  of  the
       pressures which had led to emigration and the fact of being a failed
       asylum seeker,  if  discovered,  would  not  be  of  any  particular
       interest.  However, controls at Luanda  Airport  were  thorough  and
       Angolans who had been deported from abroad or who lived  abroad  for
       many years, would be questioned by immigration  and  police  at  the
       airport with a view to establishing  their  identities  and  whether
       they were of interest to the authorities for political  or  criminal
       reasons.  Once in detention, prison conditions constituted a serious
       threat  to  the  health  and  lives  of  prisoners.   The   Tribunal
       continued:

         24. The background evidence also shows that he would be  identified
         as someone from Cabinda, both because of  the  languages  which  he
         does speak and because of his lack  of  Portuguese.   He  would  be
         questioned to see if he was of political or criminal interest:  his
         Cabindan origin, with the current upsurge in fighting  in  Cabinda,
         would make that inevitable.   Although  it  is  only  realistic  to
         suppose that he would not reveal his FLEC  membership  voluntarily,
         he would have to have a story to explain his departure from Cabinda
         and return to Luanda which would stand up to thorough and at  least
         suspicious, if not downright hostile,  questioning.   There  is  an
         unknown degree of risk  that  the  Angolan  authorities  have  some
         knowledge  of  individuals,  perhaps  of  families,  who  are  FLEC
         members.  There is a risk that, even without such  knowledge,  they
         would suppose him to be a FLEC supporter.
         25. The abuse of  the  human  rights  of  those  suspected  of  the
         political support for  a  warring  independence  movement  is  very
         probable, whether through the general prison conditions in which  a
         suspect might be detained or  the  more  active  brutal  attentions
         which he might attract.
         26. His lack of  Portuguese  and  other  local  connections  in  an
         overcrowded city would mark him out as a Cabindan  and  mean  that,
         even if he passed successfully through the airport, he would be  at
         a rather greater risk than most Angolans of  again  attracting  the
         attentions of the authorities or of  being  unable  to  seek  their
         assistance in the difficult living conditions,  for  fear  of  what
         they might ask.  This risk  would  endure  until  the  position  in
         Cabinda had been resolved.

   16. In order to avoid increasing the already large number of  internally
       displaced persons already there, the Tribunal concluded that  failed
       asylum seekers could be returned to Luanda if  they  had  come  from
       there or had connections there.  UNHCR  did  not  suggest  that  the
       return of people to Luanda would breach their Article  3  rights  if
       they came from Luanda or had relatives there and would only do so if
       they did not.  The  panel  recognised  the  Angolan  government  was
       struggling to improve conditions.


   17. Pausing there, it is as well to summarise the conclusions reached by
       the IAT in FP.  Both FP and his father were members of FLEC and  his
       father had been killed by the  Angolan  authorities.   It  was  said
       that, as a member of FLEC, he would be at risk of  being  identified
       as a Cabindan supporter of FLEC, and therefore at risk  of  torture.
       There was 'an unknown degree of risk' that the  Angolan  authorities
       have some knowledge of individuals, perhaps  of  families,  who  are
       FLEC members.  There was a risk they would suppose a Cabindan was  a
       member  of  FLEC.   There  were  'very  probable'  suspicions   that
       Cabindans offered political support  for  the  warring  independence
       movement. The Tribunal went further.  Regardless of suspicions about
       Cabindans being  supporters  of  FLEC,  a  returnee  to  Angola  was
       effectively marooned in Luanda and the humanitarian  crisis  was  so
       severe there that, as a matter  of  policy,  failed  asylum  seekers
       should only be returned to Luanda if they had come from there or had
       connections there.  That result was not a concession  that  Cabindan
       returnees were at risk of persecution or Article 3 harm but was  the
       result of a policy by the UK government, in consultation with UNHCR,
       that nobody should be returned to  Angola  who  had  not  previously
       lived in Luanda or who did not have close current connections there.
        We note that the IAT's assessment was made a decade ago when Angola
       was beginning the long process of recovery from a destructive  civil
       war.

The status of Country Guidance

   18. This brings us  to  consider  the  status  of  Country  Guidance  as
       reflected in the President's Guidance Note 2011 No  2  issued  under
       paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement
       Act 2007. It was amended in February 2012 and September 2013:

         10. ... In the absence of a starred case the common law doctrine of
         judicial precedent shall not apply and decisions of the AIT and one
         constitution of the Chamber do not as a matter of  law  bind  later
         constitutions. Judges of the First-tier  Tribunal  Immigration  and
         Asylum Chamber are, however, expected to follow the law set out  in
         reported cases, unless persuaded that the decision failed  to  take
         into account an  applicable  legislative  provision  or  a  binding
         decision of a superior court.


         11. Special arrangements are made  for  the  reporting  of  country
         guidance cases. Before a case is promulgated and  designated  as  a
         Country Guidance case it is  considered  by  the  relevant  country
         convener and the Reporting Committee and advice may be tendered  to
         the determining judges. Practice Direction 12.2 states:


         "A reported determination of the  Tribunal,  the  AIT  or  the  IAT
         bearing the letters CG shall be treated as authoritative finding on
         the country guidance issue identified in the  determination,  based
         on the evidence before the members  of  Tribunal....that  determine
         the appeal. As a result, unless it has been expressly superseded or
         replaced by any later CG determination,  or  is  inconsistent  with
         other authority that is binding on the  Tribunal,  such  a  country
         guidance case is authoritative in any subsequent appeal, so far  as
         that appeal:-
             a) relates to the country guidance issue in question; and
             b) depends upon the same or similar evidence".


         If there is credible fresh evidence relevant to the issue that  has
         not  been  considered  in  the  Country  Guidance  case  or,  if  a
         subsequent  case  includes  further  issues  that  have  not   been
         considered in the CG case, the judge  will  reach  the  appropriate
         conclusion on the evidence, taking into account the  conclusion  in
         the CG case so far as it remains relevant.


         12. Country Guidance cases will remain as such on the  Chamber  web
         site unless  and  until  replaced  by  fresh  Country  Guidance  or
         reversed by a decision of a higher court.  Where  Country  Guidance
         has become outdated by reason of developments  in  the  country  in
         question, it is anticipated that a judge of the First-tier Tribunal
         will have such credible fresh evidence as envisaged in paragraph 11
         above.

   19. In NM and Others (Lone women  -  Ashraf)  Somalia  CG  [2005]  UKIAT
       00076, Ouseley J (President), Storey and Risius (VPP)  the  Tribunal
       said;

      140. These decisions are now denoted as "CG".  They  are  not  starred
           decisions.  Those latter  are  decisions  which  are  binding  on
           points of law.  The requirement  to  apply  CG  cases  is  rather
           different:  they should be applied except where they do not apply
           to the particular facts which  an  Adjudicator  or  the  Tribunal
           faces and can properly be held inapplicable for legally  adequate
           reasons;  there may be evidence that circumstances  have  changed
           in a material way which requires a different decision,  again  on
           the basis that proper reasons for that view are given;  there may
           be significant new evidence which shows that the views originally
           expressed  require consideration for revision or refinement, even
           without any material change in circumstances.  It may be that the
           passage  of  time  itself  or  substantial  new  evidence  itself
           warrants a  re-examination  of  the  position,  even  though  the
           outcome may be unchanged.  It  is  a  misunderstanding  of  their
           nature, therefore, to see these cases as  equivalent  to  starred
           cases.  The system does not have  the  rigidity  of  the  legally
           binding precedent but has instead the flexibility to  accommodate
           individual  cases,  changes,  fresh  evidence   and   the   other
           circumstances which we have set out.

The political situation

   20. The People's  Movement  for  the  Liberation  of  Angola  (Movimento
       Popular de Liberta��o de Angola, MPLA) led by President  dos  Santos
       has been in power in Angola since independence in 1975. According to
       the US State Department  report  on  Human  Rights  Practices  2013,
       published on 27 February 2014 the MPLA exercise  tight,  centralised
       control over government planning, policy making and  media  outlets.
       There were national elections on 31 August, which  were  the  second
       elections since 1992 and the third since independence in 1975.   The
       August 2012 elections were described by the US State  Department  as
       the first fully constituted presidential and  legislative  elections
       in the country's history.


   21. According to Amnesty International Report  on  Angola  2013,  a  new
       political party, the Broad Convergence for the Salvation of  Angola-
       Electoral Coalition  (Converg�ncia  Ampla  de  Salva��o  de  Angola-
       Coliga��o Eleitoral, CASA-CE), was registered by the  Constitutional
       Court in April 2012 enabling CASA-CE to take part  in  the  national
       elections on 31 August 2012. Prior  to  the  elections,  there  were
       reports of sporadic political violence by members of the ruling MPLA
       against the National Union for  the  Total  Independence  of  Angola
       (Uni�o Nacional para a Independ�ncia Total de Angola, UNITA),  CASA-
       CE and other political parties, as well as of  UNITA  against  MPLA.
       The MPLA won with almost  72%  of  votes,  with  about  40%  of  the
       population  abstaining   from   voting.   Although   a   number   of
       irregularities were registered prior  to  the  elections,  observers
       judged the elections as free and fair. The results  were  officially
       contested by UNITA, CASA-CE and the Social Renewal Party (PRS),  but
       the challenges were  rejected  as  unfounded  by  Angola's  National
       Electoral Committee (CNE).

   22.  The  US  State  Department  report  2013  speaks  of  domestic  and
       international  observers  reporting  that  polling  throughout   the
       country was  peaceful  and  largely  well  organised  but  observers
       highlighted the effect of the ruling party's control  of  media  and
       other resources.

   23. Bertelsmann  Stiftung  Transformation  Index  (BTI)  2014  -  Angola
       Country Report, 1 January 2014, describes  itself  as  covering  the
       period 31 January 2011 to 31 January 2013. The  index  assesses  the
       transformation towards democracy and the market economy, as well  as
       the  quality  of  political  management,  in  129  countries.    The
       Bertelsmann Index stated that civil rights violations  increased  in
       the run-up to the 2012  elections,  when  anti-government  activists
       were arbitrarily detained,  beaten,  subject  to  interrogation  and
       sentenced to jail.  One month before the August 2012  elections  and
       up until a  few  months  afterward,  protests  dwindled.   Political
       activists  attributed  this  to  the  disappearance  of  many  anti-
       government protesters ahead of the elections.

   24. The same organisation, this time in its 2012 report, had  spoken  on
       these events in these terms:

         However in the months before the 2012  general  elections,  several
         leading youth activists disappeared and policing intensified. After
         mounting  tension,  the  election  itself  was  anticlimactic;  the
         contest was quiet, and was marked by widespread  voter  abstention.
         Some interpreted this abstention as voter apathy, and an expression
         of popular distrust in democratic mechanisms as able to  break  the
         dominance of the MPLA. Yet many people complained  that  they  were
         unable to vote, as their names did not show up on the  voter  rolls
         where they had registered. The MPLA took 71.84% of the popular vote
         (10% less than in 2008), mainly thanks to the rural vote where  the
         spectre of a return to war helped to influence  voters.  Government
         and  public  media  immediately  interpreted  this  victory  as   a
         plebiscite in favour of the continued rule of Dos Santos,  who  was
         elected for another five-year mandate. Opposition  complaints  over
         electoral fraud were dismissed by the National Electoral Commission
         and the Constitutional Court. Nevertheless, UNITA doubled its share
         of votes from 2008 to 18.66% and CASA-CE captured 6% of  the  vote,
         giving the  new  party  eight  seats  in  the  220-strong  National
         Assembly.


   25. According to Amnesty International's  Annual  Report:  Angola  2011,
       parliament  approved  a  new  Constitution  in  January  2010  which
       provided for the President to be elected by parliament, rather  than
       by the electorate.  The  Constitution  also  allowed  President  dos
       Santos, who had then been in office for over 30 years, to serve  two
       more five-year terms. In addition, it replaced  the  Prime  Minister
       with  a  Vice-President  selected  by  the  President,   a   further
       consolidation of power into the President's hands.

Angola generally - Human Rights Abuses


   26. The Amnesty International Report on  Angola  2013  stated  that,  in
       general, the  authorities  maintained  effective  control  over  the
       security forces but the security forces were guilty of human  rights
       abuses. According to  a  State  Department  report  the  three  most
       important human rights abuses were


            (i)    cruel,  excessive  and  degrading  punishment  including
            reported cases of torture and  beatings  as  well  as  unlawful
            killings by police and other security personnel;
            (ii)  limits on freedoms of assembly  and  association,  speech
            and press; and
            (iii) official corruption and impunity.

   27. Other human rights abuses included arbitrary or unlawful deprivation
       of life; harsh and potentially life-threatening  prison  conditions;
       arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  lengthy   pre-trial   detention;
       impunity for human rights abusers; lack of due process and  judicial
       inefficiency.  Although  the  government  took  limited   steps   to
       prosecute or punish officials who committed  abuses,  accountability
       was weak due to a lack of  checks  and  balances  and  institutional
       capacity in the context of a  culture  of  impunity  and  widespread
       government corruption.

Arbitrary arrest and detention

   28. The US State Department Report 2013  said  that  the  law  prohibits
       arbitrary arrest and detention; however, security forces  often  did
       not respect these prohibitions.  A domestic NGO reported that police
       throughout the country were abusive.


   29. On 29 April 2013, the UN Office of the High Commissioner  for  Human
       Rights (OHCHR),  'expressed concern' (in the diplomatic language  of
       its Committee) at reports of torture and ill-treatment or  excessive
       use of force by the police or security  forces  during  arrests,  in
       police stations, during interrogation as well as in other  detention
       facilities. It was further concerned that there  is  no  independent
       complaints  authority  to  deal  with  such  complaints  which   are
       currently only dealt with by a police force investigator.

   30. OHCHR in the same  report  (paragraph  14)  was  also  concerned  by
       reports  of  arbitrary  and  extrajudicial  killings  by  government
       security forces, in particular those which occurred in the  province
       of Huambo in 2010, as well as during the counter-insurgency  against
       FLEC in 2010. The Committee expressed further concern at reports  of
       cases of disappearances  of  protesters  which  occurred  in  Luanda
       between 2011 and  2012;  the  lack  of  concrete  and  comprehensive
       information  on  investigations,   prosecutions,   convictions   and
       sanctions imposed on those responsible and at the reported  impunity
       of security forces involved in such human rights violations.

   31. In a Freedom House report, Countries at the Crossroads 2011: Angola,
       4  November  2011,  it  was  said  that  police  behaviour  remained
       problematic across the country. Although reform enacted in 2003  was
       meant to modernise police structures and bolster respect  for  human
       rights, new mechanisms established to provide redress  for  citizens
       whose rights had been violated were largely ineffective and  offered
       little support to victims. A human rights ombudsman was appointed in
       2005 as part of a  national  justice  reform  programme,  but  human
       rights complaints were often subject to political pressure.

Prison conditions

   32. Amnesty International in its 2013 report spoke of prison  conditions
       being potentially harsh and life-threatening and domestic  NGOs  and
       media continue to  highlight  corruption,  overcrowding  and  deaths
       possibly resulting from poor conditions.  The  US  State  Department
       Report for 2013 referred to a 2012 Human Rights Watch  (HRW)  report
       which found that prison guards committed  abuses,  including  sexual
       violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of migrants, often  acting
       with the complicity of different security services.


   33. While noting efforts  implemented  by  the  State  Party  to  reduce
       overcrowding and improve  conditions  of  detention,  OHCHR  in  its
       report of 29 April 2013, paragraph 19,  remained  concerned  at  the
       inadequate  conditions  of  detention  and  the   limited   use   of
       alternatives to detentions, such as bail or release on  parole.  The
       Committee was further concerned that in some prisons, separation  of
       minors from adults was not always guaranteed. OHCHR 'regretted'  the
       lack of information on mechanisms set up  in  prison  facilities  to
       receive and address complaints lodged by detainees.


Freedom of expression

   34. The US State Department Report 2013 referred to there being  reports
       of  police  or  military  presence  at   community   meetings   with
       international  NGOs,  especially  in  Cabinda.  One  civil   society
       organisation, formerly based in Cabinda, Mpalabanda, had been banned
       but the Supreme Court was considering the lawfulness of  the  order.
       By the end of 2012 the Supreme Court had not responded to a petition
       to re-examine the ban.


   35. On 27 October 2012, according to  Amnesty  International  Report  on
       Angola 2013,  Media  Investe,  the  company  that  owns  the  weekly
       newspaper  Seman�rio  Angolense,  censored  one  edition  reportedly
       because it contained a speech on the state of the  nation  by  UNITA
       leader  Isa�as  Samakuva  which  was  critical  of  the  government.
       Although printed versions of the newspaper were  burned,  an  online
       version was circulated.

Action against protest

   36. A further Human Rights Watch Report "Angola: crackdown on opposition
       protest" 27 November 2013 highlighted the killing of  an  opposition
       activist by presidential guards  in  Luanda  in  November  2013.  At
       almost the same time the Interior Ministry banned  a  UNITA  protest
       calling for justice for two protest organisers who had been abducted
       in May 2012 and whose deaths were attributed by  a  leaked  internal
       government report to the activities of the Angolan security  forces.
       On the day of the protest, police arrested  hundreds  of  opposition
       activists. The report claimed that  since  March  2011  the  Angolan
       authorities had repeatedly  used  unnecessary  and  excessive  force
       against organisers and participants and observers of anti-government
       protests.


   37. The Amnesty International Report on Angola 2013 spoke of the  police
       and security forces' continued use  of  excessive  force,  including
       against peaceful demonstrators, as well as  carrying  out  arbitrary
       arrests  and  detentions.  Freedom  of   assembly   was   suppressed
       throughout  the  country.  Two  people  were  feared  to  have  been
       subjected to  enforced  disappearance.  Freedom  of  expression  was
       restricted and the press was censored.

Legal system and the judiciary

   38. In paragraph 20 of the OHCHR of 29 April 2013, the Committee  voiced
       its 'concern' at the  reported  lack  of  independence  as  well  as
       corruption of the judiciary, and the insufficient number of  judges,
       lawyers,  tribunals  and  courts,  all   of   which   might   create
       difficulties regarding access to justice. The Committee was  further
       concerned at the prohibitive cost of legal fees, which might prevent
       some citizens, in particular disadvantaged persons and those  living
       in rural areas, from accessing justice.

   39. Human Rights Watch, '"They Put Me in the Hole": Military  Detention,
       Torture, and Lack of Due Process in Cabinda', 22 June 2009  referred
       to  38  detainees  who  were  eventually  brought  to  the  judicial
       authorities and a civilian detention  facility  but  some  of  whose
       trial  records  demonstrated  that  due  process  rights  had   been
       violated. All 38 detainees were initially held in  military  custody
       for long periods-from 26 days to six months-before being transferred
       to the civilian prison at Yabi in Cabinda and brought either  before
       a prosecutor or to be formally charged or before  a  judge.  At  the
       time of the 2009 report, two trials had taken place, as a result  of
       which seven persons had been convicted but four were acquitted.


   40. According to a 2008 United Nations High  Commissioner  for  Refugees
       (UNHCR) report, the five-day time limit for the detained to see  the
       public prosecutor is rarely adhered  to;  police  investigators  are
       allowed to interrogate detainees despite  the  law  that  decrees  a
       prosecutor must do it; and because of a  shortage  of  legal  staff,
       "the right to access to a  lawyer  and  a  corresponding  legal  aid
       system as guaranteed by the Constitution exists only in theory." The
       report concludes that there is "no effective system in  place  which
       can prevent arbitrary detention from occurring", see Freedom  House,
       Countries at the Crossroads 2011: Angola, 4 November 2011

   41. According to the  Bertelsmann  Transformation  Index  2014,  in  the
       provinces, the situation is generally worse, as the  population  has
       less means of redress through the courts or through public scrutiny.
       This  is  especially  the  case  in  Cabinda,  where  civil  society
       activists  and  suspected  FLEC-supporters  are  often   prosecuted,
       detained and tortured. The same holds true in the  diamond-producing
       areas of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul, where the  local  population  is
       subjected to human rights abuses by the army, the police and private
       security forces, including torture and extralegal killings.


Article 26 and its repeal


   42. Freedom House Countries at the Crossroads 2011 report noted:

         Angolan law  includes  an  overly  broad  and  ambiguous  range  of
         offenses against the state,  including  "every  and  any  act,  not
         provided for by law, that endangers or may endanger the security of
         the State." A  1978  law  permits  up  to  215  days  of  pre-trial
         detention for such crimes. This law was  used  in  August  2010  to
         convict four activists  in  Cabinda  in  connection  with  a  fatal
         January 2010 attack on a bus carrying the Togolese national  soccer
         team through the province. There was no evidence linking  the  four
         men to this attack, for which the armed separatist group Front  for
         the  Liberation  of  the  Enclave   of   Cabinda   (FLEC)   claimed
         responsibility, but the four men had  participated  in  an  October
         2009 meeting with  FLEC  representatives.  They  were  released  in
         December 2010 after the Constitutional Court overturned the part of
         the state security law under which they were convicted.

   43. Whilst the outcome appears to have been resolved in favour of the  4
       convicted men as a result of the intervention of the  Constitutional
       Court, Amnesty International, in its 2011 report, placed a  somewhat
       different gloss on what happened:


         In September, the Angolan Bar Association asked the  Constitutional
         Court to rule on the legality of Article 26 of the  Law  on  crimes
         against the security of the state. The article stated that "all and
         every act, not foreseen in the law that puts at risk or  could  put
         at risk the security of the state will be punishable". In  December
         the Court decided it did not have to make a ruling on this due to a
         new Law on crimes against the security of  the  state  approved  by
         parliament in November. The new law repeals Article 26 of  the  old
         law, but makes it a criminal offence to insult  the  Republic,  the
         President or any organ of power of the state.


   44. If Article 26 has been  repealed  and  replaced  by  less  draconian
       measures, the replacement measures have themselves  been  criticised
       as a restriction on freedom of expression.

Passage through border controls

   45. According to the US State Department Report,  2013,  border  control
       agents placed emphasis on operations in the provinces bordering  the
       Democratic Republic  of  the  Congo  (DRC):  Cabinda,  Zaire,  Uige,
       Malange, Lunda Norte, Lunda  Sul,  and  Moxico.  In  particular,  in
       diamond-rich Lunda Norte Province, NGOs and the media reported  acts
       of violence and  degrading  treatment,  including  rape  and  sexual
       abuse,  associated  with  these  operations.  In  April  the  United
       Nation's High Commissioner  for  Human  Rights,  Navanethem  Pillay,
       visited a border crossing in Lunda Norte and stated sexual abuse  of
       female migrants and property theft continued  to  be  problems.  The
       government did not carry out thorough and  impartial  investigations
       into past allegations of serious abuse of migrants by  its  security
       forces during expulsions from the country,  continued  to  deny  the
       veracity  of  the  allegations,  and  failed  to  prosecute  alleged
       perpetrators.

Internal travel - FCO advice

   46. ANGOP or Angola News Agency is the official news agency of the state
       of Angola, based in Luanda.  Its independence from the state is  not
       established but, in a news report of October 2013, it spoke  of  the
       Angolan  Airlines,  TAAG,  having   transported   150,000   national
       passengers during the first semester of 2013 with Cabinda being  the
       province with  the  highest  number  of  travellers.   There  is  no
       particular reason why this should not be true and it makes  internal
       sense since Cabinda is separated from the  rest  of  Angola  by  the
       strip of land belonging to the DRC and is  relatively  distant  from
       the capital  Luanda  and,  therefore,   perhaps  more  suitable  for
       internal air transport than other population centres in Angola.


   47. Foreign and  Commonwealth  Office  advice  (updated  16  July  2013)
       advises against all but essential travel to the provinces of Cabinda
       where there are regular violent incidents including rape, murder and
       kidnappings involving  foreigners  and  Angolans.   Groups  claiming
       responsibility for these attacks, so the Advice says, have  declared
       their intention to continue attacks against foreigners. Major  roads
       between Luanda  and  the  provincial  capitals  are  improving,  but
       driving standards and some road conditions are very poor and  travel
       outside major towns is usually in convoys of two or more  four-wheel
       drive vehicles. Outside major towns, mines and  unexploded  ordnance
       remain a problem. There are taxis at the airport and these can  also
       be booked through hotels. Local minibus transport is unsafe.


   48. There is a low threat from terrorism but  FCO  advice  suggests  the
       traveller should be aware  of  the  global  risk  of  indiscriminate
       terrorist attacks which could be in public  areas,  including  those
       frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.

   49. The US State  Department  2012  Report  on  Human  Rights  Practices
       commented that, at  times,  the  government  restricted  freedom  of
       internal movement, foreign  travel,  emigration,  and  repatriation.
       During 2012 the government improved the road network  and  decreased
       checkpoints between provinces. The government  cooperated  with  the
       Office of  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR),  the
       International Organization for  Migration,  and  other  humanitarian
       organizations in providing protection and assistance  to  internally
       displaced persons, refugees, asylum seekers, and  other  persons  of
       concern. That said,  security  forces  frequently  abused  irregular
       migrants in the border region shared with the DRC.

   50. Dealing with internal  movement,  the  US  State  Department  report
       stated that extortion and harassment at  government  checkpoints  in
       rural areas and at provincial and international  border  checkpoints
       interfered with the right to travel. Extortion by police was routine
       in  cities  on  major  commercial  routes.   Land  mines  and  other
       explosive remnants of war remaining from the civil war continued  to
       impede freedom of movement in rural areas.

Bertelsmann Stiftung's Transformation Index (BTl) 2012 Angola report


   51. The Executive Summary of the Bertelsmann Transformation  Index  2012
       provides a perceptive description of  the  tentative  steps  towards
       change that has occurred in Angola:


         In March 2011, a notice was posted  online  calling  for  an  anti-
         government demonstration to demand the resignation of  a  long-time
         President Jose Eduardo  Dos  Santos.  Such  open  defiance  of  the
         government was unprecedented, even  in  Angola's  post-independence
         history. While the post was first  described  by  commentators  and
         opposition parties as a hoax (as it was anonymous, signed with  the
         pseudonym), the regime, however, reacted with  concern.  Luminaries
         of the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola  party
         (MPLA) and members of government strongly condemned any attempt  at
         "creating confusion"  as  an  illegal  act,  warning  that  whoever
         demonstrated against the government "would get some" -  a  reminder
         of the regime's capacity of the violence, the threat of  which  has
         long hampered open political dissent. The  MPLA  organised  a  mass
         counter-demonstration on March  5,  two  days  before  the  planned
         demonstration; as schoolchildren, state functionaries and employees
         of state companies  were  bussed  to  the  march  under  threat  of
         sanctions, the gathering was hardly a spontaneous show  of  popular
         support. On March 7, however, around 20 people gathered in Luanda's
         Independence Square, and were immediately arrested. Because of  the
         regime's  overreaction,  the  March  7  demonstration  was   widely
         discussed and had an  impact  disproportionate  to  the  number  of
         actual anti-government demonstrators. A number of  youth  protests,
         increasing in frequency and size and organised  under  the  banner,
         "32 is Too Much" - alluding to Dos Santos'  32  years  in  power  -
         occurred  during  the  review  period,  in  Luanda  and  in   other
         provincial  capitals.  The  authorities   reacted   with   mounting
         repression; demonstrators faced administrative and legal obstacles,
         police brutality,  arbitrary  arrests  and  suffered  sham  trials.
         Plainclothes  "thugs"  affiliated  with  the  regime   increasingly
         resorted to violence; the government's control of  the  media  also
         intensifies. But these demonstrations changed the tone  of  Angolan
         politics. Opposition parties, hitherto weak in  their  positioning,
         started attacking the government more  forcefully,  condemning  the
         inefficiency of the administration and deploring  the  dire  living
         conditions for a majority of the population. The creation of a  new
         party, the  Broad  Convergence  for  the  Salvation  of  Angola  --
         Electoral  coalition  (CASA-CE),  only  six   months   before   the
         elections, attracted dissidents from both the  National  Union  for
         the Total Independence of Angola party (UNITA)  and  the  MPLA  and
         further stimulated the political debate.


The background material as it relates to Cabinda

   52. So far, we have considered the background material as it relates  to
       Angola as a whole.  The references to Cabinda we  have  noted  above
       have been casual references arising out of the general  information;
       for example, a specific organisation located  in  Cabinda  that  had
       been subject to limitations upon its freedom of expression  [34],  a
       specific reference to lack of due process of law in  relation  to  a
       specific group of detainees in Cabinda and a lack of redress [39 and
       41] and the FCO  advice  of  July  2013  advising  against  all  but
       essential travel to Cabinda  [47].   We  now  move  on  to  set  out
       evidence that is more specifically related to Cabinda.   Inevitably,
       not all the evidence will  relate  solely  to  Cabinda.   Clear  cut
       distinctions are not always possible.


   53. Although, as we have said, the law prohibits  arbitrary  arrest  and
       detention, these prohibitions were often disregarded by the security
       forces, according to  Amnesty  International  in  its  2013  report.
       Several civil society and political party  representatives  reported
       incidents of security forces detaining Cabinda  residents  suspected
       of FLEC activity or collaboration. Representatives of one  political
       party claimed that security forces were holding at least 29  alleged
       FLEC members without charging them,  some  sources  put  the  figure
       closer to 50. Attempts to meet with  government  representatives  in
       Cabinda were unsuccessful but several government officials described
       publicly that  conditions  in  Cabinda  were  largely  positive  and
       peaceful during media interviews in the course of 2012.


   54. The Human Rights Watch report for 2013 dated 21 January  2014  spoke
       of arbitrary detentions in the enclave of Cabinda. Between 10 August
       and 12 September 2013, military and intelligence officials arrested,
       mistreated and in several cases, tortured and jailed at least 20 men
       in Cabinda who had been charged with armed rebellion and remained in
       pre-trial detention. Nine  men  of  Congolese  origin  and  Angolan,
       Belgian and French nationalities, alleged to be  former  members  of
       the defunct Armed Forces of Zaire, were arrested  in  November  2012
       beaten and tortured by military and  border  guards  while  kept  in
       incommunicado detention. They were subsequently charged  with  armed
       rebellion against the government of the DRC and illegal  entry  into
       Angola. A lawyer instructed to represent them had been threatened by
       intelligence officials.


The conflict between the Angolan authorities and FLEC and the Memorandum  of
Understanding (MOU)

FLEC

   55. As recorded by the Tribunal in FP, FLEC had emerged in 1963  seeking
       a separate independence from Portugal, but had  split  into  several
       competing factions.  Though retaining widespread  Cabindan  support,
       they had  been  marginalised  and,  following  the  independence  of
       Angola, remained unrecognised by the Organisation for African  Unity
       as an independence movement.  A low level intensity war, accompanied
       by atrocities on all sides, had endured for many years and was  then
       expected to continue.  Hopeful signs in 2001 had  come  to  nothing.
       The CIPU Report stated that in August 2002  any  possibility  of  an
       immediate reconciliation over the status of the province  had  ended
       by a major offensive launched by the Angolan army.  It  was  against
       this background, that the risk was assessed in FP.

Memorandum of Understanding

   56. According to Human Rights Watch, Military Detention, Torture etc, 22
       June 2009, the Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Angolan
       government and Antonio Bembe in 2006;  the  former  leader  of  FLEC
       Renovada wing and president of the Cabinda Forum for Dialogue  (FCD)
       sought formally  to  end  the  armed  conflict.  The  FCD  had  been
       established in 2004 as a joint commission including  representatives
       of the two main FLEC factions (FLEC Renovada and FLEC-FAC)  as  well
       as members of civil society and the churches to facilitate the peace
       negotiations with the government. The MOU  included  an  amnesty,  a
       demobilisation and reintegration plan for former FLEC combatants and
       the allocation of a number of government posts to a range of  former
       FLEC officials.

   57. The peace agreement, according to HRW, enjoyed little credibility in
       Cabinda because prominent FLEC activists as well as others from  the
       FCD had been excluded from  the  talks.  The  armed  insurgency  has
       continued but since 2006 the government has  asserted  the  war  has
       ended. There had however been a number  of  armed  attacks  but  the
       intensity of the armed conflict  and  the  level  of  serious  human
       rights violations have decreased since 2004 but the presence of  the
       Angolan armed forces  is  proportionately  higher  in  Cabinda  than
       elsewhere in Angola, suggesting a continuing concern on the part  of
       the government  about  separatist  activities.  According  to  Human
       Rights Watch, despite  the  peace  agreement  in  2006,  freedom  of
       expression and association remains restricted  in  Cabinda  and  the
       government has  used  state  security  concerns  to  crack  down  on
       peaceful opposition and scrutiny.


   58. There is a faction of FLEC currently living in Paris.   These  Paris
       exiles maintain the conflict has not yet ended.  According  to  IRIN
       news report 'Cabindan separatists in exile  deny  end  to  conflict'
       dated 22 July 2010, offers of peace by senior FLEC which  'seemingly
       ended' a long-standing separatist conflict in northern Angola,  were
       made without the knowledge or consent  of  its  president,  Henrique
       N'Zita Tiago, leader of FLEC-FAC (Armed Forces of Cabinda),  now  in
       exile in Paris:

         "We did not sign any ceasefire with the Angolans."

   59. He had told IRIN that all correspondence from  him  to  the  Angolan
       government and its President, Eduardo dos Santos, offering to engage
       in peace negotiations had always been ignored.  The 2010 IRIN report
       referred to the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Antonio  Bembe
       in 2006 and the fact that, in 2005, while in the Netherlands,  Bembe
       was arrested on an international warrant for the  kidnapping  of  an
       oil company employee 15 years earlier while he was a FLEC combatant,
       but had given parole  through  the  use  of  an  Angolan  diplomatic
       passport and returned to Luanda.  The report continued:

         Bento Bembe, recently appointed Angola's first  minister  of  human
         rights in the ruling MPLA government, told  IRIN  during  a  recent
         interview in the Angolan capital, Luanda, that Tiago "dreams  of  a
         glorious military victory, but he is a sick old man on  his  death-
         bed in Paris, and when he dies, so will his cause".

   60.  According  to  IRIN,  Bembe  dismissed  any  suggestion  that   the
       separatist movement to which he had dedicated 30 years of  his  life
       still existed, apart from "in the mind" of Tiago.

Current level of violence between the Angolan authorities and FLEC

   61. The MOU did not see the end  of  the  conflict  and  the  government
       remained afraid of a resurgence.  According to Human Rights Watch in
       2009, Military Detention, Torture etc, 22 June 2009, this  sense  of
       fearfulness on the part of  the  government  resulted  in  continued
       arrests for security crimes between 2007 and 2009.   Their  research
       was then based on new first-hand, field-based information and showed
       'a disturbing pattern of human rights  violations  during  pre-trial
       detention of persons accused of state security crimes  in  Cabinda.'
       In most of the 38 cases that Human Rights Watch investigated,  those
       accused  of  security  crimes  endured  arbitrary  arrests,  lengthy
       incommunicado  detention,  and  interrogations  under   torture   in
       military custody.


   62. The Freedom House Freedom in the  World  2013  report,  released  16
       January 2014, stated:

             In  2006,  the  government  signed  a  peace  agreement   with
             secessionists in the oil-rich  northern  exclave  of  Cabinda,
             hoping to end a conflict  that  had  continued  intermittently
             since 1975. While between 80  and  90  percent  of  the  rebel
             fighters have reportedly joined the army or demobilized,  some
             violence has  continued.  The  military  continues  to  arrest
             Cabindans for alleged state security  crimes.  Most  of  these
             detainees are allegedly denied basic due  process  rights  and
             subjected to inhumane treatment. Citing continued  attacks  by
             rebels-primarily from the FLEC-FAC group, a splinter from  the
             main FLEC movement-the military restarted a  counterinsurgency
             campaign in Cabinda in  2011,  which  continued  in  2012.  In
             August, the rebels called for talks with the government, which
             did not take place by year's end.


   63. The Amnesty International Annual Report, 2011 spoke of  there  being
       'further attacks by FLEC in Cabinda during 2010' but these were  not
       detailed.  However, two attacks in 2010 were specifically  mentioned
       in the Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2014.

   64. According to the Index, the remaining armed FLEC factions, estimated
       at a few hundred men, have continued sporadic attacks on the Angolan
       Armed Forces (FAA) troops and  supply  convoys  from  and  into  the
       Democratic Republic of the Congo. While their  primary  targets  are
       what they call FAA 'occupation troops,' they see the  oil  companies
       active in Cabinda as  complicit  in  the  Angolan  'occupation'  and
       therefore as legitimate targets for attacks. Reference  is  made  to
       the January 2010 attack carried out by FLEC on the Togolese national
       football team. In June 2010, three Chinese workers were  killed  and
       one kidnapped in an attack on a supply convoy.

   65. The same report continues that, due to FAA operations and a lack  of
       external support, the FLEC have been confined to the far  north-east
       of the province. They have little military capacity to stage attacks
       beyond  small  hit-and-run  ambushes.   Furthermore,   the   Angolan
       government has the tacit consent of its neighbours  that  FAA  units
       can cross the border into the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
       and the Republic of the Congo in pursuit of FLEC guerrillas who  may
       be seeking sanctuary there. Raids in August and November 2012 led to
       the killing of several FLEC fighters.

   66. The Executive Summary of Jane's  Sentinel  Security  Assessment  for
       Angola (updated in August 2013), noted:

         Cabinda separatists remain an issue. But incidents are sporadic and
         localised Rebel activity by unreconciled FLEC factions in  Angola's
         tiny Cabinda enclave persist at  a  low  and  sporadic  level.  The
         objectives of the various  factions  have  varied  from  aiming  to
         secure independence for Cabinda, to  trying  to  push  the  Angolan
         government  to  cede  more  autonomy  to  the  region  and  achieve
         redistribution of the enclave's oil wealth. From late 2002,  Luanda
         was largely  conducting  its  pacification  policy  in  the  region
         through a military offensive against  FLEC  bases  in  the  Cabinda
         hinterland. By mid-2003, a number of  notable  successes  had  been
         recorded, including  the  capture  of  FLEC  rear  bases,  and  the
         defection of significant numbers of  FLEC  political  and  military
         leaders. There have been attempts at negotiated settlement over the
         years, although the factionalism of the group has complicated peace
         efforts.  This  was  again  evident  with  the  most  recent  peace
         agreement signed in August 2006, which incorporated  Antonio  Bento
         Bembe's  supporters  within   FLEC-Renewal   (FLEC-Renovada),   for
         example. Under the terms of the agreement,  insurgents  were  given
         amnesty and, while the  Cabinda  enclave  was  to  remain  part  of
         Angola, it would be accorded "special status"  (greater  autonomy).
         However, with some elements still outside  the  agreement,  further
         sporadic conflict has remained likely.  The  most  widely  reported
         assault in recent years took place in January 2010  when  two  FLEC
         factions claimed responsibility for an attack on  the  bus  of  the
         Togolese football team in Cabinda.  More  recently,  ahead  of  the
         August 2012 election, another FLEC faction leader, Nzita  Henriques
         Tiago, voiced a willingness  for  talks  with  the  next  post-poll
         government.'

The attack on the Togo football team

   67. As we see in these glancing  references,  the  attack  on  the  Togo
       football team has  been  the  subject  of  widespread  coverage  and
       separate consideration proves to be instructive.   Wikipedia,  using
       fully sourced  material  cited  in  the  report  provides  the  most
       detailed description of the incident.  On 8 January 2010,  traveling
       through  Cabinda  en  route  to  the  2010  Africa  Cup  of  Nations
       tournament, under the escort of Angolan forces, the bus of the  Togo
       national football team was attacked by gunmen. The ensuing  gunfight
       resulted in the deaths of the assistant coach,  team  spokesman  and
       bus driver, as well as injuring several others.


   68. An offshoot of the FLEC claimed  responsibility.  Rodrigues  Mingas,
       secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave  of
       Cabinda-Military Position (FLEC-PM), said his fighters had meant  to
       attack security guards as the convoy passed through  Cabinda.  "This
       attack was not aimed at the Togolese  players  but  at  the  Angolan
       forces at the head of the convoy", Mingas told France 24 television.
       "So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the  players.  We  don't
       have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences
       to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for
       the total liberation of Cabinda." According Mingas, 15 FLEC fighters
       participated in the  ambush.  The  siege  lasted  for  at  least  30
       minutes. A statement signed by Mingas in which he described  himself
       as the secretary general of FLEC, "This operation is just the  start
       of a series of planned actions that will continue to take  place  in
       the whole territory of Cabinda." The Armed Forces of Cabinda  (FLEC-
       FAC) based in Paris also claimed responsibility. The leader of FLEC-
       FAC,  Jean-Claude  N'Zita  [Tiago],  dismissed  Mingas'  faction  as
       opportunist.

   69. Amnesty International in the 2011  Annual  reported  two  men,  Jo�o
       Ant�nio Puati and Daniel  Simbai,  were  arrested  on  suspicion  of
       carrying out the  attack.  Jo�o  Ant�nio  Puati  was  convicted  and
       sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment for  the  attack,  while  Daniel
       Simbai was acquitted. At least 14 others were arrested following the
       attack, although not accused directly of carrying it out.

   70. The attack clearly had repercussions going beyond the small group of
       fighters  directly  involved.   According  to  Human  Rights  Watch,
       'Angola: quash convictions of Cabinda activists', 5 August  2010,  a
       Cabinda  court  sentenced  4  human  rights  defenders  including  a
       Catholic priest, a lawyer and a  university  professor  to  6  years
       imprisonment on 3 August 2010 following the 8 January 2010 attack on
       the Togolese football team bus. The  prosecution  took  place  under
       article 26 of the 1978 law on Crimes against  the  Security  of  the
       State  which  permitted  convictions  for  unspecified  "other  acts
       against the security of the state".

   71. There appears to be no  suggestion  that  the  four  convicted  were
       directly involved  in  the  attack  and  the  participation  of  the
       defendants  in  what  was  said  to   be   illegal   meetings   with
       representatives of the guerrilla group in October 2009 was  said  by
       them to  be  aimed  at  facilitating  the  peace  process  with  the
       government. (Human  Rights  Watch,  'Angola:  quash  convictions  of
       Cabinda activists', 5 August 2010.)  As we have  set  out  above  in
       relation to Article 26,  the  convictions  of  these  men  were  the
       subject  of  intense  attention  and  significant   criticism.   The
       Constitutional Court set aside their convictions. They were released
       in December 2010.  The Amnesty International  report  2011  suggests
       this was because of the November 2010  Law  on  Crimes  against  the
       Security of the State repealing Article 26 but replacing it with new
       measures which might also have wide effect.

The government's denial of a conflict and its response

   72. Officially, since the MOU in 2006, says Human Rights Watch, Military
       Detention, Torture etc, 22 June 2009,  the  Angolan  government  has
       denied the continued existence of an armed FLEC guerrilla  movement.
       Senior FAA and police officials had explained to Human Rights  Watch
       in March 2008 that those  people  who  were  arrested  for  national
       security crimes were "bandits who oppose  development,"  or  "people
       who  still  identify  with  FLEC,  seeking  to  call  attention   to
       compromise  the  government's   cooperation   with   countries   and
       companies." Bento Bembe, the former FLEC Renovada and FCD leader and
       then a minister without portfolio, had  explained  to  Human  Rights
       Watch in March 2009 that "those people  cannot  be  from  the  FLEC,
       because I represent the guerrillas." However, the  cases  documented
       in the HRW report, they said, clearly contradicted him, as  many  of
       the charges in the cases refer to alleged  involvement  in  concrete
       acts of  armed  insurgency.  Court  records  also  often  explicitly
       referred to alleged cooperation with FLEC-FAC.


   73. Human Rights Watch,: Military Detention, Torture etc, 22 June  2009,
       is sceptical about the Angolan  government's  professions  that  the
       conflict is a thing of the past:


         Despite its insistence that the insurgency is no longer active, the
         military's systematic arbitrary detention and torture of people  in
         Cabinda suggests that the government has resorted to unlawful means
         to retaliate against people with perceived sympathy for the  FLEC's
         armed independence  campaign.  Angolan  military  and  intelligence
         services have a widespread presence in  the  small  territory,  and
         they have intimidated and harassed people with perceived  dissident
         views.

   74. Four years later, the US  State  Department  2012  Report  on  Human
       Rights Practices, released 19 April 2013, noted:

         Unlike in previous years, there were no reports of security  forces
         detaining  Cabinda  residents  suspected  of   FLEC   activity   or
         collaboration.

   75. The Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2012 Angola report  noted  that
       the attack on the Togolese delegation triggered a strong reaction by
       the Angolan armed forces and security services, and  early  in  2011
       the chief of staff of  the  faction  involved  was  arrested.    The
       writer concluded:


         It seems likely that for the time being this will  put  an  end  to
         Cabindan military resistance to the Angolan state, but the specific
         Cabindan social identity remains very strong, the  separation  from
         Angola is still an aspiration shared by many, and the  prospect  of
         future acts of armed resistance cannot be discounted. In  addition,
         in early 2011, under heavy pressure from the  Angolan  regime,  the
         Vatican appointed a  priest  from  Luanda  as  bishop  of  Cabinda,
         cancelling the sacerdotal status of three Cabindan priests who  had
         come out in  favour  of  regional  aspirations,  a  move  aimed  at
         weakening the spirit of resistance.

Friction between FLEC factions

   76. As we pointed out above, the various  factions  within  FLEC  appear
       keen to claim credit for acts of violence committed in the  name  of
       Cabindan independence.  Little is known of FLEC - Military  Position
       (FLEC-PM) or its soi-disant  general-secretary  Mingas.   (FLEC-FAC)
       also claimed the responsibility with the Paris-based  leader,  Jean-
       Claude N'Zita Tiago dismissing, as we have said, Mingas' faction  as
       'opportunist'. Whilst the Amnesty International  Annual  report  for
       2011 refers to 'further attacks by  FLEC  in  Cabinda  during  2010'
       there is very little evidence of these apart from the attack on  the
       Togo football-team.  It is well to remind ourselves that the  attack
       took place nearly 4 � years ago.  It appears to fall well  short  of
       the threat made by Mingas of FLEC-PM that the attack was to  be  the
       start of a series of planned actions that would continue across  the
       whole of Cabinda.

The Angolan authorities'  attitude towards FLEC


   77. In the Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2014,  the  writer  provides
       the plausible assessment that Angola  seems  intent  on  pursuing  a
       military solution to  the  conflict,  combined  with  infrastructure
       spending.  A very strong incentive for Angola is  the  retention  of
       the Cabindan  off-shore  oil  reserves.   This  has  echoes  of  the
       Tribunal's comments in FP  that,


         It may be that the developing peace with UNITA has freed the  hands
         of the Angolan government and army to deal  with  the  independence
         movement in Cabinda, so as to reinforce its control over  the  oil-
         rich enclave.

   78. Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2012 report noted:

         ... the state's monopoly on the use of force remains challenged  by
         forces seeking autonomy for the enclave of  Cabinda.  Although  the
         Front for the Liberation of  the  Enclave  of  Cabinda  (FLEC)  has
         suffered from internal divisions and unstable strategy,  aspiration
         for autonomy  remains  strong  in  Cabindan  society.  The  Angolan
         government signed a memorandum of understanding with the leader  of
         one FLEC faction in August 2006 regarding the demilitarization  and
         integration of  FLEC  cadres  into  the  Angolan  state  apparatus.
         However, the agreement was  rejected  by  the  FLEC  leadership  in
         exile, and in the following months, resistance and acts of sabotage
         against  Angolan  authorities  again  mounted.  While   authorities
         reacted on  the  one  hand  with  increased  repression  (not  only
         directed  at  FLEC,  but  also  at  the  Cabindan   civil   society
         organization Mpalabanda and several representatives of the Catholic
         Church in Cabinda), they also took measures aimed  at  calming  the
         situation, such the 2008 introduction of a special  customs  regime
         favouring Cabinda, the construction of a large stadium for national
         and international sports events,  and  the  creation  of  a  public
         university in Cabinda in 2010.

FLEC's attempts at a peaceful resolution

   79. A Reuters report, 'Angola Cabinda rebels want talks with  Government
       after vote', 6 August 2012 refers  to  a  statement  from  the  FLEC
       leader Nzita Henriques Tiago, in exile in Paris, in which he said:

         "FLEC is  observing  the  start  of  campaigning  for  the  general
         election in Angola and will take the necessary measures to  explore
         official and direct contact  with  the  government  that  wins  the
         ballot on August 31....Our political  commitment  to  end  the  war
         remains that of  an  understanding  through  a  direct,  negotiated
         solution with the Angolan government."


       The reporter stated that Mr Tiago said that talks could lead to  the
       end of the  Cabinda  conflict  if  the  new  government  showed  the
       political will and  created  the  conditions  to  reach  a  peaceful
       solution.  The report continued that oil output from wells  off  the
       coast of Cabinda represented  more  than  half  of  the  around  1.8
       million barrels per day produced by Angola, Africa's  second-largest
       crude producer after Nigeria.  Reuters reported  that  requests  for
       comment from the Angolan government obtained no immediate  response.
       The report continued that FLEC  and  several  splinter  groups  said
       Cabindans do not receive a fair share of Angola's oil  revenues  but
       the fact that Cabinda's oil is  produced  offshore  meant  that  the
       rebels had less  chance  of  disrupting  output  than  militants  in
       Nigeria's Niger Delta.

   80. An Africa Review article, 'Angola's Cabinda rebels ready to lay down
       arms', 2 May 2013 also spoke of overtures towards  a  resolution  of
       the conflict:

         Rebels who have been fighting for the independence of Angola's oil-
         rich territory of Cabinda are planning to lay  down  arms  and  re-
         negotiate with  the  government,  state  media  reported.   'It  is
         needful  to  make  concessions  to  our  yesterday's  enemies   and
         adversaries today. In this new era, we are going to  hold  rational
         talk with the Angolan Government', the state-owned newspaper Jornal
         de Angola quoted a press release from the rebels as saying.


   81. According to  the  newspaper,  FLEC  was  also  seeking  a  peaceful
       conflict resolution and, presumably quoting the same source, stated,
       'Angolan government has to see FLEC as a partner. Cabinda can  exist
       in Angola without claiming its independence.'

Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research

   82. In many cases it will be difficult to find an objective yardstick by
       which the intensity of a conflict is  assessed  by  an  organisation
       whose objectivity and methodology have gained respect by the outside
       world. However, we have no reason to doubt the academic  objectivity
       of the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research  and
       its findings set out in the Conflict  Barometer  for  2013.  In  the
       report, the concept of conflict intensity is treated as an essential
       feature of political conflicts:


         ...conflict intensity is  an  attribute  of  the  sum  of  conflict
         measures in a specific political conflict in  a  geographical  area
         and a given space of time. Since 2003, the HIIK has  been  using  a
         five-level  model  of  conflict  intensity.   Under   its   revised
         methodology, the intensity levels are now  known  as  (i)  dispute,
         (ii) non-violent crisis, (iii) violent crisis, (iv) limited war and
         (v) war.


       These are calibrated in a  level  of  intensity  measured  1  to  5.
       Intensity levels 1 and 2, termed a dispute and a non-violent  crisis
       respectively, both have a level of violence described as non-violent
       and of low intensity. Whilst a dispute is described as  a  political
       conflict carried out completely without resorting to violence, in  a
       non-violent crisis one of the actors is  threatened  with  violence.
       The last three levels, intensity levels,  3  to  5,  constitute  the
       categories of violent conflicts of increasing ferocity  in  contrast
       to the non-violent conflicts.


   83. Using this methodology, we find at page 45 of the report a reference
       to the Angola conflict (FLEC-Cabinda) where the conflict parties are
       FLEC and the government in which the conflict items are described as
       secession and resources. There is no indication of any change in the
       intensity level since the last report and  the  intensity  level  is
       described as intensity  level  1,  that  is,  a  political  conflict
       carried out completely without resorting to violence and without the
       threat of violence.  In contrast the conflict involving UNITA, where
       the conflict parties are described as CASA-CE and UNITA against  the
       government (a conflict described as one  for  national  power),  the
       level of intensity is described  as  intensity  level  3,  low-level
       violence.


   84. In the text, found at page 48 of the report, it is only the conflict
       with UNITA  that  is  described,  thereby  indicating  its  relative
       importance in terms of conflict descriptions. However it is a useful
       indication of the government's attitude towards opposition.

         The government repeatedly  cracked  down  on  illegal  settlements,
         especially in the outskirts of the capital Luanda. When UNITA tried
         to deliver assistance to the settlements on February  23,  security
         forces blocked them, allegedly beating them up. On March 3,  police
         raided UNITA's headquarters  in  Luanda,  confiscating  audiovisual
         materials. Three days later,  the  car  of  UNITA's  president  was
         rammed by another car and overturned four times. UNITA claimed  the
         attack was a politically motivated assassination  attempt.  On  May
         21, alleged MPLA members attacked a group of 23 UNITA  members  who
         were preparing a rally ... leaving one dead.


         Over the course of  the  year,  police  and  protesters  repeatedly
         clashed in the context of anti-government demonstrations led by the
         main opposition parties. On November 23, presidential guards killed
         a CASA-CE member in Luanda  who  was  putting  up  posters....  The
         demonstrations in Luanda and several provinces the same day  turned
         violent. While the police cracked  down  on  protests  using  guns,
         water cannon, and teargas, the  protesters  threw  stones.  Several
         people were injured and 292 detained. Police forces are  prohibited
         other demonstration attempts  in  the  provinces  of  ...  [amongst
         others] Cabinda."

Returns from the DRC

   85. A report of 22 January 2013  from  IRIN  'Uncertainty  for  Angolans
       stripped of refugee status in  DRC'  spoke  of  the  effect  of  the
       revocation of refugee status of former Angolan refugees:


         In June 2012, it was determined that the circumstances - created by
         a civil war - that led to refugee status being granted to  tens  of
         thousands of Angolans were no longer in place. Under the  terms  of
         the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, this  means
         that there is no  longer  a  prima  facie  case  for  international
         protection. In short, the refugee  status  of  these  Angolans  was
         revoked.


         Refugees from Cabinda say they continue to live in fear, and accuse
         Angolan security forces of  entering  DRC  and  other  neighbouring
         countries to kidnap those believed to be linked to  the  province's
         rebel groups, some of which have  been  fighting  for  independence
         from Angola for decades.

             "I continue to live with fear because if you have  a  Cabindan
             name, it means you are considered by Angolan authorities as  a
             rebel. Recently a friend of mine was kidnapped when he went to
             trade near the DRC-Angola border," said Alfred  Gomez,  a  48-
             year-old refugee and former  school  teacher  originally  from
             Cabinda, now living in Kinshasa.


         Cabindan refugees are reluctant to return home, either because they
         support the secessionist movement or because they fear they will be
         pressured to pick a side once they return.

             "Some are not activists, but they are former fighters  of  the
             FLEC [Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda,  the
             main Cabindan secessionist  group],"  Jose  Vase,  a  Cabindan
             journalist based in Kinshasa, told IRIN.

             "Others are regular citizens who cannot go back home. This  is
             because when they do so, they will be obliged by Angolan local
             authorities to make statements against rebel  groups,  showing
             also the goods things the government is doing for returnees...
             When they do it, they are considered as enemies  [of  Cabindan
             separatists]."

The risk at Luanda airport

   86. In FP  a principal focus in  the  assessment  of  risk  was  at  the
       precise point of arrival in Angola, at Luanda's airport:

        14. The problems faced by those returning to Luanda, at the point of
            return, is dealt with in paragraph 6.55 [of  the  CIPU  report].
            It comments that the Angolan authorities are well aware  of  the
            pressures which lead to emigration and that  asylum  claims  are
            used to facilitate that;  the fact  of  being  a  failed  asylum
            seeker, if discovered, would not be of any particular  interest.
            However, the controls  at  Luanda  Airport  are  thorough.   Any
            Angolans who have been deported from abroad, or who lived abroad
            for many years, would be questioned by immigration and police at
            the airport with a view to  establishing  their  identities  and
            whether they were of interest to the authorities  for  political
            or criminal reasons.

   87. In the appellant's skeleton, it is accepted that current evidence as
       to procedure at the airport is  limited.   It  is,  however,  common
       ground that border controls remain tight. The respondent  makes  the
       positive claim that there  is  no  evidence  that  returning  failed
       asylum seekers of Cabindan ethnicity are subject to any form of  ill
       treatment at Luanda airport. The most informative material  relating
       to this important element of the claim  comes  from  UNHCR  and  the
       organisation known as 'Search for Common Ground' in their  responses
       to questions put by the Home Office, to which we will return  later.
       Both responded by saying that there are the normal  security  checks
       performed on those embarking from and arriving at all  the  airports
       in  the  country   in   accordance   with   regular   and   standard
       internationally-accepted safety check occurs; the implication  being
       that the checks went no further.


   88.  UNHCR  were  not  aware  of  particular  procedures  for  those  in
       possession of a national passport. Those with other types of  travel
       document are normally submitted to an interview at the airport,  the
       purpose  of  which  is,  essentially,  to  ascertain  their  Angolan
       nationality.  UNHCR said  there  were  no  reported  cases  of  ill-
       treatment.  Search for Common Ground responded to  the  effect  that
       Cabindan failed asylum seekers would certainly face interrogation at
       the airport when returning especially (and not surprisingly) if they
       are suspected of being an outspoken FLEC supporter. There  would  be
       no  ill-treatment  but  they  would   remain   there   until   State
       Intelligence sanctions their release. According to SFCG, there  were
       cases, however, of Cabindan failed asylum seekers being  ill-treated
       by state intelligence officers.

The Embassy letter of 22 January 2014

   89. In connection with a Case Management hearing that took  place  on  7
       January 2014, Mr Parkinson  had  been  in  touch  with  the  British
       Embassy in Luanda. The embassy is small, a five-member post but they
       had agreed to conduct fact-finding work, to  approach  NGOs  and  to
       speak to the Minister for Human Rights. The COI  unit  liaised  with
       the post although there is no in-house immigration staff  there.  In
       response to these enquiries, the  British  Embassy  wrote  a  letter
       dated 22 January 2014 in these terms:


         At the request of  colleagues  in  the  Home  Office,  the  British
         Embassy in Luanda approached a number of different organisations in
         Angola during the latter half of 2013 to clarify if there  was  any
         specific risk to Angolans returning to Angola who  were  originally
         from the province of Cabinda. These  organisations  included  being
         Angola and Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the United Nations
         High   Commission   for   Refugees   (UNHCR),   the   International
         Organisation for Migration  (IOM)  and  Search  for  Common  Ground
         (SFCG).
         ...The responses are self explanatory but it is worth  adding  that
         the British Embassy is also  aware  that  members  of  the  Angolan
         government from Cabinda include former members  of  [FLEC].  It  is
         particularly relevant that the Secretary of State for Human  Rights
         is from Cabinda.
         We approached IOM in late November  2013  and  although  they  felt
         unable to answer our questions, they advised us that they were  not
         aware of any evidence of violence or persecution  in  Cabinda,  'as
         things stand now', and  that  they  were  aware  that  people  from
         Cabinda were returning to Angola from Switzerland and Finland.
         SFCG is a  Non-Governmental  Organisation  (NGO)  with  offices  in
         Luanda and Cabinda which was established in  1996  to  support  the
         peace and reconciliation process in Angola through activities  with
         media, civil society, community members and the Angolan government.
         The response from SFCG represents the views  of  the  author,  Carl
         Frederick Paul, the Country Representative for SFCG rather than the
         organisation itself.
         This letter has been compiled by staff at the  British  Embassy  in
         Luanda  entirely  from  information  obtained  from   the   sources
         indicated. The letter does not reflect the opinions of  the  author
         nor any policy of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  The  author
         has compiled this letter in response to a  request  from  the  Home
         Office...

   90. Although the responses included a  response  from  the  Ministry  of
       Justice and Human Rights, from  the  Cabinet  of  the  Secretary  of
       State, we have decided not to include the answers provided since  it
       may be suggested they lack appropriate objectivity  and  repeat  the
       government line that all is well. However, we set out in full the 16
       answers provided by UNHCR and Search for Common Ground in  the  body
       of this text as they are not otherwise in the public domain.


       Responses from UNHCR and Search for Common Ground NGO, Angola


       [We note that in neither case was English the first language of  the
       respondent.  In order to avoid editing or making alterations, we set
       out the responses as provided,  save  for  spelling  mistakes.   Any
       ambiguity in the responses is for the reader  to  resolve,  see  for
       example, the answer to question 1  where  the  respondents'  answers
       'Yes' and 'No', although apparently contradictory, are not in fact.]


       1. Are there numbers of  Angolans  of  Cabindan  origin  (Cabindans)
       ordinarily resident in Greater Angola?


       UNHCR response (16 December 2013),


       Yes, but it is unknown how many. As you know,  freedom  of  movement
       exists between all the provinces of the  country  and  there  is  no
       registration mechanism in place when  one  citizen  moves  from  one
       province to the other.


       Search for Common Ground response (13 December 2013),


       No, there are no numbers of Angolans of Cabinda origins resident  in
       Greater Angola. Such numbers will be provided  by  the  Ministry  of
       Interior but there is no official numbers.  The  census,  forecasted
       for 2014, will provide hopefully those numbers.  Nevertheless,  lots
       of Angolans from the Cabinda province live in greater  Angola  where
       employment opportunities are better. The rest remaining  in  Cabinda
       usually work for the governmental  institutions,  oil  companies  or
       perform commerce with neighbouring country.


       2. Is there any evidence that these Cabindans  are  subject  to  any
       form of ill-treatment of any type by virtue of being  Cabindans?  If
       so what types of ill-treatment and to what degree?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no report on ill-treatment against Angolans from Cabinda by
       virtue of being Cabindan.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       The ordinary Cabindans living in Greater Angola are not  subject  to
       any kind, form of any  type  of  ill-treatment  for  being  Cabindan
       except for the normal sincere rivalry and camaraderie amongst native
       of different provinces as it would occur in any country.


       3. Is there any evidence that young Cabindan males  are  subject  to
       the treatment outlined in 2 above?


       UNHCR response,


       Same as above. [There is no report on ill-treatment against Angolans
       from Cabinda by virtue of being Cabindan.]


       Search for Common Ground response,


       There is no ill-treatment  performed  on  male  Cabindan  living  in
       Angola. Therefore, no evidence is applicable.


       4. Is there any evidence that merely by being Cabindan a  person  is
       perceived as being a supporter of FLEC?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no evidence of the sort. There are also Cabindans that  are
       supporting the party in power (MPLA).


       Search for Common Ground response,


       Being a Cabindan person makes the individual perceived  as  being  a
       supporter of FLEC although Cabinda is also a stronghold of the  MPLA
       or at least the MPLA try to make it appear  as  such.  Nevertheless,
       the  FLEC  is  a  very  restricted  movement  and  is   a   military
       organisation. To my personal interaction with Cabindans in  general,
       mostly are not FLEC supporters  or  at  least  supporters  of  their
       manners. However, in general  any  Cabindan  is  more  prone  to  be
       inclined to the separatism ideas promoted by  the  FLEC  although  a
       high percentage of the population will also support  continued  ties
       with greater Angola. But,  no,  there  evidence  of  a  Cabindan  is
       perceived as being a supporter of FLEC.


       5. Is there any evidence that young  Cabindan  males  are  routinely
       suspected of being FLEC supporters and are therefore at risk of  ill
       treatment?


       UNHCR response,


       No, there is no evidence of the sort.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       No, the young Cabindan males are not routinely  suspected  of  being
       FLEC. Nevertheless, if they are suspected of being FLEC  supporters,
       they will face scrutiny from intelligence services (phone tapping, e-
       mail spying) and pressure  from  the  MPLA  propaganda  (job  offer,
       psychological pressure, money etc).


       6. Please could answers be provided in respect of questions 2  to  5
       for Cabindans living in Cabinda itself?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no evidence  that  all  Cabindans  living  in  Cabinda  are
       suspected to be part of the FLEC, nor that young  Cabindans  are  at
       risk of ill-treatment.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       For the Cabindans living  in  Cabinda  itself,  the  rule  is  quite
       simple: Avoid being an outspoken to the MPLA and don't  be  a  clear
       supporter of FLEC. Cabinda is the smallest province of Angola yet it
       has the same intelligence,  police,  army,  security  forces  for  a
       standard normal province such as  Luanda  and  for  a  larger  city.
       Therefore, the province is highly controlled. If it happens  that  a
       Cabindan, living in Cabinda, is suspected of being a FLEC  supporter
       and/or UNITA and/or CASE-CE supporter,  the  authorities  will  make
       their   lives   impossible   ranging   from   blocking    employment
       opportunities, pressures, corruption by  money,  interrogations  and
       very  possible  imprisonments.  Since  Cabinda  is  not   connected,
       geographically, to Greater Angola and since the press (there is only
       state radio and one  commercial  radio  and  Jornal  de  Angola)  is
       severely   controlled,   therefore,   such    imprisonment    and/or
       mistreatments are difficult to monitor and to report on.


       7. What languages do Cabindans speak?


       UNHCR response,


       Flote and Portuguese.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       Normally, the Angolan from the Cabinda province do speak  Portuguese
       as well as the local  language  such  as  Ibinda,  Tchiowe  and  the
       languages of the two Congo: Lingala and  French.  There  is  a  high
       percentage of Angolan  from  Cabinda  province  that  speaks  fluent
       French due to their emigration to the Congos during the civil war of
       Angola. The newer generation normally does not speak French but have
       a basic understanding of it.


       8. How likely would language be in exposing a  person  to  risk  (if
       any)?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no report that would establish that a person  from  Cabinda
       is at risk by virtue of his/her language. Portuguese is the national
       language of Angola.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       None. You can easily speak  the  language  of  your  choice  in  the
       Cabinda province. Due to the high presence of foreigners, English is
       used as well. The local population is  somehow  more  familiar  with
       English and French (also due to the migrants of West Africa) that in
       Greater Angola. But if you are a visiting diplomat or representative
       of a foreign government, it is best to be accompanied with  a  local
       person who will make the translation for you.


       9. What is the procedure at the airport for the reception of  failed
       asylum seekers returned from Europe? (I gather the Dutch  have  some
       agreement with the Angolan government on returnees.)


       UNHCR response,


       We are not aware of particular procedures for those in possession of
       a national passport. Those with other type of travel  document  such
       as 'Salvo Conducto' are normally submitted to an  interview  at  the
       airport. Essentially, the purpose of this interview is to  ascertain
       the Angolan nationality.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       I am not qualified to answer this question and have  no  information
       on this procedure.


       10. Any evidence to suggest that a returned Cabindan  failed  asylum
       seeker will face interrogation and ill-treatment at the airport?  If
       so, to what degree?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no evidence of the sort unless the individual is  returning
       using travel documents other than the  national  passport.  In  this
       case,  the  individual  will   most   probably   be   submitted   to
       interrogation, but no reported cases of ill-treatment.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       Yes, Cabindan failed asylum seekers will definitely and surely  face
       interrogation at airport  when  returning  especially  if  they  are
       suspected of being clear/outspoken FLEC supporter. There will be  no
       ill-treatment but they will be  retained  the  days  of  questioning
       until the state intelligence 'clears' them and release them. In some
       cases, the situation degenerated  and  the  Cabindan  failed  asylum
       seeker will get beaten and physically molested during  interrogation
       with state intelligence officers that were looking for information.


       11. If no general risk is there any evidence to suggest that a young
       male Cabindan would face a risk of ill-treatment?


       UNHCR response,


       There is no evidence.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       Cabinda failed asylum seeker males  are  more  prone  to  face  ill-
       treatment.


       12. How is the internal public  transportation  system  arranged  in
       Angola?
       Are there buses taxis etc?   Is  internal  transportation  generally
       available and affordable?  What are the levels of cost involved?


       UNHCR response,


       Private taxis are available as well as public transportation. Public
       transportation are widely available and cost 100 Kwanza for a  ride,
       although one might need to take several  taxis  ('candongueiro')  to
       get home, hence might have to pay more than 100 Kwanza.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       There are  taxis  mostly:  both  public  and  private  taxi.  It  is
       recommended to hire a private taxi and  negotiate  a  fare  per  day
       and/or for the duration of  the  stay.  Recommended  also  that  the
       driver is authorised to drive in all the province with you  and  can
       speak at least one local  language,  besides  Portuguese.  SFCG  can
       provide references.


       Internal transportation is available and affordable. Make sure  that
       you have authorisation from government to travel  in  municipalities
       other than the Cabinda province. The transportation is safe and  the
       transportation personnel is  quite  courteous  in  relation  to  the
       Luanda one. It is highly recommended to have a driver that can drive
       you in the other municipalities.


       [The cost] is all based on negotiation with a private owner  of  the
       car or the car rental company. The average price with driver cost is
       between 10,000-12,000 Kwanzas for a standard SUV car.


       13. Is there any evidence to indicate that persons arriving  by  air
       at Luanda airport would be unable to  travel  or  that  such  travel
       would be unduly harsh from Luanda to the port of Soyo in Angola  and
       thence by ferry to Cabinda?


       UNHCR response,


       There are regular flights from Luanda to Soyo and Cabinda.  We  have
       no information in respect of the use of ferry from Soyo  to  Cabinda
       or the use of boat transportation from Luanda Soyo.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       That is impossible so far. You can take the  air-taxi  shuttle  from
       Soyo to Cabinda but the best way is to travel directly  from  Luanda
       to Cabinda was one of the airlines. We  recommend  TAAG.  For  TAAG,
       please use always the  first  daily  flight  or  last  daily  flight
       to/from Cabinda. Those ones are never cancelled whereas  the  second
       or third services are often schedule due to plane delay or  lack  of
       passengers. Since the first one occurs at 6 am and the last  one  at
       20h40 pm, it is gives enough time to work during a full day.


       14. Could you provide locally available  information  on  the  ferry
       from Angola to Cabinda including timings, ticket costs?


       UNHCR response,


       See above.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       There is no ferry (water transportation from  Soyo  to  the  Cabinda
       city).


       15. Please could you provide locally available  information  on  air
       flights the ferry from Angola (Luanda) to Cabinda including timings,
       ticket costs?


       UNHCR response,


       In respect of flights from Luanda to Cabinda: one  trip  cost  about
       150 USD. Flight timetable is as follows: 6h00 am; 11h30 am, 16h00 an
       20h00.  But this timetable can change from one week to the other, as
       sometimes flight and timetable varies.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       For the flight, please check out the www.taag.com website  and  then
       the domestic routes schedule. But normally there are  three  flights
       to/from Luanda to Cabinda: a) 6:40 am b) 11 am c) 6 pm.  The  flight
       takes about 45-50 minutes and then takes off  back  to  Luanda.  The
       prices range on the classes, airfare basis etc.  The  average  price
       for a round trip ticket from Luanda to Cabinda  is  25,000  Kwanzas.
       [Currently, about US$250]


       16.  Is there any evidence of security  checks  on  those  embarking
       from Soyo to Cabinda whether at Soyo or on arrival at Cabinda.


       UNHCR response,


       There are security checks performed on those embarking from Soyo  to
       Cabinda and to Cabinda upon arrival, like in  all  airports  of  the
       country.


       Search for Common Ground response,


       Regular check and standard  internationally  accepted  safety  check
       occurs.

The questions agreed by the parties

   91. In what we regard as a sensible and  useful  practice,  the  parties
       agreed a series of questions that are or may be material.  They are:


   a. Whether the authorities consider anyone who is from Cabinda  as  being
      allied to FLEC?
   b. What would one have to be able to do to convince (or seek to convince)
      the Angolan authorities of one's not being allied to FLEC?
   c. What the procedure would be with regards to questioning  Cabindans  on
      return to Angola (if any)?
   d. How difficult internal movement in Angola for Cabindans is currently?
   e. What is the availability of shipping between Luanda and Cabinda  (i.e.
      travel to and from same by water)?
   f.    What is the cost of such travel if possible?
   g. What, if any, internal displacement there is due  to  war/conflict  in
      Angola/Cabinda currently?
   h. How likely language would be in exposing a person to risk (if any)?
   j. Situation for Cabindans over and above the above.

Submissions

   92. Extensive skeleton arguments have been provided.   Both  sides  have
       produced two each.

   93. The appellant maintains that there is an ongoing risk  to  Cabindans
       returned to Angola. It is, of course, accepted that there have  been
       welcome developments, although it is said these are mainly  economic
       in character.    Ms Akinbolu submitted that the conflict between the
       ruling party  and  UNITA  has  ceased  but  this  does  not  have  a
       sufficiently marked impact on  returnees  to  Cabinda.   We  should,
       however, note that the HIIK Conflict  Barometer  adopts  a  somewhat
       different approach.

   94. She submitted there is general  consensus  that  the  government  is
       guilty of human right abuses and that the government  is  continuing
       to maintain a counter-insurgency campaign so that  returnees  remain
       at real risk.

   95. Ms Akinbolu argued that much has been made of the 2006 Memorandum of
       Understanding as a peace accord but that the  MOU  did  not  receive
       widespread support and at least a section of FLEC  do  not  consider
       themselves bound by it. Fighters on the ground, she  said,  continue
       to take their instructions from Paris. She maintains  that  FLEC  is
       (in her words) a 'joined up'  organisation  whose  stated  aims  are
       devised by its political wing but intended to be carried out by  its
       military wing. She accepted that this  was  a  low-level  insurgency
       with relatively few incidents.  However, she argued that it  is  not
       the level of activity that FLEC now manages to  engage  in  but  the
       response of the Angolan government to it. Cabinda is governed by the
       Angolan Armed Forces and they  provide  security,  border  controls,
       checkpoints  and  similar  security  measures,  a   role   performed
       elsewhere by the  police.  It  has  resulted  in  concerns  by  NGOs
       including UNHCR. There is evidence of  raids,  checkpoints,  regular
       stop and search as well as arbitrary arrests by those  perceived  to
       support FLEC. Once detained, it is the unanimous view that there  is
       a  risk;  indeed,  torture  is  present  throughout  all   detention
       facilities. The appellant's case is that FLEC are still  active  and
       that the government is attempting to combat  the  threat  it  poses,
       including by taking military action in the  course  of  which  human
       rights abuses are noted and a risk of Article  3  violations  arise.
       The risk is that identified in paragraphs 14 and 15 of FP.  Controls
       at the airport are thorough.  Failed asylum seekers are not at  risk
       for  that  reason  alone  but  are  likely  to  be   questioned   or
       interrogated to establish their identity and  whether  they  are  of
       interest to the authorities for political or criminal  reasons.  The
       responses by the US State  Department  and  the  Search  for  Common
       Ground,  the  answer  to  question  10,  annex   Ad   support   this
       proposition.   Ms Akinbolu accepted the response does not amount  to
       ill-treatment but submitted that this  does  not  tie  in  with  the
       broader background information that detention does establish a risk.

   96. The appellant relies upon the answers to questions 4 and  5  of  the
       Search for Common Ground and its advice: 'avoid being  a  critic  of
       the government or demonstrate support for FLEC'.

   97. Ms Akinbolu, therefore argued that a broad interest on the  part  of
       the authorities coupled with tight controls would cause  authorities
       to have an  interest,  at  the  very  least,  in  a  person  in  the
       appellant's position. He is likely to be asked about his background.
       Checks will be made. That process attracts a real risk of  a  breach
       of his Article 3 rights. The risk, she maintains, is on arrival  and
       therefore internal relocation does not arise. Even if  the  Tribunal
       were to consider a return to Cabinda, then the same risk  occurs  in
       Cabinda. The Angolan authorities maintain security at border control
       points and, if anything, it is greater in Cabinda  than  in  Luanda.
       Travel to Cabinda suggests  that  air  travel  is  the  only  viable
       option; there is no reference to ferry transport in  the  background
       material.

   98.  If  relocation  to  Luanda  is  to  be  considered,  there  are  an
       undetectable number of IDPs and those who internally travel  are  at
       the lowest end of the economic ladder. The appellant  would  not  be
       able to maintain a reasonable life: he returns  with  no  particular
       skills and the booming economy benefits only those who  are  at  the
       top.

   99. In response, Mr Parkinson referred to C23 of the respondent's bundle
       and a Lonely Planet travel forum which records the  exploits  of  an
       Australian traveller who travelled from Soyo in Angola to Cabinda by
       ferry.  He refers to the ferry departing  every  other  day,  taking
       about 5 hours and costing approximately US$45.

  100. Mr Parkinson submitted that even if  the  breakaway  group  of  FLEC
       (FAC) maintains its struggle against the  Angolan  authorities,  the
       only significant matter is the January 2010 incident  involving  the
       team bus of Togo nationals. The responsibility for this is confused.
       One source identifying Rodriguez Mingas from FLEC (PM), an otherwise
       unidentified group as being responsible, a suggestion  dismissed  by
       FLEC (FAC), anxious  to  maintain  its  position  as  the  principal
       faction. This was enormously embarrassing public relations  disaster
       for the government which, Mr Parkinson accepted, resulted in a clear
       response by way of a crackdown over a period of perhaps  18  months.
       However, he said, it was a singular event and, apart from it,  there
       is little to indicate that a serious  on-going  conflict  is  taking
       place. Compare this situation, for example, with  the  LTTE  in  Sri
       Lanka where the LTTE area was a state within-a-state, subject to  an
       on-going military campaign with inevitable  consequences  for  those
       opposed to, or perceived to be, in  opposition  to  the  government.
       The Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research  offers
       a more reliable gauge.  There is no reliable evidence that FLEC is a
       significant  force  in  Cabinda  but,  given  the  government  is  a
       repressive one, it is not surprising that it maintains a high  level
       of its armed forces there.

  101. The response from Search for Common Ground, question 5,  establishes
       there is no evidence that a Cabindan is at real risk for that reason
       alone. Those detained are those suspected of being  associated  with
       FLEC or the opposition, that is, human  rights  defenders,  lawyers,
       activists and those with a profile.

  102. The Dutch government no longer consider there remains a risk of  ill
       treatment.  Nor does UNHCR in its 2012 report: there is no longer  a
       need  for  refugee  status  for  former  Cabindans  located  outside
       Cabinda. The interrogation of prisoners is  to  be  contrasted  with
       others who are not in detention. It is clear that there are  returns
       from Switzerland and Finland.  Given  the  number  of  NGOs  on  the
       ground, if there were ill-treatment, UNHCR would have reacted.

  103. The United Kingdom Embassy letter makes reference to members of  the
       government including those from Cabinda  including  those  who  were
       part of FLEC.  Bembe is a notable example.  The IOM has  a  presence
       in Angola.

  104. As the informants make clear in answer to questions 1 and 2,  it  is
       not necessary to return to Cabinda if the appellant does not wish to
       do so.


  105. In reply, Ms Akinbolu drew to our  attention  the  evidence  of  the
       UNHCR return programme and the IRIN report [84, above]  which  makes
       it clear that Cabindans remain in fear of returning and the  January
       Human Rights Watch report speaks of  on-going military action and on-
       going concerns of NGOs precisely because of  the  on-going  military
       response by Angolan government forces. A specific risk of torture is
       posed  to  those  who  are  tortured  to  disclose  associates   and
       associations.

Our analysis - Generalised Violence and Armed Conflict

  106.  This  determination  is  principally  concerned  with  the  Angolan
       authorities' attitude to Cabindans.  In passing,  however,  we  have
       assessed the evidence  before  us  as  to  more  general  levels  of
       violence and the Angolan authorities' attitude  towards  opposition.
       We  have  mentioned  the  Heidelberg  Institute's   methodology   in
       assessing levels of conflict and its assessment  that  the  conflict
       between the government and UNITA/CASA-CE has ascribed to it a  level
       of intensity calibrated at intensity level 3, low-level violence. We
       remind ourselves that there are examples of heavy-handed response by
       government forces to the  actions  of  the  opposition  groups,  for
       example,  when  UNITA  tried  to  deliver  assistance   to   illegal
       settlements in February 2013, the security forces used violent force
       against them, similarly the allegation of May 2013 when it was  said
       MPLA members attacked a group of 23 UNITA members who were preparing
       a rally.

  107.  That  said  the  August  2012  election  has  been   described   as
       'anticlimactic' with much voter apathy.  UNITA doubled its share  of
       the vote from 2008 to 18.66%

  108. This material establishes that neither Angola as a whole nor Cabinda
       is in a state of conflict or generalised violence  at  such  a  high
       level that persons are at risk of persecution or serious harm or ill-
       treatment  merely  by  virtue  of  being   civilians.   Indeed   the
       preponderance of the evidence indicates that armed conflict  is  low
       and incidents are sporadic and numerically few.

The risk faced by Cabindans or in Cabinda

  109. We will begin by attempting to  answer  the  questions  the  parties
       themselves  have  agreed  merit  consideration.   Before  doing  so,
       however, it is crucial to point out that  whilst  Angola's  laws  on
       civil liberties are generally consistent with  international  norms,
       the problem lies in whether reality lives  up  to  those  standards.
       Paragraphs  26  to  46  above  pinpoint  the  problems.   There   is
       significant  evidence  of  human  rights  abuses,  including  within
       Cabinda and affecting Cabindans, problems of  arbitrary  arrest  and
       detention,  ill-treatment  in  detention,  poor  prison  conditions,
       restrictions on freedom of  expression,  government  action  against
       protest and limitations in  the  legal  system  and  security  laws.
       These problems do not  render  all  those  returning  to  Angola  or
       Cabinda at risk of serious harm, whether or not they are  Cabindans.
       The effect is that in order to establish a real risk, an  individual
       has to establish that, by reason of circumstances as they relate  to
       him, there is a reasonable likelihood he will come into contact with
       the authorities in a way that will result in his detention.  This is
       sometimes referred  to  as  arising  by  reason  of  'his  profile'.
       Arbitrary exercise of force against an individual, being  arbitrary,
       presupposes no rational basis for it.  The fact that such  incidents
       do occur does not, however, establish a reasonable  likelihood  that
       all Angolans are at risk.


  110.  The  fact  that  the  presence  of  the  Angolan  armed  forces  is
       proportionately higher in Cabinda than elsewhere in Angola  shows  a
       continuing concern on the part of the  government  about  separatist
       activities and, consequently, a greater potential for  the  exercise
       of force, but the evidence still falls well  short  of  establishing
       that all Cabindans are at a real risk of harm.  This applies equally
       to an individual returning to Luanda and to  greater  Angola  as  it
       does to Cabinda.

Whether the authorities consider anyone who is from Cabinda as being  allied
to FLEC?


  111. Although it is suggested that the Angolan authorities equate being a
       Cabindan with being a member of FLEC, we emphatically  reject  this.
       The Angolan authorities do not equate being a Cabindan with being  a
       member of or supporter of FLEC.   It is axiomatic that any member or
       supporter of FLEC will be a Cabindan but the reverse  is  not  true.
       The size, effectiveness, recent record and goals of FLEC  are  plain
       as they  emerge  from  the  background  material.   The  Bertelsmann
       Transformation Index 2014 estimated the remaining armed FLEC members
       to be a few hundred men.  Jane's Sentinel  Security  Assessment  for
       Angola  (August  2013)  spoke  of  incidents  being   sporadic   and
       localised. The group who attacked the Togo football team was said to
       number  15  FLEC  fighters  by  Mingas,  one   of   those   claiming
       responsibility  and  the  attack  lasted  for  about   30   minutes.
       Bertelsmann Transformation Index 2012 thought  that  the  crack-down
       after the Togo football team attack and the arrest in  2011  of  the
       chief of staff of the faction involved were likely to  have  put  an
       end to Cabindan military  resistance  to  the  Angolan  state.   The
       readiness of the Paris  exiles  to  lay  down  their  arms  strongly
       supports  recognition  by  them  of  a  reduced  level  of   violent
       intervention. The Heidelberg Institute  for  International  Conflict
       Research (2013), in  the  passage  summarised  in  paragraphs  74-75
       above, saw no change in the intensity level since  its  last  report
       and an intensity level described as level 1, that  is,  a  political
       conflict carried out completely without resorting  to  violence  and
       without the threat of violence. The US State Department 2012  Report
       on Human Rights Practices, [, paragraph 66  above]  in  contrast  to
       earlier years, spoke of there being no reports  of  security  forces
       detaining  Cabindan  residents  suspected  of   FLEC   activity   or
       collaboration.


  112. The evidence fails to establish that FLEC currently  operates  at  a
       level such as to represent a real threat to the Angolan  authorities
       although they are keen to take measures to ensure that there  is  no
       resurgence of its activities.  Nor does the evidence establish  that
       FLEC reflects the views and aspirations of a majority of  Cabindans,
       notwithstanding the fact that the Cabindan sense of social  identity
       remains very strong and separation from Angola remains an aspiration
       shared by many. We consider that  it  is  likely  that  the  Angolan
       authorities  readily  understand  the   distinction   between   FLEC
       membership or  support  and  Cabindan  self-assertion.  Indeed,  the
       government's efforts to spend money on infrastructure in Cabinda and
       to afford it some form of special status demonstrate  a  willingness
       to win over the hearts and minds of Cabindans rather  than  to  view
       them as potential  terrorists.  The  evidence  also  suggests  that,
       amongst Cabindans, there is a divergence of  opinion,  some  seeking
       independence   whilst   others   seek   greater   autonomy.    These
       considerations must inform the Angolan  authorities'  assessment  of
       the likelihood that an  individual  from  Cabinda  is,  or  may  be,
       associated with FLEC.

  113. The Tribunal's conclusion in paragraph 24 of FP  that  there  is  an
       unknown degree of  risk  that  the  Angolan  authorities  have  some
       knowledge of individuals, perhaps of families, who are FLEC  members
       or that there is a risk that,  even  without  such  knowledge,  they
       would suppose a  person  to  be  a  FLEC  supporter,  is  no  longer
       supported by the background material we have considered.


What would one have to be able to do to convince (or seek to  convince)  the
Angolan authorities of one's not being allied to FLEC?

  114. We do not consider that an individual needs to convince the  Angolan
       authorities that he is not a FLEC activist or supporter since  there
       is no presumption on the part of the Angolan authorities that he is.
       We accept that it would obviously court danger for a FLEC fighter to
       reveal his activities to the Angolan authorities and, by  parity  of
       reasoning, for a Cabindan who aspires to a separate  Cabindan  state
       to express his views in  such  outspoken  terms  as  to  excite  the
       hostility of those members of the Angolan armed forces with whom  he
       is speaking.  But such a degree of caution  does  not  amount  to  a
       violation of his right to enjoy his sense of identity as a Cabindan.
        It will be assumed by the authorities that he shares  the  Cabindan
       sense of social identity and may  well  aspire  to  separation  from
       Angola, but these features, common amongst Cabindans, do not lead to
       a real risk of harm.


What the procedure would be with regards to questioning Cabindans on  return
to Angola (if any)?

  115. There is clear evidence  of  normal  security  checks  at  airports,
       including Luanda airport on arrival.  We would expect  those  checks
       to be thorough. They  will  be  directed  towards  establishing  the
       identity of the person entering  the  country.  Where  the  identity
       document produced by the returnee is valid and in a form  acceptable
       to the authorities, there will be no  reason  for  suspicion  to  be
       aroused. There is no credible evidence before  us  to  suggest  that
       entry procedures are conducted by the Security Service or  that  any
       heightened attention is paid  to  those  returning  from  particular
       countries. Thus, whilst we are satisfied that  security  checks  are
       conducted at border posts, we are not satisfied  those  checks  will
       lead to arrest and detention unless there is a specific  reason  for
       attention.


  116. There is evidence [83, above] that at remote land border  posts  the
       discipline of the individuals manning those posts  may  be  lax  and
       pose particular threats to those using them.  The risk, however,  is
       not suggested to arise from any suspicion that the individual  is  a
       member of FLEC; rather, it is the unrelated risk  of  extortion  and
       misbehaviour which falls well below a generalised or real risk.

How difficult is internal movement in Angola  for  Cabindans  is  currently?
What is the availability  of  shipping  between  Luanda  and  Cabinda  (i.e.
travel to and from same by water)? What  is  the  cost  of  such  travel  if
possible?

  117. There are no obvious difficulties in  Cabindans  travelling  between
       Angola and the enclave of Cabinda by air. There is no clear evidence
       of a regular ferry system, although the Secretary of State  produced
       an account from one seasoned western traveller who had travelled the
       coast by boat. However, the predominance of  the  evidence  is  that
       ferries do not operate and the preferred method of transport  is  by
       air  via  the  national  airline.   Although  the  road  network  is
       improving, the FCO's advice is  against  its  use.  What  is  clear,
       however, is that there are no obstacles for  a  returnee  to  Luanda
       airport in making an onward journey to Cabinda.


  118. The cost of travel does not act as a practical bar, see the response
       to question 15, page 32, above.

  119. It is as well to recall that in FP (Return - Cabinda - Non-Luandan),
       the AIT concluded that travel to Cabinda from Luanda was excluded as
       a practical possibility.  That conclusion no longer holds good.

What  if  any  internal  displacement  there  is  due  to  war/conflict   in
Angola/Cabinda currently?

  120. When FP was decided, the aftermath of the civil war had resulted  in
       a humanitarian crisis.   There  was  massive  internal  displacement
       caused by the civil war principally  fought  between  the  MPLA  and
       UNITA.  The humanitarian situation in Luanda was variously described
       as critical and wretched.  The situation is very different now.   We
       do not know the fate of the millions displaced,  the  thousands  who
       fled to neighbouring countries or the half a million  in  the  camps
       around Luanda.  As we have pointed out [84, above], there are  those
       who were afforded refugee status in the DRC but whose refugee status
       has now been withdrawn and, after many years in the DRC, do not wish
       to return home.  Some fear they will be treated as former member  of
       FLEC, indeed some may have been FLEC members, but  the  evidence  is
       clearly insufficient to establish that all those returning to Angola
       will be suspected of being former FLEC fighters and at risk  because
       of it.


  121. The US State Department 2012 Report on Human  Rights  Practices,  19
       April 2013, noted:

         Officially there were no longer significant numbers  of  lOPs.  The
         majority of persons previously considered lOPs either returned home
         or did not intend to return  to  their  area  of  origin,  as  many
         considered their new locations to be home. Some stated  a  lack  of
         physical infrastructure, government services such as medical  care,
         and the presence of land  mines  were  major  deterrents  to  their
         return.


  122. Suffice it to say that the humanitarian crisis no longer exists.

How likely language would be in exposing a person to risk (if any)?

  123.  Language  is   a   distinctive   method   of   identification   but
       identification as a Cabindan is not sufficient to establish  a  real
       risk.


Situation for Cabindans over and above the above.

  124. Our assessment of risk is a composite exercise  since  there  is  no
       material distinction between  risk  of  persecution,  the  need  for
       humanitarian protection or a violation of the appellant's article  3
       rights. Instead, our focus has been on the assessment of whether the
       appellant faces the reasonable likelihood of serious harm on  return
       to Angola.  Our  twin  considerations  have  been  directed  towards
       Angola itself, including the situation at the airport, and in Luanda
       generally on the one hand  and  the  situation  at  the  airport  in
       Cabinda, and in Cabinda generally, on the  other,  as  well  as  the
       means of travel from Luanda to Cabinda.  Whilst these may be trigger-
       points, none of them pose a  risk  in  normal  circumstances  to  an
       Angolan or Cabindan returning to the country.

Internal relocation

  125. The evidence establishes that there is freedom of  movement  between
       all the  provinces  of  Angola,  including  Cabinda.   There  is  no
       evidence of a registration system that operates as a clog and  UNHCR
       in its response to the United Kingdom Embassy states that  there  is
       no such registration system.  The  evidence  establishes  there  are
       many Cabindans who  live  in  greater  Angola,  often  for  economic
       reasons.   There is no evidence to  suggest  that,  in  general,  it
       would be unduly harsh for a Cabindan to relocate to greater  Angola,
       at least, by relocation to Luanda.


  126. The risk posed to a person returning to Angola will depend upon  the
       threat he poses or, more importantly, the threat he is perceived  to
       pose to the Angolan authorities. Whilst individuals in the  security
       forces may not always  act  rationally,  there  is  no  evidence  of
       widespread random violence meted out at  the  point  of  return,  as
       opposed  to  what  the  evidence  suggests   occurs   in   detention
       facilities. The perception of threat on  the  part  of  the  Angolan
       authorities will, inevitably, vary depending upon the  intensity  of
       the conflict with which the authorities are  engaged  from  time  to
       time. Where there is a full on-going conflict of violent  intensity,
       the level of scrutiny likely to be operated by  the  authorities  is
       likely to be greater than during a period of relative calm  with  an
       attendant greater risk posed to those perceived to be  a  threat  or
       potential threat.

  127. Our assessment is that  FLEC  no  longer  represents  a  significant
       military  or  political  force  capable  of  organising  a  military
       opposition to the  government.   We  do  not  accept  Ms  Akinbolu's
       suggestion that the organisation is well-defined by reference  to  a
       political wing directing and  controlling  a  military  wing  within
       Cabinda  itself  or,  for  that  matter,  Angola.   We  accept   the
       government has adopted a policy of stonewalling any suggestion  that
       the conflict even exists which does not  assist  in  our  assessment
       but, on the other hand, the presence of a number of NGOs in the area
       has not produced hard evidence of a significant insurgency.  In  the
       current climate, there is little room for a perception on  the  part
       of the Angolan authorities that a person returning  to  Angola  will
       pose a threat to Angola by reason of links with FLEC in the  absence
       of evidence justifying the suspicion.


Conclusions


  128. FP (Return - Cabinda - Non-Luandan) Angola CG [2003] UKIAT 00204  no
       longer provides an accurate assessment of  country  conditions.   It
       ceases to be country guidance.


  129. There is significant evidence  of  human  rights  abuses,  including
       within Cabinda and affecting Cabindans, problems of arbitrary arrest
       and detention, ill-treatment in detention, poor  prison  conditions,
       restrictions on freedom of  expression,  government  action  against
       protest and limitations in  the  legal  system  and  security  laws.
       However, these problems do not render all those returning to  Angola
       or Cabinda to be at risk of serious harm, whether or  not  they  are
       Cabindans.

  130. Unless there exists  a  situation  in  which  there  is  generalised
       violence or armed conflict at a very high level (which  is  not  the
       case here) in order to establish a real risk of harm, an  individual
       has to establish that, by reason of circumstances as they relate  to
       him, there is a reasonable likelihood he will come into contact with
       the authorities in a way that will result in his detention.

  131. The Angolan authorities do not equate being a Cabindan with being  a
       member of or supporter of FLEC.

  132. The evidence fails to establish that FLEC currently  operates  at  a
       level such as to represent a real threat to the Angolan  authorities
       although they are keen to take measures to ensure that there  is  no
       resurgence of its activities. Nor does the evidence  establish  that
       FLEC reflects the views and aspirations of a majority of  Cabindans,
       notwithstanding the fact that the Cabindan sense of social  identity
       remains very strong and separation from Angola remains an aspiration
       shared by many.  The  Angolan  authorities  readily  understand  the
       distinction between FLEC membership or support  and  Cabindan  self-
       assertion.

  133. There is clear evidence  of  normal  security  checks  at  airports,
       including Luanda airport on arrival.  Those checks are likely to  be
       thorough and directed  towards  establishing  the  identity  of  the
       person entering the country.

  134. There are no obstacles in a returnee to  Luanda  airport  making  an
       onward journey to Cabinda. The finding in FP that travel to  Cabinda
       from Luanda is excluded as a  practical  possibility  is  no  longer
       correct.

  135.  Language  is   a   distinctive   method   of   identification   but
       identification as a Cabindan is not sufficient to establish  a  real
       risk.

  136. A person of Cabindan origin returning to Angola will not in  general
       be at real risk of ill-treatment by reason of his  or  her  Cabindan
       origin.  Such a person is reasonably likely to be detained (with the
       accompanying risk of ill-treatment) only if he or she has a  history
       of active involvement with FLEC (or one of  its  factions,  such  as
       FLEC-PM or FLEC-FAC).  Excluded from those at risk  are  individuals
       formerly associated  with  the  pro-government  FLEC-Renewal  (FLEC-
       Renovada) or Antonio Bembe.

  137. A person's Cabindan origin will not, in general, preclude  him  from
       living or working in Luanda or some other part of Angola.

Re-making the decision

  138. The appellant, although a Cabindan, was not a member  of  FLEC.   He
       had not been detained, tortured or escaped as  he  had  claimed.  He
       will be returned to Luanda and is able to fly from there to Cabinda,
       if he chooses to do so.  He  will  be  returned  with  documentation
       sufficient to establish his identity.  There is  nothing  about  his
       circumstances  that  will  excite  the  suspicion  of  the   Angolan
       authorities.  He is not at risk of harm from the Angolan authorities
       on return to Luanda or on onward transit  to  Cabinda.   It  is  not
       unreasonable for him to locate himself in Luanda if he  chooses  not
       to return to Cabinda.

DECISION

    The Judge made an  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  we  substitute  a
    determination
    dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Boyle, Solicitor, Halliday Reeves Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Ms Rackstraw, Home Office Presenting Officer

      REASONS FOR FINDING THAT THE FIRST TIER TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF
                                     LAW


     1. The Appellant, a citizen of  Angola,  born  on  20  November  1987,
        claimed asylum on 14 December 2010 after a clandestine entry to the
        United Kingdom, and his arrest on 29 November 2010. The application
        for asylum was refused, and a decision was made to  remove  him  to
        Angola on 11 January 2011. The  Appellant  sought  to  appeal  that
        decision, and his appeal was heard by  Immigration  Judge  Handley,
        and dismissed on all grounds, in a Determination promulgated on  23
        March 2011.


     2. The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  from  the  First-Tier
        Tribunal, which was granted by Immigration Judge Gibb  on  7  April
        2011 on the basis that  it  was  arguable  the  Judge  had  wrongly
        departed from the country guidance to be  found  in  FP  (Return  -
        Cabinda - Non Luandan) Angola CG [2003] UKIAT 204 having no  proper
        evidential basis for doing so. Thus the matter comes before me.


     3. It was not disputed before the Judge  that  the  Appellant  was  an
        Angolan national, from Cabinda, or that he would  be  perceived  as
        such upon return to the airport at Luanda, which the Respondent had
        confirmed to the Judge would be the point of return to Angola.


     4. The Appellant has raised no challenge to the findings of fact  made
        by the Judge in rejecting the claims; (a) that he was a  member  of
        FLEC (in any of the different  categories  of  membership  of  that
        organisation), or (b) that he had ever worked  for  FLEC,  or,  (c)
        that he had experienced any past persecution in Angola on the basis
        that he was perceived to be a member of FLEC, or, (d) that his body
        bore any scars which resulted from injuries sustained in the way he
        had described, or, (e) that he had in the  past  been  detained  as
        claimed by the authorities in Angola.


     5. Mr Boyle confirmed  that  the  appeal  therefore  turned  upon  the
        discrete issue of how the Appellant would be perceived upon  return
        to Luanda. Thus whether he  as  one  who  would  be  likely  to  be
        perceived to be a failed asylum  seeker  who  had  originated  from
        Cabinda, was at risk as a result of being perceived by the  Angolan
        authorities to be a member, or a supporter, of FLEC,  and  thus  at
        risk of persecution. In the light of the unchallenged  findings  of
        fact it was accepted that this was  not  a  case  that  raised  the
        prospect of the Appellant having to lie, or dissemble, in order  to
        hide his true political allegiances, because the Judge had made  no
        finding in his favour to the effect that he was  even  in  truth  a
        FLEC supporter (no doubt because of his dishonest account  and  his
        inability to give accurate evidence about FLEC).


     6. No separate complaint is made in relation to the  Judge's  approach
        to the human rights appeal.


     7. It is accepted that the Judge correctly identified FP as being  the
        current country guidance in relation to the risks faced upon return
        to Angola of Cabindans, despite  the  passage  of  time  since  its
        promulgation. In paragraph 47 of the Determination the Judge sought
        to summarise that decision, and to apply it to the facts as he  had
        found them to be.


     8. To the extent that Mr Boyle went so far  as  to  say  that  it  was
        improper for the Judge to ignore evidence  of  changes  in  country
        conditions since FP, simply because the Tribunal had not  expressly
        withdrawn current country guidance status from FP, his argument  is
        unsustainable because it  does  not  engage  with  the  President's
        Practice Direction of 4 April 2005, paragraph 18.2,  and  thus  the
        proper status of such a decision. A country guidance case  is  only
        to be treated as an authoritative finding on the  issue  identified
        in the determination, based upon the evidence that was then  before
        the Tribunal. Thus, even if that decision has  not  been  expressly
        superseded, or replaced, by  later  country  guidance  it  is  only
        authoritative in a subsequent appeal  so  far  as  that  subsequent
        appeal; (a) relates to the same issue, and, (b)  depends  upon  the
        same or similar evidence.


     9. Accordingly in my judgement the Judge sought,  quite  properly,  to
        consider the more recent evidence upon Angola that was relied  upon
        by the Respondent.  There were two limbs  to  the  evidence  relied
        upon by the Respondent to establish that there had been a change in
        country conditions since FP.


    10. First, that a returnee could now  travel  by  air  from  Luanda  to
        Cabinda,  and  would  not  therefore  be  required  to   face   the
        difficulties inherent in the overland or  sea  journey  to  Cabinda
        that the Tribunal considered at paragraph 23 of FP.  The  Appellant
        has not sought to rebut or challenge that evidence,  either  before
        the Judge, or subsequently. There is therefore no basis upon  which
        the Appellant can properly challenge the  Judge's  conclusion  that
        the Appellant could upon return to Luanda, take a flight to Cabinda
        if he wished to travel there, without having to make a  journey  to
        Cabinda by land by sea.


    11. Second, that a returnee perceived to be Cabindan would not face the
        difficulties at the Luanda airport that were identified in FP.  The
        Respondent relied upon a  Country  of  Origin  Information  request
        dated 28 October 2008, and the reply dated  30  October  2010.  The
        request read as follows;


           I would be grateful if you could please provide  information  on
           whether the Angolan authorities (particularly the authorities at
           the airport and in Luanda) would perceive an ethnic Cabindan  to
           be a member or supporter of FLEC in the absence of any  evidence
           that he or a family member was actually involved with  FLEC.  If
           you are not able to find anything useful from the usual  sources
           in the public domain, I would appreciate it if you could  please
           approach  the  FCO  Desk  Officer/post  for  their  comments  in
           disclosable form.


        The reply read as follows;


         The UK Foreign Office in an email dated 30  October  2008  stated;
           "Not unless they were a member. It would also depend on if  they
           had been outspoken during their time in exile. If they had  made
           any kind of public statement about independence for Cabinda then
           there is a slim possibility they might be so accused.


    12. It was not suggested by Mr Boyle in the course of argument that the
        Appellant had  relied  before  the  Judge  upon  any  more  recent,
        relevant evidence as to the treatment of those returned to  Angola.
        However subsequent to the hearing, I have had the opportunity to go
        through the whole of the bundle of documents that had been prepared
        by IAS (the Appellant's former  representatives)  and  relied  upon
        before the Judge. I note that this bundle contains a  report  dated
        29 October  2010  prepared  by  the  Refugee  Documentation  Centre
        (Ireland) upon the treatment of those returned to Angola.  It  does
        not appear that the content of this report was  specifically  drawn
        to  the  attention  of  the   Judge   by   the   Appellant's   then
        representatives, because there is no reference to it in either  the
        Skeleton Argument prepared by IAS for the hearing, and no reference
        to it  in  the  Determination.  That  this  report  was  apparently
        overlooked is a pity because its content is of direct relevance  to
        the issue raised by this appeal. That it was apparently  overlooked
        by the Judge means in my judgement that there was an error  of  law
        in his approach to the evidence placed before him.






    13. The 2010 Irish report notes that a UNHCR position paper of  January
        2004 withdrew the advice previously issued to  states  against  the
        involuntary return of  failed  asylum  seekers  to  Angola,  except
        Cabinda. The report notes that whilst UNHCR advice in  relation  to
        Cabinda was reinforced in a paper dated January  2009,  UKBA  in  a
        June 2009 Operational Guidance Note did not accept that all  person
        presenting as from Cabinda were, irrespective of  their  individual
        circumstances, automatically in need of some form of  international
        protection. Neither of  these  documents  was  placed  in  evidence
        before the Judge, or is now placed in evidence before me.






    14. It is in my judgement significant that other  recent  reports  from
        NGOs that are contained in the  bundle  prepared  for  the  hearing
        before the Judge by IAS, also do not echo the guidance to be  found
        in FP as to the likely attitude of the Angolan authorities  towards
        those returned to Angola, who would be perceived as  failed  asylum
        seekers. Thus the Human Rights  Watch  report  upon  Angola  of  24
        January 2011 refers to some recent arbitrary detentions in  Cabinda
        of those suspected to be  rebels,  but  not  of  any  risk  in  the
        remainder of Angola, or Luanda in particular, to those perceived to
        be Cabindan. The US State Department report of 11 March 2010 refers
        to the government's co-operation with the UNHCR, and the  IOM,  and
        other  humanitarian  organisations  in  providing  protection   and
        assistance to internally  displaced  persons,  returning  refugees,
        asylum  seekers,  and  other  persons  of  concern,  and  makes  no
        reference to difficulties faced at the airport  (as  the  point  of
        return) by those perceived by to be Cabindan.


    15. It is not  clear  from  the  Tribunal  file  whether  either  party
        referred the Judge to the COI report upon Angola dated 1  September
        2010, and the Determination does not quote from  it.  Both  parties
        sought however to  place  reliance  upon  that  report  before  me,
        although neither had filed in advance of the hearing, or  was  able
        to produce at the hearing  a  complete  copy  of  it.  Once  I  had
        obtained a complete copy of that document, and the  representatives
        had time to peruse it, it was common ground that this document  did
        not contain either the passage that was quoted in FP as having been
        taken from paragraph 6.55 of the October 2002 CIPU report,  or  any
        passage expressed in similar terms.  Indeed  the  2010  COI  report
        makes no reference to difficulties  faced  by  those  returning  to
        Angola, whether or not they  are  perceived  to  be  failed  asylum
        seekers who  originated  from  Cabinda.  On  the  contrary,  as  Ms
        Rackstraw argued, paragraph 26.01 can only reasonably  be  read  as
        describing a quite different situation;

     26.01    The United States State  Department  2009  Country  Report  on
           Human Rights Practices on Angola stated that:
                "The constitution and law provide for  freedom  of  movement
           within   the   country,   foreign   travel,   emigration,    and
           repatriation; however, the government at times restricted  these
           rights in practice. The government cooperated with the  UN  High
           Commissioner   for   Refugees   (UNHCR),    the    International
           Organization for Migration, and other humanitarian organizations
           in providing protection and assistance to  internally  displaced
           persons (IDPs), returning refugees, asylum  seekers,  and  other
           persons of concern.
                  "Extortion and harassment at  government  checkpoints  in
           rural  areas,  and  at  provincial  and   international   border
           checkpoints, interfered with the right to travel.  Extortion  by
           police was routine in cities on  major  commercial  routes.  The
           government and private security companies restricted  access  to
           designated diamond concessions. Citizens living near  concession
           areas were regularly denied access for  any  purpose,  including
           obtaining water."

    16. The decision of the Presidential panel in FP does not suggest  that
        the Tribunal had the benefit of evidence from any individual called
        by either party and held out as an expert upon the  then  situation
        within Angola. Instead paragraphs 11, 14 and 15  of  that  decision
        clearly record that the Tribunal was  relying  primarily  upon  the
        content of the October 2002 CIPU report in seeking to ascertain the
        likely reception at the airport in Luanda of a failed asylum seeker
        who would be at risk of being perceived to be of  Cabindan  origin.
        Thus;


      14. The problems faced by those returning to Luanda, at the  point  of
           return, is dealt with in paragraph 6.55. It  comments  that  the
           Angolan authorities are well aware of the pressures  which  lead
           to emigration and that asylum  claims  are  used  to  facilitate
           that; the fact of being a failed asylum seeker,  if  discovered,
           would not be of any particular interest. However,  the  controls
           at Luanda Airport are  thorough.  Any  Angolans  who  have  been
           deported from abroad, or who lived abroad for many years,  would
           be questioned by immigration and police at the  airport  with  a
           view to establishing their identities and whether they  were  of
           interest to the authorities for political or criminal reasons

       15. The  Report  describes  prison  conditions,  should  someone  be
           arrested and detained, as constituting a serious threat  to  the
           health and lives of prisoners; paragraph 5.25 states:
           "There is widespread and generalised abuse of suspects. Security
           service personnel regularly employ torture and  other  forms  of
           cruel and degrading treatment including  rape.  Confessions  are
           regularly obtained this way ... ."

    17. The Tribunal went on to conclude;


        24.  The background evidence also shows that he would be identified
           as someone from Cabinda, both because of the languages which  he
           does speak and because of his lack of Portuguese.  He  would  be
           questioned to see if he was of political or  criminal  interest:
           his Cabindan origin, with the current  upsurge  in  fighting  in
           Cabinda,  would  make  that  inevitable.  Although  it  is  only
           realistic  to  suppose  that  he  would  not  reveal  his   FLEC
           membership voluntarily, he would have to have a story to explain
           his departure from Cabinda and  return  to  Luanda  which  would
           stand up to thorough and at least suspicious, if  not  downright
           hostile, questioning. There is an unknown degree  of  risk  that
           the Angolan authorities  have  some  knowledge  of  individuals,
           perhaps of families, who are FLEC members. There is a risk that,
           even without such knowledge, they would suppose him to be a FLEC
           supporter.


    18. It is now some nine years since FP was decided, and  it  is  hardly
        surprising that the evidence suggests  that  conditions  in  Angola
        have changed in that time. It would have been quite wrong  for  the
        Judge to ignore the Presidential Guidance in his  approach  to  the
        assistance he could properly derive from FP but it  is  also  quite
        clear from his Determination that he did not do so.


    19. In the circumstances of this appeal I am satisfied that the  proper
        course is to adjourn the hearing of this appeal to  permit  further
        submissions to be made in relation to the material that was  before
        the Judge, and to which the parties did not refer to in the  course
        of the submissions they did make. Given that neither party seeks to
        disturb the findings of fact made by the Judge, and set  out  above
        in paragraphs 3 & 4, the appeal would  appear  to  give  the  Upper
        Tribunal the  opportunity  to  give  further  country  guidance  in
        relation to Angola, and specifically the risk of detention and  ill
        treatment at the hands of the authorities for those  returnees  who
        are likely to be perceived  to  be  Cabindan.  Directions  will  be
        issued separately, and the matter  listed  for  a  case  management
        hearing, to allow that opportunity to be explored further.






                                                                      Signed


                                Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal JM Holmes


                                                         Dated 26 April 2012

-----------------------
[1] Cabinda is an Angolan exclave in that it is not connected  to  the  rest
of Angola by land.  It is not strictly an enclave, that  is,  a  country  or
part of a country lying  wholly  within  the  boundaries  of  another  since
Cabinda has a coastline and is not entirely surrounded by the DRC,  although
the  DRC  may  well  think  of  it  as  an  enclave.  The  terms  are   used
indiscriminately in relation to Cabinda.
