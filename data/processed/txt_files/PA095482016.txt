                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    David C Clapham SSC, promulgated  on  20  April  2017,  dismissing  his
    appeal against refusal of asylum.

 2. The decision runs to 10 pages.  The grounds of appeal to the UT,  which
    run to 7 pages, might have been more succinct.  Their essential  points
    are these:

      (1). The Judge,  having  accepted  the  appellant's  involvement  with
      environmental organisations perceived as anti-regime, erred by finding
      that irrelevant to the claim.  That  association  gave  him  an  anti-
      regime profile and increased the risk of scrutiny on return.

      (2). The finding that the appellant had no connection  with  PJAK  was
      irrational.  The regime saw environmental organisations as a front for
      PJAK.  It  was  reasonably  likely  that  the  regime  would  see  the
      appellant as a PJAK sympathiser.

      (3). The Judge applied too high a standard of proof when rejecting the
      appellant's account of an Ettela'at raid  on  his  home,  because  his
      account of previous detention and torture had not been  rejected,  and
      too great a burden had been placed upon him to establish his claim.

      (4). The Judge did not give the appellant fair  notice  of  his  point
      that if a significant number of the  Ettela'at  had  attended  at  his
      home, they would have covered the exits, and he would have been unable
      to flee.  It was plausible that the appellant might have fled  through
      a rear exit.

      (5). The Judge gave inadequate reasons for rejecting  the  appellant's
      evidence of escaping.

      (6). The Judge gave inadequate weight  to  documentary  evidence  [not
      specified in the ground] which materially supported his claim.

 3. Mrs O'Brien said that there was a difficulty with the  decision,  which
    made a finding at ï¿½57 of  an  adverse  interest  on  the  part  of  the
    authorities due  to  the  appellant's  involvement  with  environmental
    groups.  That should have led the Judge to consider whether there might
    be anything on record to give rise to a problem  on  return.   In  that
    context, a finding should also have been made on whether the  appellant
    left Iran unlawfully, but that was absent.

 4. Parties agreed that the "adverse  interest"  finding  left  it  unclear
    whether the account of arrest, detention and torture was accepted,  and
    that this was a matter of importance.

 5. There was some  debate  on  whether  any  factual  findings  should  be
    "preserved", but that  could  cut  both  ways,  and  might  lead  to  a
    difficult and artificial exercise of remaking. The outcome  was  agreed
    as follows.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham SSC.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
