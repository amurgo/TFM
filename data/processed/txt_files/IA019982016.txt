Representation:

For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born in 1984.

 2. He arrived in the UK in April 2008 with leave and was  granted  further
    periods of leave until 28 October 2014.  On 16 October 2014  he  sought
    further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (general)  student  migrant.
    However, this was refused in a decision dated 12 April 2016.


 3. The reason for refusal was that  the  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies (CAS) that he had submitted  with  his  application  by  Oxford
    College, London was invalid.  A check by the respondent with the Tier 4
    Sponsor Registrar indicated the college was not listed  as  a  sponsor.
    The appellant was informed of this on 2 February 2016 and  was  allowed
    60 days in order to obtain a new sponsor and CAS but he had not done so
    and thus did not meet the requirements of the Rules.


 4. He appealed.


    First tier hearing


 5. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 27 September 2017 Judge  of  the
    First-Tier Choudhury dismissed the appeal.


 6. The appellant had asked for the case to be dealt with 'on papers'.   In
    fact, it was dealt with as a hearing in absence.


 7. In a brief decision the judge noted that it appeared to be accepted  by
    the appellant that he did not have a valid CAS.  As such he  could  not
    satisfy the Immigration Rules.


 8. The judge ended by noting that it was  alleged  that  the  respondent's
    decision was a  disproportionate  breach  of  his  private  life  under
    Article 8.  However, the judge found that she had "not had the  benefit
    of  any  documentation  or  evidence  (for  example)  ...  any  witness
    statements) from the appellant demonstrating any Article 8 private life
    in the UK".  She concluded that she could not find that  there  is  any
    private life in the UK.


 9. He sought permission to appeal which was granted on 18 December 2017.


    Error of law hearing on 6 February 2018


10. At the hearing on 6 February, at which the appellant was represented, I
    found no merit in what appeared to be a submission that the judge erred
    in failing to find that the respondent acted unfairly in not giving the
    appellant yet more time to try and get a CAS. However, I found error in
    that the judge failed to have regard to a bundle which was received  by
    the Tribunal on 27 September 2017.  Whilst it had no relevance  to  the
    claim under the Rules for which the judge's decision was  unassailable,
    the bundle contained a witness statement in support  of  his  claim  to
    show private life in the UK.


11. In failing to consider material evidence the judge erred.


12. I set aside the decision but only to the  extent  that  the  Article  8
    aspect be reheard. The decision under the Rules stands.


13. It was indicated by counsel  that  he  was  not  ready  to  proceed  to
    rehearing on that day.  I adjourned the matter to the  resumed  hearing
    date on 15 March.








    Resumed hearing


14. On that  date  the  appellant  appeared  alone  although  he  said  his
    solicitors were still on record.


15. I invited him to say anything he wished in support  of  his  Article  8
    claim.  He indicated  he  was  not  seeking  to  lodge  any  up-to-date
    statement or any other items.  He gave brief evidence.


16. Having done a Master's Degree in Pakistan he came  to  the  UK  seeking
    practical study.  He achieved an MBA in 2012.  He then wanted to pursue
    an M.Phil with a view eventually to working in  a  technology  company,
    but following the revocation of the Oxford College, London, licence  he
    was not able in the time available to get  an  offer.   Such  had  been
    beyond his control.  He had lost ï¿½2,000 in fees paid to Oxford College.


17. Asked how he supported himself he said he worked in a shop for 20 hours
    a week.  It was enough to get by.  A brother in the UK met  his  other,
    more major, costs.


18. He added that he had married in October 2017, a woman  originally  from
    the Philippines who works as a housekeeper.  She has  indefinite  leave
    to remain.


19. Asked about family in Pakistan he said his parents and various siblings
    are there.  Asked if his wife would go with him to Pakistan if  he  was
    required to leave he said he thought she would.


20. In brief submissions Mr Nath accepted that the appellant in  the  years
    he had been here had established a private life.  However, having  come
    here  to  study  he  had  achieved  his  goal.   He   now   has   ample
    qualifications which would benefit him on return.


21. Mr Nath added that no evidence of the marriage had been  provided.   In
    any event the evidence was that his wife would go with him to  Pakistan
    to continue their family life.


22. Mr Nath added that as the  appellant  had  nearly  achieved  ten  years
    continuous lawful residence  a  different  application  might  be  more
    appropriate.  The appellant had nothing to add.


    Consideration


23. In considering this matter I see no reason to doubt the credibility  of
    the appellant.  He came across as a patently truthful  witness.   I  am
    satisfied that in October 2017 he married as claimed a  lady  from  the
    Philippines who has ILR.


24. I find that he has family  life  here  with  his  wife  albeit  a  very
    recently established family life. There are no children.


25. I find also (and, as indicated,  it  was  not  disputed)  that  he  has
    established a private life here not least because  he  has  spent  nine
    years here, a point he emphasised in the statement lodged for the First-
    Tier hearing.  Apart from his studies there was  little  indication  of
    any wider activities beyond study during that period.


26. I find that his removal would not be an interference with his right  to
    family life because he indicated that his wife would go with him if  he
    asked her to do so.


27. I find that his removal would be an interference with the  exercise  of
    his right to respect for his private life and to have  consequences  of
    such gravity as to engage Article 8. Such interference is in accordance
    with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the  interests
    of the economic wellbeing of the country.


28. In considering proportionality the starting point is  paragraph  276ADE
    'Requirements to be met by an applicant for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    grounds of private life'.


29. Paragraph 276ADE(1) states the requirements to be met by  an  applicant
    for leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that
    at the date of application, the applicant:


           '...


           (vi)  is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the
           UK for less than 20 years ... but there would be very
           significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into the
           country to which he would have to go if required to leave the
           UK.'


30. The appellant does not come close to showing that he  would  face  very
    significant obstacles if returned to Pakistan.  He would  be  returning
    to the country where he has spent the majority of his life.   He  would
    be returning with post-graduate qualifications which it  is  reasonable
    to assume would give him an excellent opportunity to get  accommodation
    and employment and be able to support himself and his wife.

31. He faces no language difficulties.  There are no  medical  issues.   He
    has close family there who would no doubt be able to  give  support  as
    necessary.


32. He cannot succeed under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).


33. Under section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    I give little weight to private life established when  his  immigration
    status was precarious.  His ability to speak English  (section  117B(2)
    is a neutral  factor.   He  is  not  financially  independent  (section
    117B(3)).


34. I see no exceptional circumstances, that is to  say,  circumstances  in
    which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the
    appellant such that refusal would not  be  proportionate.   The  appeal
    cannot succeed under Article 8 outside the Rules.


35. In summary, having considered the balancing  exercise  and  giving  due
    weight to the public interest in removal, I find  that  the  Article  8
    claim is nowhere near sufficiently strong to outweigh it.


36. The Article 8 appeal fails.
