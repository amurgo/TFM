Representation
For the Appellants:    Fawad Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Ian Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are appealing against a decision of Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Alis promulgated on 12  November  2019  dismissing  their
    appeal made under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2016.

 2. On 27 March 2020, permission to appeal  was  granted  on  a  procedural
    fairness point.

 3. On  10  July  2020,  directions  were  issued  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
    expressing the preliminary view that the error of  law  issue  in  this
    appeal could be determined without a hearing.

 4. On 31 July 2020, Mr Jarvis, on behalf of the respondent, accepted  that
    there  had  been  procedural  unfairness.  He  also  stated  that   the
    consequence of the error was that a core issue in the  appeal  remained
    undecided.

 5. In the light of the  position  of  the  respondent,  I  find  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal should be set aside  on  the  basis
    that it involved the making of an error on a point of law.  The  nature
    of the accepted  error  is  such  that  the  appeal  will  need  to  be
    considered afresh with no findings preserved. Having  regard  to  para.
    7.2 of the Practice Statements of the Immigration and  Asylum  Chambers
    of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, I have decided that  the
    appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

 a. The appeal is allowed.

 b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the appeal  is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh by  a  different
    judge.
