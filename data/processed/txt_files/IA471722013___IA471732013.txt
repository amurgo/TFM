Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Solomon, Counsel instructed by Zaidi Solicitors
For the Respondent:
On 6 June 2014:   Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
On 18 July 2014:  Ms L Kenny, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this case concerns the welfare of a child the issues  are  not
    personal and I see no justification for  making  an  order  restraining
    publication of the facts of this case.

 2. I gave an extempore ruling on 6 June 2014 that the First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law and the first part of this Decision is  based  closely
    on that extempore ruling.

 3. These are appeals by citizens of the United States of  America  against
    decisions of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing their  appeals  against
    the decision of the respondent to remove them  by  way  of  directions.
    The respondent's decision was made on 31 October 2013.

 4. The first appellant is  female.  She  was  born  in  1975.  The  second
    appellant is her daughter who was born in October 1996.  They came into
    the United Kingdom as visitors at a time when the first  appellant  was
    already pregnant and wanted to be with her husband, a British national.
     They subsequently applied to remain and the  application  was  refused
    under the Rules primarily because the Rules do not permit a person  who
    has entered the United Kingdom as a visitor to remain as a  husband  or
    wife.

 5. The application was also refused with reference to  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights  as  expressed  in  the  Rules  and
    currently  from  the  decision  also  by  considering  the  case  as  a
    freestanding human rights claim.

 6. The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was unsuccessful.  The First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was satisfied that the appellants could not satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules because  they  did  not  have  the  necessary
    capacity in the United Kingdom.  They were visitors and for that reason
    could not succeed.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also decided that they  had  not  made  a
    valid  application  under  the  Rules.  That  is  a  rather  surprising
    decision. It was supported by neither party before me. Indeed before me
    Ms Isherwood quickly disassociated herself from it. It  is  plain  that
    the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  wrong  in  law  in  reaching  that
    conclusion although as far as I can see right in  law  in  deciding  to
    dismiss  the  appeal  under  the  Rules  unless  special  circumstances
    applied.

 8. Mr Solomon sought to get  around  that  conclusion  by  an  interesting
    construction of the Rules which I will seek to explain.  The appellants
    were excluded from succeeding  under  the  Rules  by  E-LTRP.2.1.  This
    provides that an applicant intending to enter the United Kingdom  as  a
    wife or dependent child as the case may be

         ... must not be in the UK-
         (a) as a visitor,
         (b) with valid leave granted for a period of six  months  or  less,
         unless that leave is as a fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil  partner,  or
         was  granted  pending  the  outcome  of  family  court  or  divorce
         proceedings, or
         (c) on temporary admission or temporary release  (unless  paragraph
         EX.1. applies).

 9. Mr Solomon submits that the qualifying words  "unless  paragraph  EX.1.
    applies" are intended to apply to the whole of E-LTRP.2.1 and therefore
    a person in the circumstances of these appellants is  entitled  to  say
    that their case comes within the scope of EX.1. This submission is made
    more attractive by his observation that if his submission is wrong then
    a person who enters the United Kingdom without permission but is  given
    temporary admission is in a better position than a  person  who  enters
    the United Kingdom lawfully as a visitor.

10. I agree that  seems  rather  strange  but  I  do  not  agree  that  the
    interpretation required by a plain reading of the Rules is  so  bizarre
    or otherwise impossible to understand that it is necessary to step back
    and look for an interpretation  of  the  Rules  other  than  the  plain
    meaning. The plain  meaning  of  the  Rules  is  against  Mr  Solomon's
    submission and I rule against it too.  This  is  an  interesting  point
    that may have to be considered further on another occasion but that  is
    my finding about it now.

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's finding  that  the  appeals  should  be
    dismissed outside the Rules for consideration under Article 8  includes
    the observation at paragraph 42:

         "I do not find that the proposed removal of  the  appellants  would
         amount to an interference with  the  exercise  of  their  right  or
         private or family life, nor those of Mr Scott and Kayden."

12. I have to say I find that both startling and wrong.  Firstly  it  shows
    the wrong test.  It was not about respect for "private or family life".
     The separation of "private life" and "family life"  is  encouraged  by
    the Rules but is not what the Convention protects.  It protects private
    and family  life  as  one  concept  along  with  a  person's  home  and
    correspondence. It is my experience that separating the two can lead to
    a misunderstanding for the purposes of the Convention.

13. More significantly I do not see how it can be sustained that a decision
    which requires a mother of a young person in  school,  and  that  young
    person, to leave the United Kingdom and for  the  mother's  husband  to
    make arrangements for the welfare  of  their  infant  child  either  by
    leaving the United Kingdom or by completely reorganising  his  domestic
    arrangements to care for his child,  can  be  anything  other  than  an
    interference with the private  and  family  lives  of  all  the  people
    involved including the husband and father of the child.

14. Whether or not the removal is proportionate is  an  entirely  different
    question.  There may be  circumstances  in  which  it  could  be  found
    properly that it was proportionate but it is completely  wrong  to  say
    that there is no interference.  It follows therefore that  I  find  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law in its decision to dismiss the  appeal
    on human rights grounds.

15. Ms Isherwood, who has argued  energetically  and  forcefully,  contends
    that the decision is not material because  at  the  material  time  the
    appellants could not satisfy the other requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.  So, even if it had been possible to consider other  aspects  of
    the case it would still have led to the appeal  being  refused  because
    the appellant's husband was not earning enough money.

16. Her argument in this respect is flawed.  The consideration of the  case
    outside the Rules would  no  doubt  be  illuminated  by  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules but it is not necessarily the case  that  the
    appeal would have to be dismissed if the financial  requirements  could
    not be met.  I cannot say that the evidence was  immaterial  because  I
    cannot say that proper consideration under Article 8 would  necessarily
    have led to the appeal being dismissed.  It may have done but I  cannot
    say it would have done, so the evidence is material.

17. It follows therefore that I find that there is  before  me  a  material
    error of law on Article 8 grounds and the decision has to be remade.

18. Mr Solomon had indicated that in the event or my ruling that the First-
    tier Tribunal erred in law he would  want  to  apply  to  call  further
    evidence.









                                 DIRECTIONS



19. I adjourned the case and I gave the directions set out below:


         Any party wishing to rely on further evidence must  written  copies
         of that evidence, including a witness statement drawn to  stand  as
         evidence-in-chief  without  need  for  further  questions,  on  the
         tribunal and the other party no later than 5 days before  the  date
         fixed for hear, which is presently 18 July 2014.

20. I think it right to record that E-LTRP.2.1 was amended  and  E-LTRP.2.2
    inserted on 28 July 2014.  The amendment, I find, makes it  clear  that
    the interpretation I  favoured  in  June  2014  is  the  interpretation
    Parliament wants given to the Rule. I do  not  see  that  as  being  an
    effort to make a special case for a person in  the  United  Kingdom  on
    temporary admission.  Rather, I see it as a Rule showing Parliament has
    set its face firmly against allowing visitors or persons with  no  more
    than six months leave to settle  in  the  United  Kingdom  unless  very
    particular conditions applied.

21. On 18 July 2014 the respondent was represented by Ms  L  Kenny,  Senior
    Home Office Presenting Officer.  By 18 July a further bundle  had  been
    prepared which she had been able to consider. It was accepted that  the
    appellants  would  now  satisfy  the  maintenance   and   accommodation
    requirements of the Rules. Given that entirely sensible  concession  it
    is not  necessary  to  say  much  about  the  additional  evidence  but
    basically the First Appellant's husband has got two jobs.

22.  Mr  Solomon  submitted  that  dismissing  the  appeal   would   be   a
    disproportionate interference with the private and family lives of  the
    appellants. In particular it would  interfere  significantly  with  the
    right of the appellant's child, who I accept is a British  citizen  the
    even if his passport has not yet been given to  him,  to  live  in  the
    country of his nationality.  His best  interests  clearly  require  his
    mother to be with him, and for him to live with both  parents  and  his
    stepsister, absent any evidence to the  contrary,  would  be  an  ideal
    arrangement.

23. Mr Solomon relied heavily on the Home Office  own  guidance  which,  he
    submitted, pointed in favour of allowing the appeal.  The relevant part
    of the guidance is in the following terms:

         "In cases where the decision being taken in respect of  the  person
         with parental responsibility would require that person to return to
         a country outside the EU then the case must always be  assessed  on
         the basis that it would be unreasonable for the child to leave  the
         UK with their parent.  In such cases it will usually  be  the  case
         that the person with parental responsibility  will  be  allowed  to
         stay in the UK with the child provided that there  is  satisfactory
         evidence as to the genuineness of the subsisting relationship.   It
         may, however, be appropriate to refuse to  grant  leave  where  the
         conduct of one of the parents gives rise to considerations of  such
         weight as to justify separation, if a British citizen  child  could
         otherwise stay with another parent or primary carer in the UK.  The
         circumstances envisaged would cover amongst other things:

         .minor criminality falling below the threshold set out in paragraph
         398;

         . a poor immigration history."

24. The first appellant clearly has parental responsibility for  the  child
    although it is shared with the child's  father.   She  is  the  primary
    carer of the infant. I accept this  in  the  absence  of  any  detailed
    evidence because it is so obviously likely to  be  the  case  with  the
    mother of a small child.  Clearly the  child's  best  interests  are  a
    primary consideration and they must lie in his remaining in his country
    of nationality with the care and support of both of his parents.

25. Ms Kenny submitted that there was a need for an  outbreak  of  reality.
    This was not a case about separating a mother from a child or depriving
    the British citizen of its parent.  All that was  needed  was  for  the
    family to go on holiday to the United States of  America  and  make  an
    application.  If, as appears to be the case, they met the  requirements
    of the Rules they  would  be  back  in  a  short  space  of  time  with
    everything done  correctly.  She  said  that  three-quarters  of  those
    applying for settlement from the United Kingdom had their  applications
    decided on within three weeks.

26. It is for the appellant to  prove  her  case  and  in  the  absence  of
    contrary evidence I accept that this is the kind of timescale  that  is
    involved.

27. It follows that if all went  according  to  plan  the  delay  would  be
    minimal. However such a holiday would have  to  be  funded.  There  was
    nothing before me to indicate how that could be done. Rather inspection
    of the  appellant's  bank  statements  suggests  that  although  he  is
    managing on his income money is tight. The  appellant's  husband  needs
    his job to meet the maintenance and accommodation requirements  of  the
    rules. Going back and reapplying is not simple as Ms Kenny suggested. I
    am not satisfied that it was a practicable proposition in this case.

28. Further I remind myself that it  for  the  respondent  to  justify  the
    interference. Merely relying on the rules cannot be enough. If it  were
    the protection of the convention could be  circumvented  by  the  rules
    whereas the convention exists to shape and form the rules.

29. This is different from a case of a person marrying during  a  visit  to
    the United Kingdom. I can  there  that  a  requirement  that  a  person
    returns  and  makes  an  out  of  country  application  is  a  way   of
    discouraging sham marriages. Ms Kenny submitted that people should  not
    be encouraged start "pregnancies of convenience"  (my  phrase,  not  Ms
    Kenny's) but manipulating immigration control is hardly likely to be  a
    main reason for married  people  of  this  age  getting  pregnant.  Her
    pregnancy was well advanced before she entered the United Kingdom as  a
    visitor.

30. In the fast moving world of immigration and human rights law  much  has
    happened since the House of Lords decided  the  case  of  Chikwamba  in
    2008. Nevertheless, it is  binding  authority  and  it  instructive  to
    remember just how emphatically Lord  Brown  expressed  himself.  Having
    considered possible justifications for the policy, he said:

         "Rather it seems to me that only comparatively rarely, certainly in
         family cases involving children, should  an  article  8  appeal  be
         dismissed on the basis that it  would  be  proportionate  and  more
         appropriate for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad".

31. I find it very important in this case that the appellants did meet  the
    rules apart from being in the United Kingdom as visitors.  I  think  it
    extremely unlikely that I would have reached the conclusion that  I  do
    if the appellants could not be maintained accommodated by their British
    citizen husband or father but they can and, mindful of the strong  need
    to promote family unity and respect the relationship  between  a  minor
    child and both his parents and I think that I must find that  requiring
    their removal would interfere disproportionately with the  private  and
    family lives of those involved, especially the private and family  life
    of the British citizen child.

32. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal for error
    of law. I substitute a decision dismissing the appeals under the  rules
    but allowing them on human rights grounds outside the rules.

33. Although I have allowed the appeal I make no fee award  in  this  case.
    The respondent has applied the rules correctly and I have  allowed  the
    appeal in the light of facts that did not exist when the  Secretary  of
    State made her decision.
