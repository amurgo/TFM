                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant has now been issued with a document confirming her  right
    of permanent residence and now wishes to withdraw her appeal.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the appellant was unsuccessful in her appeal, I give
    such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 3. Accordingly, with my  consent,  and  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This is a Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the respondent's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision, dismissing the appellants' appeals, shall stand.



Signed                              Date:  13 September 2017
