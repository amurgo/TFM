                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    ('SSHD') against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge ('FtTJ')  Ms
    Boylan-Kemp who, in a decision dated 11th  November  2016  allowed  the
    appeal of the Respondent, Mr Masoom Musaver Ali, against  the  decision
    of  the  SSHD  on  31st  December  2015  to  refuse  the   Respondent's
    application for indefinite leave to remain.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by FtTJ Omotosho on 28th March 2017.

 3. At the conclusion of the appeal we announced our decision.  We  allowed
    the appeal. We remitted the matter to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    hearing de novo. We said we would give our reasons in writing. This  we
    now do.

 4. The Respondent is an Indian national who was born on 4th May 1984.

 5. The Respondent was granted entry clearance from 22nd December  2005  to
    31st May 2007. He came to the UK on 19th January 2006. He  was  granted
    leave to enter as a student. Leave  to  remain  in  that  capacity  was
    subsequently extended to 30th April 2009. He applied unsuccessfully for
    leave to remain as a Tier  1  Post  Study  Worker.  However,  a  second
    application for leave to remain, also as a Tier 1  Post  Study  Worker,
    was grated valid from 15th June 2009  - 15th  June  2011.  In  2011  he
    applied for, and was granted, leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  General
    Migrant. That was granted until 17th June 2013. On  7th  June  2013  he
    applied for this leave to be extended and his application  was  granted
    so that his leave as a Tier 1 General Migrant continued until 17th June
    2016.

 6. On 31st December 2015 the Respondent made a  human  rights  application
    for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 10 years long  residency
    in the UK.

 7. No issue seems to have been taken with the Respondent  having  been  in
    the UK for 10 years. However, the SSHD referred to paragraph  276B(iii)
    which required that the  applicant  did  not  fall  for  refusal  under
    general grounds of refusal. The SSHD said that the Respondent did  fall
    for refusal under paragraph 322(2) and (5). These say:

         '322 grounds on which leave to remain should normally be refused...

         (2) the making of false representations or the failure to  disclose
         any material fact for the purpose of obtaining leave to enter or  a
         previous variation of leave or in order to  obtain  documents  from
         the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of  the
         application for leave to enter or a previous variation of leave...

         (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain
         in the UK in the light of his conduct (including convictions  which
         do not fall within paragraph 322(1C), character or associations  or
         the fact that he represents a threat to national security'.

 8. In essence the SSHD said that  these  rules  were  engaged  because  of
    discrepancies between information which the Respondent had supplied  to
    the Home Office in support of his application for  an  extension  as  a
    Tier 1 General Migrant in 2011 and for the further  extension  in  2013
    [the  refusal  letter  said  2011,  but  in  context  that  must  be  a
    typographical error] on the one hand and information which he  provided
    in his tax returns to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') on the
    other.

 9. To the Home Office he said that from March 2010 to February 2011 he had
    earned �36,087.39. �22,700.00 of this was said to have come from  self-
    employed earnings made through Masoom Ltd. When he applied in 2013  for
    an extension as a Tier  1  General  Migrant,  he  said  he  had  earned
    �36,738.33 between June 2012 and May 2013.  Again  the  bulk  of  this,
    �20,795.00 had been from self-employed earnings. This  time  they  were
    made through Ali Engineering Associates.

10. The reporting periods did not precisely match the tax  years,  but  the
    figures reported initially to HMRC were as follows:

         Tax year 09/10 total income �16,610

         Tax year 10/11 total income �12,705

         Tax year 11/12 total income �12,320

         Tax year 12/13 total income �10,716

         Tax year 13/14 total income �30,874.

11. These figures cast doubt on the figures which had been reported to  the
    Home Office.

12. The on-line filing records of HMRC showed that on 29th  December  2015,
    and so 2 days before the application was made for indefinite  leave  to
    remain, amendments  were  made  to  the  tax  returns.  The  Respondent
    explained to the Home Office that he had wished to add in  money  which
    he had had from employment with Lidl. In a  later  telephone  call,  he
    said that he had spoken to his present accountants  who  had  told  him
    that he also needed to report to HMRC his self-employed  earnings.  The
    respondent told the Home Office that he had not previously  been  aware
    of the need to declare such income. He said  his  previous  accountants
    had not told him he had to do so. The Home  Office  was  not  satisfied
    with this explanation. It thought that it was implausible that  someone
    who had genuinely owned 2 businesses over a 5 year  period  earning  at
    least �20,000 profit would have been unaware of  the  need  to  declare
    self-employed  earnings  to  HMRC.  It  therefore  concluded  that  the
    Respondent had made false representations in his application to  obtain
    leave to remain in the UK and the present application should  therefore
    be refused under paragraph 322(2).

13. The SSHD took the view that the Respondent had used deception to obtain
    leave to remain in the UK and his actions were in direct conflict  with
    the maintenance  of  effective  immigration  controls  and  the  public
    interest more generally. His presence in the UK was  not  conducive  to
    the public good because his conduct made it undesirable to allow him to
    remain in the UK. His application for indefinite  leave  was  therefore
    also refused under paragraph 322(5).

14. The Home Office considered whether he was nonetheless  entitled  to  be
    granted leave to remain as a  result  of  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR') and decided that he was not.

15. On 5th January 2016 the SSHD also curtailed the Respondent's  remaining
    leave to remain in the UK.

16. In his grounds of appeal to the FTT, the  Respondent  said  in  essence
    that he had not used deception.

17. The Respondent  gave  evidence  before  the  FtTJ.  The  FtTJ,  in  her
    determination at [14] said she  did  not  find  the  Respondent  to  be
    'particularly credible'. She added,

         'I also did not accept his  assertion  that  his  accountants  were
         professionally negligent as he has failed to  report  them  to  any
         professional body and has not pursued any  further  action  against
         them, despite their alleged involvement in the dissolution  of  his
         two companies; I find that  this  lack  of  action  undermines  his
         allegations on these matters. I further do not accept  as  credible
         his evidence that he was unaware of the need to declare  his  self-
         employment income for taxation purposes until he appointed his  new
         accountants, as he has been a business man in the UK for  the  past
         five years and so would be likely to be aware of the basic taxation
         laws and requirements of the UK as  a  result.  Finally,  I  am  in
         agreement with Mr Sarwar [the HOPO]  in  his  submission  that  the
         appellant's actions in contacting the HMRC on 29 December 2015  was
         most likely a direct result of his receiving immigration advice  in
         October 2015, and so I find that this was done so as to ensure that
         his affairs were in order before submitting his application  on  31
         December 2015.'

18. It seems, although it is not entirely clear, that the FtTJ  found  that
    there had been no deception of the Home Office because  the  Respondent
    had earned the sums which he told them in his applications of 2011  and
    2013. Without apparently any  comment  from  counsel  representing  the
    Respondent, the FtTJ went  on  to  consider  whether  the  Respondent's
    dealings with HMRC justified refusal of his application for ILR. Before
    us,  Mr  Richardson  for  the  Respondent   accepted   that,   in   the
    circumstances, the Respondent could not now complain that the  area  of
    debate had widened in that respect. The FtTJ concluded  that  they  did
    not justify refusal.

19. Her reasons seem to have been as follows:

        a. HMRC had not taken any action against the Respondent because  of
           his late disclosure of his earnings and a payment plan had  been
           agreed for the recovery of  the  remaining  outstanding  monies.
           HMRC  had  imposed  no  penalty  because  of  the  tardiness  in
           declaring the earnings. The matter had not been referred to  the
           police.

        b. On the date of the application for  ILR,  the  Respondent's  tax
           affairs were thus in order.

        c. She said at [16] 'there is insufficient  evidence  to  discharge
           the burden of proof that  the  [respondent's]  failure  to  make
           previous disclosures to the HMRC was dishonest or equated to  an
           offence of tax evasion, or that it was done with  the  intention
           of obtaining leave to remain as he declared his earnings to  the
           [appellant] in these applications and these earnings  have  been
           accepted by the HMRC. Therefore, I find  that  on  the  evidence
           before me paragraph 322(2) is not satisfied.'

        d. She said at [17] 'Mr Coleman [counsel who then appeared for  the
           Respondent] submitted that the late payment of income tax cannot
           cross the necessary threshold  for  his  provision  [We  assume,
           without demur from the  parties  before  us,   that  this  is  a
           typographical error  for  'this'  provision  referring  back  to
           paragraph  322(5)  which  the  FtTJ  was  addressing   in   this
           paragraph] as the general guidance is  that  a  short  custodial
           sentence is unlikely to satisfy this  threshold.  Therefore,  as
           the [Respondent] has declared his income and as  the  HMRC  have
           taken no further action and have agreed to  an  ongoing  payment
           plan in order to recover the outstanding amount, then  I  am  in
           agreement  with  Mr  Coleman  that  despite  the  [Respondent]'s
           previous behaviour not being as transparent as  it  should  have
           been that this, in itself and in light of his actions to  remedy
           the situation  prior  to  submitting  his  application,  is  not
           sufficiently serious so as to meet the threshold.'

        e. Paragraph 322(5) was a discretionary exclusion and  it  was  not
           fair to exercise it against the respondent.

  20. The FtTJ also held at [20] that, since the Respondent had lived in the
      UK for 10 years and had a family and a business here,  Article  8  was
      engaged, the Respondent satisfied the Immigration Rules and refusal of
      the application by the SSHD would be disproportionate.

  21. The SSHD submits that the decision of the FTTJ was infected  by  error
      of law.

        a. There was no guidance  or  judicial  authority  to  justify  the
           comment that a short  custodial  sentence  was  insufficient  to
           satisfy the threshold of the rule. On the contrary, the relevant
           Home Office guidance says that a person does not  need  to  have
           been convicted of a criminal offence for the provision to apply.



        b. The judge gave no  consideration  to  paragraph  276B(ii)  which
           says,

             'having regard to the public interest, there  are  no  reasons
             why it would be undesirable for him  to  be  given  indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of  long residence, taking  into
             account  his....(c)  personal  history,  including  character,
             conduct ....'

             The SSHD submits that, even if the Judge  was  right  to  find
             that the respondent's evasion  of  tax  was  not  sufficiently
             serious to engage paragraph 322(5), then it was still relevant
             to what is  submitted  to  be  the  lower  test  in  paragraph
             276B(ii) and the Judge erred by not considering this aspect of
             the rule.

  22. Under cover of a letter dated 4th May 2017 the Respondent's solicitors
      submitted a Rule 24 response. Relevant to the grounds of appeal,  this
      submitted as follows:

        a. The guidance to which Mr  Coleman  and  the  FtTJ  referred  was
           'General Grounds for Refusal: Section 4 of 5: considering  leave
           to remain' published on 10th April  2017.  Paragraph  322(5)  is
           considered at page 34 and says,

             'the main types of cases you  need  to  consider  for  refusal
             under paragraph 322(5) or referral to other  teams  are  those
             that involve criminality, a threat to national  security,  war
             crimes or travel bans. A person does not  need  to  have  been
             convicted of a criminal offence for this provision  to  apply.
             When considering whether to refuse under  this  category,  the
             key thing to consider is if  there  is  reliable  evidence  to
             support a decision that  the  person's  behaviour  calls  into
             question  their  character   and/or   conduct   and/or   their
             associations to the extent that it  is  undesirable  to  allow
             them to remain in the UK.  This  may  include  cases  where  a
             migrant has entered, attempted to enter or facilitated a  sham
             marriage to evade immigration control.'

        b. The Respondent argued that there was nothing comparable  in  his
           behaviour.

        c. Since paragraph 22(5) did not apply, nor, too,  could  paragraph
           276B(ii) which uses very similar language.  The  Respondent  did
           not accept that paragraph 276B(ii) set a lower test.

        d. The FtTJ had not found tax evasion by the Respondent, only  late
           payment of tax.

  23. In our judgment the r.24 notice and the Guidance to  which  it  refers
      does not meet the first ground of appeal. In  her  decision  the  FtTJ
      referred to Mr Coleman's submission that, 'as the general guidance  is
      that a short custodial sentence is unlikely to satisfy this threshold'
      and she then appeared to adopt or agree with the submission. The plain
      fact is there is no  such  guidance.  On  the  contrary,  a  custodial
      sentence of any kind (short or long) is not a necessary condition  for
      applying paragraph 322(5). Indeed, a conviction  is  not  a  necessary
      condition. The FtTJ had therefore been  led  into  error.  She  either
      misdirected herself as to the scope of the rule or took  into  account
      an irrelevant consideration (namely guidance which did not exist).  On
      this basis alone, the FtTJ's decision included an error of law.

  24. We have to  decide  whether  it  was  a  material  error  of  law.  Mr
      Richardson accepted that in deciding  this  issue,  we  must  consider
      whether her decision would inevitably have  been  the  same,  even  if
      there had been no such error.

  25. He argued that it would have been the same. She  had  found  that  the
      respondent had not been  dishonest  in  his  dealings  with  HMRC.  In
      paragraph 20 she had referred to his dealings with the Revenue as 'tax
      indiscretions ...not  sufficiently  serious  to  warrant  any  further
      action to be taken in respect of  them  taking  the  evidence  in  the
      round.' Mr  Richardson  submitted  that  if  the  proper  guidance  is
      considered then the Respondent's 'tax indiscretions'  simply  are  not
      comparable.

  26. We  do  not  agree.  We  cannot  be  sure  (even  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities) that her decision would have been the same but for  the
      error of law. Mr Richardson was entitled to stress that the  FtTJ  did
      not find the Respondent to have been dishonest in  his  dealings  with
      the Revenue. However, as we have also set out above, she also rejected
      his evidence that he was unaware of the  need  to  declare  his  self-
      employed earnings. It is not entirely  easy  to  reconcile  those  two
      factual findings. Mr Richardson is right  to  say  that  there  is  no
      distinct ground of appeal based on  the  incoherence  of  the  factual
      findings. However, we are entitled to take the whole of  the  decision
      into account in asking ourselves whether  she  would  inevitably  have
      come to the same conclusion absent the error of law.

  27. Our view is that we cannot find that that is the case.

  28. Mr Richardson also argued that the FtTJ's decision could  still  stand
      on Article 8 grounds. However, in our view that cannot rightly be seen
      as a free standing basis for her decision. It was, after all  in  this
      paragraph of her decision that she  cross  referred  to  her  previous
      findings about the 'tax indiscretions'.

  29. In our view the decision of the FtTJ was affected by a material  error
      of law. It had to be quashed.

  30. In these circumstances, it is not necessary for us to  deal  with  the
      second ground of appeal or decide whether there is any  difference  in
      the application of paragraph 322(5) and paragraph 276B(ii)(c).

  31. Nor did we feel able to redecide the remake the decision on the appeal
      against the SSHD's refusal  of  leave  ourselves.  The  difficulty  of
      reconciling the different findings of fact  did  not  allow  this.  We
      therefore concluded that the only course was to remit the matter to be
      heard de novo by another FtTJ.

Mr Justice Nicol
