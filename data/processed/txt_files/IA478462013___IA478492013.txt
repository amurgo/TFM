Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms L Hirst, Counsel instructed by Birnberg Peirce &
Partners
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants, nationals of Turkey, dates of birth 20  September  1969
    and 29 August 1998  appealed  against  the  Respondent's  decisions  to
    refuse to vary leave to remain and to make removal directions.
2.   An appeal against that decision came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Walters who on 9 November 2014 dismissed their appeals.

3.   Permission to appeal the  judge's  decision  was  given  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Lambert on 11 February 2015 and the Respondent  provided
    a Rule 24 response on 24 February 2015.

4.   On 7 August 2015 in a decision promulgated by myself and  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Professor N M Hill QC we found for the reasons given  in
    the decision that the Original Tribunal's decision could not  stand  in
    connection with the fairness of the proceedings before  the  judge  and
    the judge's assessment of the  evidence.   Ultimately  the  errors  had
    particularly related to  whether  or  not  the  first  Appellant  could
    effectively support herself and the  second  Appellant,  her  dependent
    daughter, through income generated from her business as a  hairdresser,
    also although it was not a significant basis of refusal  whether  there
    was accommodation of which the Appellants were paying  their  share  of
    the rent.

5.   Directions were given for the submission of further evidence which  the
    Appellants did provide  in  time.   The  first  Appellant  adopted  her
    evidence and there was no cross-examination of  the  Appellant  on  the
    statements which she had made in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  The evidence was
    clearly provided relating to the premises they occupied, their  payment
    of the rent and the business income was established  to  show  that  in
    2013, 2014 and 2015 there was a significant net  profit.   The  current
    position shows the current net  profit  to  be  ï¿½17,000  odd.   In  the
    circumstances there was no remaining  issue  concerning  her  financial
    circumstances.   Under  the  EC  Turkish  Association  Agreement   such
    applications were required to meet n the UK the  Immigration  Rules  HC
    510.  Ms Little cited the relevant case law at Savas [2000] ECR  1-2927
    (ECJ) as well as EK (Ankara Agreement  -  1972  Rules  -  construction)
    Turkey [2010] UKUT 425, Akinci (paragraph 21 HC 510 - correct approach)
    [2012] UKUT 00266 (IAC).  The issue of disguised employment,  the  case
    of Quashie  v  Stringfellow  Restaurants  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1735  were
    addressed.

6.      In the case of the refusal of the further leave to  remain  for  the
    first Appellant and her dependent daughter the Secretary of  State  was
    not satisfied the first Appellant was genuinely established in business
    or that the profits were sufficient to support  herself  and  dependent
    daughter or that the Appellant's  work  did  not  amount  to  disguised
    employment.

7.   I was satisfied on the evidence as was indeed  it  seemed  to  me,  the
    judge that the Appellant  was  operating  her  own  business  that  was
    evidenced by letters from  clients  as  well  as  the  Appellant's  own
    evidence and documents.

8.   Bearing  in  mind  there  was  no  specified  financial  threshold  for
    maintenance nor was there a requirement  for  the  business  itself  to
    reach a certain level of profitability the issue was whether or not the
    profits generated  by  the  Appellant's  business  were  sufficient  to
    support her and her dependent daughter, without undertaking employment.



9.   Ms Brocklesby-Weller did not cross-examine the first  Appellant  as  to
    her business activities nor challenge the documentary evidence provided
    pursuant to directions when demonstrating the continued running of  the
    business.  The evidence showed the significant increase in  net  profit
    over the period of 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.  I find  looking  at  the
    figures there plainly was sufficient funds to meet the living  expenses
    of the first Appellant and her daughter.

10.  It was unclear if the Respondent was intending to pursue the  issue  of
    whether the first Appellant  was  really  employed  rather  than  self-
    employed: The evidence provided within  the  bundle  showed  the  first
    Appellant was self-employed in  the  operation  of  the  business,  the
    charging for the costs of supplies, the arrangement of her  own  public
    liability insurance, the  absence  of  third  party  control  over  the
    Appellant's working hours  and  the  absence  of  obligation  upon  the
    Appellant to serve any client of the salon where from time to time  she
    also worked.

11.  In the circumstances the evidence indeed had moved on and it  is  clear
    that she was not an employee.

12.  In the circumstances I was satisfied the Appellant has  discharged  the
    burden of proof upon a  balance  of  probabilities  that  she  met  the
    relevant requirements of HC 510 and failed to take a holistic  approach
    to the assessment of the evidence.

ANONYMITY ORDER

13.  No anonymity order is necessary or appropriate

NOTICE OF DECISION
14.  The appeals under the Immigration Rules are allowed.


Signed                                  Date 17 October 2015


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD
The appeals have succeeded  substantially  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
originally submitted but more particularly  on  the  basis  of  the  further
evidence provided which meets every point raised.  In  the  circumstances  I
do not find this is an appropriate case to make fee awards bearing  in  mind
the original decisions by the Respondent.

Signed                                  Date 17 October 2015
