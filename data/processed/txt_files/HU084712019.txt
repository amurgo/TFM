Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms F Shaw of Counsel instructed by IHRC Legal
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1.  Following  a  hearing  on  20  December  2019  and  by  way  of  a
         determination promulgated on 13  January  2020,  I  set  aside  the
         decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross, promulgated on 5 August
         2019, to the extent that a fresh decision was required on the issue
         of whether the appellant would have the support of  her  family  on
         return to Bangladesh and, if not, on how this would impact  on  the
         assessment of whether there would be very significant obstacles  to
         her integration. The judge's findings that the appellant would  not
         be at risk from her first ex-husband and that none  of  her  health
         conditions were life threatening or prevented  her  from  living  a
         reasonably normal life were preserved.

      2. The appellant is a Bangladeshi national born on 19 August 1957. She
         entered the UK on 24 June 2003 on a visit visa 12 August  2013,  to
         allegedly escape domestic abuse,  and  overstayed.  On  28  October
         2014, she made an application for leave to remain  on  private  and
         family life grounds. That was refused on 22 March 2015.  A  further
         application was made on 19 October 2016; that, too, was refused  in
         February 2017. The appellant then made her current application on 4
         December 2018 and that was refused on 30 April 2019. Her appeal was
         heard at Taylor House on 28 June 2019 and dismissed.

      3. The appellant's claim was that she  was  divorced  from  her  first
         husband in Bangladesh and that a second marriage  entered  into  in
         the UK on 8 July 2004 had also ended. She maintained that  although
         she had six siblings in Bangladesh, she would be unable to turn  to
         any of them for help and that her first ex husband had not  allowed
         her to have contact with their two children since they were just  a
         few years old. There are no children of the second marriage.

         The Hearing

      4. The appellant attended the hearing but Ms Shaw stated at the outset
         that she had been unable to take instructions  from  the  appellant
         and that it was her view that she  was  not  well  enough  to  give
         evidence due to her anxiety and medication. It was  her  view  that
         the appellant was generally unwell so that it was not the case that
         she  would  be  well  on  another  date.  No  application  for   an
         adjournment was  made  and  the  appeal  proceeded  with  the  oral
         evidence of a witness, SB, who gave her date of birth as 6 November
         1994.

      5. SB confirmed the contents and accuracy of her witness statement and
         said she had known the appellant for 15 years having met her  at  a
         family gathering when she, the witness, had been at primary school.
         She  said  that  over  the  years  they  had  developed   a   close
         relationship and she knew  her  very  well.  She  stated  that  the
         appellant was in today's state of health most  days  and  had  been
         that way for several years. She said she saw  the  appellant  every
         other day or every two days over the last 3-5 years. The  appellant
         had not changed during that time. She said that the  appellant  had
         spoken about her family and said she had no contact with them.  She
         had two brothers, four sisters, parents and two children.  She  did
         not know where her brothers were and her sisters were  all  married
         with their own families. She then said the appellant's parents were
         deceased. The appellant did not recall how old her  children  were.
         Her last contact with her family was in  2003  when  she  had  left
         Bangladesh. Ms Shaw asked how SB knew if  this  was  true  and  she
         replied that the appellant had told her and she believed  her.  She
         said she had never seen her have contact with family.

      6. SB was asked whether she knew the  appellant's  last  husband.  She
         said she did not. She knew nothing about him other  than  that  the
         appellant had told her he had ill treated her. She said she was one
         of the appellant's closes friends despite their large age gap.  The
         appellant looked upon her as a daughter. She  had  never  seen  any
         bruises on the appellant but said the appellant was covered up  all
         the time anyway. That completed examination in chief.  The  witness
         was then tendered for cross examination.

      7. In response to Ms Jones' questions, SB said she was 25  years  old.
         The appellant's marriage to Mr A  ended  in  2017.  She  knew  that
         because the appellant had informed her of it.  She  confirmed  that
         she had never met the man.

      8. SB was asked for  evidence  of  identity.  She  did  not  have  her
         passport but produced a driving licence.

      9. SB was asked about the appellant's hospital appointments.  She  did
         not know what the appellant's last appointment had  been  for.  She
         had never accompanied the appellant to any of her appointments  and
         she did not know who did. She was not present  when  the  appellant
         had given instructions to her representatives  in  respect  of  her
         witness statement and she had not been to the solicitors  with  the
         appellant. The appellant had gone with a friend.  That  friend  was
         not at the hearing.

     10. SB confirmed that she had met the appellant at a  family  gathering
         but she said they were not related. It had been a wedding.

     11. SB had last been in Bangladesh in 2011.

     12. SB confirmed that she supported the appellant and had done so often
         over the last 3 years. She had given her �100 some weeks  and  �200
         some months. She was asked whether other friends also supported her
         financially and she replied  that  they  did.  She  said  that  she
         supported the appellant because she had no money  and  received  no
         benefits.

     13. SB was asked whether the appellant had ever  lived  with  her.  She
         said she had stayed over from time to time  and  also  stayed  with
         others.  This  started  one  and  a  half  years  ago.  After   the
         appellant's marriage  ended,  she  had  stayed  with  friends.  She
         currently lived with a friend in Bethnal Green. SB did not know the
         address but it was in the E2 postal area of  London.  SB  confirmed
         that the appellant had received funds from charity.  The  appellant
         lived with a Mrs N. She did not know how long she  had  lived  with
         her. She thought it was months, and then said it was years.

     14. SB was asked whether she would continue to support the appellant if
         she were removed. She said she  would  not.  When  asked  why,  she
         replied that her situation might change. She was questioned further
         on this and she replied that she would not  support  the  appellant
         regardless of her circumstances. Whether asked why, she said it was
         because she had never sent money home. It was put to her that  that
         was not a credible reason. She  repeated  her  answer.  When  asked
         whether she would do so if she were shown how  to  transfer  funds,
         she said she would still not do so as she would not  know  how  the
         appellant spent the money. She said she trusted the  appellant  but
         repeated that  she  would  not  support  her  if  she  returned  to
         Bangladesh.

     15. SB was asked what medication the appellant took. She did  not  know
         but said it was for blood pressure and depression.  She  was  asked
         what her  next  medical  appointment  was  for  and  she  said  the
         appellant was due to have cataract surgery.

     16. SB was asked whether she would help the appellant to  make  contact
         with her family in Bangladesh. At first she  said  she  would  not.
         When she was asked why, she said she did not know where they  were.
         She then repeated that she would not help the appellant.  She  then
         said anyone could say they were family. Finally, she said she would
         help the appellant. She did not know if  the  appellant's  brothers
         had families and she did not  know  the  ages  of  the  appellant's
         children. She did not know when the  appellant  had  last  attended
         counselling. She said she had been though although  she  could  not
         provide any indication as to when.

     17. SB said that she lived with her parents and siblings. She was asked
         if she was married and she replied she was. She was  asked  whether
         her husband lived with her and she said he did not. She  then  said
         he had how own house. They had had an Islamic wedding ceremony. She
         then said she was engaged.

     18. SB said that her mother was 48 years old. She was aware that SB had
         attended today's hearing.

     19. SB said that she worked full time as a senior  co-ordinator  for  a
         health agency. She had  worked  for  the  last  three  years  since
         leaving college.

     20. SB said she was not related to  Mrs  N,  with  whom  the  appellant
         lived. She had never met her.

     21. SB was asked about the letter from Crisis contained in the  bundle.
         She was shown the letter and she stated that the appellant had gone
         to seek help. She did not know if any support had been offered. She
         did not know Mrs N's full name. The appellant went for help in case
         she could not continue living with Mrs N. The appellant  could  not
         come and live with her as she had no space.  That  completed  cross
         examination. There was no re-examination.

     22. I then put questions to SB for clarification. I asked in  what  way
         her circumstances had changed since the appellant had  stayed  with
         her. She said her brother had been away at work  and  had  returned
         last week. He had been working outside London and had given up  his
         job. She could not remember where the  appellant  had  been  living
         when their friendship commenced. She said she  had  never  been  to
         visit the appellant; the appellant had always come to her. She  had
         been a school girl when they met. The appellant would come to visit
         her and her family. She then said that she did used  to  visit  the
         appellant but stopped going after she left the home she  had  lived
         in 3-4 years ago.  SB had been in college then  and  the  appellant
         had been living in Shadwell.   She  said  prior  to  the  appellant
         leaving that address, she, SB, had been visiting her every week, or
         every two days, for a couple of years. The appellant lived with her
         mother in law in Shadwell. SB had met  her.  She  stopped  visiting
         because the appellant left the  house.  They  now  saw  each  other
         "outside". She clarified this to mean in shops or in  the  park  or
         the appellant came to her house. The appellant no  longer  received
         funds from  charity.  The  witness  was  asked  about  the  Islamic
         marriage she said she had had. She said she had been confused.  She
         was just engaged.

     23. There were no questions arising from mine and  that  completed  the
         oral evidence.   I then heard submissions.

     24. Ms Jones relied on the decision letter. She asked me  to  note  the
         preserved findings. She submitted that the appellant had been  able
         to provide a full witness statement to her solicitors and had  been
         able to approach Crisis about her housing; all this had taken place
         this month. There was no mention of  the  appellant  having  needed
         support or any been given. The respondent did not accept  that  the
         appellant was vulnerable. Her claimed lack of ties did  not  amount
         to an inability to integrate. She relied on MA (prove  destitution)
         Jamaica [2005] UKIAT 00013 (at 11 and 14). She  submitted  that  if
         the witness supported the appellant then the appellant would not be
         destitute on return as there was no credible reason why  she  would
         stop that support. She was not being truthful in her claim that she
         would stop all support to the appellant after removal. It  was  not
         accepted that  there  would  be  no  family  support  or  that  the
         appellant was not fit to return. The other friends said to  support
         her had not given evidence. The success of the appeal  depended  on
         whether the Tribunal believed the claim.  The  appellant  had  been
         receiving support. She would be able  to  access  medical  help  in
         Bangladesh.  The  difficulties  she  was  said  to  face  were  not
         compelling. If they were such good friends it was  surprising  that
         the witness had never met the appellant's husband.

     25. Ms Shaw responded. She relied on her skeleton  argument.  She  said
         that it was unsurprising that SB had not met the appellant's former
         husband.  The  marriage  had  been  accepted  as  genuine  by   the
         respondent. The  appellant's  situation  here  where  she  received
         support was different to what it would be on return to  Bangladesh.
         There were costs involved in sending money overseas. SB was due  to
         marry and would probably start a family and stop working. There was
         a stigma attached  to  mental  health  issues  in  Bangladesh.  Few
         support services were available and who would help  her  to  access
         facilities. She was nearly 63. Her situation might be different  if
         she did not have mental health issues but she did and that amounted
         to very difficult obstacles. How could the appellant prove she  had
         no family support. Her sisters were married  and  it  was  not  the
         cultural norm for them to take her in. The appellant did  not  know
         how old her children were. SB was nine when she met  the  appellant
         so it is not  surprising  that  she  could  not  recall  where  the
         appellant lived. The witness was aware of  the  appellant's  family
         members. The appeal should be allowed.

     26. At the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved my  decision  which  I
         now give with reasons.

         Discussion and Conclusions

     27. I have considered all the evidence and the  submissions  made.  The
         issue before me is whether the appellant would have the support  of
         her family were she to return to Bangladesh. If she does not,  then
         this may impact upon the issue  of  whether  there  would  be  very
         significant obstacles to her reintegration  and  that  matter  will
         require assessment. If it is found that she does, then the  judge's
         conclusion that there will not be  very  significant  obstacles  on
         return shall stand.  I  reach  my  conclusions  only  after  having
         considered the evidence and submissions holistically.

     28. It is unfortunate that the appellant did not give oral evidence  as
         there are many questions arising from the various written  evidence
         which remain unresolved and which I shall come to  later.  Although
         she attended and was present for the duration of  the  hearing,  it
         was Ms Shaw's view that the appellant was not  able  to  give  oral
         evidence because she had been unable to take instructions from her.
         I have no medical evidence to confirm the  appellant's  ability  or
         inability to give oral evidence and there was no opportunity to try
         and see how she would manage, given Ms Shaw's decision not to  call
         her. I note Ms Jones' point that the appellant had just  some  days
         earlier given a witness statement to her solicitors  and  that  she
         had been to see a progression  coach  at  Crisis.  The  appellant's
         representatives did not at  any  stage  indicate  that  there  were
         problems in taking instructions for  that  statement  or  that  the
         appellant was unfit to give them. SB confirmed that  the  appellant
         was as she generally was and had not changed. However,  it  is  for
         Counsel and the appellant to decide how best to present the case in
         all the circumstances.

     29. I accept that the appellant is  depressed  and  anxious,  that  her
         depression  and  anxiety  is  likely  to  be  the  result  of   bad
         relationships with her  former  husbands  and  exacerbated  by  the
         uncertainty over her immigration status, lack of a  permanent  home
         and income. This is confirmed by the  evidence  from  the  NHS  and
         other medical professionals and I do not dispute it.

     30. I indicated above that there were many  unresolved  issues  arising
         from the evidence. These are matters which should have  been  plain
         to the appellant's representatives, who have represented her over a
         considerable period, and which should have been  addressed  in  the
         written evidence particularly as the issue for determination is  so
         narrow. They go directly to the  appellant's  claim  to  have  been
         without family support essentially  since  the  end  of  her  first
         marriage. For all the  reasons  set  out  below,  in  no  order  of
         priority, I have concluded, only after assessing all the  evidence,
         that the appellant has not made out her case that she would have no
         family or other support if returned to Bangladesh.

     31. The appellant told Judge Ross in her oral  evidence  that  she  had
         lived with her brothers after her divorce and until she came to the
         UK. She has consistently maintained that she married very young and
         that her husband divorced her when her two children were  toddlers.
         She told a psychiatrist  that  she  married  at  16  and  that  the
         marriage lasted four years (at J2). Given that she  did  not  leave
         Bangladesh until she was almost 46 years old, she would have  spent
         some 26 years living with her brothers which wholly undermines  her
         claim that they told her to "go away" when she divorced.  She  also
         claimed at the last hearing that her intention  was  to  return  to
         Bangladesh after her visit which suggests that she had a  place  to
         return to.

     32. Her claim that her husband took away her children upon  divorce  is
         contradicted  by  her  claim  to  a  psychiatrist  in  April   2008
         (relatively  recently  after  her  arrival  in  the  UK  when   her
         recollection would have been more  reliable)  that  she  lived  and
         struggled as  a  single  mother  for  seven  years  before  leaving
         Bangladesh (J2). If that is to be believed, she would have been  in
         her mid-twenties when she arrived here and not in her late forties.
         I also note that she attributed her low mood at the time to a  lack
         of permanent accommodation and income (J1). In her  recent  witness
         statement, the appellant maintained  that  her  children  had  been
         taken from her as toddlers (paragraph 4) which conflicts  with  her
         earlier claim that she had brought them up for seven years. I  also
         note that when the appellant obtained her passport in 2007, she was
         described as a housewife and her husband was named (AB:8-9). By her
         own evidence, however, she would have  been  divorced  long  before
         then.

     33. The appellant claimed that she had four married  sisters  but  that
         she would not be able to live with  them.  She  did  not,  however,
         maintain at any point in the proceedings that they would be  unable
         to assist her in other ways and nor did she ever suggest there  was
         any friction between them.  Ms  Shaw  submitted  that  it  was  the
         cultural norm for married female relatives not to  take  in  others
         and that I should take that into account. The  same  submission  is
         made by  the  appellant's  representatives  (at  A13)  and  by  the
         appellant in her recent witness statement (at paragraph 6). If that
         is so, then I am also required to consider  that  it  is  also  the
         cultural/Islamic norm for male relatives to care  for  their  needy
         female relatives. Indeed, the appellant's  brothers'  past  conduct
         supports this.

     34. I take note of SB's evidence that she had never seen the  appellant
         make contact with her family. As her evidence was also that she saw
         the appellant "outside", in shops and at SB's home, there would not
         have been any opportunity for the appellant to  have  made  contact
         with her family during those times.

     35. I accept that SB came to the hearing with good intentions and  that
         she wanted to help the appellant as much as possible in securing  a
         positive outcome but I find that she has exaggerated  her  evidence
         to an extent in her attempt to do so. Her lack of  knowledge  about
         matters which she could be expected to know had she truly  been  as
         close a friend as she claimed, suggests that  the  relationship  is
         not as she described.  She claimed to be  one  of  the  appellant's
         closest friends, yet she has never accompanied the appellant to any
         medical or counselling appointments or to see her  representatives.
         She did not know the name of the  person  the  appellant  currently
         lives with and her evidence as to when the appellant moved from the
         accommodation she had previously lived in with her mother-in-law is
         contradicted by other evidence. SB said she  had  stopped  visiting
         the appellant at that property ([60 ~ Gardens], although she  could
         not give the address) when the appellant moved out 3-4  years  ago.
         The appellant's evidence, however, is that she was  still  at  that
         address in December 2018 when  she  made  her  application  to  the
         respondent (B2) and even as recently as  21  June  2019  (when  her
         witness statement was prepared: AB:5-7).

     36. SB's evidence about supporting the appellant financially  over  the
         last 3 years is also contradicted by the appellant's  evidence.  In
         December 2018 the only income the appellant declared  she  received
         was from a charity (C22) and  she  flatly  denied  having  received
         money from friends (C12).

     37. Given these contradictions between the evidence  from  SB  and  the
         appellant, it is unclear to me where the truth lies.  If,  however,
         SB has been supporting the appellant financially and is a very good
         friend, then I agree with Ms Jones that her initial claim that  she
         would cease support when the appellant left is not  believable.  Ms
         Shaw submitted that SB was due to marry, would start a  family  and
         stop working but that is all  speculative.  The  witness  was  very
         confused about whether she had been through an Islamic  wedding  or
         not and she said nothing in evidence about when if at all she would
         cease employment or when she would plan to start a family.

     38. There is further conflict in the  appellant's  evidence  about  her
         parents. In the representations forwarded by her representatives in
         December 2018 (A10), it was claimed that  the  appellant's  parents
         were deceased. In her recent witness statement, she maintained that
         her parents had passed away before she had  left  for  the  UK  (at
         paragraph 5). SB gave oral evidence that the appellant had told her
         that her parents were  deceased.  In  her  application  for  leave,
         signed on 3 December 2018, however, the  appellant  maintained  she
         had a mother and siblings in Bangladesh (B30).   She also  told  Dr
         Ascione in August 2018 that her mother was in  Bangladesh  but  was
         unwell and needed constant care (AB:19).  It is difficult to accept
         that the appellant would be confused over whether  her  mother  was
         alive or dead and this is just one  more  area  of  evidence  where
         there is serious conflict and which raises concerns over  what  the
         appellant's family circumstances genuinely  are.  In  view  of  the
         conflicting evidence, I do not accept that the appellant  has  been
         truthful about her family connections and about  the  circumstances
         that she would encounter on return  as  far  as  their  support  is
         concerned.

     39. In reaching  my  conclusion,  I  have  also  taken  account  of  MA
         (Jamaica) as relied on by Ms Jones. I note that  the  appellant  in
         that case, a 63 year old woman, slightly older than the  appellant,
         was considered not to be "elderly" and that  the  Tribunal  advised
         that appellants seeking to prove  they  would  be  destitute  "must
         prove their cases and do it in a way  that  shows  that  they  have
         seriously addressed their minds to returning to  their  country  of
         origin and made proper enquiries about  how  they  could  establish
         themselves. If they fail to do that it will  be  most  unusual  for
         them to be able to show that they would be destitute in  the  event
         of return" (at 14). This approach has  not  been  followed  in  the
         appellant's case.

     40. I have also had regard to Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 relied  on  by
         Ms Shaw in her skeleton argument. The guidance therein  would  have
         been more useful had I found that the appellant would not have  any
         family or other support  in  Bangladesh.  Judge  Ross  has  already
         addressed the matter of the appellant's health and his findings  in
         that respect are not open to challenge at  this  stage.   The  only
         fresh medical evidence that has  been  provided  which  post  dates
         Judge Ross' determination is the letter of 13 November  2019  which
         is identical to that dated 27 June 2019 and which  was  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal and an admission and discharge note of  2  July
         2019 which showed that the appellant complained of  abdominal  pain
         but was discharged the  same  day  when  no  cause  was  found,  no
         treatment or follow up was needed  and  the  pain  settled  in  any
         event.

     41. There are many other inconsistencies in the evidence which do  not,
         however go to the issue I am required to determine.  These  include
         inconsistencies over how the appellant arranged her journey to  the
         UK and whether or not she had ever lived with her  second  husband.
         Indeed, Ms Shaw pointed to the  latter  as  a  "factual  error"  at
         paragraph 16 of my previous determination. I would draw  Ms  Shaw's
         attention to J1 and AB:28 where the appellant gave her  address  as
         [95 ~ Gardens] (her husband's address) and where she told her GP in
         April 2016 that she had been living with her partner and his mother
         since 2004. There is no need to detail these matters  any  further,
         however, as they do not impact upon  whether  the  appellant  would
         have family support on return to Bangladesh.

     42.  Due  to  the  appellant's  discrepant  evidence  over  her  family
         circumstances I conclude that the truth has not been told.  I  find
         that the appellant has not  made  out  her  case  to  the  required
         standard.  That  finding  when  taken  with   Judge   Ross'   other
         conclusions on the issue of very significant obstacles  means  that
         the appeal does not succeed under the rules.

     43. Ms Shaw argues in her skeleton argument that the matter should also
         be  considered  under  article  8  outside  the  rules  given   the
         compelling compassionate factors. This argument was not pursued  in
         oral submissions but in any event the factors Ms Shaw relies  on  -
         age, lack of support in Bangladesh and mental health issues -  have
         been addressed. The appellant is not  an  elderly  woman  (see  MA:
         paragraph 13), it is not accepted that she will have no support  in
         Bangladesh and her mental  health  issues  can  be  addressed  with
         medication, a point Judge Ross already dealt with.  He  noted  that
         the psychologist admitted to having no knowledge of health care  in
         Bangladesh and no  objective  evidence  on  facilities  for  mental
         health patients in Bangladesh has  been  adduced.  The  judge  also
         found that none of the appellant's conditions  prevented  her  from
         leading a normal life in  Bangladesh  and  that  finding  has  been
         preserved. More importantly, Judge Ross found that the respondent's
         decision was proportionate on article 8 grounds  and  that  finding
         was also preserved as my previous determination makes clear.

     44. The First-tier Tribunal also considered article 3 and dismissed the
         appeal on those grounds. That part of the judge's decision  is  not
         open to challenge either.

     45. The issue for determination before me was limited to the matter  of
         how the lack or not of family support would impact  upon  the  very
         significant obstacles test. I have engaged with that and  have  set
         out my reasons for finding that the appellant would be able to seek
         family and/or other support on return to Bangladesh.

         Decision

     46. The appeal is dismissed.

         Anonymity

     47. I continue the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.
