                             ANONYMITY DIRECTION

I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the appellant. No report of  these
proceedings shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This
direction applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and all  other
persons. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
court proceedings. Liberty to apply.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. It is not in dispute that the appellant is a national of  Sudan  and  a
    member of the Zaghawa tribe (and therefore  a  "Non-Arab  Dafuri").  He
    appealed to the FtT against a decision of the SSHD of 26 September 2016
    refusing his protection and human rights claims.

 2. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the  appeal  was
    subsequently set aside by the Upper Tribunal. It remains for the  Upper
    Tribunal to re-make the decision on the appeal.

 3. By way of an e-mail to the Upper Tribunal on 28 November  2019,  Mr  A.
    McVeety, acting on behalf of the SSHD, invited the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    allow the appellant's appeal given the undisputed findings of fact  and
    the terms of the recent Upper Tribunal decision in AAR &  AA  (Non-Arab
    Dafuris - return) Sudan [2019] UKUT 282 (IAC).

 4. I conclude, for the reasons set out in the  preceding  paragraph,  that
    the appellant's appeal should be allowed on the basis that his  removal
    to Sudan would lead to a breach of the Refugee Convention.

Decision

For the reasons given above, the appellant's appeal is allowed on the  basis
that his removal would breach the United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the
Refugee Convention.
