Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Loughran, instructed by Wilson Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction. There has been  no
    application  before  me  for   this   direction   to   be   discharged.
    Consequently, unless and until a Tribunal or Court  directs  otherwise,
    the appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant or  any  member  of
    his family. Failure to comply with  this  direction  could  lead  to  a
    contempt of court.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born in October 1986. On 7  June
    2010 he was convicted of  an  offence  of  robbery  for  which  he  was
    sentenced to a period of four years imprisonment. On 23 October 2012  a
    decision was made that Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applies
    to the appellant and, on the same date, a deportation order was  signed
    against him.  The appellant exercised his right of appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal against the former decision. The  appeal  initially  came
    before a panel of the First-tier Tribunal on 6 December 2012,  but  was
    dismissed on all grounds. This determination was subsequently set aside
    by the Upper Tribunal (UTJ Reeds and UTJ Kebede) in a determination  of
    11 June 2013 and  the  appeal  was  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for redetermination.  The appeal then came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Morgan and Mrs E Morton (non-legal member) on  26  March
    2014, but was once again dismissed on all grounds, in  a  determination
    of 27 March 2014.

 3. On 28 April  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hemingway  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in  the  following
    terms:

         "2.  The grounds of application contend that  the  panel  erred  in
             these ways; a)failing to make findings as to whether  there  is
             family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR between
             the appellant and various family members; b) failing  to  treat
             the best interests of the children as  a  primary  concern;  c)
             failing to determine whether the weight to be attached  to  the
             deportation of foreign criminals is to  be  reduced  where  the
             proposed deportee is rehabilitated; d)  failing  to  apply  the
             correct test with respect to be  met  when  it  is  argued  the
             public interest in deportation is outweighed.

         3.   The panel  produced  a  careful  and  thorough  determination.
             However, it is arguable they erred in failing to evaluate  more
             fully and in a more individualised way  the  individual  family
             relationships and failed to treat the interests of the children
             as a primary concern..."

 4. Thus the matter came before me.

 5. Taking the grounds in turn, contrary to that submitted in first  ground
    I do not accept that the First-tier Tribunal failed to make findings as
    to whether family life existed between the appellant  and  the  various
    family members referred to in his evidence, nor do I  accept  that  the
    Tribunal failed  to  identify  with  precision  the  features  of  such
    relationships.

 6. At paragraph 17 of its determination the Tribunal identify that it  was
    not necessary for  it  to  hear  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant's
    siblings and aunt because the evidence they  had  given  regarding  the
    appellant's private and family life was not in dispute. From the  terms
    of this paragraph it is  clear  that  the  Tribunal  proceeded  in  its
    considerations on the basis of the evidence  as  contained  within  the
    respective witness statements. There was, in my conclusion, no need for
    the Tribunal to recite this evidence any further in the determination.

 7. The  Tribunal  continued  by  setting  out  relevant  features  of  the
    appellant's relationship with his mother  and  partner,  including  the
    fact that (i) he has  lived  with  his  family,  and  particularly  his
    mother, throughout his time in the United Kingdom; (ii) he is currently
    required by his bail conditions to remain living in the family home and
    (iii) that the appellant  is  in  a  'serious'  relationship  with  his
    partner.

 8. In paragraph 25 of its determination the Tribunal state as  follows  on
    this issue:

         "We  accept  the  particularly  strong  relationship  between   the
         appellant and his  siblings  and  in  particular  the  relationship
         between the appellant and his younger brother ...  who  attended  a
         school for children with  learning  disabilities.   We  accept  the
         quality of the relationship between the appellant  and  his  nephew
         and between the appellant and his fiancï¿½e and her son.   We  accept
         that most of the appellant's family ties  were  formed  before  the
         appellant was convicted of  any  offence.   We  accept  the  United
         Kingdom  nationality  of  the  three  children  involved   in   the
         appellant's life ... we accept that the effect of  the  appellant's
         removal is to significantly impair his  family  life  with  all  of
         these people ..." (my emphasis)

 9. In my conclusion it is clear from reading the Tribunal's  determination
    as a whole, and in particular paragraph 25 of the determination that:

      i) it accepted the nature of the relationships between  the  appellant
         and his various family members as they were  asserted to be in  the
         evidence before it; and

     ii) that each of these family relationships constituted family life for
         the purposes of a consideration of Article 8 of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention.

10. I do not accept that the Tribunal were required to  identify  with  any
    more precision than it did, the nature and extent  of  each  individual
    relationship the appellant had with  his  various  family  members.  It
    accepted the evidence as given, summarised the most  salient  parts  of
    that evidence, and found that each of  the  relationships  amounted  to
    family life.

11. Moving onto the second ground, i.e. the submission  that  the  Tribunal
    erred in failing to treat the best  interests  of  the  children  as  a
    primary consideration; the Tribunal accept,  in  paragraph  25  of  its
    determination, that the best interests of each of the children  lie  in
    them remaining in the United Kingdom. This finding  was  reiterated  in
    paragraph 26 of the determination, where the Tribunal conclude that the
    best interests of both the children and the adult members of the family
    "lie in the appellant not being deported but being  allowed  to  remain
    and continue his present role within the family".

12. Whilst it is correct to say that the Tribunal do not identify,  on  the
    face  of  the  determination,  that  it  directed   itself   that   the
    aforementioned  best  interests  must   be   treated   as   a   primary
    consideration, there is no reason in my conclusion to believe  that  it
    did not treat them as  such.   The  determination  was  written  by  an
    experienced and specialist Tribunal. The fact that reference was  made,
    and consideration given to, the best interests of the children is in my
    conclusion sufficient to demonstrate that the Tribunal were well  aware
    of the obligations under Section 55 of the 2009 Act. This conclusion is
    re-forced by the Tribunal's  identification  in  paragraph  10  of  the
    determination that it had  given  consideration,  inter  alia,  to  the
    appellant's skeleton argument, which itself references  section  55  of
    the 2009 Act, Article 3(1) of the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the
    Child, as well as associated case law. I do not, therefore, accept that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in the manner submitted in ground two  of
    the appellant's grounds.

13.  I  find  the  third  ground  somewhat  difficult  to  understand.   It
    identifies that the appellant submitted before the First-tier  Tribunal
    that the weight to be attached to the public interest  in  deporting  a
    person who has committed a serious crime should be reduced as a  matter
    of public policy where that person has been fully rehabilitated.  It is
    asserted that the First-tier Tribunal erred in (i)  failing  to  engage
    with this submission and (ii)  failing  to  identify  that  it  had  so
    reduced the weight in the public policy  side  of  the  proportionality
    scales.

14. In paragraph 24 of its  determination  the  Tribunal  accept  that  the
    appellant poses a low risk of reoffending, in line with  an  assessment
    made  by  the  Probation  Service,  and  that  he  is  continuing   his
    rehabilitation. It further refers to the fact that the appellant has in
    the past repeatedly  been  exposed  to  the  severe  domestic  violence
    suffered by his mother. It plainly  took  all  of  these  factors  into
    account when coming to its conclusions on the issue of proportionality.



15. In paragraph 27 of its determination the Tribunal observe that:

        "Mr Chirico quite correctly accepted,  there  is  a  strong  public
        interest in removing foreign citizens convicted of serious offences
        even where there is little or no evidence of  future  risk  to  the
        general public."

16. Looking at the determination as a  whole  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    Tribunal erred in its consideration of  the  fact  of  the  appellant's
    rehabilitation. It is somewhat artificial  to  require  a  Tribunal  to
    compartmentalise it considerations  in  the  manner  submitted  by  the
    appellant in his grounds.  It is clear that significant weight must  be
    attached to the policy  of  deporting  foreign  criminals,  given  that
    parliament has spoken in this regard in the 2007 Act (as to  which  see
    SS (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550).  It is also important that  a
    Tribunal identifies all the relevant features of an  individual's  case
    which are relevant  to  the  balancing  exercise.   In  this  case  the
    Tribunal identified those features put  forward  by  the  appellant  as
    being relevant, and took those into account (see for example  paragraph
    23 of the determination where the Tribunal refer to paragraph 46 of the
    appellant's skeleton argument).  It clearly weighed in the  appellant's
    favour the fact that he is now at a low  risk  of  reoffending  and  is
    continuing his rehabilitation, as well the history of exposure  to  the
    severe domestic violence that his mother  has  suffered.  The  Tribunal
    was, in my view, required to do no more than it did in this regard.

17. Turning finally then to the fourth ground, in which it is said that the
    Tribunal applied a legally incorrect test and/or  came  to  a  perverse
    conclusion.  The grounds cite from the decision of the Court of  Appeal
    in MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  and  in  particular
    paragraphs 43, 44 and 46 of that decision which  relevantly  (according
    to the grounds) state as follows:

         "43.     The word exceptional is often used to denote  a  departure
             from a general Rule.  The general Rule in the present  context
             is that, in the case of a foreign prisoner to whom  paras  399
             and 399A  do  not  apply,  very  compelling  reasons  will  be
             required to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  deportation.
             These compelling reasons are the 'exceptional  circumstances'.



         44.  We would, therefore, hold that the new Rules  are  a  complete
             code and that the exceptional circumstances to  be  considered
             in  the  balancing  exercise  involve  the  application  of  a
             proportionality test as required by  Strasbourg  jurisprudence
             ... .

         46.   ...  it  is  necessary  to   consider   whether   there   are
             circumstances which are sufficiently compelling (and therefore
             exceptional) to outweigh the public interest in  deportation."



18. In its conclusory paragraphs the First-tier Tribunal found:

         "27. In summary we consider that there are unusually strong factors
             weighing  in  the  appellant's  favour,  arguably   the   most
             important of which is that he came to the United Kingdom as  a
             minor and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the United
             Kingdom as a minor and that his entire family,  with  whom  he
             has close ties, will remain in the United  Kingdom.   However,
             as Mr Chirico quite correctly  accepted,  there  is  a  strong
             public interest in  removing  foreign  citizens  convicted  of
             serious offences even where there is little or no evidence  of
             future risk to the general public.  Whilst we  find  that  the
             deportation of the appellant will have harsh consequences both
             for the appellant and  more  importantly  his  family  we  are
             unable  to   find   either   that   these   consequences   are
             unjustifiably harsh or in the alternative that  even  if  they
             were unjustifiably harsh that deportation, given  the  offence
             in question, would not be proportionate.

         28.  In  summary  whilst  we  accept  the  serious  consequence  of
             deportation both to the appellant and his family  we  consider
             that on the facts of this case that the decision to deport  is
             not disproportionate."

19. It is important to observe that in paragraph 10  of  its  determination
    the Tribunal cite from the Upper Tribunal's decision in Kabia (MF: para
    398 - "exceptional circumstances") [2013] UKUT 00569, setting  out  the
    head note in that case in  full  -  paragraph  3  of  which  states  as
    follows:

         "The new Rules speak of exceptional circumstances but, as has  been
         made clear by the Court of Appeal in MF  (Nigeria),  exceptionality
         is a likely characteristic  of  a  claim  that  properly  succeeds,
         rather than a legal test to be met.  In  this  context  exceptional
         means  circumstances  in  which   deportation   would   result   in
         unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual or their family
         such that a deportation would not be proportionate."

20. The Tribunal correctly directed itself in  this  regard  and  there  is
    nothing in the determination that identifies the Tribunal as failing to
    properly apply that self-direction to its  considerations.   I  do  not
    accept that the Tribunal applied a higher threshold or "put a gloss" on
    the test set out in MF Nigeria.  It carried out a careful assessment of
    all of the evidence before it, including  everything  advanced  on  the
    appellant's behalf, and explained why those features of  the  case  did
    not  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  the  appellant's  deportation
    occasioned by his extremely serious past criminal behaviour. This was a
    conclusion the Tribunal was entitled to come to on the evidence  before
    it and, had I been required to consider this matter for myself, I would
    undoubtedly have come to the same conclusion.

21. Having carefully considered all of the grounds of application, as  well
    as Ms Loughran's careful and eloquent submissions, I do not accept that
    it has been demonstrated that the First-tier Tribunal erred on a  point
    of law such that its determination should be set aside.  The First-tier
    Tribunal's determination is therefore maintained  and  the  appellant's
    appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
