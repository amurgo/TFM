Representation:

Appellant:   In person and unrepresented.
 Respondent:  Mr Harrisson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The background to this determination is set out in my earlier decision,
    dated 24 July 2014, appended hereto.  The further hearing convened  for
    the purpose of remaking the decision has  now  been  completed.  It  is
    convenient to consider, and determine, the merits  of  this  appeal  by
    reference to the salient passages in the Respondent's  decision  letter
    (hereinafter "the impugned decision").

 2. By the impugned  decision,  dated  21  November  2013,  the  Respondent
    refused the Appellant's application for leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  regime  of  the  Points  Based
    System.  The letter of refusal rehearses the  following  three  reasons
    for rejecting the application:

    (a)  The Appellant has not genuinely  established  a  business  in  the
         United Kingdom, as required by Table 4 of Appendix A.


    (b)  The Appellant does not genuinely intend  to  invest  the  relevant
         money in such business.


    (c)  The money is not genuinely available to him and  will  not  remain
         available  to  him  until  its  expenditure  is  required  for  the
         business.

    The decision maker pronounced himself dissatisfied in respect  of  each
    of these three matters.  The letter also made  reference  to  paragraph
    245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The letter refers to certain documents provided by the  Appellant  with
    the application and some of the questions and answers during interview.
     It continues:

         "From the evidence provided and the answers you have given in  your
         interview, we are not satisfied that the �50,000 is yours to invest
         in a business in the United Kingdom.  You have not invested any  of
         the funds or transferred them into a business bank account, leading
         us to doubt the credibility over the genuineness of the funds."

    This passage can be readily related to the  second  and  third  of  the
    refusal reasons summarised above.  The letter continues:


         "The fact that you stated you had no previous employment other than
         the contract work for the Bank of America or business experience in
         the United Kingdom  are  both  contradictory  to  statements  given
         during your interview."

    While the syntax in this passage is not felicitous, its gist appears to
    be that, when interviewed, the Appellant gave contradictory information
    about his business experience and previous  employment.   There  is  no
    elaboration, particularisation or  substantiation  of  this  assertion.
    Furthermore, I consider that there is no proper basis  for  criticising
    or  condemning  the  Appellant  for  providing  some   elaboration   or
    clarification of information previously supplied when  interviewed.   I
    conclude  that  the  adverse  assessment  in  this  passage  cannot  be
    sustained.

 4. The letter continues:

         "You gave conflicting statements of how you knew Mr [MZU], director
         of ........  Limited, of your previous employment/business  history
         and the bank statements you provided  demonstrate  that  the  funds
         were from other means than your savings and  an  �8,000  gift  from
         your father."

         This discrete passage conflates a series of issues and invites  the
following analysis:

    (a)  While a substantial part of the letter is devoted  to  reproducing
         part of the Appellant's interview,  this  contains  no  conflicting
         statements about how the Appellant knew  Mr  MZU.  In  the  lengthy
         quotation, the Appellant recounted  that  the  two  persons  became
         acquainted as a result of attending the same MBA course.  There  is
         no conflicting statement about this matter in the interview segment
         quoted.   Nor  is  there  anything  in  the  letter   of   decision
         suggesting, much less establishing, some conflict or  contradiction
         by reference to  some  other  source.   In  a  separate  reproduced
         segment of the interview transcript, the Appellant states  that  he
         also knew Mr MZU in a different context.  I can discern  no  proper
         basis  for  the  contradiction  attributed  to  the   contradiction
         attributed to the Appellant by the decision maker. It follows  that
         this assertion cannot be sustained.

    (b)  The second statement in the passage quoted above simply rehearses,
         accurately, that some of  the  �50,000  funding  proposed  for  the
         business emanates from  sources  other  than  the  Appellant's  own
         savings. It was readily - and properly - accepted by Mr Harrison on
         behalf of the Respondent  that  in  this  type  of  entrepreneurial
         context the funding typically  comes  from  a  series  of  sources.
         Furthermore, the decision maker cast no doubt on the gift of �8,000
         from the Appellant's  father.   It  follows  that  the  reservation
         expressed in this discrete passage has no substance.

         The letter continues:

         "Furthermore, no evidence has been provided to confirm why [MK],  a
         family friend would deposit �24,460 into your personal account over
         a three day period and only two months prior to you submitting your
         application raises high concerns over the genuineness of the  funds
         [sic]."

    The Appellant  has  consistently  made  the  case  that  this  was  the
    repayment of a personal loan and that the timing  was  attributable  to
    his need for the funds to support his business.   Furthermore,  written
    confirmation of the repayment was provided by the debtor.  Contrary  to
    the decision maker's assertion, therefore,  evidence  was  provided  to
    explain this payment. None of this is taken into account in the  letter
    of decision, thereby rendering this reservation untenable. Furthermore,
    I consider the explanation tendered satisfactory.

 5. The next section of the letter begins thus:

         "Your last grant of leave was as a Tier 1 (Post Study)  Migrant  on
         25 July 2011 until 25 July 2013.  You have provided no evidence  to
         suggest that you have been  developing  this  business  during  the
         course of your leave.  There is nothing to suggest you have planned
         for or developed the idea prior to registering the company  in  May
         2013."


    Continuing, it is stated that an internet  search  revealed  a  website
    identical in content  to  that  of  the  Appellant.   This  passage  is
    contradicted by the evidence that the Appellant established  his  first
    business, Zafrees Limited, in 2012,  which  continued  for  almost  two
    years, including amongst its clients, the Bank of America and performed
    relatively well.  His  present  company,  SNZ  Solutions  Limited,  was
    established some two  months  before  the  submission  of  his  Tier  1
    application. The Appellant's previous history is ignored completely  in
    the decision letter.  Thus a significant factor has been  left  out  of
    account.  This  represents  yet  another  infirmity  in  the   impugned
    decision.

 6. In the next section of the decision letter, there is  a  focus  on  the
    market research conducted by the Appellant and a reference to questions
    and answers during the interview, in which he  explained  that  he  had
    conducted a questionnaire survey of 85 small businesses, with around 50
    results, supplemented by some 50 telephone calls  to  businesses  which
    elicited certain positive responses.  The decision letter states:

         "From the above answers it is  clear  that  you  have  not  made  a
         genuine attempt  to  advertise  your  business  or  carry  out  any
         substantive or formal market research."

    This passage lacks clarity and reasoning, particularly since  there  is
    no challenge  to  the  veracity  of  the  market  research  information
    supplied by the Appellant.   Nor  is  any  doubt  expressed  about  the
    Appellant's professed engagement in "telemarketing".

 7. Next, the decision letter states:

         "We conducted an internet search and found over 22  competitors  in
         your area.  You have provided  no  evidence  to  suggest  how  your
         company will compete in the local market against  more  established
         competitors."

    This passage fails to engage with the Appellant's intention to  provide
    services on a nationwide basis and places  disproportionate  weight  on
    the geographical, physical location of his business base.  Furthermore,
    in this and other  passages,  there  is  a  failure  to  recognise  the
    Appellant's  experience  of  two  years  within  the  highly  regulated
    financial industry. This  failure  is  especially  acute  in  the  next
    succeeding passage.  Furthermore, the Appellant is given no credit  for
    his third level education qualifications.  All of this  undermines  the
    conclusion which follows:


         "Therefore we are not satisfied that during your  period  of  Post-
         Study leave you have undertaken genuine and credible steps to  make
         preparation for planning, launching and developing a business  idea
         in the United Kingdom."

 8. The omnibus conclusion in the  decision  letter  is  expressed  in  the
    following terms:

         "Based on  the  above  consideration  the  Secretary  of  State  is
         therefore  refusing  your  application   because   you   have   not
         satisfactorily demonstrated that you  are  a  genuine  entrepreneur
         ....."

    As the analysis in the preceding paragraphs hereof  demonstrates,  much
    of the assessment and reasoning in the decision lacks  real  substance.
    In  particular,  some  important  pieces  of   information   were   not
    considered, either properly  or  at  all.  Furthermore,  assertions  of
    contradiction and conflict are not substantiated.  I  have  also  taken
    into account the information provided with the Appellant's  application
    and his evidence to this Tribunal.  The Appellant  was  an  articulate,
    impressive and plausible witness and  I  accept  his  evidence  without
    hesitation.  His attributes as a witness may explain why  Mr  Harrison,
    representing the Secretary of State, questioned the  Appellant  on  one
    issue only,  namely  the  profitability  of  his  business  during  the
    difficult, interim period initiated by the Appellant's application  for
    Tier 1  Entrepreneurial  Status.   The  Appellant's  evidence  to  this
    Tribunal was basically unchallenged.


 9. For the reasons elaborated above, I conclude that the impugned decision
    was not in accordance with the law.   The  proper  application  of  the
    relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules should  have  resulted  in
    the Appellant's application being granted.

DECISION

10. Thus I allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. This appeal has its origins in a decision made on behalf  of  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department (the "Secretary of State"),  dated  21
    November 2013, whereby the application of the Appellant, a national  of
    Bangladesh aged 28 years, for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as
    a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant was refused.  The ensuing appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal (the  "FtT")  was  dismissed.   In  dismissing  the
    appeal the Judge held, in substance, that the  Appellant's  application
    was properly refused because he had failed to place  his  funds  in  "a
    discrete  business  account".   This  is  the  first  ground  on  which
    permission to appeal was granted.  The second ground related to a  lack
    of  sufficient  findings  and  inadequate  reasoning   in   the   FtT's
    determination.

 2. At the conclusion of the  hearing,  I  gave  an  ex  tempore  judgment,
    allowing the appeal for the following reasons, in summary:

        a)    As there is no requirement under the Rules for the  funds  in
           question to be held in an applicant's business account, the  FtT
           committed a clear error of law.

        b)    There was a related failure to engage  with  the  Appellant's
           explanation for this, to link this with the refusal reasons  and
           to make findings accordingly.

        c)    The Judge rehearsed the Appellant's evidence relating to  the
           provenance of the funds and made certain  comments  about  same.
           However, no specific clear findings on this issue were made.

        d)    The Judge  repeated  the  supposed  business  account  error,
           confirming its materiality in his decision.

        e)    Finally, the Judge, on the face of the determination,  failed
           to properly explore the underlying evidence  (rehearsed  in  the
           refusal decision) and to make findings accordingly.

 3.  For these reasons, I announced that the appeal would succeed.

DECISION


 4. This gives rise to the following decision:

        a)    The decision of the FtT is set aside.


        b)    The appeal is retained in the Upper Tribunal for the  purpose
           of remaking the decision.

        c)    The case will be listed before me on  18  September  2014  at
           this venue for this purpose.
