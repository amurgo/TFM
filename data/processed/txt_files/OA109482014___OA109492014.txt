Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr H Kannangara, instructed by Anglo Chinese Law
Firm Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of China born on 29th March 1976  and  24th
    December 1996.  Their appeals against the refusal of entry clearance as
    the spouse and daughter of a person settled in the UK were dismissed by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge G Clarke in a decision  promulgated  on  27th
    October 2015.
 2. The Appellants appealed on the grounds that the judge had erred in  law
    in his interpretation of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE in  that  there
    was a conflict between paragraph E-ECP 3.1(b) and paragraphs 13 and  15
    of Appendix FM-SE.

3.   Appendix FM sets out the requirements to  be  met  and  Appendix  FM-SE
    listed the  specified  documents  that  needed  to  be  submitted.  The
    Appellants could satisfy Appendix FM paragraph E-ECP 3.1  by  combining
    the Sponsor's salary with the First Appellant's savings. Therefore, the
    judge had erred in law in dismissing the appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules. There was no challenge to his finding on Article 8 grounds.

4.   Further, it was submitted that the Respondent  should  have  considered
    the duration of the Sponsor's employment at the time the  decision  was
    made rather than at the date of application because, in the  particular
    circumstances of this case, the  Respondent  had  put  the  Appellants'
    application on hold pending the outcome of the case of MM and Others.

5.   Accordingly, the  Respondent  should  have  given  the  Appellants  the
    opportunity to rely on the Sponsor's employment and income at the  date
    when  the  application  was  reconsidered  in  August  2014.  Had   the
    Respondent done so  the  Sponsor  would  have  passed  the  six  months
    duration and the Appellants could easily have combined the  income  and
    savings under the Immigration Rules.

6.   The  Respondent  cross-appealed  on  the  ground  that  the  notice  of
    decision indicated that the appeal was allowed, but it was  clear  from
    the body of the decision and the preceding paragraph that it  had  been
    dismissed. The Respondent invited the Tribunal to correct this  obvious
    typographical error under Rule 31 of the Procedure Rules.

7.    Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    Robertson on the basis that it was arguable that Appendix  FM  did  not
    exclude the combination of savings and salaried income where a  Sponsor
    had been employed for less than six months in  the  current  employment
    and was in fact able to provide  evidence  of  his  gross  income  over
    twelve months.

8.   Further, the Respondent had applied for a correction under Rule  31  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014 for the simple reason that the judge found  against
    the  Appellants  and  dismissed  the  appeal  but  under  the   heading
    'Decision' stated that the appeals were allowed.  Since  permission  to
    appeal had been granted to the Appellants, it  was  a  matter  for  the
    judge whether the mistake could be rectified under Rule 31.





Submissions

9.   Mr Kannangara submitted that there was a conflict  in  the  Immigration
    Rules. Appendix FM-SE should only be interpreted to refer to  specified
    evidence necessary to meet Appendix FM. Paragraph A of  Appendix  FM-SE
    states:

         "This Appendix sets  out  specified  evidence  applicants  need  to
         provide to meet the requirements of the rules contained in Appendix
         FM and, where those requirements are also contained in other rules,
         including Appendix Armed Forces, and unless otherwise  stated,  the
         specified evidence the applicant  needs  to  provide  to  meet  the
         requirements of those rules.

10.  Mr Kannangara submitted that the sources listed at paragraph E-ECP  3.2
    did  not  prevent  the  combination  of  savings  and  income.  However
    paragraph  15  of  Appendix  FM-SE  introduced  an  extra  requirement.
    Paragraph E-ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM  states:

         "The applicant must provide specified  evidence  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-ECP 3.2 of


          a) a specified gross annual income of at least
                i) �18,600;
               ii) an additional �3,800 for each child; and
              iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child  alone  or
                   in combination with


          b) specified savings of
                i) �16,000; and
               ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to  2.5  times
                   the amount which is  the  difference  between  the  gross
                   annual income from the sources listed in paragraph  E-ECP
                   3.2 (a)-(d) and the total  amount  required  under  E-ECP
                   3.1(a).

11.  Paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE states:

         In respect of paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 13(d) the provisions in
         this paragraph also apply


         (a)  In order to evidence the level of gross annual income required
             by Appendix FM  the  person  must  meet  the  requirements  in
             paragraph 13(b) or paragraph 13(d)(i); and


         (b)  The person must also meet the level  of  gross  annual  income
             required by Appendix FM on the basis that their income is  the
             total of the gross


             (i)  The gross income from salaried employment in  the  UK  or
             overseas earned by the person in the twelve  months  prior  to
             the application;
             (ii)     The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
             income other than pension income received  by  the  person  or
             their partner in the  twelve  months  prior  to  the  date  of
             application;
             (iii)    The gross amount received from the UK  or  a  foreign
             State pension or a private paid pension by the person or their
             partner in the twelve months prior to the date of application;
             and
             (iv)     The person cannot combine the gross annual income  at
             paragraph 15(b)(i) to (iii) with specified savings in order to
             meet the level of income.


12.  Paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE states:

         Based on the evidence that meets the requirements of this  Appendix
         and can be taken into account  with  reference  to  the  applicable
         provisions of Appendix FM gross annual income under  paragraphs  E-
         ECP 3.1, ELTRP 3.1, E-ECP 2.1 will be calculated in  the  following
         ways:

          a) Where the person is in salaried  employment  at  the  date  of
             application, has been employed by their current  employer  for
             at least six months and has been paid throughout the period of
             six months prior to the date of application at  the  level  of
             gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the  level  relied
             upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will  be
             (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply), the total of:
                i) The level  of  gross  annual  salary  relied  on  in  the
                   application;
               ii) The gross amount of any specified  non-employment  income
                   other than pension  income  received  by  them  or  their
                   partner in  the  twelve  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                   application; and
              iii) The gross annual income from  the  UK  or  foreign  State
                   pension or a private pension received by  them  or  their
                   partner.


         (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at  the
             date of application and has been  employed  by  their  current
             employer for less than six months  (or  at  least  six  months
             where the person does not rely on 13(a))  their  gross  annual
             income will be the total of:
             (i)  The gross annual salary in the employment as  it  was  at
                  the date of application;
             (ii) The gross amount of any specified  non-employment  income
                  other than pension related  income  received  by  them  or
                  their partner in the twelve months prior to  the  date  of
                  application; and
              iii) The gross annual income from a  UK  or  a  foreign  State
                   pension received by them or their partner.
             In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.


13.  Mr  Kannangara  submitted  that  there  was  an  extra  requirement  in
    paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE which meant that the Appellants' in this
    case were unable to combine income and savings. There was a conflict in
    the Immigration Rules and Appendix FM-SE should not be  used  to  limit
    the scope of Appendix FM. Appendix FM-SE, in essence, was  guidance  as
    to what evidence should be supplied to satisfy Appendix FM.  Therefore,
    Appendix FM-SE could not introduce a further condition.

14.  Secondly, the  Respondent  put  the  Appellants'  application  on  hold
    because of the case of  MM.   Therefore,  the  Respondent  should  have
    looked at the situation at the time of the decision not at the date  of
    application. Paragraph 2A of Appendix FM-SE  gave  the  Respondent  the
    power to grant the application if the applicant did not submit a P60 or
    to enable the Respondent to  ask  for  it.  Since  the  Respondent  had
    delayed  the  decision  the  Respondent  should  have  known  that  the
    situation had changed and should have decided it on the basis of  facts
    existing at the time of this decision.

15.  Paragraph 2A of Appendix FM-SE states, inter alia:  The  applicant  may
    in addition to the payslips and personal bank statements required under
    that paragraph submit the P60 for the relevant  periods  of  employment
    relied upon if issued. If they do not the Entry  Clearance  Officer  or
    Secretary of State may grant the  application  if  otherwise  satisfied
    that the requirements of the Appendix relating to that  employment  are
    met. The Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State may request that
    the applicant submit the documents in accordance with  paragraph  D  of
    this Appendix.

16.  Paragraph D(f) states: Before making the decision under Appendix FM  or
    this Appendix the decision maker may contact  the  applicant  or  their
    representative in writing or otherwise to request  further  information
    or documents.

17.  Mr Kannangara submitted that it was  incumbent  on  the  Respondent  to
    make enquiries of the Appellants because at the  date  of  decision  it
    would be obvious that the Sponsor had been in  his  current  employment
    for more than six months.

18.  Ms Ahmad submitted that there was no conflict between Appendix  FM  and
    Appendix FM-SE. There was no authority that Appendix FM-SE  was  'less'
    of an Immigration Rule and that Appendix FM should take  precedence  in
    some way.  She relied on paragraph 51 of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387
    which states:

         "In our judgment, the approached Article 8  in  the  light  of  the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In  other  words  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with."




19.  Accordingly, Appendix FM had the same status  as  Appendix  FM-SE.  The
    relevant date, in this case,  was  the  date  of  application  and  the
    Appellants had chosen to make the application on that date.  The  delay
    in deciding the application was immaterial because the  Respondent  had
    to apply the Immigration Rules. It was quite clear  that  the  relevant
    date in those Rules was the date of application.  The  grounds  do  not
    identify any error of law on the judge's part in his interpretation  of
    paragraph 13 or paragraph 15.

20.  In response, Mr Kannangara stated  that  there  was  no  definition  of
    annual gross income in the Rules in Appendix FM and the Appellants were
    able to meet all the requirements of  Appendix  FM  and  therefore  the
    judge had erred in law in dismissing the appeal under  the  Immigration
    Rules.


Discussion and Conclusion

21.  I find that, although Appendix FM-SE states, at the outset,  that  this
    Appendix sets out  the  specified  evidence  applicants  will  need  to
    provide to meet the requirements of the Rules contained in Appendix FM,
    it did, in  fact,  not  only  mention  the  types  of  evidence  to  be
    submitted, but defined how certain  parts  of  Appendix  FM  should  be
    interpreted and calculated. Paragraphs 13 and 15, in  particular,  deal
    with how to calculate gross annual income under Appendix  FM  and  they
    set out conditions that have to be met.

22.  Further paragraph B of Appendix FM-SE states  "Where  evidence  is  not
    specified by Appendix FM, but is of a type covered  by  this  Appendix,
    the requirements of this Appendix shall apply."

23.  I am not persuaded that there is any  difference  between  Appendix  FM
    and Appendix FM-SE in the  sense  that  they  are  both  parts  of  the
    Immigration Rules and it is not the case that Appendix FM  should  take
    precedence over Appendix FM-SE. Nor am I persuaded that  there  is  any
    conflict between Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE, although I  appreciate
    that paragraph 15 qualifies how gross annual income is to be calculated
    under Appendix FM and there is a distinction made between a person  who
    has been employed for twelve months and a person who has been  employed
    for less than six months. This distinction also applies to cases  where
    the applicant's partner has been in salaried employment outside the UK,
    but that was not relevant in this case.

24.  I have some sympathy with Mr  Kannangara's  argument,  but  I  have  no
    jurisdiction to consider whether the Rules are ultra vires. It is quite
    clear that paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE  specifically  prohibits  the
    combination of gross  annual  income  and  savings  where  the  current
    employment is for a period of less than six months.


25.  The judge  accepted  that  the  Sponsor  could  satisfy  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM, if he was allowed to  combine  his  annual
    income with savings. The judge specifically  considered  paragraphs  13
    and 15 which he set out in full in the decision and  found  that  on  a
    strict interpretation of the Immigration Rules, which had been set down
    by Parliament, the Sponsor  would  be  unable  to  combine  income  and
    savings. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

26.  I find that  there  was  no  arguable  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    conclusion because paragraph 15 of Appendix FM-SE was  in  clear  terms
    and prevented the combination of savings and income. I am not persuaded
    by Mr Kannangara's argument that there is a conflict  between  Appendix
    FM and Appendix FM-SE and, notwithstanding the  additional  requirement
    in paragraph 15, the judge's decision was not erroneous given  that  he
    properly interpreted the relevant Immigration Rule.

27.  The appeal also fails on the second ground because it  is  quite  clear
    that the gross annual income is that earned by the person in the twelve
    months prior to the date of application and therefore  the  application
    is the relevant date. Delay on the part of the Respondent was therefore
    irrelevant to the consideration in an application  of  the  Immigration
    Rules in this case. There was nothing in the  Rules  that  allowed  the
    Respondent to look at the earnings at the date  of  decision  when  the
    Rules specifically state that it must be the  twelve  months  preceding
    the application.  Accordingly, there was no error of law in the judge's
    conclusion that the relevant date was the date of application.

28.  Lastly, the point  made  is  that  the  Respondent  has  some  residual
    discretion to request further information from the Appellants and  that
    on the  facts  of  this  case,  where  the  delay  was  caused  by  the
    Respondent, the ECO  should  have  made  enquiries  about  whether  the
    Sponsor was still  employed  with  his  current  employer.  Again  this
    argument cannot succeed because the date of application is the relevant
    date for consideration in the Appellants' case and the  judge  and  the
    ECO can only look at the facts existing at the date of application.

29.  Accordingly, whilst I have sympathy for the  Appellants,  in  that  the
    Sponsor meets the financial requirements save that the application  was
    made two months short of the six month period of employment, the appeal
    before the First-tier Tribunal could not succeed under the  Immigration
    Rules.

30.  Mr Kannangara suggested that a further application could  not  be  made
    because one of the Appellants had attained the age of 18. It  was  open
    to the Appellants to have made a fresh application when the Sponsor had
    been in employment for more than six months, namely in June  2014  when
    the Second Appellant was still under  the  age  of  18.  There  was  no
    challenge to the judges Article  8  findings  in  the  grounds  and  Mr
    Kannangara did not rely on it at the appeal.



Summary

31.  I conclude that there was no arguable  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    interpretation of the Immigration Rules and his decision to dismiss the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules was one which was properly  open  to
    him.  The Appellants could not satisfy  Appendix  FM-SE  and  therefore
    they could not satisfy the Immigration Rules. I dismiss the appeal.

32.  I amend the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  under  Rule  42  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  There  was  clearly  a
    clerical mistake in the 'Notice of Decision' which should read  'Appeal
    dismissed.'
