                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Entry Clearance Office (ECO) appeals  against  a  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Bruce  promulgated  on  7th  February
    2014.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Turkey born 10th November 1987  who
    applied on 31st August 2012 for leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as
    the spouse of Ali Baba Huyuk (the Sponsor) a  person  settled  in  this
    country.

 4. The application was refused on 15th November 2012.  The ECO  considered
    the application with reference to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.
     It was not accepted that the parties were in a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship, nor was it accepted that they intended to  live  together
    permanently in the United Kingdom.

 5. It was not accepted that the financial requirements of Appendix FM were
    satisfied as the specified documents required to show that the  Sponsor
    had a gross  income  of  at  least  �18,600  per  annum  had  not  been
    submitted.

 6. The Appellant appealed.  The appeal  was  heard  by  Judge  Bruce  (the
    judge) on  24th  December  2013.   Having  considered  the  documentary
    evidence and heard oral evidence from the Sponsor, the judge found that
    the parties were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,  and  they
    intended to live together as husband and wife.

 7. In relation to finance the  judge  referred  in  paragraph  8  to  bank
    statements covering the period July-November 2012.  Paragraph 9  refers
    to up-to-date bank  statements.   The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the
    financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  were  met,  finding  that
    although there was no letter from the Sponsor's employer, there  was  a
    letter from accountants which set out the required information, and the
    judge was prepared to treat this as a letter from the employer, on  the
    basis that the accountants are his agents.  The  appeal  was  therefore
    allowed under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 8. The judge recorded that if she was wrong to allow the appeal under  the
    rules, because of the missing letter  from  the  employer,  the  appeal
    would be allowed under Article 8 of the  1950  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 9. The ECO applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   In
    summary it was contended that the judge had had no regard at  paragraph
    9 of the determination, to the specified evidence set out  in  Appendix
    FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

10. It was contended that the judge had not had appropriate regard  to  the
    relevant date, which was the date of  application,  and  the  specified
    evidence was required for a specified period before that date.  It  was
    contended that the application had been made in September 2012, and the
    judge had not considered the evidence in the specified period prior  to
    that date.

11. It was contended that it was not clear what  gross  annual  income  the
    Sponsor had  at  the  date  of  application  and  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in allowing the  appeal  under  Appendix  FM,  as  the
    specified documents had not been submitted.

12. In relation to Article 8 the ECO relied upon Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640
    (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).  It  was  contended  that  the
    judge had not explained why the decision to refuse entry clearance  was
    disproportionate, if a further application could be made to satisfy the
    financial requirements.  It was therefore submitted that the judge  had
    not considered whether there were compelling  reasons  for  considering
    the appeal outside the Immigration Rules, and whether refusal of  entry
    clearance would be unjustifiably harsh.

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Bird who noted that there was a requirement in Appendix  FM-SE  that  a
    letter from the Sponsor's  employer  containing  specified  information
    must be submitted, and that the judge had arguably  erred  in  allowing
    the appeal despite the absence of such a letter.

14. In relation  to  Article  8  Judge  Bird  recorded  in  the  concluding
    paragraph of her grant of permission;

         "The judge's consideration of this is under paragraph 10 and it  is
         arguable that the judge in considering  Article  8  has  failed  to
         consider the findings of both the High Court and the Upper Tribunal
         in what circumstances an assessment under Article 8 of the ECHR  is
         to be made if the requirements to the Immigration  Rules  were  not
         met."

15. Following the grant of permission directions  were  issued  that  there
    should be a hearing before the Upper Tribunal, to ascertain whether the
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law


16. Mr Smart was provided with a copy of  a  rule  24  response  issued  on
    behalf of the Claimant.  However Mr Dhanji indicated that  he  did  not
    rely upon that response which had been prepared by Counsel who appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.  Mr Dhanji said that it was conceded on
    behalf of the Claimant, that the judge had erred in law in allowing the
    appeal under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules,  despite  the  fact
    that an employer's letter containing the specified information, had not
    been submitted.  Mr Dhanji indicated that he relied upon  the  rule  24
    response in relation to Article 8 as it was contended  that  the  judge
    had not erred in law on this issue.

17. In relation to the reference in the rule 24 response to an  application
    under rule 15(2A) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the proposed submission of a letter from the Appellant's  employer,
    Mr Dhanji indicated that he would not be  making  such  an  application
    because the letter was not relevant to the error of law  consideration,
    and if the decision was re-made, would not mean that the  appeal  could
    succeed under Appendix FM.

18. Mr Smart relied upon the grounds contained within the  application  for
    permission to appeal and submitted that it was clear that the judge had
    erred in law in treating an accountant's letter as if it was  a  letter
    from the Sponsor's employer, and the judge had not taken  into  account
    the specified evidence which  must  be  submitted  to  prove  that  the
    financial requirements of Appendix FM are met, and that  the  specified
    evidence must cover a period of time, normally six months, prior to the
    application being made.  Mr Smart submitted that  the  bank  statements
    did not show receipt of the  Sponsor's  claimed  wages.   There  was  a
    conflict in the evidence provided as to what those wages  were  if  the
    amount in the contract of employment was compared to  paragraph  19  of
    the Sponsor's witness statement, which  set  out  what  he  claimed  to
    receive.

19. Mr Smart submitted that the judge had not adequately explained  why  it
    was appropriate to allow the appeal under Article 8, when the financial
    requirements of Appendix FM were not met, and on this issue relied upon
    the grounds contained within the application for permission to appeal.

20. Mr Dhanji in making submissions, having accepted  that  the  judge  had
    erred in considering the financial requirements of Appendix FM,  argued
    that the evidence submitted did in fact show that  the  Sponsor  earned
    above �18,600, and therefore the judge having accepted  that,  had  not
    erred in allowing the appeal under Article 8 for the reasons  that  she
    gave.

21. Having considered  the  submissions,  I  decided  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law such that the decision must be set aside.  Mr
    Dhanji was correct to concede that the judge had erred in finding  that
    a letter from an accountant could be regarded  as  a  letter  from  the
    Sponsor's employer.  The absence of the employer's  letter  meant  that
    the requirements of paragraph 2 of Appendix FM were not  satisfied  and
    the judge erred in finding to the contrary.

22. In relation to Article 8 the judge's findings are brief  and  contained
    in paragraph 10.  The judge does  not  make  any  reference  to  either
    Gulshan or Nagre and does not adequately explain why refusal  of  entry
    clearance is disproportionate given that the financial requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules are not satisfied, and that it  is  open  to  the
    Appellant to make a  fresh  application  to  satisfy  the  rules.   The
    Supreme Court in Patel and Others [2013] UKSC 72  stated  at  paragraph
    57;

         "57. It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing  power.   It  is  to  be  distinguished  from   the
             Secretary of State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
             outside the rules, which may be  unrelated  to  any  protected
             human rights."

23. Having set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal I  decided  to
    proceed to re-make the decision.  Both representatives  indicated  that
    they were ready  to  proceed  and  there  was  no  application  for  an
    adjournment.

Re-Making the Decision

24. Mr Dhanji indicated that it  was  not  proposed  to  call  any  further
    evidence.  Mr Dhanji accepted that the appeal could not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules, but submitted that the appeal should be  allowed
    under Article 8.  In submitting that Article  8  should  be  considered
    outside the Immigration Rules Mr Dhanji relied upon paragraph 135 of MM
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

25. I was asked to find, with reference to section 117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) that although there  may
    be no evidence of the Claimant's  ability  in  English,  she  would  be
    financially independent  if  granted  entry  clearance  to  the  United
    Kingdom, and genuine family  life  existed  between  the  Claimant  and
    Sponsor.

26. Mr Dhanji stated that he relied upon Chikwamba and Hayat on  the  basis
    that it was not necessary for a further application for entry clearance
    to be made.  If such an application was made, this  would  involve  the
    ECO having to expend further resources in  assessing  the  application,
    which was unnecessary.  I was asked to allow the appeal under Article 8
    outside the Immigration Rules.

27. Mr Smart submitted that it was clear that the appeal could not  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules, and  contended  that  it  should  also  be
    dismissed with reference to Article 8.  Mr Smart suggested  that  there
    was no good reason to allow the appeal  under  Article  8  and  that  I
    should take into account that it was accepted that the appeal could not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules.

28. Mr Smart submitted that there was no good reason  to  depart  from  the
    rules and that it was open to the Claimant to make a fresh  application
    which would be the appropriate course of action, to  ensure  compliance
    with the Immigration Rules.  On that basis Mr Smart submitted that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was proportionate.

29. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Findings and Conclusions

30. I find that the financial requirements of Appendix FM are not satisfied
    and therefore the appeal cannot succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    There was however no challenge to the findings made in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that the Claimant and Sponsor have a genuine relationship and
    intend to live  permanently  with  each  other  as  spouses  and  those
    findings are  preserved.   Therefore  if  there  is  to  be  a  further
    application for entry clearance, there has been a judicial  finding  in
    relation to their relationship.

31. The primary reason for finding that the financial requirements are  not
    satisfied, is the failure to provide an  employer's  letter  containing
    the specified information, which means that paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-
    SE is not satisfied.  I do not find that it  has  been  proved  by  the
    production of specified evidence, that the Sponsor had an annual income
    in excess of �18,600.

32. In relation to Article 8, this is  not  a  case  that  can  succeed  by
    relying upon Article 8 as set out in the Immigration Rules, in Appendix
    FM in relation to family life, and  paragraph  276ADE  in  relation  to
    private life.

33. I therefore have to decide  whether  Article  8  should  be  considered
    outside the Immigration Rules.  In my view where the provisions in  the
    Immigration Rules permit consideration of exceptional circumstances and
    other factors, then the Immigration Rules can be regarded  as  being  a
    complete code and there will usually be no need to consider  Article  8
    directly.  This is because the  same  outcome  would  derive  from  the
    application of the Immigration Rules as under  Article  8.   Where  the
    Immigration Rules contain no such  provisions,  then  they  are  not  a
    complete code, and Article 8 will need to be  considered  directly.   I
    set out below paragraph 135 of MM, referred  to  by  Mr  Dhanji,  which
    summarises the position;

         "135.    Where the relevant group of IRs, (Immigration rules)  upon
             their proper  construction,  provide  a  'complete  code'  for
             dealing with a person's Convention rights in the context of  a
             particular IR or statutory provision, such as in the  case  of
             'foreign criminals,' then the balancing exercise and  the  way
             the various factors  are  to  be  taken  into  account  in  an
             individual case must be done in  accordance  with  that  code,
             although references to 'exceptional circumstances' in the code
             will nonetheless entail a proportionality  exercise.   But  if
             the relevant group of IRs is not such a 'complete  code'  then
             the proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided
             by the Huang test and UK and Strasbourg case law."

34. There has been no proportionality exercise under the Immigration Rules,
    and the Appellant cannot rely upon section EX.1  of  Appendix  FM,  and
    therefore I find it appropriate  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the
    rules.

35. I therefore follow the step-by-step approach advocated by the House  of
    Lords in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 which involves answering  the  following
    questions;

         "(1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
             authority with  the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
             respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?

         (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

         (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?

         (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"

36. If I find that the Appellant has established family life, the  decision
    in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39 means that I have to consider the  family
    life of the Sponsor as well as the Claimant.

37. I am satisfied that the parties have established a genuine family life,
    and that refusal of entry clearance is an interference with that family
    life, which engages Article 8.

38. I find that the decision is in accordance  with  the  law  because  the
    Claimant cannot satisfy the Immigration Rules in order  to  be  granted
    entry clearance.

39. I  then  have  to  consider  whether  the  decision  is  necessary  and
    proportionate.  I take into account section 117B of the 2002 Act  which
    states that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
    public interest.

40. It is in the public interest, and in the interests of the economic well-
    being of the United Kingdom, that individuals  seeking  to  enter  this
    country are able to speak English, and are financially independent.

41. There is some evidence in the Claimant's bundle at page 55 that she has
    achieved level A1 of the CEFR and I am therefore satisfied that she can
    speak English.

42. The evidence submitted does  not  prove  that  the  Claimant  would  be
    financially independent.

43. I do not find that the decisions in  Chikwamba  and  Hayat  assist  the
    Claimant.  Although Mr Dhanji referred to these cases very briefly, and
    I was not referred to any particular provision, the applications  which
    were the subject of appeals in those cases  were  not  entry  clearance
    applications.

44. The position in this appeal is that the  Claimant  cannot  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   I  am  asked  to  state  that
    notwithstanding that the specified evidence has not been provided,  the
    Claimant could be adequately maintained, and therefore  notwithstanding
    the failure to meet the rules,  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under
    Article 8.

45. As previously mentioned in this determination, the  Supreme  Court  has
    indicated that Article 8 is not  a  general  dispensing  power.   While
    there is an interference with the  family  life  of  the  Claimant  and
    Sponsor, by refusal of entry clearance, this is because the Immigration
    Rules cannot be satisfied.  That in my view is not disproportionate.

46. The appropriate course of action would be for the Claimant  to  make  a
    further application  for  entry  clearance  to  provide  the  specified
    documentation to prove that the financial requirements of the rules can
    then be met.  I do not find that refusal of  entry  clearance  breaches
    the Claimant's rights under Article 8 and I find that the



    weight to be accorded  to  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control, outweighs the wishes of  the  Claimant  and  Sponsor  to  live
    together in the United Kingdom.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

The Claimant's appeal on human rights grounds is dismissed.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the  Upper  Tribunal  makes  no  anonymity  order.
