                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born on 2 January 1985.

    2. She came to the United Kingdom on 1 October 2009 on a  student  visa.
       She was subsequently granted leave until 8 July 2013 as a post  study
       migrant. On 6 July 2013  she  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  an
       entrepreneur. This was refused on 12 February 2014. The Secretary  of
       State was not satisfied she was a genuine entrepreneur  intending  to
       invest money.

    3. The business related to the import of textiles and was to be  carried
       out through a private limited company, Tharmi Solutions  Ltd,  formed
       on 13 May 2013. The appellant claimed she had �50,000 to invest.  She
       produced Barclays bank statements with a balance on 8  July  2013  of
       �56,336. At interview he disclosed that her sister had  provided  her
       with the monies. The respondent noted the monies were paid in shortly
       before the  application  and  believed  the  deposits  were  a  paper
       exercise to facilitate the application rather than investment.

    4. The business plan indicated  there  were  no  business  premises.  At
       interview she was not convincing. There was a lack of evidence of any
       in-depth market research. When asked about competitors she said there
       were none in the area but a simple check revealed several hundred  in
       London where the company was based. She  had  produced  one  contract
       dated 28 June 2013.A check on the customer revealed it was a  limited
       company only established two months before the contract.

    5. The  appellant's  background  was  in  computing  not  textiles.  The
       respondent concluded she did not have sufficient  previous  education
       or experience for the business.

    6. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Judge Hubball on 3  October  2014.
       The appellant attended and was represented, as was the respondent. In
       a decision promulgated on 17 October 2014 her  appeal  was  dismissed
       under the immigration rules and under article 8,  the  latter  having
       been raised in the grounds of appeal.

    7. The judge focused upon  the  question  of  funding  and  whether  the
       appellant  genuinely  intended  to  establish  a  business.  In  oral
       evidence she said she lived with her sister  and  brother-in-law  and
       their two young children. The judge noted the appellant's sister, her
       financial backer, had not given evidence. At paragraph 66  the  judge
       concluded the appellant had not shown on the balance of probabilities
       that the funds were genuinely available to her to invest.  The  judge
       pointed out  that  the  monies  were  transferred  into  her  account
       proximate to the application date. The judge found a lack of business
       knowledge on her part.

    8. Regarding article 8, it had been accepted on behalf of the  appellant
       she could not meet the requirements of appendix FM or  paragraph  276
       ADE. The judge referred to section 117 and that  the  maintenance  of
       effective immigration control is in the public  interest.  The  judge
       did not see any  compelling  circumstances  outside  the  immigration
       rules.

  The Upper Tribunal

    9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  the  basis
       it was arguably an error of law to raise  the  source  of  the  funds
       rather than whether they were  actually  available  with  a  view  to
       investment. At paragraph 63 the  judge  had  referred  to  the  major
       transfers into her bank account coming from Tharmi Solutions and  the
       respondent's concern as to the source of the money.

   10. The appellant has  not  attended  her  appeal.  Notification  of  the
       hearing was sent to her on 16 April 2015. There is a  medical  report
       in the file from Kettering General Hospital  received  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal on 12 May 2015. It states the  appellant  was  an  inpatient
       from 2 May to  the  6  May  2015.  On  discharge  her  condition  was
       described as stable. She had been complaining of general malaise  and
       had been treated for a chest  infection.  She  also  was  seen  by  a
       rheumatologist  for  consideration  of  an  arthritic  condition.  On
       discharge she was stable and fit. She also enclosed a letter dated  9
       May 2015, in which she asked for  her  appeal  to  be  heard  in  her
       absence. In the circumstances I saw no reason to adjourn the  hearing
       and decided to proceed in her absence.

  Conclusions

   11. From reading the decision of First-tier Judge Hubball the  judge  did
       not dismiss the appeal because  the  source  of  the  monies  in  the
       appellant bank account was not identified. The  judge  concluded  the
       appellant had not discharged the burden of proof  to  show  that  she
       genuinely was an entrepreneur.

   12. The judge made the comment  that  monies  were  introduced  into  her
       account shortly before the application  was  made.  In  itself,  this
       could be viewed as a person calling in funds to launch a project. The
       appellant's claim was that the  bulk  of  the  money  came  from  her
       sister, with whom she lived. In itself there is  nothing  wrong  with
       this and if a close family member was willing to  finance  a  project
       well and good. However, the judge made the comment the sister did not
       attend. The genuineness of the enterprise could not be further probed
       by cross-examination of her sister.

   13. The appellant indicated she would repay her sister from  the  profits
       of the business. In assessing the  genuineness  of  the  project  her
       sister's circumstances, as her financial backer, would  be  relevant.
       The concern was that this was a  contrived  application.  Her  sister
       could be injecting money into her bank  account  shortly  before  her
       leave was due to expire to support an application. Whether she  truly
       was willing to advance the money for a business was crucial. This was
       a reasonable concern to raise.

   14. The  judge  has  clearly  set  out  the  arguments  advanced  by  the
       respondent. It is important to note the structure of the decision and
       not to confuse what is recorded as submissions with the  judge's  own
       findings and reasons. There is passing reference to the source of the
       money. However, when the decision is read as a whole it is clear  the
       source of the money is not the issue. The issue is the genuineness of
       the project.

   15. At paragraph 63 of the  determination  the  judge  is  repeating  the
       respondent's concerns. At paragraph 64  the  judge  agreed  with  the
       presenting officer's submission that she had not shown the funds were
       genuinely available to her. The legitimate concern was that funds had
       been introduced on a temporary basis to bolster her claim  to  be  an
       entrepreneur and the project was not genuine. The focus  was  on  the
       genuineness of the funds being  used  for  investment  in  a  project
       rather than the source of the funds.

   16. The decision highlights the fact that the appellant  was  aware  that
       the respondent was questioning the genuineness of the project and the
       claimed investment. This meant she was made aware of  the  issue  and
       had the opportunity to discharge the burden of proof. The immigration
       judge concluded she had failed to do so. I see no  error  of  law  in
       this approach. My conclusion therefore is that the First-tier judge's
       decision shall stand. No material error of law has been demonstrated.

  Decision.

   17. The appeal is dismissed as no error of law is disclosed. The decision
       of First-tier Judge Hubball dismissing the appeal shall stand.
