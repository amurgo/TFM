Services
For the respondent:    Ms S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Onyema Chas Jnr Ofoegbu, date  of  birth  2.8.76,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wolley promulgated 20.8.14, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of  the  respondent,  dated  23.1.14,  to  refuse  his   human   rights
    application for leave to remain in the UK.  The Judge heard the  appeal
    on 8.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    7.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Woolley should be set aside.

 6. There is an error of law in the determination that is not raised in the
    grounds of appeal. According to �9 of the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the representatives  for  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    appellant agreed at  the  outset  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
    hearing  that  as  the  application  had  been  made  before  the   new
    Immigration Rules in force from 9.7.12, they did not apply. That is not
    correct. As I understand it, the appellant's  claim  related  to  human
    rights under article 8. Prior to 9.7.12 there were no Immigration Rules
    for a human rights claim  and  thus  there  could  be  no  transitional
    provisions for the application of the new  Rules.  The  only  Rules  to
    which the Secretary of State could turn were those in Appendix FM  with
    family life and in paragraph 276ADE with private life. The transitional
    provisions have no relevance to an application  made  entirely  outside
    the Immigration Rules, as there was no equivalent provision  under  the
    old Rules for consideration of the application. The only framework  for
    considering private and  family  life  in  existence  at  the  date  of
    decision was that of the new Rules under paragraph 276ADE and  Appendix
    FM. The Secretary of State is required to undertake  a  proportionality
    assessment  and  the  new  Rules  comprise  the  framework   for   that
    assessment. This is entirely  consistent  with  both  Haleemudeen,  and
    Edgehill.

 7. However, this error was not one raised by the appellant and even if the
    judge had addressed Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE, it seems  unlikely
    that it would have assisted the appellant.

 8. The grounds of appeal contend that the judge erred in law in  that  her
    rejection of the article 3 claim, making negative credibility  findings
    against the appellant, was substantially influenced by  the  inaccurate
    assertion in the determination that the appellant  had  not  previously
    put forward any article 3 claim, whereas there was evidence before  the
    tribunal that he had done so in 2012.  Judge  Brunnen  considered  this
    ground was arguable and thus granted permission on all grounds.

 9. The article 3 claim is allegedly based  on  the  claim  that  that  the
    appellant would be at risk on return to Nigeria  because  he  would  be
    killed as the only son of his father in order that other family members
    would then inherit his property in accordance with what  the  appellant
    alleged was part of the Igbo clan culture.

10. The difficulty for the appellant in respect of this ground is  that  at
    �9 the judge recorded that the two representatives agreed at the outset
    of the appeal that the only issue was article 8. That  is  repeated  in
    the judge's summary of the submissions at �24.

11. Further, at �16 the judge noted the appellant's evidence  that  he  did
    not make an asylum or article 3 claim immediately  because  he  thought
    the easier route for him would be to sit for examinations in the UK. At
    �33 the judge noted the confirmation of the appellant's  representative
    that no asylum claim had been made.

12. Despite the aforementioned agreement between the  representatives  that
    the only issue was article 8, at �34 the judge went on to consider  the
    risk on return for the appellant. In doing  so,  the  judge  apparently
    made an error in stating that there was no evidence of having  made  an
    article 3 claim, and the appellant's statement that he had done so  but
    that it had been ignored by the respondent. However, even if the  judge
    was in error in stating that there had been no past article 3 claim, it
    is clear from a reading of the determination as a whole that the  judge
    properly considered the appellant's factual case and assessed the  risk
    of harm to him.

13. In summary, the judge did not accept the appellant's  factual  account.
    Neither he nor his sister were found to be credible witnesses  and  the
    judge set  out  his  reasons  for  that  finding  over  two  pages.  In
    particular, at �32 the judge did not accept that his  father  had  been
    killed by relatives, or unlawfully killed, or that there was  a  family
    feud. The judge did not accept the appellant's account of what happened
    when he returned to Nigeria and concluded, "I do  not  accept  that  he
    would be at risk should he return there."

14. It is thus clear that notwithstanding  any  error  as  to  whether  the
    appellant had made an  article  3  claim,  the  judge  disbelieved  the
    appellant's factual account and reached the conclusion  that  he  would
    not be at any risk on return for any of the  reasons  claimed  by  him.
    There has thus been a de facto consideration of the  article  3  claim.
    The appellant has failed to demonstrate that any factual  error  as  to
    whether he had made an article 3 claim previously could or  would  have
    produced any different outcome to the appeal. Finally on this issue,  I
    find that the appellant's own representative did not pursue an  article
    3 claim, agreeing that the sole issue was article 8 ECHR.

15. In the circumstances I find no error of law on this ground of appeal.

16. The second ground of appeal is that at �31 the judge erred  in  stating
    that the appellant would not be a primary target  in  the  "Igbo  caste
    system," as there was  no  evidence  in  support.  In  fact,  both  the
    appellant and his witnesses had stated that and thus  it  is  suggested
    that the judge was in error, undermining  the  other  findings  in  the
    determination. I have carefully considered  the  appellant's  statement
    and that of his witnesses. The grounds submit that  the  statement  was
    "completely unsubstantiated and amounts to an  error  of  law."  It  is
    suggested that the judge should have adjourned for expert  evidence  on
    the issue.

17. I find that it is the assertions of the  appellant  and  his  witnesses
    that  was  completely  unsubstantiated  by  any  independent  evidence.
    Actually, what the judge stated was that, "There is no evidence  before
    me that a son is a primary target in the  Igbo  caste  system."  It  is
    clear that the judge was referring to objective evidence in support  of
    the contention by the appellant and his witnesses.  Clearly  the  judge
    was aware that was being urged by the appellant, otherwise,  logically,
    there would be no purpose in this short paragraph.

18. At �4 of the witness statement of Rita  Ukwunna  Ofoegbu  (A67)  it  is
    stated that, "As the only son to  the  family,  he  was  in  particular
    danger as his death would have meant that  the  extended  family  would
    inherit from our family."  The  appellant's  sister's  statement  (A52)
    referred to a family feud and that, "As the only son, my  parents  were
    psychologically disturbed at the threat that  the  appellant  would  be
    killed." The appellant's latest witness statement,  handed  in  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing, stated at �5, "I am the only son of
    my parents and Igbu land that means a lot, as  culturally  I  am  prune
    (sic) to death and danger.

19. It is not entirely clear from the above whether  the  appellant's  case
    was that he was at risk because of a particular family feud, or because
    he is only son of the family and that if he died other relatives  would
    inherit the property of his immediate family. However, it was  for  the
    appellant to produce satisfactory evidence of what  he  claimed.  There
    was no request for an adjournment and I reject the suggestion that  the
    judge should have,  of  his  own  motion,  adjourned  for  such  expert
    evidence to be obtained. The judge was entitled to point out that there
    was no evidence before her that a son is a primary target in  the  Igbo
    caste system. It is obvious and can be safely inferred that  the  judge
    must have been referring to  evidence  in  support  of  the  subjective
    claims of the appellant and his witnesses. In the circumstances, I find
    no error of law in this regard.

Conclusions:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
