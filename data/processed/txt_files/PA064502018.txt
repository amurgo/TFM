Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Bedford (for Central England Law Centre)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of Ahmed [A], a citizen  of  Afghanistan,  born  1
       January 2001, against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  of  6
       July 2018 dismissing his appeal, itself brought against  the  refusal
       of his asylum claim of 8 May 2018.


    2. The Appellant is from Surkh Rod in Nangarhar, Afghanistan. He arrived
       in the UK on 7 October 2015 and claimed  asylum.  He  had  previously
       travelled across Iran, Turkey, Serbia, and various EU countries.  His
       asylum claim was based on his  fear  of  forced  recruitment  by  the
       Taliban. Daesh had come to his village taking and  killing  children,
       and asking for boys to join their organisation. The Taliban  came  to
       his home and asked his father if the  Appellant  and  his  two  older
       brothers would enlist to become suicide bombers.  From  October  2014
       the Taliban sent warning letters to his family home  asking  that  he
       join up. His older brothers fled at once, and the Appellant  and  his
       father followed six days later.

    3. His claim was refused because it was not considered  consistent  with
       the country evidence, which did not demonstrate that the Taliban  had
       taken over his home area as of April 2013 or that he was at  risk  of
       forced recruitment; and it was thought implausible that  the  Taliban
       would have sent warning letters giving his brothers  the  opportunity
       to escape.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the likelihood of the Taliban having
       been perceived by the Appellant as having taken over  his  home  area
       given media articles showing that Surkh Rod had become  dangerous  to
       enter by spring 2014. However, it did not  accept  the  rest  of  his
       account as credible, because

      a) The mention of having witnessed a child's suicide bomb attack only
         at the hearing was not plausible given the Appellant's account was
         focussed on association with suicide bombing generally: this
         addition was indicative of willingness to mislead;


      b) Whilst the Taliban were known to write warning letters, it was not
         plausible that they would thus alert the parents of potential
         suicide bombers as this invite their targets' escape, and it was
         implausible that their father would make arrangements for his
         elder sons to escape first, leaving the Appellant vulnerable to
         recruitment for several days in the meantime;


      c) There was nothing in his account to suggest that he would be at
         any personal risk of facing problems with Daesh: the possibility
         must have been something that he had become aware of whilst living
         in the UK, from television reports, and was not a real risk;


      d) There was an inconsistency in his account of losing touch with his
         father, as he had said in his witness statement that they became
         separated in Sofia after which a Pashtu speaker that the Appellant
         called "uncle" took care of him and assisted with his journey to
         the UK, whereas at the hearing he had said that he had managed to
         contact his uncle in Afghanistan following losing touch with his
         father in order to make arrangements for his onwards journey;


      e) It appeared that the plan had consistently been for him and his
         father to travel to the UK rather than claim asylum in the first
         safe third country;


      f) His claim to have been unable to re-establish contact with his
         father in the UK was not plausible: had he truly been innumerate
         such as to be unable to recognise a mobile telephone number he
         would presumably have mentioned this at interview, and he had in
         fact shown evidence of numeracy by correctly identifying Afghan
         banknotes at interview and admitting he had attended school for a
         year.  And the benefit of feigning being out of contact with adult
         relatives was self-evident given the advantages that unaccompanied
         minors had in the status determination system.

    5. Based on those findings, the First-tier Tribunal found the  Appellant
       was not in need of international protection, as he was not at risk in
       Surkh Rod if he returned there for any individual reason and not  was
       there any generalised risk of violence there; anyway  he  would  have
       support available to him from his immediate and extended  family.  In
       any event, he could safely  relocate  internally  to  Kabul  being  a
       healthy male with skills gained from his life in the UK and with  the
       benefit of relatives who could support him.


    6. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law by

      a) Failing to take account of the difference between how children and
         adults might be expected to recall events, and of the possibility
         that the Appellant would be unable to write down numbers even if
         he could recall them;


      b) Overlooking material evidence as to the prevalence of the use of
         child suicide bombers in the Appellant's home area;


      c) Making findings without evidential foundation in concluding that
         the Taliban would not use letters in the context of invitations to
         enlist as a suicide bomber notwithstanding that there was country
         evidence indicating that they did, and as to whether an agent
         might have told the Appellant of the advantages of claiming to be
         out of touch with his family;


      d) Failing to have regard to the Appellant's age, mental health, lack
         of work experience and education, in concluding that Kabul would
         be a reasonable site of relocation.

    7. The Upper Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 16 November  2018,
       on the basis that it appeared that material  evidence  regarding  the
       use of night letters had been overlooked.


    8. Before me Mr Jarvis for the  Secretary  of  State  took  a  pragmatic
       stance, explaining that there  were  clearly  difficulties  with  the
       reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal. However, the  most  significant
       failure of the Judge below was that the Appellant was in fact a minor
       at the date of the appeal  hearing,  and  this  had  not  been  given
       express attention in the  making  of  the  credibility  findings.  Mr
       Bedford expressed his agreement with commendable concision.

  Findings and reasons

    9. I accept that there  were  indeed  material  errors  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


   10. Given the Appellant was  a  minor,  his  evidence  should  have  been
       approached having regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2
       of  2010  for  Child,  vulnerable  adult  and  sensitive   appellants
       vulnerable and sensitive witnesses having regard  to  the  extent  of
       their vulnerability and the effect on the quality of  their  evidence
       and the ultimate weight to be given it.


   11. Although the First-tier Tribunal referred to the Appellant's date  of
       birth and his age, there is no other indication in the decision  that
       any special attention was afforded the impact that his age might have
       on his ability to give his account. Far from applying this  approach,
       if anything, the Appellant's minority was in fact held  against  him,
       via the reference to the perceived advantages that the  system  would
       bestow  on  a  child  without  family  to  which  to  return  abroad.
       Accordingly the appeal must be re-heard afresh.


   12. When the appeal is re-heard, the Judge will need to  have  regard  to
       the matrix of Country Guidelines. In the most recent decision  of  AS
       Afghanistan, the Upper Tribunal found that low level individuals such
       as the Appellant would not be at real risk of  persecution  from  the
       Taliban in Kabul. It would not in general be unreasonable  or  unduly
       harsh for a single adult male in good health  to  relocate  to  Kabul
       even if he does not have any specific connections or support  network
       in Kabul. However, the  particular  circumstances  of  an  individual
       applicant must be taken into account in the context of conditions  in
       the place of relocation, including a person's age, nature and quality
       of support network/connections with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical
       and mental health,  and  their  language,  education  and  vocational
       skills when determining whether a person falls  within  this  general
       position. A person with a support network or specific connections  in
       Kabul is likely to be in a  more  advantageous  position  on  return,
       which may counter a particular  vulnerability  of  an  individual  on
       return.


   13. However, regard must also be had to the fact that the  assessment  of
       risk is different in the case of a minor than an adult. The situation
       of a child or vulnerable young person on a return to Afghanistan  may
       be different to that of a slightly older  adult  with  experience  of
       life in an urban centre there, or with family  to  support  them.  As
       stated in AA (unattended children)  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT  16
       (IAC) headnote at (2):


           "the background evidence demonstrates that  unattached  children
           returned  to  Afghanistan,  depending  upon   their   individual
           circumstances and the location to which they are  returned,  may
           be  exposed  to  risk  of  serious   harm,   inter   alia   from
           indiscriminate violence, forced  recruitment,  sexual  violence,
           trafficking and  a  lack  of  adequate  arrangements  for  child
           protection.  Such risks will have to be taken into account  when
           addressing the question of whether a return is  in  the  child's
           best interests, a primary consideration when determining a claim
           to humanitarian protection."


       Those guidelines remain relevant: as  stated  in  AS  Afghanistan  CG
       [2018] UKUT 118 (IAC) (28 March 2018) (headnote at (8)): "The country
       guidance in AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG  [2012]  UKUT  16
       (IAC) also remains unaffected by this decision."


   14. And as stated most recently in SA (Afghanistan) [2019]  EWCA  Civ  53
       �43:


           "KA (Afghanistan) established the proposition that, in the light
           of  risks  which  included   forced   recruitment   and   sexual
           exploitation of vulnerable  young  males,  persecution  was  not
           respectful of birthdays, and that assumed age was more important
           than chronological age. In JS (Afghanistan) the  Upper  Tribunal
           noted that, although JS was no longer a minor, consideration had
           to be given to whether he  would  have  family  or  other  adult
           support on  return  to  his  home  country  appropriate  to  his
           particular needs, and in the context of the risks to  unattached
           children and the fact that such risk did  not  disappear  on  an
           eighteenth birthday."


   15. Although on a re-hearing the Appellant will no longer be a minor, the
       principle that persecution is not  respectful  of  birthdays  remains
       apt.


   16. AS (Afghanistan) at Upper Tribunal  level  also  concluded  (headnote
       (v)) that, "although Kabul suffered the highest  number  of  civilian
       casualties (in the latest UNAMA figures from 2017) and the number  of
       security incidents is increasing, the proportion  of  the  population
       directly affected by the security situation  is  tiny.   The  current
       security situation in Kabul is not at  such  a  level  as  to  render
       internal relocation unreasonable or  unduly  harsh."  The  First-tier
       Tribunal will also need to have regard to the fact that, as noted  by
       the Court of Appeal in AS (Afghanistan) [2019] EWCA  Civ  208,  there
       appears to have been something of an arithmetic slip in the course of
       the Upper Tribunal's reasoning in AS, in that the  civilian  casualty
       rate was miscalculated by a factor of ten. In the Court  of  Appeal's
       estimation, that could not  be  written  off  as  a  mere  "error  of
       expression"  but  represented  a  "substantive  error"  �5,  42.  The
       implications of that miscalculation will need to be considered by the
       First-tier Tribunal when it hears the appeal.


   17. As already indicated, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  cannot
       stand and the appeal must be remitted for re-hearing afresh.

Decision

The appeal is allowed to  the  extent  it  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for re-hearing afresh.
