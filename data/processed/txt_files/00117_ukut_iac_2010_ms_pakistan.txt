(i)   The effect of AS and NV [2009] EWCA Civ 1076 is to make the Tribunal
the primary decision maker in an increased number of cases where a new
ground is raised for the first time, but it does not have the effect of
requiring the Tribunal to consider as a section 120 statement a re-
formulation of the original ground on which leave to remain was sought.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.     The  appellant  is  a  national  of  Pakistan.   He  appealed  to  an
    Immigration Judge against the decision of the Secretary of State on  27
    April 2009 refusing to vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The
    appellant's wife, Ghulam Fatima  and  their  sons  Muhammad  Awais  and
    Muhammad Hamza are dependent on his appeal.

2.    The appellant had applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-Study
    Work) Migrant.   His  application  was  rejected  because  he  had  not
    satisfied  the  Secretary  of  State  that  he  met   the   maintenance
    requirements of paragraph 245Z(e) and Appendix C of HC 395.

3.    It was common ground that the appellant had made  his  application  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant on 20 March 2009 and  that
    it was treated by the Secretary of State as being made on 23 March.  It
    was also common ground that the appellant had not had the necessary sum
    of �2,399 for the entirety of the three month period, in  that  he  had
    not had the minimum required amount in the period 16 December  2008  -
    1 January 2009.

4.    It was shown at  the  hearing  on  24  June  that  the  appellant  had
    maintained a balance in excess of �2,399 for over five months.

5.    It was argued before the Immigration Judge that on  a  proper  reading
    of Section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,
    consideration could be given to the more recent  bank  statements.   It
    was argued that the substance of the decision was simply the refusal to
    vary leave to remain, and reliance was placed on what had been said  by
    the Tribunal at paragraph 9 in LS (Gambia) [2005] UKAIT 00085.

6.    The Immigration Judge, however, founding himself on a recent  decision
    of the Tribunal in NA and Others [2009] UKAIT 00025, concluded that any
    reference to "the substance of the decision" had to be a  reference  to
    the specific issue or issues which led the Secretary of State to refuse
    to vary the previous leave to remain.  He considered that it was clear,
    in particular from what was said  at  paragraph  49  in  NA,  that  the
    relevant provisions required appellants to show they had the  requisite
    amount of personal savings during the three months  immediately  before
    their application and therefore it was not  possible  to  consider  the
    subsequent state of the bank account.

7.    The appellant sought reconsideration of this  decision,  arguing  that
    in the context of the one-stop appeal mechanism in Section 120  of  the
    2002 Act it was appropriate to interpret the notion of the substance of
    the  immigration  decision  differently  from  that  concluded  by  the
    Immigration Judge and that the more recent state of  the  bank  account
    could be taken into account.  It was also argued that the Secretary  of
    State had not issued directions to remove the appellant from the United
    Kingdom, and that this operated unfairly  to  the  appellant  since  he
    could not challenge the decision in that regard other than by remaining
    in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  The ambit of  the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in TE (Eritrea) [2009] EWCA Civ 174 was  raised  as  an
    associated issue.

8.    A Senior Immigration Judge ordered reconsideration on all grounds.

9.    The hearing before me took place on 2 November and  7  December  2009,
    Mr Z Malik, instructed by Malik Law Chambers Solicitors (Bethnal  Green
    Road), appeared on behalf of the appellant.  Mr M Blundell appeared  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State.

10.   Mr Malik referred to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in  AS
    (Afghanistan) and NV (Sri Lanka) [2009] EWCA Civ 1076 and also provided
    a copy of TE (Eritrea).  A copy of Odelola  [2009]  UKHL  25  was  also
    provided.

11.   Mr Malik had referred to the impending decision in AS and  NV  in  his
    grounds and it was now of course decided.  It was argued that AS and NV
    had clear implications for the earlier decision of the Tribunal  in  EA
    [2007] UKIAT 00013.  It was said in AS and NV that the substance of the
    Section 85(4) decision meant the decision on the  detailed  eligibility
    of an individual in the context of the rule.

12.   The Tribunal was referred to paragraph 78 and onwards in  AS  and  NV.
    The substance of the decision was the refusal to vary leave to  remain.
    Paragraph 80 was also relevant.  If a Section 120  statement  had  been
    made then the Tribunal  must  consider  and  determine  the  appeal  in
    relation to that.  In AS and NV the appeal had  been  allowed  and  the
    Tribunal  had  been  ordered  to  consider   the   matter   under   the
    International Graduate Scheme, although no decision had  been  made  by
    the Secretary of State on that.   As  an  example  of  how  this  would
    operate, if a student applied for further leave to remain as a  student
    and was refused and appealed, making a Section 120 statement  in  which
    they now said they qualified  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  post-study
    migrant, on the basis of the reasoning in AS and NV the  Tribunal  must
    consider this and if the matter were made  out  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed.  To obtain leave to remain it was necessary to show �800  over
    three months prior to the  date  of  application.   If  there  were  no
    application then in accordance with what was said  in  AS  and  NV  the
    Tribunal had to consider the post-study migrant  matter  and  determine
    it.  It was necessary to treat the Section 120  statement  as  a  fresh
    application.  Its date would be considered as the date  of  application
    for the purpose of the post-study migrant  rules.   In  this  case  the
    facts were not in dispute.  The appellant had applied on 23 March 2009.
     It was accepted that the  balance  between  23  December  2008  and  1
    January 2009 was less than the required  amount  so  on  the  basis  as
    decided by the Tribunal in NA the appeal could  not  succeed.   At  the
    hearing the appellant had made a Section 120 statement in the form of a
    witness statement in which he  had  explained  why  he  should  not  be
    removed from the United Kingdom and should be granted leave to  remain.
    The balance had fallen below the requisite figure for fewer than  seven
    days but he had been maintaining the balance since 1 January and if  he
    applied now would succeed.  The Tribunal was  under  an  obligation  to
    treat the Section 120 statement as a  fresh  application.   If  so  the
    appellant would succeed, as  the  balance  had  always  been  over  the
    requisite amount since 1 January.

13.   Also, in support of that, if the appellant were refused he would  have
    to make another application to the Secretary of State enclosing  recent
    bank statements, and  clearly  the  legislative  framework  discouraged
    this.  Reference was made to paragraph  102  in  AS  and  NV  and  also
    paragraph 3.  There was a preference for one-stop appeals  and  a  view
    that the process should not encourage successive applications and  this
    favoured the interpretation argued for in respect of Section 85(4)  and
    Section 120.

14.   Ground 2 was concerned with the proper interpretation of the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in TE.  No removal directions had been issued so
    the Tribunal's jurisdiction was limited to the  Immigration  Rules  and
    Article 8  and  it  did  not  encompass  any  argument  as  to  whether
    discretion had been exercised outside the Immigration Rules.   If  that
    had been done then it would invoke  paragraph  395C  and  the  Tribunal
    could have concluded that even if the appellant did not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules he should not be removed,  bearing  in  mind  the
    paragraph 395C factors.  In the  absence  of  removal  directions  that
    could not be considered however.  It was argued that this was unfair to
    the  appellant  and  unlawful.   The  matter  had  been  considered  at
    paragraph 15 in TE, quoting from what had been said by Laws  LJ  in  JM
    [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 at paragraphs 16 to 18 and  22  and  23.   If  the
    appellant's current appeal was unsuccessful then the Secretary of State
    would have to issue removal directions and when he did so the appellant
    would have another right of appeal and could then argue in  respect  of
    paragraph 395C before the Tribunal.  The price he would  pay  for  this
    would be that of committing a criminal offence by overstaying, as would
    his employers if they continued to employ him and  this,  as  had  been
    said by Laws LJ, was wrong in principle.  Mr  Malik  also  referred  to
    paragraphs 19 and 20 of TE and the Section 47 issue.   There  had  been
    no reason given for segregating removal directions from the substantive
    decision and this was unfair and was not in accordance with the law.

15.   Mr Blundell was in some difficulties, not having seen a  copy  of  the
    grounds until  today  and  in  light  of  the  interest  and  potential
    difficulty of the issues involved I  acceded  to  his  request  for  an
    adjournment and the matter was to be listed for completion on a date to
    be fixed.

16.   At the resumed hearing on 7 December  2009  Mr  Malik  referred  to  a
    letter sent to his instructing solicitors from the Civil Appeals Office
    concerning his ground 1 which was  to  be  dealt  with  in  six  linked
    appeals to be heard as a test group on that particular  issue.   As  it
    was not likely to be dealt with by the Court of Appeal for some time he
    was happy for the Tribunal to proceed today, and  Mr  Blundell  agreed.
    The same was true of ground 2.  Mr Malik had referred to  that  at  the
    previous hearing.

17.   Thereafter Mr  Blundell  made  his  submissions.   He  relied  on  the
    skeleton argument he had put in, and amplified a number of points  made
    in it.

18.    At  the  outset  he  urged  the  Tribunal  to  exercise  caution   in
    considering what weight to give to the letter from  the  Civil  Appeals
    Office to the appellant's solicitors.   He  referred  to  the  Practice
    Direction on citation  of  authorities  which  prohibited  citation  in
    proceedings before the Tribunal of various types of documents from  the
    Court of Appeal including  permission  decisions  and  directions,  and
    argued that that should apply in this case even where  it  was  in  the
    form of a direction from a Lord Justice who had sat in AS and NV [2009]
    EWCA Civ 1076.  Clearly it was appropriate for the letter to have  been
    shown to the Tribunal but it was asked to approach  its  contents  with
    extreme caution in reference to what was  said  by  way  of  directions
    concerning AS and NV.  What was said in the letter  did  not  cause  Mr
    Blundell to abandon  paragraph  6.15  of  his  skeleton  and  he  would
    continue to argue that AS and NV did not weaken what had been  said  in
    NA and Others [2009] UKAIT 00025, nor did it  in  effect  demolish  the
    decision in EA (Nigeria) [2007] UKAIT 00013.

19.   Mr Blundell's submissions  were  summarised  at  paragraph  6  of  the
    skeleton argument.  AS and NV had not considered the ambit  of  Section
    85(4) of the 2002 Act in any detail.  As a result,  the  foundation  of
    EA, on which NA was constructed, remained entirely firm.   With  regard
    to the points made at paragraph 7 of the skeleton, reference  was  made
    to the judgment in AS and NV of Moore-Bick LJ at paragraph 65  onwards.
    He had not cited Section 85(2), and that  must  indicate  that  Section
    85(4) was not material to his judgment.  Paragraph 77 was of particular
    relevance.  Moore-Bick LJ and Sullivan LJ had focused in particular  on
    that point.  That did not mean  that  Section  85(4)  did  not  receive
    comment in AS and NV, but when one went to the comments  of  Moore-Bick
    LJ on what the Tribunal had done, it was argued  that  he  had  treated
    Section 85(4) as irrelevant to the case before him.  At paragraph 72 he
    had summarised what the Tribunal had decided, in  effect  shutting  out
    the Section 120 grounds.  This approach had been rejected at  paragraph
    83 onwards.  EA and SZ were both referred to in paragraph 82, but there
    was no indication in that judgment that they were wrong.   Sullivan  LJ
    dealt with the point at paragraph 114.  If there was an opportunity  to
    say that the decision in EA was wrong, then it  clearly  existed  there
    and likewise in respect of  Moore-Bick  LJ's  paragraph  83.   In  fact
    neither had said that EA was wrong but  had  preferred  to  shelve  the
    issue of Section 85(4) and referred to Section 85(2).  Paragraph  9  of
    the skeleton dealt with this.

20.   Paragraphs 78 to 79 and 110 to 114 comprised the ratio of  AS  and  NV
    and that was with regard to  the  meaning  of  Section  85(2)  and  the
    reference was the same as  "immigration  decision"  in  Section  82(2).
    With regard to what was said about Section 85(4), this supported EA and
    the reliance on it in NA as a consequence.   Since  Section  85(4)  had
    been treated as largely irrelevant, the Tribunal could be taken to what
    Arden LJ said in respect of Section 85(4). The point was referred to at
    paragraph 15(v)  and  also  paragraphs  27  to  32.   Significance  was
    attached to Section 85(4) as being relevant to the appeal and Arden  LJ
    had agreed with the views of  Senior  Immigration  Judges  Perkins  and
    Waumsley in the Tribunal.  She had quoted from SZ  [2007]  UKAIT  00037
    and supported the decision at paragraph 32.  There was nothing in Moore-
    Bick LJ's decision to cast any doubt on that.  As regards what was said
    by Sullivan LJ on Section 85(4), that was to be found at paragraph  113
    and in the last sentence in  particular.   As  a  consequence,  it  was
    argued that Sullivan LJ clearly said that the decision appealed against
    in Section 85(2) was simply the immigration decision, but the reference
    to the substance was a reference back to the  decision  actually  taken
    under  the  Immigration  Rule  in  question,  which  was  precisely  in
    accordance with what the Immigration Judge had found and what was found
    in EA and then in NA.   Paragraph 11 of the skeleton referred to this.

21.   It was argued that AS and NV did not disturb  the  previous  guidance,
    and considered very different circumstances from those in  the  instant
    case.  In AS the appellant wanted to set up in business under paragraph
    206E, and in NV the original application was for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on account of ten years' lawful residence.  No additional ground
    had been raised in a Section 120  notice  in  the  instant  case.   The
    application was echoed in the appeal and therefore a distinction needed
    to be drawn and there was a clear distinction  between  a  Section  120
    case, such as an AS and NV case, and a non-Section  120  case  such  as
    this one.  There was therefore nothing in AS and  NV  which  undermined
    the decisions in EA and NA.  What was said about Section  85(4)  in  AS
    and NV supported the conclusion in EA and NA.   Reference was  made  to
    the fixed historic time line point referred to in NA: at  the  date  of
    the application, as the Rules said.  Reference was made to the skeleton
    at paragraph 14.  The decision of the House of Lords in Odelola  [2009]
    1WLR 1230 gave some further support  to  what  was  being  argued.   In
    particular paragraphs 7 per Lord Hoffman and 39 per Lord Brown were  of
    relevance.  There was a clear  statement  in  the  Rule  and  this  was
    supported by Odelola so the Tribunal should adhere to  the  EA  and  NA
    approach.

22.   With regard to ground 2, concerning TE (Eritrea) [2009] EWCA Civ  174,
    it  was  the  appellant's  argument  that  the  Secretary  of   State's
    segregation of the decision to refuse to vary leave and the decision to
    refuse to issue removal directions was flawed in law.  Paragraph 36  of
    the grounds dealt with this, but it was argued that that was worded too
    strongly.

23.   At this point Mr Malik made it clear that he did not rely on what  was
    said in that paragraph about abuse of power.

24.   Mr Blundell noted that it had been said that the decision was  not  in
    accordance with the law because of that segregation, but he argued that
    TE did not support that argument.  He referred to paragraph 18  of  his
    skeleton argument in this regard.  Sedley and Lloyd  LJJ  rejected  the
    argument made  in  that  case  that  it  was  always  inappropriate  to
    segregate the two decisions.  Paragraph 19 in Sedley LJ's judgment  was
    of relevance in this regard.  It was said that it might  be  acceptable
    if it were practical and fair and it was reasonable for a person not to
    break the law.  He referred also  to  paragraphs  55  and  56  in  that
    judgment.  It was argued that this was  not  very  clear,  but  it  was
    sufficiently clear that the broad submission was rejected.

25.   Mr Blundell argued that it was not possible to ascertain the ratio  of
    the decision in TE.  It had not been said by the Court of  Appeal  that
    the decision was not in accordance with the law but there was reference
    to it being unfair to the appellant, which was  not  agreed  with,  but
    even if it were,  it  did  not  amount  to  a  decision  being  not  in
    accordance with the law, and paragraph 56 in the judgment of  Lloyd  LJ
    was as strong as it went when it was  said  that  it  would  have  been
    sensible for the two stages to have been combined.  The  argument  that
    no clear ratio could be found in TE (Eritrea) was supported by what was
    said in the grounds quoting from a permission of leave from Sir Richard
    Buxton on the basis  that  TE  required  clarification.   The  Tribunal
    should follow the wording of the statute.  Only when removal directions
    were made under Section 10 could the Secretary of  State  consider  the
    paragraph 395C factors and nothing bound him as to the making of such a
    decision.

26.   JM (Liberia) had been cited in TE, but the concern in  that  case  was
    that there should not be a situation where a person  had  to  commit  a
    criminal offence before their human rights case  could  be  considered,
    and this was seen as objectionable.  That should be contrasted with the
    situation before the Tribunal.  It was not a question of  human  rights
    entitlement but the question of a person's right under  paragraph  395C
    which was far wider than human rights issues and there  was  no  reason
    for a person to be entitled to be considered under paragraph 395C,  but
    good reason to consider a person liable to removal differently  from  a
    person seeking variation of leave.

27.   In his submissions  Mr  Malik  questioned  the  Secretary  of  State's
    reliance on EA which he argued had clearly been rejected by  the  Court
    of Appeal.  He referred to paragraphs 78 and 79 of AS and NV.   It  was
    clear that one could not understand Section 85, including Section 85(4)
    without understanding Section 82 and Section 84.  As to how  the  court
    had dealt with EA, reference was made to paragraphs 82 and 83.  It  was
    clear that Moore-Bick  LJ  had  referred  not  only  to  the  decisions
    mentioned there but also  to  EA  and  SZ  and  he  explained  this  at
    paragraphs 83 and 84.  Elsewhere Sullivan LJ dealt with the  matter  at
    paragraph 113, in particular the last sentence,  which, it was  argued,
    referred to the approach which he outlined  earlier  in  the  paragraph
    that the decision was  not  limited  to  a  decision  to  refuse  under
    specific Immigration Rules, and it was argued that the meaning  of  the
    word "decision"  in  Section  85(2)  and  Section  85(4)  remained  the
    decision to refuse an application to vary leave,  not  the  refusal  of
    variation under  specific  Rules  as  the  Tribunal  had  held  in  NA.
    Paragraph 114 referred to SZ and EA as incoherent  decisions.   It  was
    argued that EA and SZ and NA should no longer  be  seen  as  persuasive
    even in respect of Section 85(4).  Even if the Home Office were correct
    on this point, then as Mr Malik had argued before,  if  an  appeal  was
    made against refusal to vary leave as a student and an appellant made a
    Section 120 statement that he should remain  on  the  grounds  that  he
    satisfied the post-study work scheme, then it should be questioned what
    the date of the application was, as the guidance referred to  the  date
    of the application.  The Tribunal had to consider  the  matter  against
    the post-study work Rules as was said  in  NA,  and  if  there  was  no
    application then it would have to  be  the  date  of  the  Section  120
    statement as Mr Malik argued, as  being  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
    application.  In this case there was  a  leave  to  remain  application
    which had been refused.   The  Section  120  statement  had  been  made
    concerning the balance which was less at the date  of  the  application
    but now the appellant had the appropriate balance in the  account.   It
    was argued on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  that  there  was  a
    difference as regards AS and NV since the  appellant  was  not  raising
    additional grounds in the Section 120 statement.  Reference  needed  to
    be had to the specific wording of Section 120, in particular paragraphs
    2 and 3.  Keeping this in mind it was necessary to look at paragraph 80
    of AS.   It was argued that what the appellant had said in the  Section
    120 statement was clearly capable of supporting  a  fresh  application.
    The Tribunal should consider the  Section  120  statement  as  a  fresh
    application and determine  it.   If  so  the  appellant  would  clearly
    succeed, given the balance in his account.

28.   As regards ground 2, it was accepted that the Secretary of  State  was
    not obliged to issue removal directions with the refusal  notice.   But
    here the Secretary of State had been unable to give any reason for  the
    decision to segregate the removal directions and the refusal notice and
    this was relevant to the concern raised in TE by the  Court  of  Appeal
    where there had also been no reasons given.  It was also  not  disputed
    that TE did not  say  that  the  decision  in  that  case  was  not  in
    accordance with the law, but that was because in TE the Home Office had
    accepted  the  appellant's  point  and  had  agreed  to  issue  removal
    directions after considering the matter under  paragraph  395C.   There
    had been no such concession in this case.

29.   Finally, a point relevant to both grounds concerned paragraph  103  of
    AS and NV.  It  was  argued  that  the  legislation  favoured  one-stop
    appeals and the appellant would be forced to make a fresh  application,
    and the legislation discouraged this.  If the Home Office was right  in
    respect of ground 2 then, again, this  would  force  the  appellant  to
    lodge another appeal when removal directions were issued and  this  was
    discouraged by the legislative framework.

30.   Mr Blundell asked and  was  given  permission  to  raise  two  further
    points.  The first was to ask the Tribunal to read paragraph 80  of  AS
    and NV in full.  The second was that he had  not  seen  a  Section  120
    notice.

31.   Mr Malik explained that that  was  to  be  found  in  the  appellant's
    witness statement.  In AS there was no Section 120  statement  made  in
    the appeal form but a witness  statement  had  been  taken  to  be  the
    Section 120 statement.

32.   Mr Blundell argued that there was nothing in the witness statement  in
    the bundle of 19 June 2009 to indicate  that  it  was  a  Section  120
    statement and nor was there a submission that it should be treated as a
    Section 120 statement and no indication  that  that  was  what  it  was
    designed to be.  It was not in Section 5 of the appeal  form,  contrary
    to what one would expect.

33.   Mr Malik argued that the situation was similar to that in AS  and  NV.
    He referred also to the grounds before  the  Tribunal  at  paragraph  7
    quoting from paragraph 19.43  of  the  seventh  edition  of  Macdonald.
    There it was said there was  no  statutory  time  limit  for  making  a
    Section 120 statement nor were there any statutory provisions as to the
    form in which such a statement was to be made.  The Secretary of  State
    could always make rules about this if he wished.  The appeal should  be
    allowed.

34.   I reserved my determination.

Decision and Reasons

35.   It is important first  of  all  to  set  out  the  relevant  statutory
    provisions:

    "Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002


    82.    Right of appeal: general


    (1)    Where an immigration decision is made in respect of a person  he

    (b)    that the decision is unlawful by virtue of section  19B  of  the
         Race Relations Act 1976 (c74) [or Article 20A of the Race Relations

         authorities);
    ...


    (c)    that the decision is unlawful  under  section  6  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1998 (c42) (public authority  not  to  act  contrary  to
         Human Rights Convention) as being incompatible with the appellant's
         Convention rights;


    85.    Matters to be considered


         (1)      An appeal under section 82(1) against a decision shall  be
         treated by [the  Tribunal]  as  including  an  appeal  against  any
         decision in respect of which the appellant has a  right  of  appeal
         under section 82 (1).


         (2)      If an appellant under section  82(1)   makes  a  statement
         under section 120, [the Tribunal] shall consider any matter  raised
         in the statement which constitutes a ground of  appeal  of  a  kind
         listed in section 84(1) against the decision appealed against.


         (3)      Subsection (2) applies to a statement made  under  section
         120 whether the statement was made before or after the  appeal  was
         commenced.


         (4)      On an appeal under section 82(1), 83(2) or 83A(2)  against
         a decision the Tribunal may  consider  evidence  about  any  matter
         which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision,
         including evidence which concerns a matter arising after  the  date
         of the decision ...


    86.    Determination of appeal


         (1)      This section applies on an appeal under section 82(1),  83
         or 83A.


      (2)  The Tribunal must determine -


         (a)      any matter raised as a ground of appeal (whether or not by
             virtue of section 85(1)), and


         (b)      any matter which section 85 requires it to consider.


         (3)      The Tribunal must allow the appeal in so far as  it]thinks
         that -


         (a)      a decision against which  the  appeal  is  brought  or  is
         treated as being  brought  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
         (including immigration rules), or


         (b)      a discretion exercised in making a decision against  which
         the appeal is brought or is treated as being  brought  should  have
         been exercised differently.


         (4)      For the purposes of  subsection  (3)  a  decision  that  a
         person should be removed from the United Kingdom under a  provision
         shall not be regarded as unlawful if it could  have  been  lawfully
         made by reference to removal under another provision.


         (5)      In so far as subsection (3) does not apply,  the  Tribunal
         shall dismiss the appeal.


         (6)      Refusal to depart from  or  to  authorise  departure  from
             immigration rules is not the exercise of  discretion  for  the
             purposes of subsection (3)(b).


    96.    Earlier right of appeal


         (1)      ...


         (2)      An appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  an  immigration
         decision ("the new decision")  in respect of a person  may  not  be
         brought if  the  Secretary  of  State  or  an  immigration  officer
         certifies-


         (a)      that the person received a notice  under  section  120  by
         virtue of an application other than that to which the new  decision
         relates or by virtue of a decision other than the new decision,


         (b)      That the new decision relates to an application  or  claim
         which relies on a matter that should have been, but ha s not  been,
         raised in a statement made in response to that notice, and


         (c)      that, in then opinion of the Secretary  of  State  or  the
         immigration officer, there  is  no  satisfactory  reason  for  that
         matter not having been raised in a statement made  in  response  to
         that notice.]


    120.   Requirement to state additional grounds for application


         (1)      This section applies to a person if -


            (a)  he has made an  application  to  enter  or  remain  in  the
United Kingdom, or

         (b)      an immigration decision within the meaning of  section  82
         has been taken or may be taken in respect of him.


         (2)      The Secretary of State or an immigration  officer  may  by
         notice in writing require the person to state -


         (a)      his reasons for wishing to enter or remain in  the  United
         Kingdom,


         (b)      any grounds on which he should be permitted  to  enter  or
         remain in the United Kingdom, and


         (c)      any grounds on which he should  not  be  removed  from  or
         required to leave the United Kingdom.


         (3)      A statement under subsection (2) need not  repeat  reasons
         or grounds set out in -


         (a)      the application mentioned in subsection (1)(a), or


         (b)      an application to which the immigration decision mentioned
         in subsection (1)(b) relates."

      It is also appropriate to set out  the  terms  of  paragraph  395C  of
HC395:

         "395C.Before a decision to remove under section 10 is given, regard
         will be had to all the relevant factors known to the  Secretary  of
         State, including:


            (i)   age;
            (ii)       length of residence in the United Kingdom;
            (III)      strength of connections with the United Kingdom;
                 (iv)  personal history, including character,  conduct  and
                  employment record;
                 (v)   domestic circumstances;
                 (vi)  previous criminal  record  and  the  nature  of  any
                  offence of which the person has been convicted;
                 (vii) compassionate circumstances;
                 (viii)     any representations received  on  the  person's
                     behalf.


         In the case of family members, the factors listed in paragraphs 365-
         368 must also be taken into account."




36.   It is also important to consider the case law to  which  I  have  been
    referred.  In EA (Section 85(4) explained) Nigeria [2007] UKAIT  00013,
    the Tribunal concluded that the effect of Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act
    was not to  make  the  Tribunal  a  primary  decision  maker.   It  was
    important to focus on the decision actually made  in  response  to  the
    appellant's application.  The Tribunal  concluded  that  an  in-country
    appellant could not succeed by showing that he met the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of the hearing but could succeed only
    by showing that the application that he made would be successful at the
    date of hearing.

37.   This decision, among others, was considered recently by the  Court  of
    Appeal  in  AS  (Afghanistan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
    Department; NV (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2009] EWCA Civ 1076.  The first appellant had been granted initial and
    then further leave to remain  as  a  student  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Before the expiry of that leave to remain she submitted an  application
    for leave to remain as a  person  intending  to  establish  herself  in
    business under paragraph 206E of HC395.  This application was  refused,
    and the notice of decision included what has come to be referred to  as
    a one stop Notice, i.e. a notice of the kind  referred  to  in  Section
    120(2) of the 2002 Act.   Some  three  weeks  later  she  submitted  an
    application for leave to remain under the International Graduate Scheme
    and on the same day lodged a notice of appeal with the Tribunal against
    the Secretary of State's  earlier  refusal  of  the  application  under
    paragraph 206E.  On her appeal the Immigration Judge concluded that the
    Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider  the  second  application  and
    also dismissed the appeal under  paragraph  206E.   This  decision  was
    upheld on reconsideration.

38.   In the second case the appellant had entered the United  Kingdom  with
    leave to enter on several occasions over a period of time since January
    1997.  Some five days before the expiry of her most  recent  leave  she
    made an application for leave to remain on  the  basis  of  ten  years'
    residence in the United Kingdom.  This application was  refused  and  a
    one stop Notice was served.  She  appealed  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision on the basis that that decision was not in accordance with the
    law and the Immigration Rules and  some  twelve  days  later  served  a
    Statement of Additional Grounds raising the grounds specified above and
    seeking a variation of her leave to remain on the basis that she was  a
    student.  The Immigration Judge who heard her appeal  decided  that  he
    had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal  on  the  student  basis  and  a
    Senior Immigration Judge subsequently found that there was no  material
    error of law in that determination.

39.   These appeals were heard together by  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  the
    principal matter considered was the effect  of  Section  120  one  stop
    Notices.  The contention on behalf  of  the  appellants  was  that  the
    effect of a one stop Notice was that the appeal covered  not  only  any
    ground before the Secretary of State when he made  the  decision  under
    appeal but also any grounds raised in response to a  one  stop  Notice,
    even if they had not been the subject of any decision by the  Secretary
    of State and did not relate to the decision under appeal.  On behalf of
    the Secretary of State it was contended that one stop Notices had a far
    narrower effect on appeals and the only grounds that could  be  put  in
    issue on appeal were grounds placed before the Secretary of State  when
    he made his decision or grounds raised in answer to a one  stop  Notice
    relating to that decision.  It can be seen therefore that the  Tribunal
    had preferred the interpretation of the Secretary of State.

40.   By a majority the Court of Appeal  allowed  the  appellant's  appeals.
    Moore-Bick LJ at paragraph 78  considered  that  the  language  of  the
    sections of the Act to  which  he  had  been  referred,  in  particular
    Sections 85(2), 96(2) and 120, demonstrated that they were intended  to
    form constituent parts of a coherent  procedure  designed  to  avoid  a
    multiplicity of applications and appeals.  He  noted  that  Section  82
    established a general right of appeal against an "immigration decision"
    and provided the context in which the word "decision"  in  Sections  84
    and 85 was to be interpreted.  It  was  clear  in  his  view  that  the
    expression "immigration decision" in Section 84(1) had the same meaning
    as it had in Section 82(1) and that the word "decision"  in  that  sub-
    section  must bear the same meaning.  He went on to say the following:

    "79.   Sections 82 and 84 provide the context for the interpretation of
         Section 85.  Here again, the word  'decision'  in  sub-Section  (1)
         must in my view mean an immigration decision of the kind identified
         in Section 82(1); and the word 'decision' in sub-Section  (2)  must
         have the same  meaning.   Section  85(2)  imposes  a  duty  on  the
         Tribunal to consider any matter raised in a  statement  made  under
         Section 120 insofar as it constitutes  a  ground  of  appeal  of  a
         relevant kind against the decision  under  appeal.   Thus  far,  it
         seems to me, the natural meaning of these provisions is  to  impose
         on the Tribunal a duty to consider matters raised by the  appellant
         insofar as they  provide  grounds  for  challenging  a  substantive
         decision of the kind identified in  Section  82  that  affects  his
         immigration status.  On the face of it they do  not  restrict  that
         duty to considering grounds that relate to  the  reasons  for  that
         decision or to the original grounds of appeal."


41.   He went on to  consider  the  terms  of  Section  120  and  96(2)  and
    considered them, as he  said  at  paragraph  81,  to  point  towards  a
    procedural scheme under which the appellant was required to put forward
    all  his  grounds  for  challenging  the  decision  against   him   for
    determination in one set of proceedings and  the  Tribunal  was  placed
    under a corresponding duty  to  consider  them.   He  referred  to  the
    decision of the Senior Immigration Judge in NV as being based  in  part
    on what that judge understood to be the effect of certain  passages  in
    EA (Nigeria) relating to the effect of Section 85(4) and in the case of
    AS to the conclusions of the Senior Immigration Judge  there  that  the
    Tribunal was not intended to be a primary decision maker as held in  SZ
    (Bangladesh) (applicable immigration rules)  [2007]  UKAIT  00037.   He
    found neither of those reasons to be persuasive.   He  considered  that
    Section 85(4) had little bearing on the present case,  being  concerned
    only with the evidence that the Tribunal might consider when hearing an
    appeal.  Nor did he see force in the argument that the  effect  of  the
    appellant's intentions was to make the Tribunal  the  primary  decision
    maker in relation to any additional grounds.  He also saw no  force  to
    an argument concerning the implications of  his  proposed  findings  on
    Section 3C(4) of the Immigration Act 1971.

42.   Sullivan LJ agreed with Moore-Bick  LJ.   He  said  the  following  at
    paragraph 103:

    "103.  It is clear that the underlying legislative policy is to prevent
         successive applications which, as Arden  LJ  says,  are  likely  to
         prolong the period in which a  person's  status  is  uncertain  and
         undetermined.  In my judgment, that policy is better  served  by  a
         "One-stop" procedure that enables all, rather than merely some,  of
         an appellant's "other grounds" for remaining in the United  Kingdom
         to  be  considered  by  the  AIT  at  one  appeal   hearing.    The
         inconsistency  between  the   narrower   interpretation   and   the
         underlying policy objective - to prevent successive applications  -
         is a powerful reason for preferring  the  wider,  rather  than  the
         narrower, interpretation, since the  latter  encourages  a  "Multi-
         stop" appeal process."


    At paragraph 108 he made the point that "any grounds" in paragraphs (b)
    and (c) of Section 120(2) means what it says:  any  grounds,  not  "any
    human rights or asylum grounds".  He also referred to  SZ  and  EA,  at
    paragraph 114 of his decision, but remarked that the AIT in those cases
    had not considered how Section 85(2) should be interpreted so as to  be
    coherent, and work in harmony with Section 96 and 120, bearing in  mind
    the  statutory  purposes  underlying  those  provisions.   Earlier,  at
    paragraph 113, he had said that he was not persuaded that the reference
    to "the  decision  appealed  against",  in  Section  85(2)  must  be  a
    reference to the decision to refuse to vary leave  to  remain  under  a
    particular Rule rather than a decision  to  refuse  to  vary  leave  to
    remain, being one of the immigration decisions as  defined  by  Section
    82(2).


43.   Arden LJ dissented, for the reasons summed up at paragraph 62  of  the
    judgment.  She disagreed inter alia on the proper interpretation of the
    meaning of the words "against the decision appealed against" at the end
    of Section 85(2) and considered that her  interpretation  achieved  the
    statutory purpose, disagreed with the view that  in  effect  Parliament
    had intended the Secretary of  State  to  have  to  exercise  a  choice
    between relying on Section 3C of the 1971 Act and Section  120  of  the
    2002 Act, considered that it was a coherent scheme that  preserved  the
    Secretary of State's role as primary decision maker in all cases  apart
    from asylum and human rights cases and concluded that  the  purpose  of
    Section 120 was not to give an applicant who had missed the time  limit
    in  Section  3C  a  means  of  rectifying  mistakes  in  his   original
    application.

44.   I should state at the outset that it is in my view right to treat  the
    appellant's witness statement of 19 June 2009 together with the  letter
    from his solicitors of the same date as being a Section 120  statement,
    and it is clear from the file that a Section 120 notice was made in the
    letter from the Secretary of State to the appellant of 27  April  2009.
    As Mr Malik argued in his grounds  for  reconsideration,  there  is  no
    provision for a statutory time limit for the making of  a  Section  120
    statement nor are there any statutory provisions  as  to  the  form  in
    which such a statement  is  to  be  made.   Accordingly  there  are  no
    difficulties in proceeding to treat this appeal on the basis  on  which
    it has been argued.  It is also relevant to mention that I  agree  with
    Mr Blundell that I am not bound by  what  is  said  in  the  directions
    quoted in the Civil Appeals Office letter to the appellant's solicitors
    with regard to the effect on EA of AS and NV for the reasons he gave.

45.   It is clear from AS and NV that the Tribunal  may  expect  to  be  the
    primary decision maker in  an  increased  number  of  cases.   To  that
    extent, what was said by the Tribunal  in  EA  [2007]  UKAIT  00013  at
    paragraph 7 must now be regarded as too broad a statement.  Sullivan LJ
    at paragraph 114 in AS and NV noted the  decision  in  EA  but,  as  he
    remarked, the Tribunal in that case  had  not  considered  how  Section
    85(2) should be interpreted so as to be coherent and  work  in  harmony
    with Sections 96  and  120,  bearing  in  mind  the  statutory  purpose
    underlying those provisions.  Moore-Bick LJ was not  persuaded  by  the
    reasoning of the Senior Immigration Judge in NV which was in part based
    on what the judge understood to be the effect of  certain  passages  in
    EA.  If Mr Malik is right, then what is said in  the  headnote  to  EA,
    from which I have quoted above, would no longer be correct.

46.   It is clear from the majority judgments in AS and NV  that  the  Court
    of Appeal was concerned  to  take  proper  account  of  the  underlying
    legislative policy which was to  prevent  successive  applications  and
    also to avoid the difficulties posed to the appellants who, as Sullivan
    LJ put it at paragraph 99, might  have  good  reason  to  question  the
    coherence of the statutory scheme if, having been told they must  raise
    any additional grounds on pain of not being able to  appeal  against  a
    later application on that ground if they failed  to  mention  it,  were
    then told by the Tribunal that it had no jurisdiction to  consider  the
    additional grounds that they had been ordered by both the Secretary  of
    State and the Tribunal to put forward.  In other words there is a clear
    risk of prejudice to an appellant who fails to put  in  a  Section  120
    notice a matter which later under Section 96 is  ruled  out.   One  can
    readily see how this works in relation to the facts in AS and NV  where
    in each case within the context of a refusal to vary leave to remain  a
    different issue was raised in the Section 120 notice.  The question is,
    however, whether the same concerns apply and the same  approach  should
    be taken in the situation where, as in  this  case,  an  appellant  who
    acknowledges that he cannot succeed in showing the requisite amount  of
    money in his account over the period of time in  respect  of  which  he
    originally applied can, in his response to a One Stop Notice, rely on a
    later period of time and as a consequence succeed in  his  appeal.   It
    might be said in relation to this that a person  who  had  failed,  for
    example,  to show under paragraph  276A  of  HC395  with  reference  to
    paragraph 276B that  he  had  at  least  ten  years'  continual  lawful
    residence in the United Kingdom at the time of application but  by  the
    time when he put in a Section 120 notice had  completed  the  full  ten
    year period might, on Mr Malik's argument expect to succeed.  It  might
    be said that the scheme is geared to getting a person  to  provide  all
    the reasons for appealing against a  particular  decision  rather  than
    permitting  the  submission  of   evidence   relating   to   subsequent
    circumstances which would only be relevant in the case  of  a  decision
    which had not been taken.

47.   The answer to this is far from clear from the judgments in AS  and  NV
    given the different situation  being  considered  there.   Certainly  a
    matter of concern must be the risk  to  an  appellant  of  not  stating
    matters in a Section 120 notice which if they  are  left  unstated  may
    leave him unable to rely on  them  subsequently.    In  principle  that
    would appear to apply equally to the situations of the appellants in AS
    and NV and the appellant in a case such as this.  I note Mr  Blundell's
    argument that Sullivan LJ at paragraph 113 in AS and  NV  had  accepted
    that the reference to "the substance of the decision" in Section  85(4)
    is a reference to "the decision to refuse to vary leave to remain under
    Rule X".   I think, however that on a proper scrutiny of paragraph  113
    Sullivan LJ in fact made it clear that he was not  persuaded  that  the
    reference to "the decision appealed against" was  a  reference  to  the
    decision to refuse to vary leave to remain under Rule X rather than the
    decision to refuse to vary leave to remain, and that such  an  approach
    to Section 85(2) would be consistent  with  the  reference  in  Section
    85(4) to "the substance of the decision".

48.   It is relevant however also to consider what was  said  by  Moore-Bick
    LJ at paragraph 83 in AS and NV.  He said there that Section 85(4)  had
    little bearing on the present  case,  being  concerned  only  with  the
    evidence that the Tribunal might consider when hearing an  appeal.   He
    considered the argument, that an appellant would be unable by reason of
    Section 85(5) to adduce evidence in support of a completely new  ground
    of challenge and that therefore the interpretation of  sub-section  (2)
    favoured by the appellant must be wrong, went far too far.  He went  on
    to say that in a limited class of  cases  the  prohibition  on  hearing
    evidence of matters postdating the decision under appeal would  prevent
    the appellant from effectively pursuing an additional ground, but  that
    was not the case with the instant appeals.  He thought it was  unlikely
    to be so in the majority of cases.

49.   In my view the wording of this section of the judgment  provides  some
    assistance in clarifying the ambit of the decision.   I  consider  that
    the Court of Appeal limited the ambit of its decision to cases where  a
    fresh ground  is  raised  in  respect  of  the  particular  immigration
    decision  made,  rather  than  the  making  at  a  later  date  of   an
    application, based on fresh evidence, arising from the original refusal
    or that, if it was not, its decision has to be interpreted as being  so
    limited.   I  consider  that  the  purpose  of  the  procedural  scheme
    established by Section 120 is to encourage an applicant to provide  all
    the reasons he or she has for appealing against a  particular  decision
    (e.g. to refuse to vary leave to remain), rather  than  permitting  the
    later submission of evidence relating to subsequent circumstances in  a
    case such as this where the rule in question specifies a fixed historic
    time-line.  It must follow from that that in a case such as  this,  the
    Secretary of State would not properly be able to rely on Section 96  to
    rule out a further application made under the points based system,  and
    that any such reliance would be clearly vulnerable to challenge by  way
    of judicial review.  It is relevant in this regard also to bear in mind
    that the guidance is changed regularly in relation to the  points-based
    scheme, and there is no guarantee in  any  given  case  that  the  same
    requirement would apply at a later date as applied at an earlier  date.
    Appellants have had to pay close attention to the relevant  website  in
    order to ascertain what the guidance is  in  respect  of  the  relevant
    period.  In conclusion, therefore, I consider  that  Mr  Malik's  first
    ground is not made out.

50.   The second  ground  is  in  essence  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision was not in accordance with the law because he failed to make a
    decision under Section 10  of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act,  and
    therefore failed to consider paragraph 395C of HC395.

51.   In TE (Eritrea) [2009] EWCA Civ 174 the appellant had  had  an  appeal
    against a claim for asylum refused but was given discretionary leave to
    remain until her 18th birthday.  Shortly  before  the  expiry  of  that
    leave she applied for an extension which was refused two  years  later.
    It was explained in the notice of refusal that there  was  a  right  of
    appeal on grounds including any incompatibility  of  removal  with  the
    appellant's ECHR rights and it was also said that all grounds for being
    allowed to remain or for not being removed were to be advanced  on  the
    appeal except all  those  already  argued.   Her  appeal  against  this
    decision was dismissed and the matter was  appealed  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal on the basis that the Immigration Judge had materially erred  in
    overlooking the Secretary of State's failure to  consider  and  address
    paragraph 395C of HC395.

52.   The Court of Appeal noted what had been  said  by  Laws  LJ  in  JM  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA Civ  1402  where
    the appellant had been refused a variation of the six months' leave  on
    which he had entered the United Kingdom and  appealed  on  refugee  and
    human rights grounds.  Before the Tribunal it was held that  the  human
    rights claim which  he  wished  to  reserve  unless  or  until  removal
    directions were given was not justiciable.  At  paragraph  17  Laws  LJ
    noted that it was the case that once a person's appeal against  refusal
    to vary leave was dismissed they were  required  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom and if they did not do so they would commit a criminal  offence
    under Section 24(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971 and also Section  11
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Such  a  person's
    entitlement to state benefit would also  be  affected  and  if  another
    person employed them they would be guilty of a crime under Section 8 of
    the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.  Laws LJ at paragraph 18 said that
    it seemed to him to be wrong in principle that  the  price  of  getting
    before an independent Tribunal for  a  judicial  decision  on  a  human
    rights claim should be the commission of a criminal offence  and  other
    associated legal prohibitions.  He also made the point at paragraph  23
    that this was a case where a "one stop Notice" had been given.

53.   In TE Sedley LJ, with whom Jacob LJ agreed, was of the view  that  all
    these considerations applied with equal cogency in  the  present  case.
    He considered that the state had or ought to have an  interest  in  not
    multiplying administrative proceedings in appeals especially where  the
    facts  and  issues  overlapped  and  where  segregating  them   created
    uncovenanted difficulties for the individual.  He  made  the  point  at
    paragraph 19 that it  was  not  the  case  necessarily  that  the  Home
    Secretary could never fairly or rationally take variation  and  removal
    in separate stages and that there might be  cases  where  it  was  both
    practical and fair to segregate them.  He considered, however, that the
    present appellant's desire not to find  herself  breaking  the  law  in
    order to resist removal was an entirely reasonable  one  in  which  the
    Home Secretary, for reasons of both practice and public  policy,  ought
    to concur.  He considered that whatever else might determine the choice
    of course by the Home Secretary it could  not  properly  be  random  or
    dictated by simple administrative convenience.  Lloyd LJ did not accept
    that there was an obligation on  the  Home  Secretary  to  undertake  a
    consideration under paragraph 395C in any case in which he was asked to
    do so at the stage of deciding whether or not to  extend  any  existing
    leave to remain.  He considered it would not have been unlawful in  the
    sense of irrational for the Secretary of State to leave  the  paragraph
    395C issue until the stage (if it arrived) at which the  appellant  was
    liable to be removed.  He considered though that if the point had  been
    raised at the  outset  it  would  have  been  a  sensible  decision  to
    undertake that exercise  at  the  earlier  stage.   He  considered,  in
    agreement with Sedley LJ, that, the point having  been  raised  at  the
    reconsideration stage before the Senior Immigration Judge albeit  later
    than it might have been, it would now be appropriate for the  Secretary
    of State to undertake the consideration required by paragraph 395C.

54.   In the instant case, the appellant chose not to  pursue  human  rights
    issues before  the  Immigration  Judge.   The  situation  is  therefore
    different from that  in  JM  where  the  Tribunal  concluded  that  the
    appellant's human rights claim was not justiciable.  If  the  appellant
    fails in his appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and  chooses  not  to
    pursue a human rights claim, any illegality consequent on his choice to
    remain in the United Kingdom should be on his own head.  Though  it  is
    possible to envisage cases where consideration of paragraph 395C issues
    might make a difference, this, in my judgment, is not such a case.   It
    may be right therefore to regard the ambit of TE as  being  limited  to
    cases where the failure on the  part  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    consider  the  paragraph  395C  issues  makes  or  could  make  a  real
    difference.

55.   For the reasons given above, the decision  of  the  Immigration  Judge
    dismissing this appeal is maintained.
