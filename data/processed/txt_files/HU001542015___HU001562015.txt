                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Entry Clearance Officer's appeal against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey promulgated 4.5.16, allowing  on  human
    rights grounds the claimants' linked appeals against  the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer, dated 20.4.15, to refuse  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom as family visitors.  The Judge heard  the  appeal
    on 11.4.16.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  O'Garro  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.6.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 19.7.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out briefly below, I found no material error of law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Pacey to be set aside.

 5. The  grounds  assert  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
    consideration of article 8 ECHR, first by failing to  make  a  reasoned
    finding as to why there was family life between the  claimants  on  the
    one  hand  and  on  the  other  the  sponsors  and  the   seriously-ill
    grandchild, in respect of whom they wished to visit and offer emotional
    support and some respite to the sponsoring parents of that  child,  and
    that  the  refusal  decision   constituted   a   sufficiently   serious
    interference with that family life so as to engage article 8 ECHR.

 6. Second,  it  is  contended  that  the  judge's  Razgar  proportionality
    assessment was inadequate.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge O'Garro considered that at  �18
    of the decision the judge concluded that there is  family  between  the
    claimants and the sponsors, who are all adults, "but he has  not  given
    clear reasons for making that finding."

 8. Further, "Based on his finding that there is  family  life,  the  judge
    appears not to have undertaken a proper assessment as to whether it  is
    proportionate to refuse the (claimant's) application under article 8."

 9. In Adjei (visit visas - article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal held  that  in  an  appeal  against  refusal  to  grant  entry
    clearance as a visitor where only human rights grounds are available is
    whether article 8 is engaged at all. If  it  is  not,  which  will  not
    infrequently be the case, the Tribunal has no  jurisdiction  to  embark
    upon an assessment of the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer under
    the rules and should not do so. If article 8 is  engage,  the  Tribunal
    may need to look at the extent to which the claimant is  said  to  have
    failed to meet the requirements of the rule, because  that  may  inform
    the proportionality balancing exercise that must follow.

10. As the judge pointed out at �16 of the decision,  the  whole  point  of
    family visits is that  the  existence  of  family  ties  will  normally
    furnish the reason for the visit. Whilst  these  grandparent  claimants
    had never met the  unfortunately  ill  young  grandson,  they  are  the
    paternal grandparents and thus parents of the child's father, who  have
    an understandable interest in the welfare of the  family  as  a  whole,
    including their own son, one of the sponsors, and their  grandchild.  I
    accept the point made by Mr Bates that the decision  merely  maintained
    the status quo, but family life includes the  ability  to  develop  and
    maintain family relationships, including by occasional visits, as  well
    as other means of communication.

11. The judge was satisfied that the purpose of the visit was not merely to
    act as respite carers for the three-year-old child and  considered  the
    Kugathas test as to whether there is  a  real  committed  or  effective
    support or relationship between the family  members,  and  that  normal
    emotional ties between adult family members would not, without more, be
    sufficient. The judge took into account that the child was  too  unwell
    to travel to visit his grandparents, there being no  challenge  to  the
    seriousness of his condition. It is established law  that  family  life
    can exist even without continuous or any cohabitation  and  that  there
    can exist ties beyond mere biological  kinship  that  can  attract  the
    protection of article 8 ECHR.

12. Considering the decision as a whole, I find that the judge was entitled
    to find sufficient family life under article 8 ECHR so that the refusal
    of a visit could amount to sufficiently serious interference with  that
    right to respect for family life as to engage the protection of article
    8. In the circumstances, the decision does provide  adequate  reasoning
    for the conclusion of the judge that article 8 family life is engaged.

13. In relation to the ground asserting that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    failed in the proportionality assessment, as the judge pointed out,  at
    this stage the burden is on the Secretary of State or  Entry  Clearance
    Officer to demonstrate that refusal is proportionate. At �19 the  judge
    noted the legitimate aim and public interest in maintaining immigration
    control, against which the rights of the  claimants  and  other  family
    members are to be balanced in the proportionality  assessment.  At  �21
    the judge set out factors that were  relevant  to  the  proportionality
    assessment. These included that the child could not make the  visit  to
    his grandparents; the emotional support that such a visit  might  offer
    to the sponsors and the child; and section 55 and the best interests of
    the child. I take account of Mr Bates submission that the judge did not
    consider in the proportionality assessment that a  further  application
    might be made, taking care to address the reasons for refusal. However,
    unless it is absolutely clear that a further application would succeed,
    there is no material error on that narrow point.

14. Considering the decision as a whole, the judge  has  clearly  addressed
    proportionality and given cogent reasoning for the conclusions reached.
    It was open to the judge to reach the conclusion that on the  facts  of
    this case the decision to refuse entry was disproportionate.  I  cannot
    agree that the decision is perverse or  irrational,  or  one  which  no
    properly directed judge could reach.

15. In the circumstances, I find no material error of law.





Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal of each claimant remains allowed on human  rights
                    grounds.

Consequential Directions

17. Forthwith on receipt of this decision the respondent shall issue  entry
    clearance,  provided  the  respondent  is  satisfied   there   are   no
    circumstances arising after the  date  of  this  decision/the  decision
    under appeal which make it necessary to refuse to do so.





Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions  were  made  on  the  issue.  Given  the
circumstances, I make no anonymity order.





Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal was allowed at the First-tier Tribunal.
