                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of South Korea born on 12th  December  1973.
    He appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 16th March  2014
    which had refused his application for leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom pursuant to paragraph 276B(ii) of the  Immigration  Rules  (ten
    years' continuous lawful residence).  Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Hembrough, sitting at Hatton Cross  on  9th  March  2015,  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal and the Respondent now appeals  with  leave  against
    that first instance decision.  For the reasons which  I  have  set  out
    below (see paragraph 14)  I  have  set  aside  the  decision  at  first
    instance and have remitted the matter back to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for the appeal to be re-heard.  Thus although this appeal comes  before
    me as an appeal by the Respondent I  will  continue  to  refer  to  the
    parties  as  they  were  known  at  first  instance  for  the  sake  of
    convenience.

2.   The Appellant last entered the United Kingdom  on  1st  November  2002.
    His leave was extended until 28th September 2010.   On  22nd  September
    2010, six days before this leave  was  due  to  expire,  the  Appellant
    applied for leave as a Tier 4 dependent partner  but  this  application
    was rejected by the Respondent on 8th October 2010 as  the  application
    form was not signed.  The Appellant resubmitted his application on 27th
    October 2010 but unknown to the Appellant the fees for this application
    had increased in the meantime by ï¿½20.  The  Appellant  did  not  submit
    enough money to cover the  increase  and  his  second  application  was
    rejected for insufficient fees on 15th November 2015.

3.   The Appellant submitted a  third  application  on  29th  November  2010
    which was granted on 20th January 2011, just over  three  months  after
    the first application was rejected.  This last grant  was  valid  until
    26th November 2013.  On 23rd October 2013  the  Appellant  applied  for
    leave under the ten years' continuous  residence  provisions.   At  the
    date of application the Appellant had been in the  United  Kingdom  for
    almost exactly eleven years.  The refusal of this last application  has
    given rise to the present proceedings.   It  was  refused  because  the
    Appellant could not show ten years' continuous lawful residence due  to
    the gap between the rejection of his first application on  8th  October
    2010 and the grant of the third application on 20th January 2011.  That
    gap of just over three months broke the period of continuous residence.



4.   The Appellant's wife, Mrs  Deok  Kyung  Yung  brought  her  own  appeal
    against refusal to grant her leave under the ten year rule.  Her appeal
    was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mailer  on  17th  April
    2014.  She has since been granted indefinite leave to remain  (on  13th
    January 2015).  The Respondent's decision  to  refuse  the  Appellant's
    application for indefinite leave to remain as a partner was not  served
    properly on the Appellant until July 2014  after  which  the  Appellant
    appealed and his case was listed for hearing on 9th March 2015 one year
    after the Respondent's decision was taken. It is  not  clear  from  the
    Appellant's file why the two cases were not joined and heard  together.



The Determination at First Instance

5.   Counsel for the Appellant (who did not appear before me) relied upon  a
    skeleton argument that submitted that the first application (which  was
    not signed) was validly amended in time by the  second  application  by
    operation of Regulations 10(2), 16(1)(b) and 17(1)(b) and  (c)  of  the
    Immigration  (Leave  to  Remain)  (Prescribed  Forms  and   Procedures)
    Regulations 2007 ("the 2007 Regulations").   Judge  Hembrough  set  out
    paragraph 17(1)  of  the  2007  Regulations  at  paragraph  15  of  his
    determination.  Paragraph 17(1) of the  2007  Regulations  provides  as
    follows:

         "17.-(1)      A failure to comply with any of the  requirements  of
                  regulation 16(1) to any extent  will  only  invalidate  an
                  application if:

                  (a)  the applicant  does  not  provide,  when  making  the
                      application, an explanation for the failure which the
                      Secretary of State considers to be satisfactory,

                  (b)  the Secretary of State notifies the applicant, or the
                      person who appears  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to
                      represent the applicant, of  the  failure  within  28
                      days of the date on which the  application  is  made,
                      and

                  (c)  the applicant does not comply with  the  requirements
                      within a reasonable time, and in any event within  28
                      days, of being notified by the Secretary of State  of
                      the failure."

6.   At paragraph 16 to 19 the Judge found that  the  period  of  continuous
    leave had not been broken because, as he put it:

         "16. The Respondent notified the Appellant of his failure  to  sign
             the form on 8th October 2010,  i.e.  within  28  days  of  the
             application  as  required  by  Regulation  17(1)(b)  and   the
             Appellant resubmitted the same  on  27th  October  2010,  i.e.
             within 28 days as required by Regulation 17(1)(c).

         "17.  I  find  that  the  Appellant's  compliance  with  Regulation
             17(1)(c) meant that the application  made  on  22nd  September
             2010 was validated so as to  preserve  the  Appellant's  leave
             under Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

         "18. Although on 15th November 2010  the  Respondent  purported  to
             reject  the  application  resubmitted  on  27th  October  2010
             because of a fee increase in the  interim  I  find  that  this
             purported rejection was unlawful because a  valid  application
             had been submitted on 22nd September 2010 accompanied  by  the
             correct fee at that time.

         "19. As a consequence I find that the Appellant's Section 3C  leave
             was preserved during the  period  8th  October  2010  to  20th
             January 2011 when he was again  granted  leave  as  a  Tier  4
             dependent partner.  I am thus satisfied that  he  has  accrued
             ten years' continuous lawful residence in the UK."

7.   The Appellant's skeleton argument made three other points:

    (i)  the burden was on the Respondent to show that an insufficient  fee
         had been paid with the second application;

    (ii) The second and third applications should be treated as  variations
         of the first (in time) application.

    (iii)    The appeal should in any event be allowed  outside  the  Rules
         under Article 8.  The Judge did not deal with  these  three  points
         presumably because having found in the Appellant's favour under the
         2007 Regulations point the case stopped there.

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Respondent appealed against the decision reiterating  her  argument
    that the Appellant could not satisfy the ten years'  continuous  lawful
    residence requirements because of the break in continuous residence  of
    more than 28 days from 8th October 2010 to 20th January 2011. Paragraph
    5 of the grounds, after noting that the Judge had relied  on  the  2007
    Regulations, stated "those Regulations ceased to have effect as of 29th
    February 2008 when the enabling provision for them, Section 31A of  the
    1971 Act, was repealed by Section 50 of the 2006 Act.  At the same time
    Immigration Rules  34A  to  34F  took  over  governing  the  procedural
    requirements for applications".

9.   Although referred to Rules 34A to 34F were not set out in the  grounds.
     At the time of the first of the Appellant's applications paragraph 34A
    (vi)  provided  that  where  an  application  form  is  specified   the
    application or claim must comply with  certain  requirements  including
    where the application or claim is made by post or courier or  submitted
    in person the form must be signed by the applicant.   This  requirement
    for signature was added to the Immigration Rules  by  HC  321  on  29th
    February 2008.

10.  The version of paragraph 34C introduced by HC 321 in force at the  date
    of  the  application  was  "where  an  application  ...  for  which  an
    application form is specified does not comply with the requirements  in
    paragraph 34A such application or claim will be invalid and will not be
    considered".  That provision was amended on 6th  April  2014  (that  is
    after the date of decision) by HC 1025 which  gave  discretion  to  the
    Respondent.  The changes brought  in  by  the  2008  Immigration  Rules
    (which abolished the 2007 Regulations) did not provide  for  discretion
    to give an applicant further time. Paragraph 34C(b) now  provides  that
    the decision maker may contact the applicant or their representative in
    writing and give the applicant a  single  opportunity  to  correct  any
    omission or error  which  renders  the  application  invalid  save  for
    failure to enrol their biometric information.  The amended  application
    and/or any requested documents must be  received  at  the  Respondent's
    address within ten business days of the date on which the  request  was
    sent. Transitional provisions apply to the April 2015 amendments.

11.  The  application  for  permission  to  appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Foudy on 22nd  May  2015.   In  granting  permission  to
    appeal the Judge wrote that the First-tier had recognised the need  for
    the Appellant to prove that he had at least  ten  years  of  continuous
    residence but it was arguable that the First-tier failed to  address  a
    break in residence of three months between  October  2010  and  January
    2011.  This lack of reasoning amounted to an arguable error of law.

The Hearing Before Me

12.  At the hearing before me Counsel  conceded  the  point  that  the  2007
    Regulations had ceased to have effect in 2008  and  therefore  did  not
    apply when the Appellant made his three applications in  2010/11.   The
    First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in basing its decision on the 2007
    Regulations.  Both parties agreed that in the light of  the  Tribunal's
    error in taking into account the wrong Regulations, the matter had  not
    been properly heard such that it should be sent back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be re-heard.  At that point it could be re-examined whether
    the Appellant could succeed under the Rules or in any event whether  he
    could succeed outside the Rules under Article 8 given that his wife had
    now been granted indefinite leave to remain under the ten year Rule.

13.  Under the present Rules there was  discretion  for  the  Respondent  to
    make further enquiries before finally deciding an application and there
    may therefore be an issue as to whether the Respondent  did  make  such
    enquiries at the time (giving rise potentially to an argument that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law).  The  Presenting  Officer
    agreed that the present wording of the Rules did give discretion to the
    Respondent in certain circumstances.  At the conclusion of  submissions
    I indicated that I found a material error of law such that the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside.  I re-made  the  decision  in
    this case by remitting the appeal back to the First-tier  to  be  heard
    again.

The Error of Law

14   The First-tier Tribunal applied the  wrong  Regulations.   The  correct
    provisions to establish whether the Respondent  had  properly  rejected
    the application form (and thus whether there  was  a  break  in  lawful
    residence) were paragraphs 34A to  34F  introduced  by  the  2008  Rule
    change,  Rules  subsequently  amended  in   April   2015   subject   to
    transitional provisions.  If the  Appellant  could  not  bring  himself
    within the Immigration Rules because the relevant 2008  amendments  did
    not provide for any discretion in rejecting an  incomplete  application
    form it would then fall to be decided whether  the  Appellant's  appeal
    should be allowed outside the Rules. Remitting the  case  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal affords the Respondent  further  time  to  consider
    this case in the round (before the re-hearing) given  the  decision  in
    the wife's case and whether to grant indefinite leave to remain to  the
    Appellant in line with the grant to his wife. That last is not a matter
    for the Tribunal but the Respondent may nevertheless wish  to  consider
    that aspect of the case.

15.  Accordingly having found a material error of law I set the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal aside and remit the matter back to  the  First-
    tier to be reheard when all  matters  may  be  argued  including  those
    matters referred to in the Appellant's skeleton argument which were not
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal because the  appeal  was  allowed
    under the 2007 Regulations.  (See paragraph 7 above).

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I  re-make  the  decision  by  remitting  this
appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.

I make no anonymity direction as there is no public  policy  reason  for  so
doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal I have also  set
aside the fee award.  The First-tier Tribunal will have  to  reconsider  the
issue of a fee award thereafter.
