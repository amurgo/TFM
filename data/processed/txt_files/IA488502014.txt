                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  12
    January 1963 against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Row who,
    following  a  hearing  in  Birmingham  on  6  March  2015  and   in   a
    determination promulgated  on  10  March  2015,  dismissed  his  appeal
    against the decision of the Respondent dated 26 November 2014 to refuse
    to grant to him leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  and  for  his
    removal by way of directions  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The appeal was dismissed  both  under
    the Immigration Rules and on human  rights  (Article  8  of  the  ECHR)
    grounds.

2.   The brief immigration history of the Appellant, is that he was  granted
    entry clearance as a visitor valid from 3 January  2013  to  3  January
    2015.  The Appellant's last point  of  entry  was  28  June  2014.   He
    applied on 19 August 2014 for a variation of his leave to enter and  it
    was that application  which  was  refused  by  the  Respondent  in  her
    decision of 26 November 2014.

3.   The Respondent concluded that the Appellant could not benefit from  the
    criteria set out at EX.1 and that the  Appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Having
    proceeded to consider his claim under Article 8 and as to  whether  the
    Appellant's   particular    circumstances    constituted    exceptional
    circumstances consistent with his right  to  respect  for  private  and
    family life that might warrant consideration of a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules, the Respondent took account of  the  need  to
    safeguard and promote the welfare of children in  accordance  with  her
    duties under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act
    2009.

4.   In that regard it was noted  that  the  Appellant  entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 28 June 2014.  He had a parental relationship with  a  child
    who was a British citizen and it was concluded the Respondent would not
    be denying the child's rights of being an EU or a British  citizen,  as
    it had been deemed as reasonable to expect the child to remain with the
    other  parent  in  this  country.  It  was  thus   considered   to   be
    proportionate  to  the  legitimate   aim   of   maintaining   effective
    immigration control and it was decided that the grant of leave  outside
    the Rules to the Appellant, was thus not appropriate.

5.   In dismissing the appeal, the  Fist-tier  Tribunal  Judge  noted  inter
    alia, that three of the Appellant's children were adults.  The youngest
    was 12 and it was accepted he was fond of his father,  a  feeling  that
    was mutual and that if his father had to leave the  United  Kingdom  he
    would miss him.  The Judge continued:

         "On the other hand, the family life of the Appellant's  family  has
         been by choice conducted for 26 years on the basis that for much of
         the time the Appellant was in Pakistan and his family  was  in  the
         United Kingdom. That would certainly be the position  of  the  last
         five years.  It was a choice which had suited  the  family  at  the
         time".

6.   The Judge noted that in December 2014 the Appellant bought a  fish  and
    chip shop in Watford in his wife's name.  �30,000 was paid towards  the
    cost of the business and there was still a further �25,000 owing.   The
    Appellant's wife ran the business with help of an employee and her  two
    eldest children and worked long hours.  All the children lived at home.
     The two eldest were at university.

7.   The Judge noted that it was contended that  if  the  Appellant  had  to
    return to Pakistan even for a few months whilst he made an  application
    for leave to enter as a spouse (and no doubt  as  a  parent)  it  would
    cause emotional hardship to himself and his  family,  particularly  for
    the 12 year old who was close to him.  It would  also  cause  financial
    hardship to the family, as the Appellant's wife would not  be  able  to
    run the fish and chip shop business on her own,  in  that  without  the
    Appellant's help in the home, the business might in  consequence  fail.
    It would thus be a disproportionate interference with  the  Appellant's
    private and family life.

8.   Insofar as the business was  concerned  and  at  paragraph  19  of  his
    determination the Judge noted:

         "... It was bought in December 2014 and  had  been  run  for  three
         months.  It was bought at a time when the Appellant  and  his  wife
         knew that his immigration status was precarious.  He had arrived on
         a visa and was awaiting the result of this appeal.  They were fully
         aware of the potential risks when they bought the business and must
         have considered how they would manage it if the  Appellant  had  to
         return to Pakistan".

9.   The Judge continued at paragraph 20:

         "In any event I do not find that the difficulties are as  great  as
         they make out, particularly if separation is for a relatively short
         period.  The two eldest children  are  at  home  and  work  in  the
         business.  The third eldest is at home.  All three of them might be
         expected to help out with childcare for the 12 year old."

10.  It would be as well for the sake of completeness to set out  below  the
    Judge's further findings over paragraphs 21 to 28 as follows:

         "21. In assessing the public interest question I am obliged to take
             into account those matters set out  in  Section  117B  of  the
             Immigration  Act  2014.   The  first  of  these  is  that  the
             maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
             interest.  The Appellant has made no attempt  to  comply  with
             the provisions of the Immigration Rules.  He simply sold up in
             Pakistan, arrived in the United Kingdom  and  sought  to  rely
             upon Article 8 of the ECHR.

         22.  There is no reason why he should not  return  to  Pakistan  to
             make an application  for  leave  from  there.   He  retains  a
             business there.  He has family including a mother and brothers
             there.  He has lived most of his life in that country.

         23.  Secondly, it is in the public interest and  in  particular  in
             the interest of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
             that a person who seeks to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  is
             financially independent.  We do not know  what  the  financial
             situation of the Appellant is, but the tax documents submitted
             by his wife do not indicate that he would meet the maintenance
             requirement of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Appellant  has
             submitted a number of documents which indicate that  his  wife
             is in receipt of Council Tax Reduction, Housing Benefit, Child
             Tax Credits, and Working Tax Credits (pages 135 to 142).  None
             of this would suggest that he would not be a financial  burden
             to the United Kingdom.

         24.  We do not know what the Appellant's proficiency in English  is
             although  it  is  noted  that  he  gave  evidence  through  an
             interpreter at the hearing.

         25.  I also take into account that the business  was  bought  at  a
             time when the Appellant's immigration  status  was  precarious
             and the business was purchased in the full knowledge  that  he
             might be required to leave the United Kingdom.

         26.  It is reasonable for the  Secretary  of  State  to  require  a
             proper application to be made in the correct  form,  including
             the correct information, at the  correct  time  and  place  to
             enable a reasoned decision  to  be  made  as  to  whether  the
             Appellant meets the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
             The United Kingdom, subject  to  compliance  with  its  treaty
             obligations, is not obliged to allow the Appellant  to  remain
             upon  its  territory  whilst  the  Appellant   satisfies   the
             Respondent that he meets these requirements.

         27.  These are all factors which in  my  view  weigh  heavily  when
             considering the question of proportionality.

         28.  There are no very significant  obstacles  to  the  Appellant's
             reintegration into Pakistan were he to be required  to  return
             there.  He entered the United Kingdom in June  2014.   He  has
             lived most of  his  life  in  Pakistan.   He  has  family  and
             business connections there and is familiar with  the  language
             and customs of that  country.   Paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of  the
             Immigration Rules does not apply."

11.  The Judge thus concluded that he was satisfied that the  Appellant  did
    not fulfil the requirements of the partner route (or  I  would  observe
    the parent route) of Appendix FM as he did  not  meet  the  eligibility
    requirements having made his application whilst in the  United  Kingdom
    as a visitor.

12.  Further whilst the Judge accepted that there would be  an  interference
    with the Appellant's right to respect for his family and  private  life
    and that Article 8 was engaged, he found that such interference was  in
    accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society both  for
    the economic well-being of the country and for the protection  and  the
    rights and freedoms of others that the interference  was  proportionate
    to the legitimate public ends on the facts of this appeal.

13.  Permission to appeal to the Tribunal was granted on the basis  that  it
    was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  in  law  in  his
    approach to Article 8 proportionality of  the  Appellant's  removal  to
    Pakistan  in  order  to  make  an  appropriate  application  for  entry
    clearance to rejoin his wife and children in the United Kingdom.

14.  The renewed grounds referred inter alia to Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40,
    Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054, R (On the application of Chen)  IJR  [2015]
    UKUT 00189 (IAC) and MA (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 953.

15.  In Chikwamba their Lordships pointed out that the likelihood of  return
    by entry clearance  should  not  ordinarily  be  treated  as  a  factor
    rendering removal proportionate.  In Hayat it was made  plain  that  in
    appeals where the only matter weighing on the Respondent's side  of  an
    Article 8 proportionality balance was the public policy of requiring an
    application to be made under the Immigration  Rules  from  abroad  that
    that legitimate  objective  would  usually  be  outweighed  by  factors
    resting on the Appellant's side of the balance.  In Chen it was pointed
    out inter alia, that in all cases it would be  for  the  individual  to
    place before the  Secretary  of  State  evidence  that  such  temporary
    separation would interfere disproportionately  with  protected  rights.
    It would not be enough to rely solely upon the case  law  concerned  in
    Chikwamba.  Lord Brown was  not  laying  down  a  legal  test  when  it
    suggested in Chikwamba that requiring a Claimant to make an application
    for entry clearance would only "comparatively rarely" be  proportionate
    in a case involving children.

16.  In MA (Pakistan) it was  held  that  following  Chikwamba  it  was  not
    appropriate to ask  whether  there  were  obstacles  to  the  Appellant
    returning to his country of origin to seek entry clearance  but  rather
    whether it was reasonable to expect him to do so.   The  real  question
    was not whether there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the  Appellant
    returning, in that case to Pakistan, in order to  make  an  application
    for entry clearance from there, but  whether  there  was  any  sensible
    reason as to why  he  should  be  required  to  do  so.   Thus  was  it
    reasonable?

17.  That concept was followed in Hayat where within  its  guidance  it  was
    stated that where Article 8 was engaged, it would be a disproportionate
    interference with family and private life  to  enforce  such  a  policy
    unless there was a "sensible" reason for doing so and  whether  it  was
    sensible to enforce that policy would necessarily be fact sensitive.

18.  The grounds  further  contended  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to properly address the issue of whether the decision to  refuse
    to vary the Appellant's leave to remain  was  disproportionate  on  the
    basis of the "no-switching" Rule, it being said that this was the  sole
    reason for refusal under the Rules  with  respect  to  the  Parent  and
    Partner routes, the  Respondent  in  her  decision,  referring  to  the
    mandatory eligibility requirements of the Rules. Here it was  said  the
    Appellant fell outside the Immigration Rules, because of the  mandatory
    ban on switching from visitor to spouse/parent.

19.  In the course of the hearing, I drew to Ms Naik's attention, that  this
    was not an issue raised in the original grounds of  appeal  or  further
    grounds before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and  there  was  nothing
    within the determination to suggest that the issue  was  raised  before
    him by the Appellant's Counsel (who was not Ms Naik).  It was  thus  in
    my view not an appropriate challenge to the findings of  the  Judge  to
    raise an issue that was not placed before him for his consideration.

20.  In that regard, Ms Naik most fairly accepted that  the  Tribunal  would
    not normally in such circumstances have to consider  it,  although  she
    asked me to bear it in mind.  I shall briefly do so at this stage of my
    determination  as  on  its  face  I  consider  this  challenge  to   be
    misconceived.  The Secretary of State has made a Rule  which  has  been
    endorsed by Parliament that says you cannot switch from one category to
    another.  There are on its face, good  reasons  and  indeed  the  entry
    clearance that is provided to visitors are a  relatively  light  touch.
    Such a person's status is as insecure as it could possibly  be  and  is
    predicated on that person returning to his home country at the  end  of
    his visit.  There can be no expectation that such a person is  entitled
    to switch, in circumstances where it is clearly not provided for in the
    Rules,  and  it  is  thus  proportionate  to  construct  a  system   of
    immigration which does not, as a matter of right, permit  a  person  of
    his own volition to change from one category to another.

21.  The simple existence of a no-switching Rule is a  continuation  of  the
    public interest in not allowing people who come as visitors, to further
    develop relationships here, unlike others who are  expected  to  return
    home and make an appropriate application for entry clearance.

22.  In the present case and as I observed in  the  course  of  the  hearing
    before me, no evidence was submitted on behalf of  the  Appellant  that
    these provisions acted  unfairly  or  prevented  a  visitor  making  an
    effective application for entry clearance on another  basis  after  his
    return to his home at  the  conclusion  of  his  visit  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

23.  Ms Naik drew my attention to the  fact  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not refer to any case law at all  within  his  determination,
    notwithstanding that he had a case law bundle  in  front  of  him.  She
    submitted that this was particularly important not least in a case that
    fell outside of the Immigration Rules.  Further there had been no legal
    analysis of proportionality such as by reference to Razgar [2004] 2  AC
    368.  Ms Naik submitted that  it  was  "inevitable"  that  the  Judge's
    failure to demonstrate a consideration of case law guidance against the
    backdrop of the facts as found "would have made a difference" and  that
    the Judge "would have been obliged to  make  more  findings  consistent
    with that guidance".

24.  Mr Tarlow in response  submitted  that  reference  to  case  law  in  a
    determination may have been preferable,  but  it  was  clear  from  the
    determination that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had made comprehensive
    and reasoned findings of fact that were appropriate and  not  perverse.
    This was no better exemplified than by reference to paragraphs 19 to 21
    of the determination (above).  It was in Mr Tarlow's view  clear,  that
    the judge had in mind the bundle of case law on file and  that  it  was
    apparent  that  the  judge's  reasoned  conclusions  encompassed   such
    guidance. For  example,  at  paragraph  21  of  his  determination  the
    "sensible"  reasons  for  the  Appellant's  return  to  make  an  entry
    clearance   abroad,   were   briefly   identified   that   included   a
    proportionality assessment and therefore no material error emerged from
    the Judge's reasoning when reading the determination and  his  findings
    as a whole.

Assessment

25.  When I granted permission I  was  mindful  of  the  contention  in  the
    grounds as to the utility of  requiring  the  Appellant  to  return  to
    Pakistan to seek  entry  clearance  from  abroad  and  whether  it  was
    proportionate for him to do so.

26.  On further reflection I am satisfied that  it  must  be  legitimate  to
    remove a non-national  who  has  not  established  that  he  meets  the
    requirements of entry clearance, when it is reasonable and sensible for
    him to return to his home country to make an application  from  abroad.
    There were as found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  no  obstacles  to
    his return to Pakistan for this purpose.

27.  Whilst life in the United Kingdom for those  remaining  here  would  be
    subject to an inevitable degree of disruption, that  was  proportionate
    and reasonable given the circumstances.

28.  Were the Appellant to fail in  his  out  of  country  application  that
    would be on the basis that there was a public interest requirement that
    he had not met and in such a case it was  impossible  to  say  that  it
    would be unreasonable to refuse him entry clearance.

29.  We cannot speculate as to whether the requirements for entry  clearance
    upon the Appellant's application will  be  found  to  be  met  and  the
    Appellant himself has not advanced his case on the case that they  will
    be met.

30.  Had it  been  established  that  all  of  the  requirements  for  entry
    clearance would be there requiring nothing to be done but to travel  to
    Pakistan and make  an  application  that  was  bound  to  succeed,  the
    Chikwamba principle establishes that such a  fruitless  expenditure  of
    time and money and effort would be disproportionate.

31.  The current  case  however  is  predicated  on  the  uncertainty  about
    whether those requirements are met and that can only  be  satisfied  by
    the Appellant making his appropriate application from abroad  as  found
    by the Judge.  The Judge clearly approached the case on the basis  that
    he could not tell what the decision would be and he could  not  proceed
    on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had  established   the   relevant
    requirements.

32.  Assuming the Appellant does not meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules,
    there  is  nothing  exceptional  about  his  case.   There  is  nothing
    unreasonable in requiring the Appellant  to  make  an  out  of  country
    application when he has a home and family to  return  to  who  will  be
    continuing the status quo, ante which has been enjoyed for many  years.



33.  As found by the Judge, the Appellant's wife had a  business  where  she
    was helped by staff and by a number of her  children  and  it  was  not
    established on the evidence that this business would  collapse  if  the
    Appellant returned to Pakistan.

34.  The relevant child was at the time of the  hearing  12  years  old  and
    inevitably requirements for his care were significantly different  than
    for a child that was of more tender  years.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in the present case clearly and broadly identified those  factors
    within his reasoning.

35.  It is not an error of law  for  a  Judge  to  fail  to  direct  himself
    specifically in terms of applicable jurisprudence provided  it  can  be
    seen from his judgment that he has  applied  the  right  principles  in
    reaching his decision.

36.  Chikwamba was a case where the Appellant's partner was  a  refugee  and
    did not have the option of returning to Zimbabwe but here the Appellant
    in  effect  seeks  that  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    available to every other person should not apply in his  case.   It  is
    not an appropriate use of Article 8 to seek thereby to  circumvent  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

37.  In this particular case, the Judge found that there were no  compelling
    reasons as to why in order to avoid an infringement of  Article  8,  it
    was necessary to allow the Appellant to be excused  from  the  need  to
    meet the clear requirements of the Rules.

38.  On the public interest there was a clear Rule of  which  the  Appellant
    was aware, that he  should  return  to  Pakistan  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance and on the  basis  that  there  are  cogent  public  interest
    arguments to support the contention that the Rules should be applied in
    a predicable and uniform manner.

39.  The other side of the balance is founded  on  a  remarkable  situation,
    that because the Appellant started a business when he knew  his  status
    was precarious, he should not have to meet the requirements of  seeking
    entry clearance.

40.  This is an Appellant who had a history of moving between  Pakistan  and
    the United Kingdom and it is inconceivable that it can be said  now  to
    be disproportionate to expect him to return to Pakistan to do something
    he always knew he would have to do.

41.  It is unarguable that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  required  to
    set out a self direction identifying the jurisprudence.  It was not  an
    error of law for him not to do so.  The only  question  is  whether  in
    reaching his determination he disclosed  that  the  correct  principles
    were applied.  In this case, the Judge particularly had in mind all the
    matters relied upon by the Appellant including the  best  interests  of
    the 12 year child and the fragility of a fledgling business acquired at
    a time when all  around  him  knew  that  his  immigration  status  was
    precarious. Therefore his failure to refer to the case law guidance  is
    I find in the circumstances of this case, immaterial.

42.  It is apparent to me given the findings of the  Judge  in  the  present
    case, that it cannot be said  they  were  irrational  and/or  Wednesday
    unreasonable such as to amount to perversity.  It cannot be  said  they
    were inadequate.

43.  It is apparent  to  me  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  reached
    findings that were supported by and open to him  on  the  evidence  and
    thus sustainable in law.

Decision

44.  The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law and I order that it shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
