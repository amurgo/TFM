                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:       Mr C Yeo (counsel) instructed by Elder Rahimi,
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I make an anonymity order under Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
   Tribunal) Rules 2008, precluding publication of any information regarding
   the proceedings which would be likely to lead members of  the  public  to
   identify the appellant, or his children. I do so  on  the  basis  of  the
   minority of the children and their best interests in remaining anonymous.




2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Davey promulgated on 21st August 2015, which dismissed the
   Appellant's appeal on all grounds.



Background


3. The Appellant was born  on  29  September  1982  and  is  a  national  of
   Zimbabwe.


4. On 20 November 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
   application to revoke a deportation order signed on 30 April 2009.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Davey ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
   decision.


6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 16 September 2015  Judge  Ford  gave
   permission to appeal stating


   "It is arguable that Judge Davey erred in failing to make clear  findings
   of fact and give clear reasons for his decision on relevant issues  under
   paragraphs 390, 390A, 398, 399, and 399A of the Immigration Rules"

The Hearing

7. (a) Mr Yeo, for the appellant, argued that  the  decision  contains  many
material errors of law, and that the Judge had failed to  establish  whether
he looked at the case through the lens  of  revocation  or  deportation.  He
told me that it is impossible to discern what  legal  tests  the  Judge  has
applied, and that the Judge has not looked at  the  relevant  paragraphs  of
the immigration rules. He referred me to paragraphs 390A, 398,  399  &  399A
of the immigration rules and complained that the Judge  had  not  considered
which rule would apply to trigger a deportation decision; and  that  in  any
event the Judge incorrectly looked at the exceptions set out  in  paragraphs
399 and 399A of the rules. In  essence,  Mr  Yeo  told  me  that  the  Judge
completely omitted a fundamental step and applied the wrong test.

 (b) Mr Yeo was critical of the Judge's handling of  the  evidence,  telling
me that at [16] the Judge incorrectly states that there  was  no  up-to-date
evidence from the mother of the appellant's children, yet she  had  provided
a witness statement & was present at the hearing. At [21] the Judge  refuses
to reach a conclusion about whether or not the appellant  is  in  a  durable
relationship with his partner, when he argues that evidence  was  available.
Mr Yeo told  me  that  [16]  and  [21]  indicate  that  the  Judge  had  not
understood the evidence submitted. At  [30]  the  Judge  refers  himself  to
section 117A to 117D of the 2002 Act, but  then  failed  to  carry  out  any
analysis or  reach  any  conclusions.  At  [31],  instead  of  applying  the
"insurmountable obstacle test", the Judge considers whether  or  not  it  is
impossible for the appellant's partner to join him in Zimbabwe. Overall,  Mr
Yeo submitted that the determination was fundamentally  flawed  by  material
errors in law. He asked me to set aside the determination and to  remit  the
case to the First-tier Tribunal because an inadequate fact finding  exercise
had been carried out.

8. Ms Everett, for the respondent, relied on the  rule  24  reply  dated  25
September 2015. She  argued  that  there  are  no  material  errors  of  law
contained within the decision; that the correct test had been  applied,  and
that there was no inadequacy in the Judge's fact finding exercise. She  told
me that the Judge had correctly directed  himself  in  law  before  reaching
conclusions which were open to him to reach. She urged  me  to  dismiss  the
appeal and to uphold the decision.

Analysis

9. The rules provide, at paragraph 397, that a deportation  order  will  not
be made if it would be contrary to the UK's obligations  under  the  Refugee
Convention  or  the  ECHR  or  if  not  contrary  to  those  obligations  in
exceptional circumstances.  Paragraphs 398, 399 and 3999A then set  out  the
requirements to consider when assessing  the  Article  8  position.   In  MF
(Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 the Master of the Rolls indicated that  where
the "new rules" (in force from 9 July 2012) apply (in a  deportation  case),
the "first step that has to be undertaken is to decide  whether  deportation
would be contrary to an individual's article 8 rights on  the  grounds  that
(i) the case falls within para 398 (b) or (c) and (ii) one or  more  of  the
conditions set out in para 399 (a) or (b) or para 399A (a) or  (b)  applies.
If the case falls within para 398 (b) or  (c)  and  one  or  more  of  those
conditions applies, then the new rules implicitly provide  that  deportation
would be contrary to article  8".  Paragraphs  399  and  399A  set  out  the
exceptions to deportation.

10. In Chege (section 117D � Article 8 � approach) [2015] UKUT 165 (IAC)  it
was held that the correct approach, where an appeal on human rights  grounds
has been brought in seeking to resist deportation, is to  consider:  (a)  is
the appellant a foreign criminal as defined by s117D (2) (a),  (b)  or  (c);
(b) if so, does he fall within paragraph 399  or  399A  of  the  Immigration
Rules; (c) if not are there very compelling circumstances  over  and  beyond
those falling within 399 and 399A relied upon.

11. At [10] the Judge finds that the appellant  raises  no  challenge  under
the refugee Convention to the deportation order and, in the  final  sentence
there, appears to dismiss the  appeal  under  the  immigration  rules  (with
specific reference to paragraphs 390 to  399A).  The  Judge  opens  [12]  by
saying "the asylum claim having effectively come to an end, it seemed to  me
it would have failed in any event...."  He  then  proceeds  to  dismiss  the
appeal in terms of articles 2 and 3 ECHR,

12.  The problem created by the Judge's approach is that it  gives,  at  the
very least, an  appearance  of  superficiality.  It  is  not  clear  from  a
straightforward reading of the decision that the Judge weighed the  evidence
in this case against the requirements of the immigration  rules.  A  careful
reading of the decision discloses that the  Judge  did  not  make  evidence-
based findings of fact before considering the  relevant  paragraphs  of  the
immigration rules. I consider that the lack of  findings  of  fact  and  the
absence of an explanation of the  reasoning  behind  the  finding  that  the
appellant cannot fulfil the requirements of paragraphs 390 to  399A  of  the
immigration rules amounts to a material error of law.

13. The Judge moves on to consider article 8 ECHR, but appears  to  conflate
his proportionality exercise with consideration  of  paragraph  399  of  the
immigration rules. The Judge embarks on an  exercise  considering  paragraph
21  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  when  the  respondent's
decision does not involve the consideration of  the  2006  regulations.  The
case file reveals that medical evidence was  produced.  At  [26]  the  Judge
says that he has no up-to-date medical evidence before him. The Judge  makes
reference to section 117A to 117D of the 2002 Act,  but  the  decision  does
not contain adequate discussion of the factors  which  must  be  taken  into
account when assessing proportionality.

14.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
authority or to distinguish it  with  adequate  reasons,  ignoring  material
considerations by taking into account  immaterial  considerations,  reaching
irrational conclusions on facts or giving  legally  inadequate  reasons  for
the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute errors of law.

15. In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641  (IAC),  it  was
held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination  disclosed  clearly  the
reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal  found  oral  evidence
to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document  to  be  worth  no
weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in the determination  and  for
such findings to be supported by reasons. A bare statement  that  a  witness
was not believed or that a document was afforded no weight was  unlikely  to
satisfy the requirement to give reasons.


Conclusion


16    I find that the Judge's decision is  tainted  by  material  errors  of
law. The Judge's decision  cannot  stand  and  must  be  set  aside  in  its
entirety. All matters to be re-determined afresh.

17. Under Part 3 paragraph 7.2(b) of the Upper Tribunal  Practice  Statement
of the 25th of September 2012 the case may be remitted  to  the  First  Tier
Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:



   (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the First-
   tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that party's
   case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or

   (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary
   in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that,
   having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to
   remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

18. In this case I find that the case should  be  remitted  because  of  the
extent to which judicial fact finding is necessary for the decision  in  the
appeal to be re-made. In this case none of  the  findings  of  fact  are  to
stand; the matter requires a complete re-hearing.

19. I consequently remit the matter back to the First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
heard before any First-tier  judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
Davey.




   Signed                                                              Date
