Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Nasim, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in the decision and reasons of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Stott ("the FTTJ") promulgated on 9 November  2015,
    in which he refused the appellant's appeal against the refusal  of  her
    application for entry clearance to settle in the UK as a  spouse  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


 2. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal  but,  given
    my references to the personal circumstances of the  appellant  and  her
    spouse an anonymity order is appropriate.

Background

 3. The appellant is a Pakistani citizen who sought entry clearance to join
    her husband in the UK. This was refused under Appendix FM  because  the
    appellant had not met the financial and English language  requirements.
    The respondent accepted the appellant had submitted an HMRC tax return,
    HMRC receipt  for  National  Insurance  contributions  paid,  financial
    statements for the tax year ending 2014 and personal  bank  statements.
    The respondent had noted that the tax documents showed net profit  from
    self-employment of �19,027 and bank statements showed cash deposits but
    there was "no origin to the cash deposits".  It was stated that no  ELT
    certificate had been provided. On review, the Entry  Clearance  Manager
    (ECM) conceded the appellant fulfilled the requirements with regard  to
    her English language skills. However, he noted that bank statements for
    April and May 2013 were missing and that the combined total of  credits
    to the sponsor's bank statements was �22,976, not  �29,978  as  in  the
    sponsor's financial statements. He also noted there was no evidence  of
    the sponsor having been issued with a Unique Tax Reference (UTR) number
    by HMRC.


 4. The FTTJ found that  the  bank  statements  for  April  and  May  2013,
    produced by the appellant at the hearing, were not admissible. He found
    the appellant had not complied with the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE
    by producing 12 months' bank statements. He also  found  there  was  no
    evidence to  confirm  the  "precise  amount  of  the  Sponsor's  annual
    earnings".  In addition, he found,  there  was  no  HMRC  documentation
    providing evidence of the sponsor's UTR. He dismissed the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.


 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal on various grounds  and  this
    was granted in the following terms:

           "The  First-tier  Judge  would  have  been  entitled  to  reject
           documentary evidence sought to be lodged at the hearing  but  he
           went on to give reasons in paragraph  11  of  his  decision  for
           disallowing the material  with  which  issue  is  taken  in  the
           grounds.  The  grounds  do  appear  to  raise  points  that  are
           arguable although I note in relation to the complaint  that  the
           judge did not consider Article 8 what appears in paragraph 21 of
           the determination [sic].  Although I give  permission  to  argue
           all  the  grounds,  it  may  be  the  Article  8  point  is  not
           susceptible to much development."


 6. Hence the matter comes before me.

Submissions

 7. At the outset of the hearing before me,  Mr  Avery  accepted  that  the
    electronic bank statements for April and  May  2013,  produced  by  the
    appellant at the hearing before the FTTJ, complied with the  provisions
    in Appendix FM-SE. He conceded they complied with Appendix FM-SE.


 8. Mr Nasim, for the appellant, submitted that  the  evidence  before  the
    FTTJ was that these two bank statements had  been  submitted  with  the
    application, having been sent by the sponsor to the appellant for  that
    purpose. Had  that  not  been  the  case,  the  respondent  would  have
    identified it as a reason for  refusal  (albeit  the  ECM  subsequently
    identified it as an issue in his review).  They were in the appropriate
    format and should have been admitted by the FTTJ.

 9. Mr Nasim said the principal issue was  the  level  and  source  of  the
    sponsor's takings. The respondent had been satisfied that  the  credits
    to the sponsor's bank  account  exceeded  the  financial  threshold  of
    �18,600; this was reiterated on review albeit the ECM had come up  with
    a different total.  It was submitted that there was  no  need  for  the
    total income to go through the sponsor's account. He referred me to the
    respondent's guidance, paragraph 9.3.8, which provided that cash  could
    be in hand and that the bank statements should reflect all cash income.
    He cited the guidance at May 2016 that  "self-employed  income  can  be
    cash in hand if the correct tax is paid. In line with  paragraph  3.1.5
    of this guidance, it would generally  be  expected  that  the  person's
    business or personal bank statements would fully reflect all gross (pre-
    tax) cash income. Flexibility may only be applied where  the  decision-
    maker is satisfied that the cash income relied upon is fully  evidenced
    by the  relevant  tax  return(s)  and  the  accounts  information".  He
    referred me to the sponsor's documentary evidence of income, citing his
    net income as �19,027; he also referred me to the sponsor's tax returns
    which include his UTR. He submitted that the FTTJ's finding,  that  the
    appellant had to demonstrate the sponsor had put all  his  income  into
    his bank account, was erroneous; the sponsor need only show that a  sum
    in excess of the threshold of �18,600 had been credited to his account.
    The FTTJ had confused the sponsor's gross income with his  net  income,
    as identified in the financial statements of account.


10. The appellant's fallback position was that the FTTJ had failed to apply
    the guidance in paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE and  Sultana  and  Others
    (rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014] UKUT 00540 (IAC).

11. For the respondent, Mr Avery accepted that the HMRC documents submitted
    by the appellant  with  her  application  included  the  sponsor's  UTR
    number.  He observed that Appendix FM-SE set out the requirements  with
    regard to bank statements and accepted that  the  bank  statements  for
    April and May 2013 were in the appropriate format. He made  no  further
    submissions.

Discussion

12. In view of Mr Avery's concession, I find the FTTJ erred in finding  the
    appellant had not produced her  sponsor's  UTR  (paragraph  17  of  the
    decision).


13. The FTTJ made a further error in failing to identify the two statements
    for April and May 2013 as complying with the provisions of Appendix FM-
    SE (as is now conceded by Mr Avery).  Given this, he should have made a
    finding as  to  whether  the  appellant  had  submitted  the  two  bank
    statements with her application.  He assumed that not to be  the  case,
    apparently adopting the  conclusion  of  the  ECM  and,  by  inference,
    finding that they had not been submitted,  whereas  this  was  not  the
    appellant's case.  If the FTTJ had found, as he should have (given  the
    concession  before  me),  that  these  two  statements  were   in   the
    appropriate format, he might have  made  a  different  decision  as  to
    whether the appellant had demonstrated that the sponsor's income was in
    excess of the required threshold.  As it is, the FTTJ  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to satisfy the provisions of Appendix FM-SE.

14. For these reasons, I find  that  the  decision  of  the  FTTJ  contains
    material errors of law.

15. It was agreed by the representatives that I should proceed  to  make  a
    fresh decision.

16. I am satisfied that the appellant had submitted  with  her  application
    the two bank statements for April and May 2013.  Had the appellant  not
    submitted all the required bank statements, I am in no doubt this would
    have been raised by the respondent at the outset  in  the  reasons  for
    refusal.

17. The ECM's review of the sponsor's earnings is undermined by the failure
    to take into  account,  in  his  calculations,  the  missing  two  bank
    statements. He notes total deposits of �22,976 which is  "substantially
    below  the  figure  of  �29,978  quoted  in  the  sponsor's   financial
    statements". However, this does not  take  into  account  the  deposits
    reflected in the bank statements for April and May 2013.

18. Appendix FM-SE.1(m)  provides  that  cash  income  may  be  taken  into
    account:
        "(m) Cash income on which the correct tax has been paid may be
        counted as income under this Appendix, subject to the relevant
        evidential requirements of this Appendix. "
19. The sponsor receives in cash his income for self-employment as  a  taxi
    driver.  His total takings  for  the  year  ended  5  April  2014  were
    �29,978, with a net income of  �19,027.  The  cash  deposits  into  the
    sponsor's current account are consistent with this level of takings  in
    the year to 5 April 2014.  Thus, even though the respondent  challenged
    the "origin to the  cash  deposits",  these  were  compliant  with  the
    requirements of FM-SE.1(m).


20. I take into account the appellant's bank statements,  his  accountant's
    statement of  his  income  and  expenditure  and  the  HMRC  documents,
    including his UTR, to find that the sponsor's net  income  was  �19,027
    for the year to 4 April 2014. This, being in excess of  �18,600,  means
    that the appellant has demonstrated  that  she  fulfils  the  financial
    requirements in the Immigration Rules. The decision of  the  respondent
    is therefore in breach of those Rules. There being no other  challenges
    to the appellant's ability to meet the financial or other  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, I find  that  she  has  demonstrated  to  the
    required standard that she does so.


Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve material errors  of
    law, as set out above.


22. I set aside the FTTJ's decision.

23. I re-make  the  FTTJ's  decision  by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.
