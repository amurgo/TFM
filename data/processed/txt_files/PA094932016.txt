                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge John Eames), sitting at Newport on 22 December 2016, to
     an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born 1979.
    The appellant had come here on a student visa in 2011:  his  leave  was
    curtailed to 23 September, when he applied for leave  to  remain  as  a
    student. After that  ran  out,  he  made  a  private  and  family  life
    application, received on 21 January 2013, putting himself forward as  a
    homosexual. When this  was  refused,  he  challenged  the  decision  on
    judicial review: permission was granted, but the proceedings ended in a
    consent order on 23 March,  allowing  the  appellant  to  withdraw  his
    claim.

 2. Following that order, the appellant arranged on 4 October 2013 to  make
    an asylum claim, but he missed interview appointments on the 29th,  and
    on 4 January 2014. He was next  heard  of  on  20  October  2015,  when
    immigration officers caught up with him on an enforcement visit. On  20
    November he claimed asylum, on the basis that he feared persecution  in
    Pakistan as a Shi'a, having taken part in the  activities  of  a  group
    called Sipah e-Muhammad [SeM].

 3. The appellant said he had never put himself forward  as  a  homosexual,
    and blamed his solicitors for the false claim made  in  2013,  and  for
    later pursuing  it  on  judicial  review.  He  particularly  blamed  an
    unqualified employee of the solicitors called Dr Mohid Jawad. The judge
    made the following findings of fact at paragraph 70:

     a) Dr Jawad had been the subject  of  a  decision  by  the  Solicitors
        Regulation Authority on 27 March 2015, when they  declared  him  an
        undesirable person for any solicitor  to  employ:  the  ruling  put
        before the judge gave no details of what  misconduct  he  had  been
        detected in. He had been working for  a  firm  called  Wilsons,  in
        Barking.

     b) There was however no evidence to link  the  appellant  specifically
        with Dr Jawad.

     c) In particular, the appellant had proved himself unable to bring  up
        records he said he had on his mobile to show financial transactions
        with Dr Jawad.

     d) The judge accordingly did not accept that  the  appellant  had  not
        made the homosexual application, and the judicial review  claim  on
        that basis himself.

     e) This very gravely undermined the credibility of his  later  account
        of fearing persecution as a Shi'a.

 4. At paragraph 71 the judge made the following further findings:

     a) the appellant had said nothing at all about being a  Shi'a  in  his
        homosexual application.

     b) He had failed to produce  any  photographs  to  support  a  claimed
        attack on his family house in Pakistan, despite the offer  recorded
        at paragraph 42 (o).

     c) He had given inconsistent accounts of his rï¿½le with SeM.

     d) His delay in making his current claim, till after he was caught  by
        immigration officers, further damaged his already poor credibility.

     e) The appellant had not produced  any  documentary  evidence  of  his
        connexion with SeM, though the judge accepted that this  might  not
        have been easy to get.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the appellant, not highly literate in English, could not have made  the
    homosexual  application,  still  more  brought  the   judicial   review
    proceedings, on his own. There  was  also  a  reference  to  background
    evidence on the persecution of Shi'as in Pakistan.

 6. The homosexual application was supported  by  a  6-page  typed  English
    letter [G27-33],  purporting  to  be  signed  in  Urdu  script  by  the
    appellant himself. The particulars of the judicial review claim run  to
    six pages [F14 - 19] in similar form, bearing the appellant's  name  in
    capitals at the foot, but no signature. Both documents,  whether  well-
    founded or not, show the kind of legal expertise familiar to those  who
    have to deal with applications of this kind, and it  is  reasonable  to
    conclude that, whether or not the appellant authorized their production
    and use, he did not create them himself.

 7. The consent order ending the judicial review proceedings purports to be
    signed, in Roman script, by the appellant himself: as the judge pointed
    out, there is nothing to link Wilsons of Barking, as a firm,  with  the
    proceedings, except that one document was sent on their fax machine.

 8. Miss Praisoody suggested that the judge should have given the appellant
    the 'benefit of the doubt" as to whether he  had  made  the  homosexual
    application, and  brought  the  judicial  review  proceedings  himself.
    However, as I pointed out to her, there is a  strong  presumption  that
    proceedings brought in the name of a person of full age and sound  mind
    have been authorized by him. While it is perfectly  arguable  that  the
    judge went too far in finding that the proceedings in question here had
    been brought entirely by the appellant himself, he was  fully  entitled
    on the evidence not to accept that Dr Jawad had had anything to do with
    them.

 9. It might have been possible for a particularly generous judge  to  find
    that the initial application had been the brainchild of someone else on
    the appellant's behalf; but its continuation by way of judicial review,
    going as far as the grant of permission, before  ending  in  a  consent
    order purporting to be signed by the appellant in person, was not,  and
    could not reasonably have been accepted by the judge  as  done  without
    his authority or knowledge.

10. That disposes of the main point on which permission was  granted;  but,
    as Mr Avery pointed out, the  judge  had  disbelieved  the  appellant's
    Shi'a claim on four additional grounds (see 4 (b)  -  (e))  which  were
    completely independent of his findings on  the  homosexual  one.  Those
    findings were not challenged in the grounds  of  appeal,  and,  if  the
    appellant were not  to  be  believed  on  this  claim,  the  background
    evidence was neither here nor there. There was certainly nothing in  it
    capable specifically of supporting his credibility; and, given the many
    millions of Shi'a living in Pakistan (between 5 and 20%  of  the  whole
    population, according to the partial copy of the Home  Office  Guidance
    Note in the appellant's bundle), the judge can hardly  be  faulted  for
    saying at paragraph 77 that there would  need  to  be  "...  particular
    individual circumstances giving rise to a specific fear,  in  order  to
    find that there was insufficient state protection ...".
