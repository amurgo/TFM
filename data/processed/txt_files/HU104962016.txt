                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 19th December 1986 is a citizen of Nigeria.   The
    Appellant, who was not present  was  represented  by  Ms  Taiglo.   The
    Respondent was represented by Mr Walker a Presenting Officer.



Substantive Issues Under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on
    30th  September  2015.   That  application  had  been  refused  by  the
    Respondent on 13th February  2016  and  the  Appellant  thereafter  had
    appealed that decision.  Her appeal was heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Shaw sitting at Taylor  House  on  13th  July  2017.   The  Judge
    allowed the Appellant's appeal under Article 8  outside  of  the  Rules
    having dismissed the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Respondent made application for permission to appeal to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by application  dated  12th  September  2017.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Doyle on 22nd  February
    2018.  It was found that it was arguable that the judge  had  conflated
    private life and family life and had not set out adequate  reasons  for
    his conclusions and found that the Grounds  of  Appeal  generally  were
    arguable.

 4. The matter came before me on 19th April 2018 at Field House  to  decide
    firstly whether or not an error of law had been made by the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  For reasons provided in the  decision  promulgated  on
    10th May 2018 I found that a material error of law had been made by the
    judge in this case  and  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Directions were issued for the matter to be reheard  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  In accordance with those directions  the  matter  came
    before me on 30th August 2018.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 5. I firstly noted the  documentary  evidence  before  me  in  this  case.
    Essentially there was no fresh documentation since the  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The Respondent's bundle consisted of:

       . Immigration history.

       . Those documents listed at folios A to E.

       . Refusal letter.

 6. The Appellant's documents consist of:

       . Those documents listed at folios 1 to 84 on the index sheet to  the
         bundle.

The Proceedings - Evidence

 7. I heard from the witness  Ms  [A].   She  identified  herself  and  her
    address and date of birth.  She confirmed that she was Nigerian and had
    limited leave to remain in the UK.  She adopted her  witness  statement
    of 26th June 2017 as being true and correct.  She further  stated  that
    the Appellant was struggling in Nigeria.  She tried to support her  but
    she had two children in the UK.  Her mother  had  arthritis.   She  had
    three siblings, one in the USA, one in Canada and one  in  Nigeria  and
    she provided some help to those individuals.

 8. In cross-examination she said that the Appellant had no other means  of
    support other than herself.  She said that the Appellant rented a  room
    that she paid for and the Appellant had no other relatives in  Nigeria.



 9. In answer to questions that I raised the witness confirmed that she had
    been in the UK for some fourteen  years  and  was  a  customer  service
    manager earning �1,465 monthly after tax.  She had two children  age  7
    and 6.  Her mother had no benefits.  Her siblings abroad were students.
     She said that she had grown up with the Appellant and they  had  lived
    together in the UK.  The rent on the property in Nigeria  was  �30  per
    annum.  Further, she sent her cousin some �40 to �50 monthly.  She  was
    not working.  She lived in a suburb of Lagos.

10. In closing submissions, the Respondent referred to the test  under  the
    Immigration  Rules  namely  as  to  whether  there  were  or  were  not
    insurmountable  obstacles  for  the  Appellant  reintegrating  back  to
    Nigeria.

11. Finally, on behalf of the Appellant it was said that she had no network
    of support in Nigeria and was financially dependent upon her cousin  in
    the UK where also she had social ties.  It was said that she could work
    in the UK and had no criminal convictions.

12. At the conclusion I reserved my decision to consider the documents  and
    evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

13. In this case the burden of proof lies on the Appellant and the standard
    of proof required for both immigration and human  rights  issues  is  a
    balance of probabilities.

14. The facts in this case are largely not in dispute.

15. The Appellant was born in the UK in London in December 1986.  After her
    birth her parents took her to Nigeria but at some stage it is said  her
    parents passed away.  The Appellant was then brought back to the UK  by
    a relative in June 2003 when the Appellant was 16 years  of  age.   The
    witness statements of the Appellant, her sister,  and  her  cousin  all
    refer to this fact in similar, if not identical terms.   However,  none
    identify this relative either by name or relationship or the  means  or
    motives behind that move in 2003.  There is in my view rather  more  to
    this aspect of the case than anyone has been prepared to admit and does
    leave something of a question mark over the circumstances in Nigeria in
    2003 so far as they relate to the Appellant and possibly  the  question
    of whether or not there are relatives in Nigeria.

16. However, whatever may be the reality of that which occurred in 2003 the
    Appellant was at that stage only 16 years of age.  It has been said  by
    the Appellant that she believed herself to be a British citizen because
    she had been born in the UK and had  returned  in  2003  and  it  would
    appear had had no difficulties in remaining in  the  UK  and  obtaining
    documentation that allowed  her  to  study  and  obtain  a  variety  of
    different jobs.  I accept in the circumstances the Appellant's  claimed
    belief may well be genuine.

17. The reality of her position only came to light in 2015 when she applied
    for a British passport and  discovered  that  she  was  not  a  British
    citizen and therefore not entitled to a passport.   The  Appellant  was
    removed to Nigeria in April 2016 by the Home Office and this appeal has
    been brought out of country by or on the Appellant's behalf.

18. The Appellant and her witnesses and other documentary evidence provided
    has given something of a picture of the Appellant's life in the UK from
    2003 until 2016.  I find no reason not to accept that evidence provided
    and there is nothing unusual or inconsistent in that evidence.

19. Looking firstly at the Appellant's position under the Immigration Rules
    the relevant part is paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), as to whether at the date
    of application it could be said that a removal to her home  country  of
    Nigeria would present very significant obstacles  to  integration  into
    that country.

20. The test  "very  significant  obstacles"  presents  a  reasonably  high
    threshold beyond mere difficulties or being a  less  attractive  option
    than remaining in the UK.  In many ways the strongest point is  in  the
    Appellant's favour is that she had been living in the UK from  the  age
    of 16 and therefore as an adult had not  experienced  living  elsewhere
    other than the UK.  However, I do not  find  she  meets  the  threshold
    required under the Rules.  I do not find the evidence,  or  rather  the
    sparsity of evidence on  this  point  suggests  the  Appellant  has  no
    contact or family in Nigeria nor that there has been  no  link  between
    the Appellant and her relatives in the UK  and  potentially  others  in
    Nigeria over the years.  I find the Appellant  is  young  and  of  good
    health and clearly has the education and employment skills  that  would
    place her as being employable subject  to  her  childcare  commitments.
    There is no language or cultural barrier that she would  encounter  and
    she has the ability to maintain contact with relatives and  friends  in
    the UK via social media and other forms of  communication.   I  do  not
    find therefore that the Appellant comes within the terms of the  Rules.



21. Looking at matters outside of the Rules under Article  8  of  the  ECHR
    there needs to be compelling circumstances to demonstrate  her  removal
    would be disproportionate.  The concept of compelling circumstances has
    in  case  law  been   interpreted   as   being   "unjustifiably   harsh
    circumstances".

22. The evidence that had presented is very sparse.  The Appellant returned
    to Nigeria in April 2016.  She now has a young child born  in  Nigeria.
    The identity of the father is unknown but he plays no part  so  far  as
    the evidence suggests in assisting in looking  after  the  child.   The
    witness statements of the Appellant, her  sister  and  cousin  are  all
    dated June 2017, over a  year  after  the  Appellant  had  returned  to
    Nigeria.  Regrettably none of the statements provided  any  information
    as to the Appellant's circumstances in Nigeria at that date.   Although
    this hearing in August 2018 is two and a half years after the Appellant
    returned to Nigeria again there is no up-to-date evidence in  the  form
    of additional statements or other documentary  evidence  to  assist  in
    understanding the Appellant's life and circumstances  during  that  two
    and a half year period.  A little extra information was provided by the
    cousin through questions at the hearing, together with some photographs
    produced.  It transpired that the cousin paid for the Appellant's  rent
    which was a modest �30 per annum and provided money each month again of
    a reasonably modest level of about �40 or �50 but seemingly  sufficient
    to support the Appellant who it was said did not work.  Given  the  age
    of her young child her lack of employment  is  understandable  but  one
    would presume and perhaps expect that shortly, as her child got  older,
    she would look for employment.  No evidence  was  provided  as  to  any
    friends, relatives or social contacts the Appellant may have  developed
    over those two and a half years in  Nigeria.   It  would  be  difficult
    given normal circumstances in her lifestyle in the UK to assume she had
    no friends or social contacts in Nigeria and I do not infer that to  be
    likely.  The continuance of modest financial support from her  relative
    or relatives in the UK for two and a half years does  not  lead  to  an
    inference that such would be withdrawn prior to the  Appellant  finding
    her own employment.  It is my  view  difficult  to  conclude  from  the
    little evidence provided and the above situation  and  inferences  that
    the Appellant is living in unjustifiably harsh circumstances.

23. Whilst I have much  admiration  for  the  Appellant's  cousin  and  the
    assistance she has provided to the  Appellant  and  her  own  admirable
    character I do not find that an application of the final stage test  of
    Razgar that the removal of the Appellant to Nigeria from the UK  is  or
    was disproportionate.  Whilst I am obliged to consider Section 117B  in
    such cases I do not  find  anything  of  particular  adversity  to  the
    Appellant's situation that can  be  fairly  drawn  from  Section  117B.
    Whilst she clearly has had only precarious or indeed  perhaps  unlawful
    status in the UK from 2003 I accept that given her age on return to the
    UK in that year together with her birth in  the  UK  and  her  lack  of
    difficulty in studying or obtaining employment that she  may  genuinely
    have believed she was a British citizen.   That  does  not  necessarily
    negate findings under Section 117B(4) or (5) but it would in my view be
    somewhat unjust to place much weight on such matters.  To that  extent,
    in my view a fair application of Section 117B is to take a view that it
    presents as essentially a neutral position in this case.
