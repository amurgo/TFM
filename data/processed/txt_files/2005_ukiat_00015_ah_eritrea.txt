Appearances:

For the appellant:           Ms V Nassar, Counsel, instructed by
                       Messrs Dillons & Co, Solicitors
For the respondent:          Ms K  Evans,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of Eritrea, appeals with  permission  against
      the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr  E  H  Woodcraft,  sitting  in
      Bradford, in which he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
      decision of the Entry Clearance Officer, Asmara to refuse to grant the
      appellant leave to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor.

2.    The appellant, born in  October  1944,  wished  to  visit  the  United
      Kingdom for the first time, in order to  attend  the  wedding  of  his
      daughter.  Having  interviewed  the  appellant,  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer refused the application.   The Entry Clearance  Officer  found
      that three of the appellant's four children were living in the  United
      Kingdom and that the remaining child lived not with the appellant  but
      with her mother in Eritrea.   Although the  appellant's  children  had
      been in the United Kingdom since 1988, the appellant had  not  visited
      them before.   The appellant was separated from his wife, who in  fact
      also lived in the United Kingdom, but was not  legally  divorced  from
      her.   The appellant earned "a very minimal  income  of  12,000  Nakfa
      (�500) per annum from a mini bus" that the appellant ran  and  he  had
      "minimal savings and no  other  assets  in  Eritrea".     The  sponsor
      daughter's invitation to the appellant indicated that  her  invitation
      was in respect of four persons and the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
      "not satisfied  from  the  documents  submitted  that  she  does  have
      sufficient funds because of the costs of  maintaining  four  persons".
      Having regard in particular to the appellant's  "modest  circumstances
      and limited ties in Eritrea"  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant was seeking entry to the  United  Kingdom
      for the purpose of a short visit or that  he  intended  to  leave  the
      United Kingdom after the stated period of that visit.

3.     The  appellant  appealed  against  the  Entry   Clearance   Officer's
      decision.   On the appeal form, which the appellant signed  and  which
      is dated 6 October 2003, the appellant was asked to choose one of  two
      options:-

      a     your appeal will be decided only on the basis of the information
           you have provided in this form (and any  other  information  you
           may have attached)

      OR


      b     your appeal will be decided at a hearing.

      Once you have chosen one of these options you cannot later  change  to
      another option".

4.    A square box was included on the form in respect  of  option  "a"  and
      option "b".    The form stated "please tick a box".     The  appellant
      ticked the box in relation to option "a", as opposed  to  ticking  the
      box indicating that he wished the appeal to be decided at a hearing.

5.    Earlier in the same appeal form,  the  appellant  had  been  asked  to
      provide details of the person who would  be  acting  for  him  in  the
      United  Kingdom.    He  was   asked   to   give   details   of   "your
      representatives (if any)" and "the family member  you  are  visiting".
      The appellant left blank the boxes relating to  "your  representative"
      but filled in the name, address and telephone number of  his  daughter
      as "the family member" that he was visiting.

6.    Underneath this, the appeal form asked "if you are  having  a  hearing
      of your appeal, do you want your family member (named above) to attend
      the hearing?"  Again, two boxes were provided,  labelled  respectively
      "yes" and "no" and the appellant was asked to  "please  tick  a  box".
      He ticked the box marked "yes".

7.    Immediately underneath the box on the appeal form for the  appellant's
      signature, name in block letters and date, there is a  section  headed
      "TO BE COMPLETED BY ENTRY CLEARANCE  MANAGER".   There,  in  different
      coloured ink from what had gone before, the reference number 00818 was
      inserted.   In relation to the "type of appeal" that is to say whether
      "Paper" or "Hearing" the Entry Clearance Manager ticked the box marked
      "Paper".  The appeal was recorded as being received on 6/10/03.

8.    Underneath this is a declaration by the Entry Clearance Manager  dated
      21 October 2003 stating that he had "considered the grounds of  appeal
      set  out  in  Part  3  of  this  form  and  the  attached   supporting
      documentation, and uphold the decision to refuse the  applicant  entry
      as a visitor".

9.     Rule  45(1)(a)  and  (b)  of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum   Appeals
      (Procedure) Rules 2003 provides that an Adjudicator  or  the  Tribunal
      may, subject to certain exceptions not  here  relevant,  determine  an
      appeal without a hearing if -

      (a)   all the parties to the appeal consent;

      or

      (b)   the party appealing against a relevant decision is  outside  the
      United Kingdom or it is impracticable to give him notice of a  hearing
      and, in either case, he is unrepresented.

10.   The Adjudicator in the present case proceeded to determine the  appeal
      upon the papers on 17 February 2004.   No hearing of the  appeal  took
      place.   No notice of hearing was sent by  the  Immigration  Appellate
      Authority to the appellant or his daughter.

11.   The Adjudicator considered the  documentation  before  him,  including
      the notice of appeal and the materials that had been attached to it by
      the appellant.  The Adjudicator made the following findings of fact:-

      "8.   The original reason for the request was that  Miss  [H  A],  the
           appellant's daughter, was marrying on 2 August 2003  and  wished
           to invite her father and three other  relatives  to  attend  the
           wedding.   These were two of the  appellant's  sisters  and  the
           appellant's mother.   The appellant had said in  interview  that
           his daughter was an accountant which was how she could afford to
           pay for all four members to travel to the United Kingdom for the
           wedding.   The sponsor Miss [HA] produced a bank statement which
           appears to show salary paid into her account on 23 May  2003  in
           the sum of �1,318.75.   I do not find that the Sponsor  is  able
           to demonstrate that  she  would  be  able  to  afford  all  four
           visitors.  I cannot be satisfied therefore  that  she  would  be
           able to maintain the appellant and the cost of  maintaining  the
           other three visitors would have too great  an  impact  upon  her
           finances.


       9.   The appellant's own income in Eritrea is very small and he would
           not be able to support himself.  Further it does not appear that
           he has sufficient economic ties in Eritrea such  that  he  would
           wish to return to Eritrea at the conclusion of his  visit.   The
           fourth child of the appellant lives with the child's  mother  in
           Eritrea not  with  the  appellant.   I  do  not  find  that  the
           appellant has sufficient family and economic ties such  that  he
           is able to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities  that  he
           would return to Eritrea at the conclusion of the visit".


12.   The Adjudicator concluded at paragraph 10 of  the  determination  that
      "on  the  evidence  as  a  whole...  the  appellant  is  not  able  to
      demonstrate that he would return to Eritrea on the conclusion  of  his
      visit.   In the circumstances it appears to me there would be a breach
      of Immigration Law and Rules by allowing this visit.    The  visit  is
      therefore  refused".     The  Adjudicator's   decision   was   "Appeal
      refused", by which he is taken to have dismissed it.

13.   The grounds  of  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  assert  that  the  sponsor
      daughter was not given the opportunity to go to  the  hearing  of  the
      appeal even though the appellant "indicated that I would  prefer  oral
      hearing and not paper".  The grounds further assert that the appellant
      was unable to instruct a legal representative  to  advise  the  family
      "because no notice was sent to my daughter in the UK".

14.   Before the  Tribunal,  Ms  Nassar  submitted  that,  had  the  sponsor
      daughter been able to appear at a hearing before the  Adjudicator  and
      give evidence, it could well have been the case that the Adjudicator's
      conclusions would have been different.   Ms Nassar  further  submitted
      that the Adjudicator, faced with a  notice  of  appeal  on  which  the
      appellant had ticked the box marked "yes" against the question "if you
      having a hearing of your appeal, do you want your family member...  to
      attend the hearing?" should have arranged for an oral hearing to  take
      place or, at least, should have ensured that the sponsor daughter  was
      contacted in order to ascertain whether the appellant was  asking  for
      an oral hearing.   The fact that this box had been ticked meant, in Ms
      Nassar's submission, that the ticking of box "a"  on  page  3  of  the
      notice, indicating that the appeal was to be decided only on the basis
      of written materials, could not be taken at face value.

15.   The appeal to the Adjudicator in the present case  was  brought  under
      section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   That
      being so, the effect of section 101 of that  Act  is  to  empower  the
      Tribunal to overturn the  Adjudicator's  determination  only  if  that
      determination contains a material error of law.   On the basis of  the
      written materials before the Adjudicator, the Tribunal finds  that  he
      was entitled as a  matter  of  law  to  the  conclusions  set  out  at
      paragraphs 8 to 10 of the determination.

16.   The central issue in the present case is, accordingly, whether in  the
      circumstances the Adjudicator erred in law in proceeding to  determine
      the appeal  without  a  hearing.    Before  the  Tribunal,  there  was
      discussion as to what happens in practice when  an  appeal  notice  is
      submitted to the Entry Clearance  Manager.    There  is,  however,  no
      evidence before the Tribunal on this issue.

17.   The Tribunal  finds  that  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case  the
      Adjudicator cannot be said to have erred in law in  proceeding  as  he
      did.   The only possible basis upon which an error  of  law  could  be
      said to arise is that identified by the Court of Appeal in the case of
      E & R [2004] EWCA Civ 49, that is to say, a  mistake  of  fact  giving
      rise to unfairness.   If the position had been that the appellant  had
      placed a tick against the box indicating that he wished his appeal  to
      be decided at a hearing, as opposed to on the basis of the information
      provided in the form, together with other  attached  information,  and
      the Adjudicator  had  failed  to  notice  this  and  so  proceeded  to
      determine the appeal  without  a  hearing,  that  would  constitute  a
      mistake on the part of the Adjudicator that if left uncorrected  would
      give rise to unfairness.  The error would thus be one of law, with the
      result that the determination would have to be set aside and  a  fresh
      hearing arranged, unless the circumstances were plainly such that  the
      appellant had no prospect of succeeding, whether or  not  the  sponsor
      was able to give evidence.

18.   That is, however, not what happened here.  In order for a  mistake  of
      fact to give a rise to unfairness and become an error of law,  neither
      the appellant nor his advisers must  have  been  responsible  for  the
      mistake. That is one of the ordinary requirements identified in E & R.
        Even if it is accepted in favour of  the  appellant  that  his  real
      intention all along was to have an oral hearing at which his  daughter
      would be able to attend and give evidence on his behalf,  his  ticking
      of the box beside alternative "a" on page 3 of the  notice  of  appeal
      led to the chain of events  which  resulted  in  the  Entry  Clearance
      Manager identifying the appeal as a "paper" one,  to  the  Immigration
      Appellate  Authority  treating  it  as  a  "paper"  case  and  to  the
      Adjudicator proceeding to determine the appeal without a hearing.   In
      short, even if there can be said to be a mistake,  the  appellant  was
      responsible for it.

19.   The appellant has the right to make a fresh application to  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer for leave to enter the United Kingdom  in  order  to
      visit his daughter and other family members.   The documentation which
      the appellant has submitted in connection with  the  Tribunal  hearing
      suggests that various matters have changed since the date of the Entry
      Clearance Officer's decision in the present  appeal.   The  mechanical
      problems which beset to the appellant's mini bus, and  which  resulted
      in a diminution in his income, appear to  have  been  resolved.    The
      post-decision evidence regarding the financial  circumstances  of  the
      appellant's  daughter,  who  is  now  married,  arguably  disclose   a
      healthier financial position.    It is no longer  the  case  that  the
      daughter wishes to invite a total of  four  people  simultaneously  to
      visit the United Kingdom.   We say this because the Tribunal would not
      in any sense wish or expect its decision in the present case adversely
      to affect any fresh application for entry clearance as a visitor which
      may be made by the appellant.

20.   This appeal is dismissed.
