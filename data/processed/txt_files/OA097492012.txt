                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Geoffrey Onoufriou), sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  17
    April, to  a dependent relative  appeal by a citizen of Uganda, born  4
    March 1995. The appellant had applied, well before he  reached  18,  to
    settle here with his mother, the sponsor, and needed to  show  she  had
    sole responsibility for him, following her divorce from his  father  in
    2002,  and  the  ill-health  which  was  said  to  have  overtaken  his
    grandmother, with whom he had been living, in 2010. He  was  refused  a
    visa on 22 February 2012.


 2. The judge found against the appellant on sole responsibility,  for  the
    reasons he gave at paragraph 18:

        a. a letter from a local authority in Uganda, confirming  that  the
           appellant had been living  with  his  grandmother,  was  not  in
           proper form;

        b. medical evidence that she had become unwell was illegible;

        c. the appellant's father had  been  involved,  to  the  extent  of
           getting a birth certificate for him in 2010.

 3. Reason (a) is challenged, on the basis that the judge  failed  to  make
    the necessary allowances for conditions in  Uganda  in  the  degree  of
    formality he required in the letter. I have  some  sympathy  with  this
    point: a handwritten letter, validated by a rubber stamp,  may  be  the
    best evidence available in rural east  Africa.  However,  it  does  not
    cover the decisive issue, so far as  the  appellant's  grandmother  was
    concerned, which was whether by the date of the decision she had become
    unfit to take whatever responsibility was by then required for him.

 4. That point is covered by the medical evidence: the judge does not  list
    or describe what was before him, other  than  by  calling  it  "totally
    illegible". So far as pp 40 - 41 of the appellant's present bundle  are
    concerned, while that view may not be literally correct,  I  have  very
    considerable sympathy with it. The difficulty arises on p 39, which  is
    a computer-generated printed document,  from  the  Mulago  Hospital  in
    Kampala, headed 'Medical Report', and dated 23 September 2010.

 5. The subject is the appellant's grandmother,  by  then  65:  the  report
    gives the results of a medical examination and laboratory analysis. The
    examination is said to  have  given  positive  results,  not  only  for
    diabetes, not uncommon in a person of that age, and what may be  rather
    high  blood-pressure,  equally  usual;  but  also  for   'Guillain-Barr
    syndrome'. Guillain-Barr� syndrome, as it  is  properly  called,  is  a
    serious condition: the Wikipedia article describes it as follows:

       Guillain-Barr� syndrome ... is an acute  polyneuropathy,  a  disorder
       affecting  the  peripheral  nervous  system.   Ascending   paralysis,
       weakness beginning in the feet and hands and  migrating  towards  the
       trunk, is the most typical symptom, and some subtypes cause change in
       sensation or pain as well as dysfunction  of  the  autonomic  nervous
       system. It can cause life-threatening complications, in particular if
       the respiratory muscles are affected or if there is autonomic nervous
       system involvement. The disease is usually triggered by an infection.

       The diagnosis is usually made by nerve conduction  studies  and  with
       studies  of  the  cerebrospinal  fluid.  With  prompt  treatment   by
       intravenous  immunoglobulins   or   plasmapheresis,   together   with
       supportive care, the majority will recover completely. Guillain-Barr�
       syndrome is rare, at 1-2 cases per 100,000 people  annually,  but  is
       the most common cause  of  acute  non-trauma-related  paralysis.  The
       syndrome is named after the French physicians  Georges  Guillain  and
       Jean Alexandre Barr�, who described it in 1916.





 6. The Mulago report certainly is legible, and dates from well before  the
    date of the decision, though because of the way the  judge  dealt  with
    the medical evidence, it is not clear what was before him. In  my  view
    his decision on sole responsibility needs  to  be  re-made  because  of
    this. Both sides sensibly agree that this will be the  only  point  for
    decision; so if the appellant succeeds on it, then the appeal is likely
    to be allowed, and if not, then  dismissed.  The  judge  will  wish  to
    consider the point in the  light  of  TD  (Paragraph  297(i)(e):  "sole
    responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049, and  the  other  authorities
    referred to in that decision.

 7. Mr Melvin quite rightly drew  my  attention  to  the  appellant's  age,
    nearly 17 by the date of the decision,  which  is  the  relevant  time.
    While by then his grandmother would have hardly  needed  to  take  much
    responsibility of a practical kind for him,  he  would  no  doubt  have
    needed the usual oversight and guidance required by  any  teenage  boy,
    and the question will be whether he has shown that she  was  no  longer
    able to provide this by then. The  appellant's  solicitors  should  not
    think that my extract from  the  Wikipedia  article  on  Guillain-Barr�
    syndrome is enough to  show  that:  some  proper  medical  evidence  is
    required to show the  effects  of  the  condition  on  the  appellant's
    grandmother in particular.

 8. So far as the appellant's father  is  concerned,  the  decree  absolute
    dissolving his  marriage  to  the  sponsor  gave  her  custody  of  the
    appellant; but the judge noted that he had got a birth certificate  for
    him in 2010. The judge does  not  seem  to  have  considered  what  the
    purpose  of  that  might  have  been:  the  sponsor's  present  witness
    statement, undated, but clearly made  since  his  decision,  claims  at
    paragraph 8 that the appellant's  father  only  did  this  because  his
    grandmother was already unwell, and  apparently  so  that  the  sponsor
    could bring him to this country. If that is right, then the  fact  that
    the appellant's father got the certificate  does  not  seem  to  me  to
    amount to a resumption of parental responsibility.
