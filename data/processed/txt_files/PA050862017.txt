For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   Whilst it is the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  who  has
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal, I refer to the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First Tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant was born on 24th  November  1998  and  is  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.  He appeals against the decision of the  respondent  taken
    on 12th May 2017 refusing his protection claim.  He appealed to a First-
    tier Tribunal and in a determination of 26th February  2018  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Anthony allowed the appellant's appeal.   The  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department has been granted leave  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

3..  The appellant's claim was that he is of Hazara ethnicity and fears  the
    Taliban, ISIS and other AGEs operating in Afghanistan.  His  claim  was
    on the basis of his imputed political opinion and  his  ethnicity.   He
    says that he is at risk of violence from these groups as well as  being
    at risk of forced recruitment and exploitation.  Additionally, he  also
    fears from the family of a deceased friend  of  his  and  a  re-arrest,
    detention and disproportionate punishment, maybe the death  penalty  on
    his return due to a suspicion on the part  of  his  friend's  relatives
    that he murdered his friend.

4.   The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 3rd September  2015  and
    claimed asylum on 10th September 2015.

5.   The judge found that the appellant had demonstrated that his claim  was
    one which engaged the Refugee Convention on the basis  of  his  imputed
    political opinion and ethnicity.   The  respondent  accepted  that  the
    appellant had previously been detained in custody  for  some  seven  or
    eight days on suspicion of  having  murdered  his  friend.   The  judge
    considered the question of sufficiency  of  protection  and  concluded,
    having looked at the background material,  that  various  state  Afghan
    actors committed serious human  rights  abuses,  government  officials,
    security  forces,  detention  centre  authorities   and   police   have
    reportedly used torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading  treatment  or
    punishment.  Impunity for human rights violations committed by each  of
    these state actors was  reported  to  have  remained  widespread.   The
    prison system suffers from severe overcrowding  with  lengthy  pretrial
    detention remaining a problem.  Law agencies reportedly use torture  in
    order to coerce confessions  from  detainees.   The  judge  noted  that
    Afghan governments perceived  as  being  particularly  weak  with  high
    levels of corruption, a climate of  impunity  and  in  most  areas  the
    police are linked to a functioning justice system and in many areas  of
    the country there  is  no  effective  government  backing  the  police.
    Within the police itself corruption is endemic as is the abuse of power
    and extortion.  The justice system is similarly reported to suffer from
    systematic corruption.

6.   The  judge  found  that  if  the  appellant  were  to  be  returned  to
    Afghanistan, he could not be returned to his home area.   She  believed
    that were he to be returned he would face an unacceptable long pretrial
    detention in a situation of overcrowding in  prisons.   She  noted  the
    background evidence which suggested that judges are  frequently  unable
    to remain in such communities due to insecurity,  that  anti-government
    elements take advantage of this rule of law vacuum to enforce their own
    parallel judicial structures which are  illegal.   Punishment  such  as
    executions are meted out by these structures and are criminal acts  but
    victims of such human rights abuses do not have  access  to  government
    redress  mechanisms.   Having  reviewed  the  background  evidence  she
    believed it reasonably likely that the appellant would not face a  fair
    trial  and  a  weak  formal  justice  system  was  likely  to  lead  to
    ineffective and unreliable adjudication in  relation  to  the  criminal
    matter concerning the appellant.

7.   In relation to the appellant's ethnicity  and  risk  to  him  from  the
    Taliban, ISIS and other AGEs, she concluded that he would be likely  to
    be at risk and considered whether there  was  any  possibility  of  him
    being able to relocate.  She concluded that he could  not  relocate  to
    Kabul because to require him to do so would be unduly harsh.

8.   The respondent's appeal application was  granted  leave  on  the  basis
    that the impact  of  the  appellant's  ethnicity  on  the  question  of
    internal relocation suggests that there  would  be  discrimination  and
    that it would not amount to persecution.  The judge failed to  identify
    the evidence on which she could find that the  appellant's  ability  to
    find  work  or  accommodation  would  materially  be  affected  by  his
    ethnicity and that the judge failed to take into account that grants of
    up to ï¿½1,500 would  be  made  available  to  the  appellant  under  the
    Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme.

9.   Having carefully examined what the judge said and listened  to  helpful
    submissions from Counsel and from the Presenting  Officer  I  concluded
    that there is  in  fact  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    determination.  In the context of sufficiency of protection  the  judge
    considered the risk to the appellant on account  of  his  being  wanted
    suspicion of murder and concluded that he could not return  because  of
    poor prison conditions, widespread human rights abuses by various state
    actors including detention centre authorities, security forces and  the
    police.   The  lengthy  prison  system  delays  overcrowding,   lengthy
    pretrial  detention  remaining  a  problem  and  the  fact   that   law
    enforcement  agencies  reportedly  use  torture  in  order  to   coerce
    confessions from detainees.

10.  Insofar as internal flight is concerned, she looked  at  the  situation
    in Kabul and concluded that because of the  appellant's  age;  lack  of
    family  connections  to  Kabul;  significant  difficulties   he   would
    encounter in securing employment because of prejudice against  Hazaras;
    the financial restraints on him to pay rent for accommodation in Kabul;
    requiring him to  relocate  would  be  unduly  harsh.   He  would  have
    significant difficulties in security, in finding employment to  sustain
    himself and to pay for rented accommodation in Kabul.  The  appellant's
    ethnicity would be a further damaging factor which would cause  him  to
    face discrimination on attempting to  access  employment  and  housing.
    She found that he would have significant difficulties  in  adapting  to
    conditions in Kabul without family support and  would  be  particularly
    vulnerable.  She concluded, as she was entitled  to  do,  that  in  the
    circumstances it would be unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  appellant  to
    relocate to Kabul.

11.  I find that the making of the decision involved the making of no  error
    of law on the part of the judge  and  for  that  reason  I  uphold  the
    judge's decision.
