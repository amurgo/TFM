Appellant   Mr Yekini (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian national. The appellant entered the  United
    Kingdom in January 2008 by air on a student visa that was  valid  until
    January 1, 2010. He applied to extend his stay as a Tier 4 student  and
    this was granted until May 23, 2011. On September 29, 2012  he  applied
    for further leave to remain but this was refused. On November 11,  2013
    he claimed asylum and was served with form IS151A as an overstayer.  He
    was interviewed on March 7, 2015 but  his  claim  was  refused  on  all
    grounds on March 12, 2015.

 2. The appellant appealed on April 2, 2015  against  that  decision  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The matter  was  heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pacey
    (hereinafter referred to as "the Judge") on July  30,  2015  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on August 19, 2015 she refused his application  on
    all grounds.

 4. The appellant applied for permission to appeal  on  September  3,  2015
    submitting the Judge had erred in her  approach  to  private  life.  He
    submitted the Judge should have dealt with the appellant's private life
    claim primarily  under  paragraph  276ADE  and  then,  if  appropriate,
    considered it  under  article  8  ECHR.  The  Judge  did  not  consider
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395 and thereby erred.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Brunnen on September 21, 2015 on the ground argued.

 6. The matter came before me on the above date  and  I  heard  submissions
    from both representatives. At the conclusion  of  those  submissions  I
    reserved my decision.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  pursuant  to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I  extend
    that order.

    SUBMISSIONS

 8. Mr Yekini relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted the  Judge  had
    erred because she had not considered the appeal under paragraph  276ADE
    HC 395. He submitted the appellant's medical condition amounted to very
    significant obstacles and the Judge erred by not considering the  same.
    He further submitted the Judge should have made further enquiries about
    the appellant as the medical report  stated  he  suffered  from  memory
    loss. As he was unrepresented it was incumbent on the Judge  to  ensure
    the appellant's case was presented fairly even if that meant adjourning
    for more evidence. The Judge had no regard to  the  fact  he  would  be
    unable to pay for his medical treatment in Nigeria. The Judge failed to
    properly consider the appellant's family life and the fact he  was  bi-
    sexual.

 9. Mr Richardson accepted the Judge did  not  directly  address  paragraph
    276ADE but submitted that in view of the fact she  had  considered  the
    wider ambit of article 8 then there was no  material  error.  The  test
    under paragraph 276ADE HC was higher than the test under article 8  and
    the fact the Judge found article 8  was  not  engaged  (having  already
    dismissed his asylum claim) meant there would be no material error.  In
    any event there was no evidence to show he was  receiving  any  ongoing
    medical evidence. He had been treated and  the  doctor  referred  to  a
    check up but he was not prescribed any medication. In any  event  there
    were hospitals and doctors in Nigeria. There was no error in law.

10. I reserved my decision.



    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

11. In considering whether there has been an error I have had regard to  my
    record of proceedings, the grounds of appeal, the rule 24 response  and
    submissions.

12. Mr Yekini's grounds of appeal are correct in that  the  Judge  did  not
    deal with paragraph 276ADE HC 395. However, as the Judge  did  consider
    the appellant's appeal under article 8 the Judge's  omission  does  not
    mean there is an error in law.

13. Most private life appeals that come before this Tribunal centre  around
    the fact a judge has considered  paragraph  276ADE  but  then  did  not
    consider the appeal under article 8 ECHR. The argument  being  that  if
    there are matters that did not  meet  the  test  of  "very  significant
    obstacles" in paragraph 276ADE then consideration could  be  made  made
    under the wider test of article 8 ECHR.

14. The Judge was clearly aware of the appellant's  medical  background  as
    she referred to this in her decision. She  noted  the  letter  from  Dr
    Okirie and this was the only real medical  evidence  before  her.  When
    seen by the doctor in 2014 he was in  a  wheelchair  following  a  road
    traffic accident but he was now able to walk  with  the  assistance  of
    crutches. The Judge considered his medical condition in paragraph  [46]
    of her decision and noted that he had received  minimal  treatment  for
    polio which he had been born with. The Judge noted he did not appear to
    be receiving medical treatment here. She noted there was no evidence he
    would  die  without  treatment  or  that  he  could  not  continue  his
    rehabilitation in Nigeria. He had received ï¿½11,000 compensation and the
    Judge concluded that if funds were needed then he  could  use  some  of
    those monies.

15. The Judge considered his personal circumstances and had regard  to  his
    medical circumstances. All these factors were matters  she  would  have
    had regard to when  considering  paragraph  276ADE  and  in  particular
    whether there were very significant obstacles in him  integrating  back
    in Nigeria. Mr Yekini submitted  the  defendant  was  slow  in  thought
    process but in the absence of further medical evidence  the  Judge  had
    little to go on, as do I.

16. The Judge therefore identified  nothing  that  could  be  argued  would
    amount to very significant obstacles to him integrating in Nigeria  and
    therefore based on the evidence presented I am satisfied that there was
    no material error.

17. I am satisfied the Judge would have dismissed  any  276ADE  application
    based on the findings made and  in  those  circumstances  her  omission
    cannot be material.

18. Mr Yekini raised issues of family  life  but  these  were  not  matters
    raised in the permission to appeal. He raised the appellant's sexuality
    but these were not raised in the grounds of appeal and I find no reason
    to consider this argument further.





    DECISION

19. There was no error in law. I uphold Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Pacey's decision and I dismiss the appeal.
