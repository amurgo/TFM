                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr D Bazini, Counsel.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were known before the First-tier  Tribunal  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the Respondent" and Mrs Zubaida  Naz
    as "the Appellant".

 2. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  who  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 17 December 2013 with entry clearance  conferring  leave  to
    enter as a visitor until 14 April 2014. On 28 March 2014 the  Appellant
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom relying on Article  8
    grounds of the ECHR on the  basis  of  family  and  private  life.  The
    Respondent refused the application  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    concluded that there were no exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  a
    grant of leave outside of the Rules.

 3. The Appellant's appeal  first  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Talbot who, in  a  decision  promulgated  on  11  April  2016,
    dismissed it both under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.
    Permission to appeal was sought and subsequently granted. In a decision
    promulgated on 10 November 2016  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bagral
    found that Judge Talbot's decision contained an error on a point of law
    and set it aside before remitting it back to the First-tier Tribunal to
    be re-heard. She preserved the Judge's findings.

 4. The remitted hearing came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  N  M
    Paul who in a decision promulgated on 18 January  2017  allowed  it  on
    human rights grounds.

 5. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted  by  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Frankish on 31 July 2017. His reasons for so
    doing are:

         "1.  In a decision promulgated on 18.1.17 F-tTJ NM Paul,  following
             remittal of a previously refused appeal in which the  findings
             were preserved (notably the family home having  moved  down  a
             generation), allowed an appeal against  refusal  of  leave  to
             remain having overstayed a visit visa.

         2.    The  application  for  permission  to  appeal  asserts:   non
             application of public interest per S117b and AM (Malawi),  the
             appellant having overstayed a visit visa; lack  of  weight  to
             the fact that the nephew  could  perfectly  well  support  the
             appellant back in Pakistan.

         3.   The conclusion, outside of  the  Rules,  was  that  while  the
             appellant spoke no English, was  not  financially  independent
             (�28) and likely to be a burden on the health service (�27), a
             key factor was her quasi  grandmother  role  to  her  nephew's
             children (�16/30). Arguably, this places  insufficient  weight
             on  the  public  interest  factor  under  �2  above.  �1  also
             demonstrates confusion about the appellant's age."

 6. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 7. Mr Bramble relied upon the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal  but
    emphasised that it was ground 2 that dominated his submissions.

 8. The first ground asserts  that  the  Judge  misinterpreted  the  public
    interest as set out in Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002. Whilst the Judge  at  paragraph  27  of  his  decision
    acknowledges the statutory provisions as set out in Section 117B he has
    nonetheless failed to deal with the fact that the Appellant arrived  on
    a visit visa and had a precarious immigration status. I was referred to
    the authority of AM Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC)  and  the  head  note
    therein which states:-

         "Those who at any given date held a precarious  immigration  status
         must have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant of  leave  to
         enter or to remain. A person's immigration status  is  "precarious"
         if their continued presence in the UK will be dependent upon  their
         obtaining a further grant of leave"

 9. The  second  ground  asserts  that  the  Judge  finds  that  there  are
    exceptional and  compelling  circumstances  but  also  finds  that  the
    Appellant's nephew can support her if returned to her country of origin
    by sending her money and paying her medical treatment  and  that  these
    findings, within paragraph 20 of the Judge's decision, are at  conflict
    with one another. The Judge has failed to follow the guidance given  in
    Treebhawon and Others (NIAA 2002 Part  5A  -  compelling  circumstances
    test) [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC) and has given no significant reason why this
    Appellant cannot resettle in Pakistan given her precarious  status.  Mr
    Bramble expanded this ground emphasising that compelling  circumstances
    had to be found. At paragraph 25 of his  decision  the  Judge  accepted
    that there was no medical evidence supporting the contention  that,  in
    some way, the Appellant had become a dependant  upon  a  UK  family  as
    carers. Further that at paragraph 27 of his decision, when  looking  at
    the two sides of the argument, the Judge has  not  taken  into  account
    Section 117B factors. Moreover, the Judge concluded at paragraph 28  of
    his decision that the Appellant was someone who neither  spoke  English
    nor is able to be financially independent.  The  Judge's  findings  are
    potentially irrational and at best speculative.  There  is  no  medical
    issue why this Appellant cannot live alone in the country of origin  or
    engage with her brother who continues to reside there. Mr  Bramble  did
    not accept Mr Bazini's submission that this was an  Appellant  with  no
    "Article 8 family" in Pakistan.

10. At the outset of his submissions Mr Bazini referred me to the authority
    of Dasgupta (error of law - proportionality - correct approach)  [2016]
    UKUT 28 (IAC). The head note to that authority states:-
         "(i)             A tribunal's failure to make clear  findings about
         family life is not per se erroneous in law where its existence  has
         not been contested in the Secretary of State's decision and has not
         been challenged at the appeal hearing and the  tribunal's  decision
         is not otherwise unsustainable in law.
         (ii)           The question of whether there is  family  life  in a
         child/grandchild context requires a finding of something  over  and
         above normal emotional ties and will invariably be  intensely  fact
         sensitive.
        (iii)         In error of law  appeals,  the  Upper  Tribunal should
         apply the principles in Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC 14 .
        (iv)           In  appeals  involving  the   proportionality   of an
        interference with a Convention right, the ultimate question for  the
        Upper Tribunal is whether the  interference  is  proportionate,  per
        Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 2 AC 167."
     I have taken this authority into account when coming to my decision.

11. Having considered the submissions made by Mr Bazini, and whilst I  find
    that  Judge  Paul's  decision  may  well  be  a  generous  one,  it  is
    nonetheless one that was open  to  the  Judge,  and  one  that  he  was
    entitled to come to, on the findings he made.

12. The issue of the Appellant's precarious immigration status has  plainly
    been taken into account by Judge Paul. At paragraph 29 of his  decision
    he states:-

         "29. Furthermore, I have to take into account that the  application
             is made against the background  of  a  precarious  immigration
             status, because of course she is only here on a visit visa.  I
             have taken these factors into account,  and  I  consider  that
             they should be applied in the following way:..."

     I find ground 1 of the Respondent's reasons for appealing is  not  made
out.

13. Likewise ground 2. In essence it amounts  to  a  disagreement,  and  no
    more, with the Judge's reasoning and finding and does  not  identify  a
    material error of law.  The  Judge  took  into  account  the  preserved
    findings  from  the  original  appealed  decision  and  recognised  the
    strength of the relationship that this Appellant had with her  nephew's
    minor children. This was a fact sensitive finding which the  Judge  had
    to place on one side of the balance. Within his decision he had gone on
    to consider the other competing factors  and,  contrary  to  ground  2,
    there is no internal conflict within the Judge's findings at  paragraph
    20 of his decision in relation to potential financial support from  the
    Appellant's nephew and the payment of  medical  treatment.  These  were
    just factors the Judge placed on the balance. Likewise  those  referred
    to in paragraphs 24 to 29 of the decision.

14. Ultimately at paragraph 30 the  Judge  comes  to  a  conclusion  having
    effected  the  required   balancing   exercise   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate for this Appellant to be returned to  Pakistan.  As  I
    say, that was a decision that was open to be made on the  evidence  and
    the individual facts of this case.

Decision

The making of the decision in the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
