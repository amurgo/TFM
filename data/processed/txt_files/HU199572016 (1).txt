                            (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Secretary of State:  Ms Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For MAH:                              Mr Cross, Counsel instructed by
                            Duncan Lewis Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. MAH is a male national of Jamaica born in 1997.   On the 19th July 2017
    the First-tier Tribunal allowed his appeal against a decision to deport
    him. The Secretary of State for the Home Department now has  permission
    to appeal against that decision.


 2. The matter in issue between  the  parties  is  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in  its  approach  to  the  question  of  whether  MAH's
    deportation would have  an  "unduly  harsh"  impact  upon  his  British
    daughter.


    Anonymity


 3. This case turns on the presence in the  UK  of  a  young  child.  I  am
    concerned that the identification of the Appellant could  lead  to  the
    identification of that child. Having had  regard  to  Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 4. MAH faced deportation because the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department considered that he is a 'persistent offender'  and  as  such
    his deportation would be conducive to the public good. Between the 11th
    October 2011 and the 24th December 2014 MAH had amassed  5  convictions
    for 10 offences including robbery, possession  of  cannabis,  attempted
    robbery, violent disorder and handling stolen goods. There was evidence
    that he had been investigated, but not  in  the  end  charged,  with  a
    series of other offences.  These included  a  violent  assault  on  his
    sister, possession of cannabis, allowing himself to  be  carried  in  a
    stolen vehicle, drug dealing and burglaries.  The  Secretary  of  State
    believed that MAH is of bad character and that he associates with known
    criminals.


 5. MAH based his appeal on human rights grounds. In respect of his  family
    life he  placed  particular  emphasis  on  his  relationship  with  his
    partner, Ms B, and their infant daughter, born only two  months  before
    the hearing.

 6. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from 6 witnesses. In addition  to  the
    Appellant himself, the Tribunal heard from his partner  Ms  B,  Ms  B's
    mother Ms M, his mother Mrs H, his sister Ms F and his  brother  Mr  H.
    Having heard that evidence,  and  having  regard  to  the  evidence  of
    criminality adduced by the Secretary of State, the  Tribunal  made  the
    following findings:

         . It had not been shown that MAH was a member of a  gang,  but  it
           was clear that he did associate with criminals and  that  he  is
           immersed in drug culture [ï¿½ 57]


         . He had not been rehabilitated and his  evidence  to  the  effect
           that his daughter's birth has changed him is rejected [60]

         . He is a persistent offender and although he  was  technically  a
           minor when most of the offences took place, he was over  14  and
           can therefore be  assumed  to  have  understood  the  difference
           between right and wrong [69]

         . The evidence given by family members  that  MAH  was  "kind  and
           caring" was rejected as incompatible with  his  criminal  record
           [62-67]


         . MAH is in a relationship with Ms B [58] but they were not living
           together permanently in a committed relationship [59].   He  had
           only moved in with her one month before the hearing and this was
           probably to enhance his chances in his appeal [69]

         . He does have a genuine and subsisted parental relationship  with
           his daughter in that he is named on her  birth  certificate  and
           has latterly been  living  with  her,  but  there  is  no  other
           worthwhile evidence that  makes  any  contribution  towards  her
           wellbeing [68]

 7. Directing itself to apply those findings to the tests in paragraph  399
    of the Rules the Tribunal held that it would be unduly  harsh  for  the
    little girl to go and live in Jamaica with her father, noting  [at  72]
    that she "cannot reasonably be expected" to do so,  particularly  given
    that the most recent offending was not deemed serious enough to warrant
    a penalty, the Appellant having received a  conditional  discharge.  In
    respect of the second limb, whether it would be 'unduly harsh' for  the
    child to remain in the UK without her father, the determination reads:


         "74....As a general rule of thumb, it is safe to say that it is  in
         the best interests of a child to be brought  up  by  both  parents.
         Given the  appellant's  habitual  use  of  cannabis  and  his  poor
         behaviour more generally, [the HOPO] argues that it is not  in  the
         best interests of the child that the appellant is allowed to remain
         in the United Kingdom. If the child remains in the UK  without  her
         father she will remain in the full-time  care  of  her  mother  and
         other family members to  offer  support.  The  appellant  makes  no
         financial contribution to the household and is unlikely to do so at
         least in the  near  future  because  he  has  never  had  any  paid
         employment and there is  no  evidence  to  show  that  he  has  any
         realistic prospect of paid employment in the future. Apart from the
         appellant's presence in the household, it is hard to see any  other
         specific contribution the appellant makes to  the  child's  welfare
         and he has been residing with the child's mother for  only  a  very
         short period of time. It is too soon to say whether that will last.


         75. I strongly suspect as I have indicated that the reason why  the
         appellant moved in with [Ms B] is because having read  the  reasons
         why his human rights application was refused, he  has  contrived  a
         family life  with  his  partner  in  order  to  try  and  help  his
         deportation  appeal.  I  reiterate  the  fact  that  although   the
         appellant said that he decided to change his life  around  the  day
         that his daughter was born  he  was  caught  in  possession  of  an
         illegal substance within days of the birth".


    Having made these apparently damning findings the Tribunal  noted  that
    the Appellant has managed to qualify as a level 2  football  coach  and
    that he is now making some contribution towards his  community,  before
    concluding:

         "When deciding whether it is 'unduly  harsh'  for  the  appellant's
         child to remain in the United Kingdom without her  father  I  again
         take into account the gravity of  the  appellant's  latest  offence
         which was not deemed worthy of any penalty, and the length of  time
         since his last conviction. Though the appellant was  found  in  the
         company of other drug users or suppliers in 2016 he  has  not  been
         convicted since 2014 when he was under the age of 18. The  decision
         on  this  point  is  very  marginal  indeed,  but  weighing   these
         considerations I conclude on balance that it is  unduly  harsh  for
         the appellant to be removed and for the child to remain in  the  UK
         without him".




    The Secretary of State's Appeal


 8. The grounds are unnecessarily long and repetitive but in  essence  they
    boil  down  to  this  central  complaint:  although  the  Tribunal  has
    purported to have applied the guidance in KMO  (section  117  -  unduly
    harsh) [2015] UKUT 543 it cannot realistically be said to have done so,
    given that it has not  identified  any  adverse  consequences  for  the
    child.   Insofar as the Tribunal finds  that  as  a  general  'rule  of
    thumb' that it will be in a child's best interests to  live  with  both
    parents, in this case, given the  findings,  such  a  conclusion  would
    appear to be perverse.




    The Response


 9. For the Appellant Mr Cross pointed out that the  Tribunal  clearly  had
    the public interest  at  the  forefront  of  its  mind  throughout  the
    decision-making process. The determination refers  extensively  to  the
    Appellant's criminality.   Having directed itself to the best interests
    'rule of thumb' he was not satisfied that the offending  behaviour  was
    of sufficient weight to justify deportation, particularly having regard
    to the fact that the Appellant was a youth offender.




    Discussion and Findings


10. I have considerable  sympathy  with  the  position  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in this matter. Having  conducted  a  careful  review  of  the
    Appellant's criminal history, and made  what  appear  to  be  eminently
    sensible findings on  the  evidence,  it  is  now  criticised  for  its
    conclusions on what might be described as a matter  of  weight,  namely
    the weight to be attached to the  family  life  shared  by  father  and
    daughter.   I therefore  set  aside  this  decision  with  considerable
    reluctance, given  that  matters  of  weight  are,  absent  perversity,
    matters for the judge.   I am however satisfied that the  Tribunal  did
    err in its approach to the impact upon the  child,  for  the  following
    reasons.


11. This case involved the application of a specific test in the Rules,  ie
    whether it would be unduly harsh for the baby to  live  here  with  her
    mother. It is not possible to discern, from the passages I have  cited,
    what the actual impact of the Appellant's deportation might  have  been
    on this child.   The test requires appellants to demonstrate  that  the
    impact would be "severe", or "bleak" and that it would be "unduly"  so,
    meaning "excessively" or "inordinately" so. The Tribunal in  this  case
    appears to have considered  the  latter  issue,  but  not  the  former.
    Although paragraph 74 (set out above) does refer to the 'rule of thumb'
    that a child's best interests will be served by having two parents,  it
    is by no means clear  from  the  rest  of  the  paragraph  whether  the
    Tribunal found that matter proven.    If it did, it is hard to see why,
    given the way that the Tribunal expressed itself about the  Appellant's
    contribution thus far. I am therefore satisfied that  the  findings  in
    respect of whether it would be 'unduly harsh' for the child to live  in
    the UK without her father must be set aside.

12. The second limb  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  concerns  the
    findings that it would not be "reasonable" for this British child to go
    and live in Jamaica. Although I think that it is a finding that  no-one
    takes issue with (given the terms of the Secretary of  State's  policy)
    it is of course an application of the wrong  test.  The  test  was,  as
    discussed above, whether it would be unduly harsh.

13. It follows that the decision  must  therefore  be  set  aside  and  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department succeeds in her appeal.

14. A final issue arose before me, although not raised by  the  Respondent:
    Mr Cross pointed out that another element of the  Appellant's  case  is
    the extent to which the deportation might interfere  with  his  private
    life. Submissions were made on whether the exception in paragraph  399A
    of the Rules might apply, and no findings were made.   I am  told  that
    the Appellant has had indefinite leave to remain in the UK since he was
    three years old.

15. Given the extent of the judicial  fact  finding  required  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate that this matter be remitted to the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



    Decisions


16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors
    of law and it is set aside.


17. The decision will be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.


18. There is an order for anonymity.
