For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. At the  end  of  the  hearing  I  announced  that  I  would  allow  the
    appellant's appeal because I am satisfied that the decision and reasons
    statement of First-tier Tribunal Judge Maxwell (promulgated on 18  July
    2014) contains legal error that requires it to be set  aside.   I  also
    announced that I would remake the decision and allow the appeal against
    the immigration decisions of  2  January  2014  refusing  to  vary  the
    appellant's leave and to remove her by way of directions.   Although  I
    gave brief reasons at the end of  the  hearing,  I  indicated  I  would
    prepare a full statement, which was reserved.

 2. The appellant was born on 22 July 1928 and is a citizen of India.   She
    last arrived in the UK on 2  May  2013  as  a  visitor,  holding  entry
    clearance that acted as leave to enter for  six  months.   Before  that
    leave expired, on 25 October  2013,  she  applied  to  vary  her  leave
    outside the immigration rules on the basis of her health  circumstances
    and at the same time made a human  rights  claim.   The  focus  of  her
    application  was  on  the  fact  that  she  had  been  diagnosed   with
    Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia,  meaning  that  it  was  not
    possible for her to care for herself.  As she had been living alone  in
    India and would return to a situation where care could not be provided,
    she sought to remain in the UK where her daughter and son-in-law  could
    provide daily care.  The medical evidence also identified a  number  of
    six  other  conditions  for  which  the  appellant   received   various
    medications.

 3. The appellant acknowledged that she could not succeed under  the  adult
    dependent route  of  the  immigration  rules  as  that  only  permitted
    applications from people outside  the  UK.   The  Home  Office  agreed,
    pointing out that  in  addition  to  the  adult  dependant  route,  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE.  The  Home
    Office considered the application exceptionally and concluded  that  it
    was reasonable to expect  the  appellant  to  obtain  suitable  medical
    treatment in India and there was no evidence that she would  be  unable
    to travel to receive such treatment.  Therefore she could return there.
     The Home Office also disputed that the appellant enjoyed  family  life
    within the meaning of article  8  ECHR  with  her  adult  children  and
    grandchildren present and settled in the UK.

 4. Judge Maxwell examined the evidence and made a number of findings which
    are unchallenged.  At paragraph  17,  he  concluded  that  the  medical
    evidence confirms that the appellant has  dementia,  and  that  "...her
    condition is deteriorating and that she is increasingly unable to  look
    after herself and requires  a  level  of  care  commensurate  with  her
    present condition but this is likely to become greater as her  dementia
    inevitably progresses."  At paragraph 19, he found that this was a case
    there required direct consideration of article 8  ECHR.   At  paragraph
    21, Judge Maxwell concluded that applying Kugathas v SSHD  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31, there is family life between the appellant,  her  sponsor  (her
    daughter) and family.  In the following paragraph, Judge Maxwell  found
    that the consequences of the immigration decisions were  of  sufficient
    gravity to engage article 8(1).  He also accepted that the decision was
    in accordance with the law and there was public  interest  in  removing
    the appellant because of  the  importance  of  maintaining  immigration
    control.  He therefore went  on  to  address  whether  the  immigration
    decisions were proportionate in all the circumstances.

 5. When  considering  whether  the  decisions  were  proportionate,  Judge
    Maxwell did not accept that the appellant could not receive appropriate
    care in India.  At paragraph 30 he stated, "The sponsor and her husband
    have sufficient resources to fund the appellant's care in India without
    the necessity of  the  sponsor  having  to  go  and  live  there."   At
    paragraph 30 he took into consideration the "cost to the  public  purse
    if the appellant were allowed to remain."   Although  he  accepted  the
    sponsor and her husband genuinely intended to look after the appellant,
    he believed that they would have to  resort  to  public  funds  "sooner
    rather  than  later"  because  of  the  nature  and  prognosis  of  the
    appellant's condition.  Judge Maxwell believed  it  to  be  "inevitable
    that the National Health Service will be called upon to cope  with  the
    appellant at some point and that point will be reached soon rather than
    later."

 6. During the hearing I asked if either representative could show  me  the
    evidence from which Judge Maxwell had drawn  these  conclusions.   They
    were unable to do so.  The medical evidence did not indicate  that  the
    appellant would need medical care or residential care.   The  extensive
    reports all concluded she needed  supervisory  care,  which  was  being
    provided by her daughter and son in law and which should continue.   In
    light of the evidence, it was unclear on what basis Judge  Maxwell  had
    reached his conclusions that the appellant would need to resort to  NHS
    treatment.  In addition, it is well known that NHS treatment  does  not
    cover residential or supervisory care, which is the type  of  care  the
    appellant would require.  It is evident from the findings at  paragraph
    29 that Judge Maxwell was satisfied the sponsor was able  to  meet  the
    costs of the  appellant's  care.   Although  he  indicates  there  were
    sufficient resources available to provide care in India, the  level  of
    necessary expenditure is indicated in  paragraph  30  to  be  at  least
    ï¿½27,647 which is likely to go a long way  to  meeting  any  care  costs
    arising in the UK.  In any event, before  me  Mr  Kandola  acknowledged
    that the evidence of the resources available to  the  sponsor  and  her
    husband would be sufficient to provide care in the UK.

 7. It is evident that Judge Maxwell  relied  heavily  on  his  conclusions
    regarding the cost to the public purse when carrying out the  necessary
    balancing act.  Therefore, the fact that he had  no  basis  other  than
    speculation for those conclusions undermines his assessment because  it
    is unsound for lack of reasons.  It is for this reason that I set aside
    his decision because the proportionality assessment needs to be remade.

 8. Before moving to that issue, I add that there  are  other  difficulties
    with the balancing act carried out by Judge Maxwell.  In  paragraph  34
    he concludes that any separation of the sponsor's family unit would  be
    "... as a result of voluntary actions of the sponsor and  her  husband.
    In any event, there is nothing to stop both the sponsor and her husband
    going to India to care for the appellant, the result of which would  be
    their daughter would remain in their care."  This conclusion  does  not
    follow  from  the  other  findings  because  it  does  not  take   into
    consideration what the sponsor and her family would have to give up  in
    order to relocate to India.  To suggest that it was simply a choice the
    family would have to make fails to have proper  regard  to  whether  it
    would be reasonable to expect the family to be divided or  for  British
    citizens to be expected to leave the country of  their  nationality  in
    order to care for a relative who is and could be cared for in  the  UK.
    In addition, this conclusion fails to have regard to the best interests
    of the sponsor's nine year old daughter, assuming merely that she would
    be able to adapt to such a significant  change  of  life.   Again,  the
    findings are undermined by the judge's speculation.

 9. In remaking the decision, given the preserved findings, I only need  to
    assess the proportionality of  the  immigration  decisions.   I  remind
    myself that it is for the Secretary of  State  to  establish  that  the
    level of interference that would arise from the  immigration  decisions
    is proportionate.  The usual civil standard applies.

10. As I have indicated, the evidence is not disputed.   The  sponsor  gave
    further evidence at the hearing to update  that  evidence;  little  had
    changed.  An updated medical report was also submitted.  There  was  no
    challenge to the sponsor's credibility or to any of the evidence.

11. Mr Kandola reminded me that the appellant admitted she could  not  meet
    the requirements of the immigration rules and, because this was a  case
    where s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended) applied, weight had to be given to the  public  interest  that
    lay in maintaining effective immigration control.  Mr Kandola submitted
    that it was reasonable to expect the  appellant  to  be  cared  for  in
    India.  The Dementia India Report was published in 2010 and was not  up
    to date.  Medical care was  certainly  available.   As  to  maintaining
    family life, that could be achieved by regular visits.

12. There was no need for me to hear from Mr Cooray, the  burden  lying  on
    the Secretary of State in relation to the issues I have to decide.   Mr
    Kandola's submissions, which reflect the reasons for  refusal,  do  not
    show that on the facts of this case it is proportionate to  remove  the
    appellant to India.  My reasons  are  essentially  those  that  I  have
    already given above in finding an error of law.   For  clarity,  I  set
    them out below.

13. I reject Mr Kandola's argument that the Dementia India Report is out of
    date and therefore unreliable.  It is the best evidence we  have  about
    the situation in India.  It is limited to the issue of how people  with
    dementia are cared for in India.  It confirms that such care is usually
    provided by families and that there are  no  trained  carers  in  India
    because of this cultural background.  There is nothing to indicate that
    Indian society and culture has  changed  significantly  since  2010.  I
    mention that I accept the sponsor's evidence that the appellant has  no
    living relatives in  India  to  be  truthful.   Given  the  appellant's
    history of having been settled in the UK  between  1994  and  2000  and
    given her age, it is more likely than not that her surviving family are
    her adult children in the UK.

14. The current situation is also described  by  the  sponsor.   She  is  a
    medical professional, being a general practitioner in the UK.  She  has
    investigated for herself what care could be provided in India  and  has
    concluded that apart from a day centre many miles away in  Delhi  there
    is nothing.  The number of places available at the day centre  is  very
    limited and therefore there is no realistic prospect of  the  appellant
    accessing such care, even if she were able to travel to it.

15. The evidence clearly shows that the appellant requires  24  hour  care.
    It has successfully been provided to the appellant by her sponsor since
    she arrived here, that is, for over a year.   There  is  no  reason  to
    think that the sponsor would not continue  with  such  arrangements  or
    that she would be unable to meet the costs of  any  external  care  she
    buys in.  There is no dispute that the sponsor  and  her  husband  have
    more than sufficient funds to ensure there would  be  no  risk  to  the
    economic wellbeing of the UK should the appellant be allowed to remain.

16. It is wholly unrealistic to  expect  the  sponsor  and  her  family  to
    relocate to India.  They are all British citizens.  The  sponsor  works
    as a general practitioner.  Her husband is retired.  Her daughter is at
    school.  The level of disruption that they would incur in order to move
    to India to care for the appellant is unreasonable.  I  add  that  they
    would be left  with  no  reasonable  choice  should  the  appellant  be
    removed.  The appellant is part of the family unit, and should  she  be
    removed the family would be faced with the  choice  of  bearing  severe
    disruption either by relocating as a unit or by  separating.   Although
    human  rights  law  indicates  that  where  there   is   a   reasonable
    alternative, then an immigration decision will be  proportionate,  that
    is not the case here.

17. The evidence  in  this  case  also  indicates  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the appellant  to  travel  to  India  to  make  an
    application as an adult dependent relative.  Her  dementia  would  make
    such a journey extremely difficult.  It is clear  she  could  not  make
    that journey on her own.  Yet I am satisfied that  the  evidence  shows
    that the requirements of the adult dependent relative  route  would  be
    met, bearing in mind the specified evidence requirements of appendix FM-
    SE to the immigration rules, were the appellant in a position  to  make
    that journey and application.

18. For all these reasons, I am satisfied that in this case the appellant's
    personal circumstances outweigh  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration controls.  That means the  immigration  decisions  are  not
    proportionate and violate the UK's obligations.

Decision

The decision and reasons statement of Judge Maxwell contains an error  on  a
point of law and is set aside.

I  remake  the  decision  and  allow  the  appeal  against  the  immigration
decisions on human rights grounds.
