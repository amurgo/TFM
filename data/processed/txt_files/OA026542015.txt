For the Appellant:     Mr V Jagadeshan, of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant a citizen of Pakistan born 17th  February  1971,  appeals
    with permission against the decision of a  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Saffer) who in a decision promulgated on 12th May 2015,  dismissed  his
    appeal against the Respondent's refusal to grant him entry clearance as
    the spouse of Aysa Riaz a British citizen, now settled in the UK.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application  on  30th  December
    2014 on three grounds.

       . Inability to meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

       . Inability to meet the English language test requirements and/or  TB
         certificate not provided.

       . No exceptional circumstances which might warrant a grant  of  entry
         clearance outside the Rules.

Background

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, who is married to Aysa  Riaz  a
    British citizen. They married in 1997. Following  their  marriage  they
    lived in Pakistan because the Appellant, who is  a  retired  Lieutenant
    Colonel in the Pakistan Army, worked there. It is a matter  of  record,
    that he had a distinguished career in the army. The couple  have  three
    children all of whom were born in Pakistan, but all of whom  of  course
    are British citizens.

 4.  Sadly  all  three  children  have  genetic  and  degenerative   visual
    impairment and are registered blind.

 5. Because of the children's medical history, Mrs Riaz returned to the  UK
    in May 2013 with the children following in  August  2013.   The  school
    system in Pakistan could not cope with their special educational  needs
    and they were being victimised, alienated  and  discriminated  against.
    Whilst she was here before the children arrived, the  Appellant  looked
    after them. He was helped by his mother and he took leave from work. He
    then came to the UK on a visitors visa but returned to Pakistan to seek
    other work, having left the army. The  situation  with  the  children's
    health worsened.  Therefore the couple changed their plans and  decided
    that the only option to serving their children's best interests was for
    Mr Bashir to apply for settlement here.

The FtT Hearing

 6. When the Appellant's appeal came before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Judge noted that it was accepted that the Apellant's application  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules and that the  appeal  therefore
    was premised on an Article 8 basis only. The Judge  properly  noted  at
    [6],

         "In summary, I must consider all the family members  human  rights,
         and bear in mind that they are all  affected  by  the  Respondent's
         decision.  When  considering  the  issue  of  proportionality,  the
         children's  best  interest  is  my  primary  but   not   the   only
         consideration. Being British is not a trump card. It  is  generally
         in their best interest to have both parents living with  them.  The
         older they are, the more I should consider  their  wishes  and  the
         less  focussed   on   their   parents   they   become.   Compelling
         circumstances can arise such as  to  mean  that  their  rights  are
         breached even though they do not fulfil the Immigration Rules.  The
         disparity of health care provisions can be relevant in a  very  few
         rare cases. I have to consider  the  economic  well  being  of  the
         country and the ability of Mr Bashir to speak English and not be  a
         drain on public (including health) services. The Respondent  enjoys
         a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be  taken
         to ensure compliance with the Convention with  due  regard  to  the
         needs and resources of the community and of individuals."

 7. He then made  the  following  findings  of  fact,  none  of  which  are
    challenged.

         "I accept that the school system in Pakistan could  not  cope  with
         their Special Educational Needs and  they  were  being  victimised,
         alienated and discriminated against as I have  no  real  reason  to
         doubt Mrs Riaz's evidence.

         I accept that the children have the identified health challenges of
         being significantly visually impaired and that they are  registered
         as being blind. Their needs are  such  that  they  need  full  time
         individual support in school and in transport to and from school. I
         accept that Dr Hussain and Mrs Riaz have both told the truth  about
         Mohammed's daily  difficulties.  The  apparent  discrepancy  is  an
         illusion as they have said what they see  where  different  support
         structures are in place. At home Mrs Riaz is by herself and  has  3
         disabled to child (sic) to look after. At  school  Mohammed  has  1
         dedicated professional all to himself. In those circumstances it is
         not surprising that there is a difference in what he can do.  I  am
         satisfied that the reality is that with professional support (which
         he gets at school) all for himself those daily tasks are within his
         ability, whereas when he is at home and he has to share Mrs  Riaz's
         time and energy and where he  does  not  get  proper  support  (not
         through lack of trying I hasten to add) he struggles. I accept that
         if Mr Bashir was here (and is well which is an issue I will  revert
         to in due course), it would be far easier to help Mohammed as he is
         a second pair of hands, and a male which makes personal care easier
         for Mohammed and Mrs Riaz.  I  accept  the  position  now  is  very
         different to when he was  in  Georgia  for  the  reasons  she  gave
         (namely them being much younger and less demanding and  her  having
         his mother's support) as  I  have  no  real  reason  to  doubt  her
         evidence.

         I accept that the stress of being a single  mother  of  3  disabled
         pubescent and pre-pubescent children will inevitably take its toll.
         The medical evidence of her  stress,  anxiety,  and  panic  attacks
         merely confirms the obvious. The children are now of an age to  see
         and understand that. It is likely to be terrifying for  them  given
         the limited help they can give given their visual  impairment,  and
         stressful on them if they think that they are the  "cause"  of  it.
         That stress is likely to affect the care she can provide on a  long
         term basis. It will inevitably be alleviated  by  Mr  Bashir  being
         here as a second adult in the house assuming he is well."

 8. The Judge then went on to say at [25] and [26],

         "It is in the children's best interest to be with  Mr  Bashir  here
         for all the reasons I have already given.  Assuming  Mr  Bashir  is
         well (and I will come back to this  in  due  course)  he  would  be
         unable to work initially as there is no evidence he has a job to go
         to and would be an  economic  burden  on  the  taxpayer.  He  would
         however (assuming he is well) be able to take the  burden  off  Mrs
         Riaz to enable her to work, and given his skills, would  be  better
         placed than many seeking employment in due course. Those matters in
         my judgement would in due course reduce the burden on the tax payer
         as they would need less external support out of school.

         However, I do not accept that he has  established  that  he  speaks
         English even given the jobs he has had and his education as he  has
         not taken  the  relevant  English  Language  test.  Bluster  is  no
         substitute for evidence that can easily be obtained.  In  addition,
         he can take the tuberculosis test and should take it to  ensure  he
         personally is not a drain on the health service and is going to  be
         well enough to help  care  for  the  children.  He  knew  when  the
         application was refused 5 months  ago  that  these  were  important
         matters."

 9. The Judge  dismissed  the  appeal  concluding  that  it  would  not  be
    disproportionate  to  require  the  Appellant  to  reapply  for   entry
    clearance, once he is able to prove he can speak English, has  obtained
    a T.B. certificate and Mrs Riaz earns sufficient to meet the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules or shows exemption due to receipt
    of disability living allowance. When  reaching  those  conclusions  the
    Judge made a finding that  although  it  was  in  the  children's  best
    interests that Mr Bashir be here in the UK, he would be unable to  work
    initially, as there was no evidence that he had a job to go to.

10. Permission to appeal that decision was granted by UTJ Martin. The grant
    of permission neatly encapsulates the issues before me.

         "The Appellant seeks permission to appeal,  in  time,  against  the
         Decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Saffer)  who,  in  a
         Decision and Reasons promulgated on 12th May  2015,  dismissed  the
         Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal to
         grant entry clearance as a spouse on Article 8 grounds.

         It is arguable that given all of the  Judge's  findings  supporting
         allowing the appeal on  Article  8  grounds,  it  was  perverse  to
         dismiss it because  the  Appellant  had  not  produced  an  English
         language test certificate (which he arguably did not need) and that
         he had not produced a TB certificate."

    Thus the matter comes before me in the Upper Tribunal.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. I had before me the grounds seeking permission, together with a Rule 24
    Response from the Respondent. Mr Jagadeshan appeared on behalf  of  the
    Appellant and Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the Respondent.

12. Mr Jagadeshan sought permission to offer further evidence. He  informed
    me that so far as the English language requirement  is  concerned,  the
    Appellant has now taken the test and passed it. There was also evidence
    of a TB certificate. I fully recognise that  the  English  test  result
    post  dates  the  ECO's  decision.  However  it  has  always  been  the
    appellant's case that he is proficient in the English  language  having
    attained both a BA and Masters Degree which were taught in English  and
    therefore fulfilled the Rules in any event. I am satisfied that on this
    basis I can admit the post decision evidence simply as evidence tending
    to show a proficiency in  the  English  language  at  any  event.  This
    effectively renders academic much of that issue which was of concern to
    the ECO.

Consideration

13. I am satisfied that the Judge has erred in his decision, because of two
    material factors which he appears to have overlooked.

14. The first is at [25], where after carefully setting out his findings in
    [15] to [22], he says this,

         "It is in the children's best interest to be with  Mr  Bashir  here
         for all the reasons I have already given.  Assuming  Mr  Bashir  is
         well (and I will come back to this  in  due  course)  he  would  be
         unable to work initially as there is no evidence he has a job to go
         to and would be an economic burden on the tax payer."

    That is an incorrect factual finding. There was clear  evidence  before
    the Judge that the Appellant had an offer of  employment  available  to
    him on entry. This evidence the Judge appears to have overlooked.

15. The second material point concerned the English language requirement as
    noted by me in [12] above. There was evidence before the Judge that the
    Appellant was educated in several institutions where  English  was  the
    spoken language. The Judge  did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant  had
    established that he speaks English (even accepting the jobs he has had)
    and went on to conclude at [26],

         "However, I do not accept that he has established  that  he  speaks
         English even given the jobs he has had and his education as he  has
         not taken  the  relevant  English  language  test.  Bluster  is  no
         substitute for evidence that can easily be obtained..."

    I am satisfied  that  this  shows  the  Judge  has  given  insufficient
    reasoning for his finding that he did not accept  the  Appellant  spoke
    English. This finding does not lie easily with the  Judge's  acceptance
    that the Appellant   had been educated as claimed and  had  followed  a
    distinguished career in the army.  It was incumbent upon the  Judge  to
    evaluate the evidence before him and to give reasons explaining why, in
    the face of all  that  evidence,  he  concluded  as  he  did  that  the
    Appellant could not speak English. A Judge of course, is fully entitled
    not to accept evidence put forward, but must give his  reasons  for  so
    doing. As I have noted above in any event, this issue has been  largely
    rendered academic.

16. Nevertheless I find for the foregoing reasons, that there are  material
    errors in the factual matrix of this decision. Those  errors  are  ones
    which are capable of tipping the balance against the weight to be given
    to the public interest in any proportionality test.  I  therefore  find
    that the errors are such that the decision of the FtT must be set aside
    and remade.

Remaking the Decision

17. Both representatives agreed,  there being no further evidence to  call,
    other than  that  the  Appellant  now  has  an  English  language  test
    certificate and a TB certificate, I was in a  position  to  remake  the
    decision. I find no reason to disturb the findings made  by  the  Judge
    and set out in [15] to [22]. None of those  findings  were  subject  to
    challenge. In essence, therefore, the following is accepted.

         "That the school  system  in  Pakistan  could  not  cope  with  the
         children's Special Educational  Needs  and  that  they  were  being
         victimised, alienated and discriminated against [16];

         That the children have the identified health  challenges  of  being
         significantly visually impaired and registered blind [17];

         That if the Appellant were here it would be far easier  because  he
         could provide a second pair of hands - particularly  with  Mohammed
         (the third child) as the  Appellant  could  provide  personal  care
         which is better provided by a man [17];

         That the stress of being a single mother of  3  disabled  pubescent
         and pre pubescent children has taken a toll on the Appellant's wife
         who suffers from stress, anxiety and panic attacks [18];

         That it is likely terrifying for the  children  given  the  limited
         help they can give their mother and stressful  for  them  to  think
         they are the cause of their mother's health problems [18];

         That the mother's stress will be alleviated by the Appellant  being
         here as a second adult in the house [18];

         That the Appellant's wife lacks support  from  her  family  and  is
         effectively on her own with the  children  when  they  are  not  at
         school [19];

         That the children want  their  father  here  and  their  views  are
         important [20];

         That the Respondent's decision interferes with the respect to which
         all the members of the family are entitled  with  regard  to  their
         family and private life [21];

         That the Appellant has never attempted  to  circumvent  immigration
         control [21];

         That consequences of gravity flow from the decision as  the  family
         are struggling now and the Appellant may not be able  to  come  for
         some time; each day increases the stress on the family [22];

         It is in the children's best interests to  be  with  the  Appellant
         here [25];

         In due course the Appellant's presence here would reduce the burden
         on the tax payer as the children would need less  external  support
         out of school [25]; and

         There are compelling circumstances in this case not  recognised  by
         the rules [27]."

18. I have no hesitation in finding that this is one of  those  exceptional
    cases which is capable of falling outside the Rules  as  recognised  by
    SSHD v SS(Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 38.

19. The significant weight which must be afforded to the public interest, I
    find in this case is reduced because the  Appellant  is  well  able  to
    speak English, now has the relevant TB certificate and has an offer  of
    employment available to him. The countervailing interests in any  event
    do not in my  judgment  outweigh  the  considerable  body  of  evidence
    available showing that the best interest of the three  children  is  in
    having their father here with them in the United Kingdom. I accept that
    this appeal is what is termed an 'overseas' case, but  I  am  satisfied
    that the evidence before me shows that in this Appellant's case, family
    life cannot reasonably be enjoyed abroad.

Decision

20.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal  error.
    I hereby remake the decision. The appeal of Aamir  Bashir  against  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's refusal of 30th December 2014  to  grant  him
    entry clearance is allowed.
