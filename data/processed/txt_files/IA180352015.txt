Representation:
For the Appellant:   Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr A Miah (counsel) instructed by Lee Valley,
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Frazer, promulgated on 14  March  2016
which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 7 March 1960 and is  a  national  of  Pakistan.
The appellant entered the UK on  21  January  2000  and  claimed  asylum  on
arrival. On 19 December 2000 that application was refused  he  appealed  the
decision to refuse asylum and his appeal was dismissed and 29 May  2002.  By
7 August 2002 his appeal rights were exhausted.

2. On 24 January 2012 the appellant applied for indefinite leave  to  remain
in the UK on compassionate grounds. He argued that because he  suffers  from
depression and anxiety he is not medically fit to leave the UK,  and  argued
that articles 2, 3 & 8 ECHR are engaged.

4. On 26 March 2014 the appellant's solicitors wrote to  the  respondent  to
remind her that the appellant's  application  was  outstanding  despite  the
passage of time. The appellant's solicitor reminded the respondent  that  by
March 2014 the appellant had completed 14 years residence in the UK and  his
application has been submitted before 9 July 2012.

5.  On 29  April  2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application.


The Judge's Decision

6. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Frazer ("the Judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

7. Grounds of appeal were lodged and, on 12 August 2016, Judge  Hollingworth
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

      "2. An error of law has arisen in relation to the Judge  finding  that
      the decision of the respondent was not in accordance with the law but,
      has nevertheless proceeded to  allow  the  appeal  outright  on  human
      rights grounds which appear to be confined to the immigration rules as
      stated under paragraph 26 of the decision without  the  matter  having
      been sent back to the respondent.


      3. It is arguable that if the Judge was allowing the appeal  on  human
      rights grounds and that section 117 should have been applied."

The Hearing

8.  For the respondent, Mr Melvin moved the grounds of appeal. He relied  on
written submission which he handed up, and told me that this case is on  all
fours with the case of Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74. He told me that  the
Judge's decision is tainted by a material error of law and  that  the  Judge
should not have allowed this appeal  by  considering  section  276B  of  the
immigration rules, but instead should consider  this  case  under  paragraph
276 ADE of the rules which, on the facts as the Judge found them to be,  the
appellant cannot meet.

(b) Mr Melvin told me that HC 194 came into force on 9 July 2012,  but  that
the implementation provision contained therein was altered by HC  565  which
came into effect from 6 September 2012. That introduced paragraph  A277C  to
the immigration rules which enables  the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider
outstanding applications made before 9 July 2012 for leave to remain in  the
UK against the provisions of appendix FM and paragraph 276 ADE to 276 DH.

(c) Mr Melvin told me that the Judge's decision is  tainted  by  a  material
error of law. He urged me to set the decision aside  and  to  substitute  my
own decision.

9. (a) For the appellant, Mr  Miah  told  me  that  the  decision  does  not
contain any errors, material or otherwise. He told me that consideration  of
paragraph 276 ADE of the rules is entirely irrelevant. He took  me  to  [16]
of the decision where the Judge correctly states that  the  application  was
made in January 2012 & the respondent's decision was made in April 2015.  He
told me that there the Judge  correctly  directs  himself  to  consider  the
immigration rules before the changes which introduced paragraph 276  ADE  in
July 2012.

(b) Mr Miah then took me to [17] of the Judge's decision where, he told  me,
the Judge correctly considered the  law  and  the  respondent's  own  policy
guidance. He reminded me that at  [14]  the  Judge  carefully  balanced  all
section 117B considerations.  He  told  me  that  the  Judge's  decision  is
correct in law and should be allowed to stand. He urged me  to  dismiss  the
respondent's appeal.

ANALYSIS

10. In Edgehill and another v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
[2014] EWCA Civ 402, in determining appeals against refusals  to  grant  the
appellants ILR  it was held that, subject to one caveat, it was  not  lawful
to reject an application, made before 9 July 2012 under  Article  8  of  the
Convention, in reliance upon the applicant's failure to  achieve  20  years'
residence as specified in  paragraph  276ADE(iii)  of  the  new  Immigration
Rules as introduced by the Statement of Changes in Immigration  Rules  which
came into effect on 9 July 2012. The caveat was that

      "... mere passing reference to the 20 years  requirement  in  the  new
      rules will not have  the  effect  of  invalidating  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision. The decision only becomes unlawful if  the  decision
      maker relies upon rule 276ADE  (iii)  as  a  consideration  materially
      affecting the decision."


11. In Singh v SSHD: Khalid v SSHD  [2015] EWCA Civ 74,  it  was  held  that
the ratio in Edgehill only applied to applications made before 9  July  2012
and decided before 6 September 2012 (i) When HC 194 first  came  into  force
on 9 July 2012,  the  SSHD  was  not  entitled  to  take  into  account  the
provisions of the new Rules (either  directly  or  by  treating  them  as  a
statement of her current policy) when making decisions on private or  family
life applications made prior to that date  but  not  yet  decided.  That  is
because, as decided in Edgehill, "the implementation provision" set  out  at
para. 7 above displaces the usual Odelola principle; (ii) But that  position
was altered by HC  565  -  specifically  by  the  introduction  of  the  new
paragraph A277C - with effect from 6 September 2012. As from that  date  the
SSHD was entitled to take into account the provisions  of  Appendix  FM  and
paragraphs 276ADE-276DH in deciding  private  or  family  life  applications
even if they were made prior to 9 July 2012. The result is that the  law  as
it was held to be in Edgehill only obtained as regards  decisions  taken  on
pre 9 July 2012 applications in the two-month window between 9  July  and  6
September 2012; (iii) Neither of the decisions with which we  are  concerned
in this case fell within that window. Accordingly  the  Secretary  of  State
was entitled to apply the new Rules in reaching those decisions.  determined
on or after 6 September 2012 were governed by the Rules  as  amended  by  HC
194 and HC 565.

12. Singh settles the difficulties that had arisen in  trying  to  reconcile
Edgehill and  Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ  558)  In  KI  (Nigeria)  v
SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 255, following Singh v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ74,  when
considering an application for indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  in
March 2013 which had been originally made in  May  2004,  the  Secretary  of
State had been right  to  consider  the  application  by  reference  to  the
Immigration Rules as amended with effect from 6 September 2012  rather  than
in accordance with the Rules as they stood before 9 July 2012. The  position
was also confirmed in R(on the application of  Rajibul  Islam)  [2015]  EWCA
Civ 312.   In R (on the application of Taylor and Owusu-Akyeaw) [2015]  EWHC
3526 (Admin) it was held that the Court was bound by the reasoning in  Singh
[2015] EWCA Civ 74  to  conclude  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  been
entitled to  take  into  account  the  provisions  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
Immigration Rules in deciding two applications for  leave  to  remain  under
Article 8 of the ECHR which had been made prior  to  the  implementation  of
Appendix FM on 9 July 2012.

13. There is therefore merit in Mr Melvin's submission. The Judge  correctly
records in the first sentence of [16] of his decision that this  application
for leave to remain was submitted on 24  January  2012  &  the  respondent's
decision was not made until 29 April 2015. HC 565 came into  effect  from  6
September 2012. If the decision in this case had been made  between  9  July
2012 and 6 September 2012, then the Judge's decision  would  be  correct  in
law. Because the respondnet's decision was made  more  or  less  2  �  years
after paragraph A277C was introduced to the immigration  rules,  the  second
sentence of [16] of the Judge's decision is tainted by a material  error  of
law.

14. As I find that the Judge's decision promulgated  on  14  March  2016  is
tainted by a material error of law I must set it aside.

15. There is no great dispute about the facts in this  case.  The  appellant
entered the UK on  21  January  2000.  His  initial  claim  for  asylum  was
unsuccessful  and  the  appeal  rights  associated  that  that  claim   were
exhausted by 7 August 2002. Since then the appellant has remained in the  UK
unlawfully. He has been in the UK for 16 years  and  nine  months,  for  the
last 14 years he should not have been in the UK. The appellant was  born  in
1960.

16. The appellant is a single man and has no  family  in  the  UK.  He  last
worked in  the  UK  in  2006.  He  attends  mosque  in  the  UK  and  enjoys
socialising with his friends and their families.

17. Because the appellant is over 25 years of age and has lived  in  the  UK
for less than 20 years he cannot meet the requirements of paragraph 276  ADE
(1) (i) to (v). To meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  276  ADE1(vi)  the
appellant would have to establish that there are very significant  obstacles
to his reintegration into Pakistan. It has never been  the  appellants  case
that such significant obstacles exist. The appellant spent most of his  life
in Pakistan. His significant friendships  in  the  UK  are  with  people  of
Pakistani origin. The grounds of  appeal  lodged  against  the  respondent's
decision of 29 April 2015 do not argue that  such  insurmountable  obstacles
exist.

18. The application was submitted by the appellant solicitors on 26  January
2012  and  did  not  argue  that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles   to
integration into Pakistani society. Instead they argue that the  appellant's
circumstances in the UK were the "most  miserable  and  compassionate".  The
skeleton  argument  relied  on  before  the  First-tier   amounted   to   an
impassioned plea to consider the appellants case  under  paragraph  276B  of
the rules, which for the reasons I have already given, is incompetent.

19. In SS(Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 Lord Justice  Richards  said
at paragraph 33 "In our judgment, even though a test of exceptionality  does
not apply in every case falling within the  scope  of  Appendix  FM,  it  is
accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special
contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to
be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new  Rules  in
Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which is not as strict as  a
test of exceptionality or a requirement of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to
foreign criminals), but  which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
consideration  of  public  interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  It  also
reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has been  tested  and
has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g.,  Haleemudeen  at  [44],  per
Beatson LJ".

20. If I find such compelling circumstances, I then have  to  determine  the
following separate questions:

    (i) Does family life, private life, home or correspondence exist within
    the meaning of Article 8
    (ii) If so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with
    (iii) If so, was the interference in accordance with the law
    (iv) If so, was the interference in pursuit of one  of  the  legitimate
    aims set out in Article 8(2); and
    (v) If so, is the interference proportionate  to  the  pursuit  of  the
    legitimate aim?


21. There is no reliable evidence of compelling  circumstances  which  merit
consideration of this case out-with  the  immigration  rules.  The  case  is
plead predominantly on the appellant's long, but mostly unlawful,  residence
in the UK. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier argue that articles 2,  3
and 8 ECHR are engaged. There is no reliable evidence of  a  threat  to  the
appellant's life if he returns to Pakistan so that is appeal cannot  succeed
on article 2 ECHR grounds.

22. The argument on article 3 ECHR grounds proceeds on the  basis  that  the
appellant suffers from  depression  and  is  having  a  miserable  time.  No
reliable medical evidence was produced

23. On appeal to the European Court in  N  v  UK  Application  26565/05  the
Grand Chamber upheld the decision of the House of Lords  and  said  that  in
medical cases Article 3  only  applied  in  very  exceptional  circumstances
particularly as the suffering was not the result of an  intentional  act  or
omission of a  State  or  non  State  body.   The  fact  that  the  person's
circumstances, including his or her life expectancy, would be  significantly
reduced was not sufficient in itself to give rise to a breach of Article  3.
Those same principles had to apply in  relation  to  the  expulsion  of  any
person afflicted with any serious, naturally occurring  physical  or  mental
illness which might cause suffering pain  or  reduced  life  expectancy  and
required specialist medical treatment that might not  be  readily  available
or which might only be available at considerable cost.

24. Insufficient evidence is produced to approach the high threshold set  in
the case of N. The appellant's appeal  cannot  succeed  on  article  3  ECHR
grounds.

25. No challenge is taken to the Judge's article 8 findings  at  [22],  [23]
and [24] of the decision. It is a matter of concession  that  the  appellant
does not have family members in the  UK  so  that  family  life  within  the
meaning of article 8 ECHR is not established. The only evidence  of  private
life is that the appellant has established friendships in the  UK  and  last
worked in the UK 10 years ago. He is able to practice his  religion  in  the
UK.

26. Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that little weight  can  be  given
to private life established while the appellant's  presence  in  the  UK  is
unlawful. In so far as the appellant has established  any  private  life  in
the UK he has done  so  whilst  his  presence  in  the  UK  is  unlawful.  I
therefore attach little weight to the meagre evidence produced to  establish
the component parts of  private  life  within  the  meaning  of  article  8.
Section 117B also tells  me  that  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
interest.

27. Even if I were able to consider the appellants  article  8  rights  out-
with the immigration rules, I would come to the conclusion that family  life
within the UK is not established, and  that  if  the  respondent's  decision
amounts to an interference with any private life the  appellant  might  have
established, it is proportionate interference. In  any  event  I  find  that
there are not sufficient grounds to consider an article 8 ECHR argument out-
with the immigration rules.

28. The appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  of  29  April
2015 must be dismissed.

Decision

29. The decision of the First-tier tribunal is tainted by a  material  error
of law and must be set aside

30. I substitute the following decision.

31. The appeal is dismissed.
