For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Ms. A. Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. In a decision promulgated on 22 May 2018 I set aside  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal came before me to be remade.


 2. I made the following directions at [38] and [39] of the  error  of  law
    decision:

    "Given Mr Jarvis' submission that the Respondent was  pursuing  further
    enquiries with the Angolan Embassy, and given the relevance of this  to
    the appeal, if the Respondent has any evidence which casts doubt on the
    evidence from the Angolan Embassy that the Appellant cannot  prove  his
    citizenship without supporting documents, she is to  provide  any  such
    evidence, and any submissions in relation to this evidence, 14 days  in
    advance of the resumed hearing. [38]

    The Respondent is also to make clear her position  regarding  the  DRC,
    given that she has accepted the Appellant's claim to be  a  citizen  of
    Angola." [39]

 3. Nothing was provided to the Tribunal by the Respondent  in  advance  of
    the hearing.


 4. At the outset of the hearing I  asked  Ms.  Fijiwala  whether  she  had
    anything further to provide.  In relation to [38] she said that she had
    chased this issue in the week prior to the hearing.  Nothing  had  been
    received from the Angolan Embassy and no timescale had been given as to
    when a response would be received.  There was  no  indication  of  when
    this issue had first been pursued following the previous  hearing,  and
    there was no documentary evidence to show when any enquiries  had  been
    made.  I therefore find that no  evidence  has  been  provided  by  the
    Respondent to cast doubt on the evidence from the Angolan Embassy  that
    the  Appellant  cannot  prove  his   citizenship   without   supporting
    documents.

 5. In relation to [39] Ms. Fijiwala stated that,  as  the  Respondent  had
    accepted that the Appellant was from Angola, the DRC was not  relevant.
    There was no issue of the Appellant's return to the DRC.

 6. The error of law decision was promulgated on 22 May 2018.   The  appeal
    came before me on 25 September 2018, some four months later.  There was
    no indication as to when the matter set out at  [38]  had  been  raised
    with the Angolan Embassy.  There was no documentary evidence before  me
    to confirm that the Respondent was pursuing  further  enquiries.   This
    issue has been ongoing since January 2017, when directions were made in
    the First-tier Tribunal relating to the Respondent's  discussions  with
    the Angolan Embassy.  I set out  in  the  error  of  law  decision  the
    Respondent's failure to comply with the directions  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal [13] to [19].  I considered  that  the  interests  of  justice
    would not be served by delaying consideration of the Appellant's appeal
    further, for an indeterminate period.  No adjournment was requested  by
    Ms. Fijiwala.

 7. At the hearing having  explained  the  position  to  the  Appellant,  I
    indicated to him that I would be allowing the appeal given the position
    relating to his inability to return to Angola.  My full reasons are set
    out below.

Remaking

 8. The burden of proof lies on the Appellant to show that the Respondent's
    decision is a breach of his rights to a family and private  life  under
    Article 8 ECHR.  The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.



The Respondent's case

 9. The Appellant applied for leave to remain as a spouse.  The reasons for
    refusal letter is dated 4 December  2015.   The  Respondent  considered
    that the Appellant met the suitability and eligibility requirements for
    leave to remain as a spouse under Appendix FM of the immigration rules.
     The  Respondent  then  proceeded  to  consider  paragraph  EX.1  ([11]
    onwards).  At [12] the Respondent stated that  the  Appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements of paragraph  EX.1(b)  as  he  had  not  supplied
    sufficient  evidence  to  support  his  claim  that  his  partner   was
    recognised as disabled.  The Respondent considered this further at [13]
    and [14].  At [15] family ties with the Appellant's partner's  daughter
    were considered.  The Respondent considered that the Appellant did  not
    meet Appendix FM.


10. The Respondent then considered the Appellant's private life.  There was
    consideration of his  nationality  at  [21],  but  that  there  was  no
    consideration of the Appellant's ability to return to Angola,  although
    the  interview  carried  out  with  the  Angolan  Embassy,  which   the
    Respondent had  arranged,  had  taken  place  in  February  2015.   The
    Respondent considered that the Appellant did not meet the  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

11. Exceptional circumstances were considered at  [30]  onwards,  but  only
    with reference to the Appellant's wife.

Findings and conclusions

12. As confirmed by Ms. Fijiwala on behalf of the Respondent, the Appellant
    has been accepted as being Angolan, so the issue is whether he is  able
    to return there.  The Respondent is not submitting that he  can  return
    to any other country.


13. I find that the evidence before me from the Angolan Embassy shows  that
    the Appellant cannot prove his citizenship  of  Angola  as  he  has  no
    documents.  I therefore find that his  Angolan  nationality  cannot  be
    confirmed.  The letter from the Angolan Embassy dated 15  May  2017  to
    the Appellant's representatives states:

    "As regards to Mr Santos' application for an Angolan Passport or Travel
    Document, we are sorry to inform that we  are  unable  to  confirm  his
    Angolan nationality since there are no supporting documents."

14. As I found in the error of law decision [24],  it  is  clear  from  the
    interview synopsis provided by the Angolan Embassy that they were aware
    that the Appellant had stated that he was born in Angola, and that  his
    father was an Angolan citizen.   However  the  letter  is  clear  that,
    without supporting documents, his nationality cannot be confirmed.   As
    set out above, there is no evidence from the Respondent to  cast  doubt
    on this.  The interview in February 2015 was set up by  the  Respondent
    who was seeking to remove the Appellant to Angola.   On  that  occasion
    the Respondent failed to obtain any documents from the Angolan  Embassy
    in order to facilitate the Appellant's removal.  I therefore find  that
    the Appellant cannot confirm his Angolan citizenship and cannot  obtain
    documents which will enable him to return to Angola.

Immigration rules

15. In order to meet paragraph EX.1(b) the Appellant must show  that  there
    are insurmountable obstacles to family life with his spouse  continuing
    outside the United Kingdom.  Paragraph  EX.2.  defines  "insurmountable
    obstacles" as "the very significant difficulties which would  be  faced
    by the applicant or their  partner  in  continuing  their  family  life
    together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail
    very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

16. I find that the fact  that  the  Appellant  cannot  prove  his  Angolan
    citizenship, and therefore cannot obtain entry to Angola, amounts to an
    insurmountable obstacle to family life continuing in  Angola.   I  find
    that he has provided evidence which shows that this obstacle cannot  be
    overcome given that he has no supporting  documents  which  could  show
    that he is entitled to Angolan citizenship.  It is not  submitted  that
    he should be able to continue family life anywhere else, in  particular
    the DRC or Kenya and, without travel documents, he would be  unable  to
    travel in any event.  I find that the Appellant meets the  requirements
    of paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.

17. Further I find that the inability to prove his citizenship is  a  "very
    significant obstacle" to his integration into Angola, and therefore  he
    meets the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) in  relation  to  his
    private life.

Article 8 outside the rules

18. I have considered the Appellant's appeal outside the Immigration  Rules
    in accordance with the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  As was  accepted
    by the Respondent, I find that the Appellant and  his  wife  are  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.  I find that the Appellant and his
    wife have a family life sufficient to engage the operation  of  Article
    8.  I find the decision would interfere with that.


19. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.


20. In assessing the public interest I have taken into account  all  of  my
    findings above in relation to the immigration rules.  I have also taken
    into account section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002.  Section 117B(1) provides that the maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest.   I  have  found  above
    that the Appellant meets the requirements for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    spouse under Appendix FM of the immigration rules.  I have  also  found
    that he meets paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).   There  will  therefore  be  no
    compromise to the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control  by
    allowing his appeal.
21. The Appellant speaks English (117B(1)).  In relation to  his  financial
    situation I find, adopting the finding in the First-tier Tribunal that,
    were his immigration status to permit him, he would be likely to obtain
    some work (117B(3)).

22. I find that the Appellant has been  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  some
    nineteen years.  Section 117B(4) provides that little weight should  be
    given to a relationship with a  qualifying  partner  formed  when  that
    person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.  However  given  the  other
    factors in the Appellant's case, I find  that  more  weight  should  be
    given to their relationship which cannot  be  enjoyed  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom.  Sections 117B(5) and 117B(6) are not relevant.

23. I have found above that the Appellant cannot obtain documents to  prove
    his Angolan citizenship and therefore cannot return to Angola.  It  has
    not been submitted by the Respondent that he could be returned  to  any
    other country.  I therefore find that family life can only  be  enjoyed
    in the United Kingdom.

24. Taking into account all of the above, I find  that  the  balance  comes
    down in favour of the Appellant.  I find, in carrying out the balancing
    exercise required, that the Appellant  has  shown  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the decision is a breach of his rights, and those of
    his spouse, to a family and private life under Article 8 ECHR.

Notice of Decision

25. The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.  The Appellant meets the
    requirements of Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1) of the  immigration
    rules.

26. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award.   The  Respondent  was  aware  of  the
problems faced by the Appellant in proving his  Angolan  citizenship  having
tried to remove him in 2015,  and  having  set  up  an  interview  with  the
Angolan Embassy in order to facilitate this.  However, he made no  reference
to these difficulties in the reasons for refusal letter.  He then failed  to
comply with the directions  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  Respondent
claimed to be in ongoing discussions with the Angolan Embassy  but  provided
no evidence of this, and no evidence  to  contradict  the  Embassy's  advice
that  they  could  not  issue  a  passport  or  travel  documents.   In  the
circumstances, I make a fee award for the entire fee paid, �140.
