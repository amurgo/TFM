                            DECISION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal by an appellant born on [ - ], a citizen  of  Albania
    from the Gypsy Jevg tribe who also claims to have been  involved  in  a
    blood feud.  He appeals the decision of Judge Paul Housego, sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 12 November  2015,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  a
    decision of 1 July 2015 refusing him asylum and granting him  leave  to
    remain only until 20 August when he reached the age of 17ï¿½.  The  judge
    accepted the appellant's account of leaving Albania on his own passport
    with a man who was the bearer of a  notarized  authorization  from  his
    legal guardians to take him out of the country.

2.   Permission to appeal was sought on the basis that  the  judge  did  not
    make adequate allowance on credibility  for  the  appellant's  being  a
    minor, acting under control of an agent.  Several particulars  of  that
    were given in the grounds, although not referred to in the grant.   The
    only one with which I need deal is referred to  at  ground  7,  and  it
    deals with paragraph 97 of the judge's decision, where the  judge  held
    against the appellant what he said was his failure to produce  a  death
    certificate for [AK], who was a member of the opposing clan,  whom  the
    appellant said had been killed by his uncle,  more  or  less  in  self-
    defence, in the course of a quarrel, leading to a  blood  feud  between
    the two clans.

3.   What the judge said about that was  this,  referring  to  TK  (Burundi)
    [2009] EWCA Civ 40, which was a  decision  about  evidence  that  might
    reasonably be expected to be called, but on totally different facts.

         "This is said to be a blood feud following a  violent  death  in  a
         public place of a person said to be of a wealthy and well connected
         family.  There is no doubt that such a death would  be  registered.
         Albania has a proper record system  (for  example  the  information
         about the departure of the appellant).  There has been  no  attempt
         to obtain a death certificate which would either result in  such  a
         certificate or evidence that  one  could  not  be  obtained.   This
         affects my view of the credibility of the evidence."

4.   There are a number of problems with that passage.  The  one  relied  on
    by Mr Sills is simply the age of the appellant.  There is no basis  for
    saying that he could reasonably be expected to  have  brought  a  death
    certificate for somebody who is an enemy of his family out  of  Albania
    with him, and he was not questioned  about  the  existence  of  one  at
    interview; nor was the point taken in the refusal letter.   If  any  of
    those things had happened,  then  he  has  had  experienced  specialist
    solicitors acting for him, and his age would not have mattered, because
    they could have been expected to make those enquiries; but this is  not
    the case.

5.   So it seems to me that the judge's reliance on the absence of  a  death
    certificate was an error of  law  in  the  circumstances,  particularly
    because there was no evidence before him to support his  finding  about
    the proper record system in Albania, except for the  information  about
    the appellant's departure which was of another kind.


6.   The question is whether the judge's error on this point was a  material
    one.  Mr Bramble has argued that it was not,  relying  on  the  country
    guidance case of EH (blood feuds) Albania CG  [2012]  UKUT  348  (IAC),
    which was cited at length by the judge at paragraph 32 of his decision.
     The relevant paragraph of the judicial head-note is (vii):  "In  order
    to  establish  that  there  is  an  active  blood  feud  affecting  him
    personally an appellant must produce satisfactory  individual  evidence
    of its existence in relation to him."  Various examples are then given,
    although there is no particular reference to death certificates.

7.   If the judge had linked his reasoning in his decision to what was  said
    in EH and gone through the evidence which might  reasonably  have  been
    available in the circumstances, and decided against  the  appellant  on
    that basis, then nothing could have been said against his decision; but
    that is not what he did.

8.   Then Mr Bramble says this was not necessarily a crucial finding in  any
    case: certainly not every point on which a judge takes  adverse  notice
    of an appellant's account is  likely  to  be  crucial  to  credibility.
    However, where this paragraph appeared was at the end of  what  was  in
    fact  the  judge's  discussing  of  the  evidence  although  it   comes
    immediately before the  short  final  passage  headed  "Discussion  and
    Conclusion".  The judge's  findings  on  the  death  certificate  ended
    specifically with the words "This affects my view of the credibility of
    the evidence" and it does not seem possible to me to say  that  it  was
    other than a material error.

Notice of Decision

9.   Both parties are agreed that the  result  in  these  circumstances  can
    only be a fresh hearing,  which  will  take  place  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, not before Judge Housego.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

The appellant is  granted  anonymity  until  the  decision  on  the  further
hearing directed, when it will be for the judge to decide whether or not  it
should be continued.  No report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
