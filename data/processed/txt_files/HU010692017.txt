Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Mr J Ren�, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Entry Clearance Officer has been granted permission to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg allowing the  appeal  of  the
    respondent against refusal to grant her entry clearance to  the  United
    Kingdom as a spouse under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

2.   The respondent will from now on be referred to  as  the  applicant  for
    ease of reference.

3.   The applicant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  22  February  1952.   At
    the hearing before  the  judge  the  appellant's  sponsor  and  husband
    confirmed that the applicant was his wife  and  that  they  married  in
    Nigeria on 27 November 2014.  He had stayed  with  his  wife  for  four
    weeks after the marriage before he returned to the United Kingdom.   He
    visited her in November 2016 when he stayed in Nigeria for four  weeks.
    He is a dual national and travelled on his Nigerian passport.  He  said
    he has not been able to see the applicant more often because  he  works
    as a security officer.  However, they kept  in  contact  every  day  by
    telephone.  He said he provided evidence of that.

4.   The Entry Clearance Officer had given several reasons for refusing  the
    applicant's application.  The judge found in favour of the applicant on
    all the issues.

5.   The judge found that the  sponsor  is  a  person  who  is  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  She also found that the  applicant  has
    submitted an IELTS certificate which she  passed  at  A1  level  on  19
    January 2016.  Therefore, the judge was satisfied  that  the  applicant
    met the English language requirements.

6.   The judge was also satisfied with the sponsor's evidence  that  he  had
    travelled on his Nigerian passport as he  was  a  dual  national.   She
    found that this was the reason why there was no Nigerian visa  or  date
    stamp in his British passport.  The sponsor had  submitted  his  flight
    ticket and booking reference at the appeal hearing which showed that he
    visited Nigeria on 9 September 2016.

7.   The judge accepted that the sponsor kept in contact with the  applicant
    regularly since the marriage by telephone.   In  evidence  he  said  he
    spoke to his wife every day.  The judge noted that the Entry  Clearance
    Manager had stated that the telephone bills  referred  to  a  telephone
    number  which  was  different  from  that  given  in  the   applicant's
    application form.  She found that the sponsor  was  not  cross-examined
    about that.  The fact that it may be a different number from that given
    in the application form, was not evidence that the sponsor has not been
    telephoning the  applicant  in  Nigeria.   She  found  that  there  was
    substantial documentary evidence of telephone calls made by the sponsor
    to Nigeria in 2015 and 16.  The judge took into account the photographs
    in the bundle.  On the balance of probabilities, the judge  found  that
    the marriage between the applicant and the sponsor was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage.  She also found that the couple do intend to  live
    together permanently as husband and wife.

8.   The judge held at paragraph 7 as follows

    7.   The sponsor provided his pay slips from G4S Secure Solutions  (UK)
         Limited.  Additionally he provided his P60 for the  year  ending  5
         April 2015 showing that he earned �24,514.12.  He also provided his
         P60 for the year ending  5  April  2016  showing  his  earnings  as
         �28,123.36.  His P60 for the year ending 5 April 2017 shows that he
         earned �28,186.46.  I find that the sponsor  is  required  to  have
         annual earnings of �18,600.  His P60s clearly show that at the date
         of application and the date of decision, he earned well  in  excess
         of that sum.  In conclusion and in taking the evidence as a  whole,
         I find that the appellant meets the requirements of Appendix FM  of
         the Immigration Rules.

9.   Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes as  follows:



    3.   The grounds argue that the judge erred as she allowed  the  appeal
         under the Immigration Rules without  taking  a  balancing  exercise
         under Article 8 which should have been conducted through the  prism
         of the Immigration  Rules.   The  application  had  failed  as  the
         appellant had not provided the required documentation and the judge
         had not identified why it was disproportionate for the appellant to
         make a fresh application.


    4.   As the appellant  had  not  submitted  the  evidence  required  by
         Appendix FM and FM-SE the appellant could not have succeeded  under
         the Rules.  The fact that the appellant had submitted evidence  for
         the hearing did not alter that fact.  There was no analysis in  the
         decision on the proportionality of a renewed application being made
         that did meet the Rules, the intention is  that  applicants  should
         submit the evidence with the application and not  after  the  event
         and that has been the position since the introduction  of  Appendix
         FM in 2012.

10.  Mr Wilding did not support the argument in the grounds that  the  judge
    was required to consider the human rights appeal through the  prism  of
    the Immigration Rules, but even if the judge found that  the  applicant
    did meet the requirements of the Rules, the judge needed to carry out a
    balancing exercise under Article 8.  Mr Wilding submitted that this was
    a wrong proposition in law.

11.  Mr Wilding's argument however was that the  applicant  could  not  meet
    the Immigration Rules because  the  applicant  failed  to  provide  the
    required supporting evidence.  He said the applicant  was  required  to
    provide six months' bank statements,  six  months'  pay  slips  and  an
    employer's letter in order to satisfy the Immigration Rules  in  FM-SE.
    The difficulty for the applicant is that there was one missing pay slip
    and that was the pay slip for April 2016.  Because of this missing  pay
    slip, the applicant could not meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.

12.  He submitted  that  this  issue  could  have  been  reconciled  by  the
    applicant at any stage up to and including the  date  of  the  hearing.
    The applicant's application was refused in 2016 and the Entry Clearance
    Manager's  review  was  received  in  2017.   The  applicant  has   had
    sufficient time to produce this evidence but has not done so.  He  said
    this missing document was sufficient to require the applicant to make a
    new application.

13.  Mr Ren� relied on his Rule 24 response and to paragraph 8(c).  He  said
    that there must be a degree of fairness and common sense with regard to
    the missing pay slip for April 2016.  He said the ECM does not say that
    the sponsor's bank statements provided did  not  show  the  income  for
    April 2006 and more so the pay  slip  for  May  2016  was  present  and
    clearly showed that it was the second pay date period for the beginning
    of the tax year 2016/17 and the gross  pay  and  actual  pay  for  that
    month.  He said the ECO could have reconciled that by  looking  at  the
    bank statement for April 2016.

14.  He submitted that even if the document was missing,  there  were  other
    documents submitted by the applicant to reconcile the  matter  and  the
    ECO could have applied a common sense approach.

15.   He  submitted  that  the  ECO  could  have  also  applied   evidential
    flexibility to his consideration of the missing document.

16.  Mr Wilding submitted that there was no real  merit  in  the  evidential
    flexibility argument.  He said evidential flexibility  applied  because
    previously applicants were barred by Section 85  to  put  in  documents
    that were missing from  an  application.   Since  the  2012  Act  which
    amended Section 85, the applicant had all the time from the refusal  of
    the application until  the  date  of  hearing  to  submit  the  missing
    document.

Findings

17.  I was not persuaded by Mr Wilding's argument that the applicant  should
    be  required  to  make  an  entry  clearance  application  because  the
    sponsor's pay slip for April 2016 was missing from the  documents  that
    she had submitted to the ECO.  I accept Mr Ren�'s argument that the ECO
    could have applied a common sense approach to this matter.  There  were
    other documents, such as the April 2016  bank  statement  which  showed
    that the sponsor's pay for April 2016  had  been  paid  into  his  bank
    account.  There was a further document, namely the  P60  for  May  2016
    which showed the applicant's gross pay and  the  actual  pay  for  that
    month.  The gross pay would have shown that the sponsor had  been  paid
    for April 2016.

18.  Whilst I accept that the evidential flexibility policy does  not  apply
    because the applicant could have submitted the missing document at  any
    time up to and including the date of hearing, I find that  this  should
    not have prevented the ECO from looking at other documents in order  to
    reconcile the outstanding issue of the missing pay slip for April 2016.



19.  In any event I find that a phone call from the ECO in Sheffield to  the
    sponsor in London could also have resolved the matter. Had the ECO done
    so, the applicant would not find herself in the position  that  she  is
    in.

20.  Accordingly, I find that the judge did not err in her decision.

21.  The judge's decision allowing the applicant's appeal shall stand.

22.  The ECO's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
