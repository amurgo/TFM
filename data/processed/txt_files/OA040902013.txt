                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of  birth  22nd  February
1989. On the 20th February  2014  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  De
Haney)  allowed  his  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
decision to refuse to grant him entry clearance  as  the  spouse  of  a
person present and settled in the United Kingdom.  The Entry  Clearance
Officer (ECO) now has permission to appeal against that decision.






Background and Matters in Issue

The Respondent's Sponsor in the United Kingdom is his wife Zeenat  Bibi
Ahmad.  They had met in the UK when the Respondent was living here as a
student. They had travelled to Pakistan together  where  they  had  got
married. The Respondent then made  an  application  to  enable  him  to
travel back to the UK with his wife.

The notice of refusal is dated the 21st December  2012.  It  was  dealt
with under paragraph 281 of the Rules. The ECO noted that payslips  had
been provided for  Ms  Ahmad  but  these  were  not  considered  to  be
satisfactory evidence of her income.   No evidence had been supplied to
show that the Respondent could reasonably expect to find employment  in
the UK. He was therefore refused on maintenance grounds.  In respect of
accommodation it was said that the couple would reside at the sponsor's
mother's house, but no evidence of this had  been  provided.    Finally
the ECO was not satisfied  that  this  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
marriage and that the parties intended to  live  permanently  with  the
other.

On appeal Judge De Haney heard oral  evidence  from  the  Sponsor,  the
Sponsor's father  and  uncle.   He  found  all  three  to  be  credible
witnesses. He made clear findings that this was a genuine  relationship
and  there  is  no  challenge  to  those  findings.    In  respect   of
accommodation he noted the evidence that the VAF had been completed  on
the basis that the couple would live at the Sponsor's mother's address.
  By the time of the decision the  couple  had  received  an  offer  of
accommodation from the Sponsor's father; notwithstanding that this  was
not communicated to the ECO Judge De Haney found it to be circumstances
appertaining at the time of decision and  found  the  burden  of  proof
discharged. In respect of maintenance the determination  sets  out  the
evidence that at the time that the VAF was completed  the  Sponsor  was
employed in a jewellery shop in Manchester.  However  by  the  date  of
decision she was living with her husband in Pakistan and had  lost  her
job.  Judge De Haney nevertheless accepted the evidence before him that
by the date of decision the Respondent had been offered  employment  in
the UK by the Sponsor's uncle.   He found this to be a genuine offer of
employment and allowed the appeal on the basis that the  parties  would
be adequately maintained.


Error of Law

The grounds of appeal are that Judge De  Haney  erred  in  taking  into
account  post-decision  evidence  in   respect   of   maintenance   and
accommodation; further that he erred in  accepting  the  oral  evidence
without  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  it.    Before  me   Ms
Johnstone elaborated those grounds to submit that  the  Judge  was  not
entitled to take into account evidence that was not before the  ECO  at
the date of decision. In respect of accommodation the Judge had  failed
to make findings about whether the third-party offer  was  durable  and
realistic. She further submitted that the determination was flawed  for
failure to set out the relevant figures in respect of maintenance,  and
whether the claimed projected earnings  were  sufficient  to  meet  the
threshold of adequacy set out in KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065.
The grounds of appeal are misconceived.  I deal first of all  with  the
point about post-decision  evidence.  It  is  not  the  case  that  the
Tribunal is only entitled to take into account evidence that was before
the ECO.  Section 85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
2002 provides that in an appeal against a refusal  of  entry  clearance
the Tribunal "may consider only the circumstances appertaining  at  the
time of the decision". As DR (Morocco)* [2005] UKIAT 00038 makes clear,
this can include evidence which existed before the decision but was not
before the ECO, as well as evidence which post-dates the  decision  but
can be relied upon to establish circumstances as  they  stood  on  that
day. The evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  credible  oral
evidence that the Sponsor's father and uncle had met with her  and  her
husband in Pakistan before the decision and had made these offers.  The
evidence of all three witnesses had been tested in cross-examination by
Judge De Haney who had found them to be entirely credible.      He  was
entitled to rely upon it because it went to circumstances  appertaining
at the date of decision.

The grounds of appeal  assert  that  there  was  "a  complete  lack  of
evidence of accommodation and employment at the date of decision". That
is not true. Judge De Haney had heard credible oral evidence from three
witnesses that at the date of decision on the 21st  December  2012  the
Sponsor's father had already offered accommodation at his home and that
the Sponsor's uncle had already offered the Respondent a job. Judge  De
Haney was entitled to place weight on that evidence.  As  Mr  Thornhill
points out, there was in fact some documentary evidence in  respect  of
the accommodation in that  there  was  a  housing  report  and  a  Land
Registry entry showing the property to be unencumbered by any  mortgage
or charge. The fact that these  reports  post-dated  the  decision  was
irrelevant since they related to the property that was the  subject  of
the offer before the decision was made.  It is not an error of  law  to
believe witnesses.

Ms Johnstone raised two new issues that were not set out in the grounds
of appeal. These had more merit. The first was that the Judge  did  not
specifically direct himself to  what  might  constitute  "adequate"  in
respect of maintenance.   He had been  given  a  copy  of  KA  and  the
relevant income support  thresholds.  It  is  right  to  say  that  the
determination does not refer to these matters but I  am  not  satisfied
that this is an error such that the decision should be set aside.  That
is because it is clear from the witness statement of  Mr  Abdul  Latif,
the Sponsor's uncle that the job offer was for 35 hours work  per  week
at �6.19 per hour. That amounts to over �226 per week, in excess of the
amount that the parties would have received on income support  even  if
one took into account the Sponsor's then as yet unborn child.      They
therefore exceeded the KA threshold.

Ms Johnstone's second point related to the offer of third-party support
made by the Sponsor's father Khalid Mahmood Ahmad. She  submitted  that
the Tribunal had failed to make findings on how  realistic  that  offer
was, and in particular whether it would be sustained for  the  duration
of the Respondent's 'probationary period'. Again, any omission in  this
regard is not such that the decision  should  be  set  aside.  That  is
because the evidence established that the offer was  stable.  Mr  Ahmad
had given credible oral evidence that he was happy to  accommodate  his
daughter and son-in-law in his three bedroomed house; the Land Registry
confirmed that he owned the property outright and there was a  property
inspection report stating that he was the only other occupant. That was
enough evidence for Judge De Haney to be satisfied as  to  this  third-
party offer of accommodation:  Mahad and Ors v ECOs (2009) UKSC 16,  AB
(Third-party provision of accommodation) [2008] UKAIT 00018.


Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law and it
is upheld.
