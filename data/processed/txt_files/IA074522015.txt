                            DECISION AND REASONS

    The Secretary of State, with permission, appeals against  the  decision
    of the First-tier   Tribunal panel (Judge Colyer and Mr G Sandal,  non-
    legal member) (hereinafter referred to as the  "panel"),  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 8th July 2015, allowed Mr  Dino  Fumo's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to  make  a  deportation
    order against him by virtue of Section  5(1)  of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971.  The decision of the Secretary of State was  to  deport  Mr  Fumo
    under the  provisions  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations"), on the basis that the Regulations
    applied to Mr Fumo as a family member of an EEA national

The background:

 1. Whilst the appeal is brought by the Secretary of State, for the sake of
    convenience we shall refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal, therefore referring to Mr Fumo as the Appellant.

 2. The Appellant's immigration history can be summarised as follows.   The
    Appellant is a national of Mozambique born  on  10th  March  1991.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom in 2003 as a dependant of his father  who
    is now a naturalised British citizen  but  at  that  date  was  an  EEA
    national.  Consequently he entered the United  Kingdom  as  the  family
    member of an EEA national.

 3. On 23rd July 2003, the Appellant was issued with a  residence  document
    confirming his right to reside in the United Kingdom as a dependant  of
    an EEA national  which  was  valid  until  23rd  July  2008.   On  11th
    September 2009 the Appellant was issued with a document certifying  his
    right of permanent residence in the UK as a dependant of  a  Portuguese
    national.  That remains the Appellant's status in the United Kingdom to
    date.

 4. The findings of the panel relating to his earlier years are set out  in
    the determination at [27] and [59] namely, that the Appellant  had  not
    lived in Mozambique since he was 3 or 4 years of age and that  when  he
    left Mozambique with his family, he moved with them  to  Germany  where
    his early education took place until he arrived in the United  Kingdom,
    aged 11.  The panel found that he had no relatives  in  Mozambique,  he
    did not speak the language and that he had returned to that country for
    a short visit in 2012.

 5. The Appellant has criminal convictions.  On 12th January  2011  he  was
    convicted of an offence of theft and was ordered to pay a fine of  �65,
    costs of �85 and a victim surcharge of �15.

 6. On 13th October 2014, at Cambridge Crown Court, he was convicted of  an
    offence  of  robbery  and  received  a  sentence  of   twenty   months'
    imprisonment.  The panel set out the circumstances of that  offence  at
    [38] and [39] of the determination by reference to  the  extracts  that
    had been set out in the decision letter of the Secretary of  State  and
    the circumstances of the offence and the part played by his co-accused.
    The judge sentenced the Appellant solely on the basis of the offence to
    which he pleaded guilty, which was one of robbery (see page  5  of  the
    sentencing remarks).  The  judge  did  not  find  that  the  provisions
    relating to "dangerous offenders" applied to the Appellant (page 4) and
    considered the appropriate sentence in  the  light  of  the  sentencing
    guidelines for robbery, finding that, on its  facts  the  offence  fell
    within level 1, with a starting point of twelve months and a  range  of
    up to three years custody.  Taking into account the mitigating  factors
    and that this was not a "pre-planned robbery", the timing of  the  plea
    and the impact upon the Appellant, the appropriate sentence was one  of
    twenty months' imprisonment.

 7. By reason of his  conviction,  the  Secretary  of  State  notified  the
    Appellant that she intended to make a deportation order against him  on
    grounds of public policy in accordance  with  Regulation  19(3)(b)  and
    Regulation 21 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 ("the Regulations"). A decision to make a  deportation  order  was
    made on 28th January 2015.  The Appellant appealed that decision to the
    First-tier Tribunal. The panel heard the appeal on 11th June  2015  and
    allowed the appeal under the Regulations and on Article 8 grounds.

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  that  decision  and
    permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 14th October 2015.

The appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

 9. Mr Whitwell appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State and Mr McKenna
    appeared on behalf of the Appellant.  Mr Whitwell's submissions can  be
    summarised as follows. First, he submitted that  the  panel  had  given
    material weight to the "prospects of rehabilitation" of  the  Appellant
    at paragraph [51] - [58] citing the decision of Essa  [2012]  EWCA  Civ
    1718 but, applying the decision of SE (Zimbabwe) v The SSHD [2014] EWCA
    Civ 256, this was a material error of approach  because  the  Appellant
    was not an EEA national but was a citizen of Mozambique  and  thus  the
    question of rehabilitation was irrelevant and the judge  had  erred  by
    giving weight to it.  He submitted that the disposal of the  appeal  by
    the panel by allowing the appeal under the 2006 Regulations was unsafe.

10. Second, he submitted that, in allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds,
    the panel  failed to direct itself as to the relevant provisions of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  did  not  apply  the
    Section 117 factors as set out in Badewa (117A - D and EEA Regulations)
    [2015] UKUT 00329. Mr Whitwell made no  specific  oral  submissions  in
    this regard, relying on the written grounds.   He  invited  us  to  set
    aside the decision and to remake the appeal dismissing the  Appellant's
    appeal.

11. Mr McKenna, on behalf  of  the  Appellant,  relied  upon  his  skeleton
    argument. In addition, he submitted  that  the  panel  had  heard  oral
    evidence from the Appellant and the family members  all  of  whom  they
    found  to  be  credible  witnesses  and  this  was   clear   from   the
    determination.  He referred us to paragraph 8 of the determination  and
    that the evidence before the panel demonstrated that the Appellant  did
    not represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat  and
    that he was not likely to reoffend and that that was the  crux  of  the
    issue.  The panel had a report or letter  from  the  Probation  Service
    referred to at [54] and was entitled to rely upon that.  The panel also
    were entitled to take into account what he had done since release  from
    custody and that there was no evidence  of  a  breach  of  the  licence
    conditions  nor  had  he  breached  any  bail  conditions.  Mr  McKenna
    submitted  that  evidence  in  the   bundle   showed   the   level   of
    rehabilitation that the Appellant was undergoing and that he  had  used
    the time in custody to get off drugs and the panel  accepted  from  the
    evidence that they had heard and read that he had made  efforts  to  be
    drug-free, relying on paragraphs [6], [8] and  the  evidence  from  the
    Appellant's father at [9].

12. As to Article 8, Mr McKenna submitted that it was open to the judge  to
    rely on  the  findings  of  fact  made  in  the  earlier  part  of  the
    determination to demonstrate that removal would be disproportionate and
    that, whilst Section 117 had not been  expressly  taken  into  account,
    those provisions were implicit in the determination.  He invited us  to
    uphold the determination.

13. We reserved our determination.

Conclusions:

14. There are two written grounds relied upon by the  Secretary  of  State;
    firstly, that the judge made a material misdirection of law when giving
    weight to his prospects of rehabilitation  when  the  Appellant  was  a
    national of Mozambique and not an EEA national, secondly that the panel
    failed to give weight to material matters  and  that  in  allowing  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds the panel failed to consider the provisions
    of Section 117A D (in  accordance  with  the  decision  of  Badewa  (as
    cited).

15. Mr Whitwell on behalf of the Secretary of State made  oral  submissions
    in relation to ground 1 but did not seek to enlarge upon  or  otherwise
    engage with ground 2.  Insofar as that ground is concerned, the written
    grounds do not expressly refer to the legal test set out in  Regulation
    21(5)(c), but assert that the panel did not give adequate consideration
    of the evidence relating to the issue of reoffending.

16. In our judgment, it is necessary to reach  a  conclusion  on  ground  2
    before  considering  ground  1  as  it  is  plain  from  the   relevant
    Regulations that, if the panel concluded that Regulation  21(5)(c)  was
    not met then in the light  of  the  decision  of  MC  (Essa  principles
    recast) [2015] UKUT 520 at [29], it is only if the personal conduct  of
    the person concerned is found  to  represent  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society (Regulation 21(5)(c)) that it becomes relevant  to  consider
    whether the decision is  proportionate  taking  into  account  all  the
    considerations identified in Regulation  21(5)  -  (6).   It  therefore
    follows that  if  the  conclusions  the  panel  reached  on  Regulation
    21(5)(c) were open to them upon the evidence  and  they  properly  took
    into account the relevant considerations, then ground 1 is not material
    to the outcome of the appeal.

17. We have therefore considered ground 2.   Whilst  the  Appellant  was  a
    national of Mozambique, the panel properly identified the nature of the
    appeal at [41] onwards and the acceptance by  the  Secretary  of  State
    that, by reason of the immigration history of this Appellant, he was  a
    family member of an EEA national. Consequently his case fell within the
    2006  Regulations  and  not  the  provisions  relating   to   automatic
    deportation of foreign criminals. As the decision to make a deportation
    order stated at [15], in the  light  of  his  immigration  history  the
    Appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence  under  the  2006
    Regulations and thus consideration was given to whether his deportation
    was justified on "serious grounds of public policy or public  security"
    to the intermediate level.

18. The panel set out the Secretary  of  State's  view  at  [47]  and  made
    reference to the public interests at play at [48] -  [50].   The  panel
    had previously set out the legal framework under the 2006  Regulations,
    setting out Regulations 19 and 21 and making specific reference to  the
    provisions of Regulation 21(5) and (6).  In addressing these issues the
    panel identified that the "central decision in the  case"  was  whether
    the Appellant represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests  of  society.   (See
    [51]).

19. Therefore Regulation 21 was central  to  the  appeal  and,  so  far  as
    relevant, provides as follows:-

         "(1) In this regulation a 'relevant decision' means an EEA decision
             taken on the grounds of  public  policy,  public  security  or
             public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
             with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15 except
             on serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who -

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision ...

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
             or public security it shall, in addition to complying with the
             preceding  paragraphs  of  this  regulation,   be   taken   in
             accordance with the following principles -

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
                  proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
                  conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                  represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
             resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker  must  take
             account of considerations such as the age,  state  of  health,
             family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the  person's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, the person's social
             and cultural integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
             extent of the person's links with his country of origin."

20. As the Appellant is a family member of an EEA national, his deportation
    must comply with the  requirements  of  the  2006  Regulations  and  in
    particular, Regulation 21.  The Secretary  of  State  set  out  in  the
    decision letter that he had established a right of permanent  residence
    in the United Kingdom and therefore the heightened level of  protection
    in Regulation 21(3) which required proof of "serious grounds of  public
    policy" applied.

21. Regulation 21(5)(c) requires the personal conduct  of  the  prospective
    deportee to represent a  "genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of  the  fundamental  interests  of  society."   A
    "threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society" means  a
    threat to do something prohibited by law (see GW  (Netherlands)  [2009]
    UKAIT  00050).   In  order  to  represent  a  "genuine,   present   and
    sufficiently serious threat" it is necessary to establish a future risk
    of reoffending and an assessment is required as to how likely it is  an
    offender will reoffend and the nature and seriousness of such offences.
     It is only if there is such a future  risk  that  an  individual  will
    present  a  "present"  threat.   Past  offending  may  be  relevant  in
    assessing future risk but the seriousness of the  past  conviction  and
    indeed the fact that he has a past conviction cannot in itself  justify
    the deportation of an EU national or a family member of an EU national,
    unlike the provisions that deal with non-EEA  foreign  criminals  under
    the automatic deportation provisions.

22. In this respect the panel made reference to the  evidence  before  them
    relating to the risk of reoffending and highlighted that the panel  had
    not been provided with any OASys report or probation reports  and  that
    there was "no indication that the Home Office has undertaken their  own
    professional assessment of the Appellant's own risk of reoffending" (At
    [53]).  The panel then  turned  to  the  only  professional  assessment
    before them consisting of a letter/report from the Appellant's  current
    supervising probation officer and set out the contents of  that  letter
    in its entirety at [54] which made reference to  the  Appellant  having
    been currently assessed as a low risk of reoffending but a medium  risk
    of serious harm to the public due to the nature of the  index  offence.
    The report went on to set out that he had  complied  with  his  licence
    conditions and had attended all appointments and was currently  engaged
    in the TSP (a Thinking Skills Programme) and had not  further  offended
    since his release.

23. The panel  went  on  to  state  that  they  accepted  the  professional
    assessment provided by the Appellant's  supervising  probation  officer
    and found him to pose a low risk of reoffending.  As this was the  only
    evidence from the Probation Service before the panel concerning risk of
    reoffending, it was wholly open  to  the  panel  to  place  weight  and
    reliance upon it (see AM v The SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 10 and The  SSHD  v
    Vasconcelos [2013] UKUT  0678).   The  grounds  do  not  challenge  the
    panel's findings on the probation officer's report or the  weight  they
    were entitled to place on such a report when considering the test under
    Regulation 21(5)(c).

24. As Mr McKenna submitted, the panel had the  advantage  of  hearing  the
    oral evidence of the Appellant, and  the  witnesses  who  included  his
    parents and girlfriend.  At [56] and [68] the panel made  reference  to
    that evidence, which they found to be  credible  and  upon  which  they
    placed  reliance  and  weight.   At  [56]  the  panel  considered   the
    Appellant's contention that he  had  now  indicated  a  willingness  to
    change his ways and that this had been  supported  (by  the  witnesses)
    that he had now matured.  In this respect, the findings at  [56],  [57]
    and [68] should be read together.  Whilst the grounds  assert  at  [16]
    that the Appellant claimed that his drug use caused him to offend, that
    ignores the panel's findings  as  to  his  present  circumstances,  his
    behaviour, conduct and motivation and that there was no  evidence  that
    he had taken drugs either whilst in custody or subsequently.  The panel
    accepted the Appellant's evidence set out  at  [6]  and  there  was  no
    evidence of any drug-taking before the panel.  Furthermore,  the  panel
    accepted and found that the Appellant wished to live a  drug-free  life
    and the panel found that he had a strong desire to remain in the UK and
    this was an inducement to remain drug-free and also crime-free.

25. At [68] the panel placed weight and reliance upon the continued support
    of his girlfriend, family members and the Probation Service  whom  they
    found would significantly reduce the risk of  reoffending.  They  found
    that the threat he represented was undermined to a significant  degree.
    Thus at [73] they reached the overall conclusion that it had  not  been
    established that the Appellant  represented  a  "genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the public" to justify  his  deportation
    on the grounds of public policy. The conclusion at [74]  was  that  the
    Respondent  had not established  that  his  deportation  was  justified
    under Regulation 21.

26. The grounds also assert at paragraphs 13 to 15 that the panel  did  not
    properly consider the circumstances of the crimes committed.   In  this
    respect in  reaching  an  assessment  under  Regulation  21(5)(c)  past
    offending may be relevant to the assessment  of  future  risk  but  the
    seriousness of  the  past  conviction  cannot  in  itself  justify  the
    deportation of an EU national (or family member of an  EU  national  as
    this Appellant is) unlike the provisions that apply to the  deportation
    of non-EEA foreign criminals.

27. Under the EEA Regulations, the panel  were  required  to  consider  the
    relevant personal conduct of the Appellant, that  is,  the  Appellant's
    criminal offending, and  did  so  at  [36  -  40]  and  also  in  their
    conclusions reached at [70 - 72].  The panel  were  plainly  aware  and
    treated  this  offence  as  a  serious  one  as  demonstrated  by   the
    circumstances of the offence and the length of the  sentence  that  was
    ultimately imposed.  Whilst the grounds make reference at paragraph  14
    to the victim who had died from injuries inflicted in the robbery, that
    that fails to take into account the basis  upon  which  the  Sentencing
    Judge expressly  dealt  with  the  Appellant  at  paragraph  5  of  the
    sentencing remarks, which  was  for  an  offence  of  robbery  and  not
    manslaughter, a offence for which he was acquitted.

28. Nor do we find the grounds at 15 adequately reflect the evidence before
    the panel that the Appellant had failed to  accept  responsibility  for
    the crime when giving  evidence  before  them.   When  considering  the
    circumstances of the offence at [69] the panel took into  account  that
    the offence was not  pre-planned  and  there  was  no  suggestion  that
    offensive weapons were involved although there was the use of  the  car
    that led to the victim's injuries resulting in his death but  noted  in
    this context  that  the  Appellant  was  acquitted  of  the  charge  of
    manslaughter.  At [70] they took into account that this was not part of
    a series of offences or that the  Appellant  has  significant  previous
    offences of a similar nature.  They  took  into  account  his  plea  of
    guilty to the charge of robbery and that  the  level  of  offending  as
    considered  by  the  Sentencing  Judge,  whilst  passing  the   custody
    threshold, was not one which demonstrated an  offending  pattern  which
    "shows a propensity to commit serious  violent  crime".   At  [72]  the
    panel took into account that he had a previous conviction for theft and
    the second (and far more serious) of robbery.  The  panel  found  "that
    there is no clear pattern of serious offending by  the  Appellant.   He
    has not indulged in a series of crimes that may  endanger  the  general
    public or criminal conduct that may endanger the economic wellbeing  of
    the UK."

29. Consequently we do  not  consider  that  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    demonstrated that the panel erred  in  the  conclusions  reached  under
    Regulation 21(5)(c) as set out at [70], [73] and [74.]  Contrary to the
    grounds, the panel, who had the advantage of hearing and assessing  the
    oral evidence before them reached conclusions that were  open  to  them
    properly on the evidence that was before them.

30. As stated in the decision of Essa  (rehabilitation/integration)  [2013]
    UKUT 316 at [32]:-

         "We observe that for any deportation  of  an  EEA  national  to  be
         justified on public good grounds (irrespective of whether permanent
         residence has been achieved) the claimant must represent a  present
         threat to public policy.  The fact of a criminal conviction is  not
         enough.  It is not permissible in an EEA case to deport a  claimant
         on the basis of criminal offending simply to  deter  others.   This
         tends to mean, in case of criminal convictions short  of  the  most
         serious threats to the public safety of the state, that a candidate
         for EEA deportation must represent a present threat by reason of  a
         propensity to  re-offend  or  an  unacceptably  high  risk  of  re-
         offending.  In such a case, if  there  is  acceptable  evidence  of
         rehabilitation, the prospects of future rehabilitation do not enter
         the balance, save possibly as future protective factors  to  ensure
         that the rehabilitation remains durable."

31. On the findings of fact and the panel's  assessment  of  the  evidence,
    they did not find the Appellant to be someone  who  could  properly  be
    described as having "a propensity" to commit further such offences. Nor
    could it be said that there was an  "unacceptably  high"  risk  of  the
    Appellant reoffending such as he would present a "genuine, present  and
    sufficiently  serious  threat"  which  is  required  under   Regulation
    21(5)(c) of the Regulations. The public policy grounds for  removal  is
    an exception to the fundamental principles of the free exercise  of  EU
    rights and as such an EU citizen  (or  family  member)  should  not  be
    expelled as a deterrent to others without the personal conduct  of  the
    person concerned giving rise to consider  that  he  will  commit  other
    offences that are against the public policy of the state.   Furthermore
    it is accepted and acknowledged by both advocates that the  appellant's
    deportation could not be justified simply on the basis of his  previous
    criminal conviction, even of such a serious nature  as  an  offence  of
    robbery and the imposition of the sentence he received. This is because
    the legal regime for  deporting  EU  criminals  is  different  and  can
    properly described as more restrictive than that for  foreign  national
    criminals under the UK Borders Act 2007.  It must be  established  that
    the Appellant represents "a genuine, present  or  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society".  In this
    context the future risk of reoffending was considered in the  light  of
    his conduct and the grounds of the Secretary  of  State  are  simply  a
    disagreement with the findings of fact reached by the  panel  on  their
    assessment of the evidence, both oral and documentary.  It was open  to
    the panel to reach a favourable view of the Appellant and his witnesses
    and for this to be considered in the light of the Appellant's offending
    history, and the probation officer's recent report.  It  was  therefore
    open to the panel to reach their conclusions under Regulation 21(5)(c).

32. In summary, the findings of the panel were that there were  no  serious
    grounds of public security to justify  the  removal  of  the  Appellant
    because he was not a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.  For the reasons
    we have given, they were sustainable findings that they  were  entitled
    to  make  on  the  evidence  before  them.   Plainly,   in   terms   of
    proportionality, the assessment following the primary findings have the
    inevitable consequence of the decision being  disproportionate,  having
    found that his removal could not be justified.

33. In the light of our conclusions as to ground 2, it  is  unnecessary  to
    consider ground 1. However, we consider that whilst the panel  appeared
    to  give  consideration  to  the  issue  of  future  rehabilitation  by
    reference to Mozambique and the lack of links to that country,  we  are
    not satisfied that the panel, by reference  to  future  rehabilitation,
    was engaging in the reasoning set out at paragraph 49 of SE (Zimbabwe).



34. Furthermore, in the  light  of  the  panel's  finding  that  Regulation
    21(5)(c) was not met, the  panel  allowed  the  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations and therefore they were not required to consider Article 8.
    Thus any failure to consider the statutory factors of  Section  117  in
    relation to Article 8 are immaterial to the outcome reached.
