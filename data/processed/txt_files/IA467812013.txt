                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, whose date of birth  is  recorded
   as 1 January 1978.   On 22 May 2013, through his  solicitors,  he  sought
   further leave to remain on the basis of his family and  private  life  in
   the UK.  The respondent refused that application by letter of 21  October
   2013, which says at page 1:

    You were last granted discretionary leave on 28 November  2012  on  the
    basis  of  ongoing  family  proceedings  in  Kirkcaldy  Sheriff   Court
    regarding your children.  These proceedings concluded on  30  September
    2013 with a determination that you were not to be  granted  any  access
    rights to your 3 children.


    ... The Sheriff ... concluded that  "[Mr  Mehmood's]  desire  to  avoid
    deportation is the  primary  reason  why  he  seeks  contact  with  his
    children."  As the circumstances under  which  you  were  last  granted
    discretionary leave no longer persist  and  the  proceedings  concluded
    with you gaining no further access  to  your  children  you  have  been
    refused further discretionary leave.


2) The respondent went on to refuse  leave  under  reference  to  the  Rules
   regarding leave as a parent and in terms of private life,  and  found  no
   exceptional circumstances which would warrant consideration  outside  the
   requirements of the Rules in relation to Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   The
   appellant was also served with a removal decision.

3) The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  on  the  grounds  that
   the  respondent's  decision  was  "contrary  to  the  Immigration  Rules,
   contrary to law, and inconsistent with Article 8 of the ECHR".

4) First-tier Tribunal Judge Scobbie dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
   determination promulgated on 27  January  2014,  his  findings  being  as
   follows:

       24. The appellant painted a picture of being  a  loving  father  ...
           unfortunately from his point of view the very full Sheriff Court
           decision ... paints  a  completely  different  picture  ...  the
           appellant is painted to be untrustworthy, untruthful and  not  a
           good father  ...  the  Sheriff  is  extremely  critical  of  the
           appellant and concludes that his only interest in  his  children
           is as a means of avoiding removal from the UK.


       25. Given the very full report of the Sheriff I did not  think  that
           it matters that the appellant was not represented.  The decision
           was compiled after a long hearing and evidence from a number  of
           sources.  It is perfectly clear that the  appellant  is  legally
           denied contact with his children ...  I  find  it  difficult  to
           believe any further action at this time would be successful.

       26. I did not believe the appellant's evidence.  I  do  not  believe
           that he still sees his children, at least not with  the  consent
           of their mother.  It may be that he attends parents' evenings at
           school but I have little doubt that he does so in a  pursuit  of
           his wish to stay in the UK.

       27. With regard to the indication  that  he  is  father  of  another
           child, there is evidence that a  firm  of  solicitors  had  been
           approached with regard to him obtaining  access  to  the  child.
           However, it is perfectly clear from a  letter  marked  as  "gone
           away" that the appellant does not even know where the mother  of
           the child is and certainly even by his own evidence  the  mother
           of the child does not wish him to have contact.

       28. I did not accept that the appellant plays any part in the  lives
           of any of his children.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  basis  for
           continuing discretionary leave.

5) These are the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal:

          1. Judge Scobbie failed to apply ... MS (Ivory Coast) [2007]  EWCA
             Civ 133 indicating that where a parent is pursuing contact that
             forms the basis for further extension  of  discretionary  leave
             until the termination of the contact hearing.  The  appellant's
             family law solicitors  provided  a  letter  confirming  that  a
             minute of variation will be lodged in view of the fact that the
             appellant continues to have contact with his children.  Further
             there were two letters from the  appellant's  other  solicitors
             confirming that they are awaiting grant of legal aid  in  order
             to raise an action for contact in respect of the other child of
             the appellant from a different relationship ...  The  appellant
             has outstanding family law proceedings and ... dismissal of his
             immigration appeal ... is a disproportionate interference  with
             the appellant's Article 8 rights.


          2. ... The judge erred in law in his findings at paragraph 25  ...
             speculating as to the chances of  success  in  respect  of  the
             appellant's contact action ... In coming to this conclusion the
             judge is making a decision that is not open to him  in  respect
             of the appellant's family contact proceedings.

6) Further to the grounds of appeal, Mr  Ndubuisi  said  that  although  the
   appellant's action failed in the Sheriff Court, as at  the  date  of  the
   hearing in the First-tier Tribunal the evidence was that he was seeking a
   variation in respect of those 3 children,  and  that  he  was  initiating
   proceedings to pursue contact with a further child.  The judge failed  to
   identify the correct issue, which was  whether  there  were  any  ongoing
   proceedings and whether  these  engaged  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
   appellant.  He fell into speculation as to whether there was any prospect
   of success in the action relation to the fourth  child.   It  was  highly
   significant that the appellant had not been represented  at  the  Sheriff
   Court,  and  the  proceedings  there  had  therefore  been  unfair.   The
   respondent's policies required discretionary leave to be continued  until
   all possible  contact  proceedings  were  exhausted.   The  determination
   should be set aside for error of law.

7) As an additional  point,  Mr  Ndubuisi  said  that  the  judge  erred  by
   considering the appellant's case in relation to  the  Immigration  Rules,
   paragraph 276ADE, rather than in  relation  to  the  respondent's  policy
   where proceedings regarding children are in progress.

8) Responding to the error of  law  submission,  Mr  Mullen  said  that  the
   grounds were not directed to any failure to have regard to policy, but in
   any event the Tribunal was correct to look firstly at  the  law  and  the
   Rules rather than at policy.  The judge correctly based  his  conclusions
   on the facts then current, being that the appellant  had  comprehensively
   and very recently lost his case regarding the  children  in  terms  of  a
   judgment by the Sheriff rejecting any form of contact.   Judge  Scobbie's
   recital of the relevant matters and his factual  findings  were  not  and
   could not be challenged.  The evidence was not that  there  were  ongoing
   proceedings, but that the appellant had made a highly tentative  approach
   to solicitors with a view to seeking a variation.  Mr Mullen referred  to
   a letter dated  22  January  2014  from  JS  Grosset,  Solicitors,  Leven
   (instructed by the appellant in relation to the contact proceedings) sent
   to Drummond Miller (his solicitors in  these  proceedings).   The  letter
   makes it plain that the involvement of his solicitors is at a very  early
   stage, and that to take the matter back to court so soon after an adverse
   decision  following  the  proof  would  require  showing  a   change   of
   circumstances.  The letter continues "Mr Mehmood claims that the children
   or at least two of them still see him occasionally on an informal  basis"
   (Mr Mullen's emphasis).  Legal aid had not been applied for and no minute
   of variation had been lodged.  Although the judge did not refer  to  that
   letter directly he did not have to rehearse every item of evidence before
   him and it was part of the underpinning of his conclusion that there were
   no likely prospects of success in any new action.  That was derived  from
   the evidence presented by the appellant himself.  It was difficult to see
   how any judge could reasonably  have  concluded  otherwise.   As  to  the
   fourth child (or alleged fourth child) paragraph  27  was  sufficient  to
   explain why the proposal for contact  in  that  respect  was  also  going
   nowhere.

9) Mr Ndubuisi in response said that the appellant had taken all  the  steps
   that he could in relation to the first 3 children, and that the judge was
   not entitled to conclude that there were no merit in his proceedings  and
   no likely prospects of success.  As to the fourth child, it was shown  by
   items at pages 112 and 113 of his productions in the First-tier  Tribunal
   that he had consulted solicitors (another firm) and legal  aid  had  been
   obtained.

10) Mr Ndubuisi indicated that if error of law were to  be  found  he  would
   seek admission of updating evidence.  Mr Mullen indicated that  he  would
   seek admission of evidence casting doubt on the  appellant's  allegations
   regarding any change of circumstances  in  relation  to  the  appellant's
   contact with his older children, and the reliability  of  his  allegation
   that he had some ongoing contact.  Each party agreed to admission of  the
   additional evidence from the other, if further hearing was required.   As
   there was no time to undertake hearing of evidence on 14 May 2014, unless
   at the expense of other cases, I reserved my determination at that stage.



11) The appellant has not shown that case law or the  respondent's  policies
   require that an appellant who wishes contact with children is entitled to
   remain in the UK until matters are  resolved  beyond  all  further  legal
   resort.  Proceedings in relation to children  and  contact  are  probably
   never beyond being visited upon change of circumstances,  but  that  does
   not mean that an appellant is entitled  to  prolong  discretionary  leave
   simply by saying that he proposes to revert to the court.  Removal  while
   an  application  for  contact  is  outstanding  may  often  amount  to  a
   disproportionate interference with Article 8 rights, but like all Article
   8 issues, this must ultimately depend on the facts and  circumstances  of
   the particular case.

12) The appellant came out very badly from the Sheriff  Court  decision.  Mr
   Ndubuisi did not support his submission that  absence  of  representation
   meant that  the  proceedings  there  were  automatically  unfair  to  the
   appellant by any reference to authority.  The submission implies a severe
   criticism of the Sheriff.  I do not find it to be sound.   The First-tier
   Tribunal Judge  was  entitled  to  rely  heavily  on  the  Sheriff  Court
   decision.  If not bound to do so, departure would at least have  required
   some strong evidence pointing another way.  There was none.

13) The First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to come to  an  adverse  view
   of the appellant as a witness, and there are no grounds directed  against
   his findings in that respect.

14) There was nothing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to  suggest  any
   meaningful change of circumstances in relation to the 3  older  children,
   and I am not persuaded that there is any error of law in the  conclusions
   reached by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  (It is  not  necessary  to  go
   further than that for present purposes, but in relation to these children
   it would have been surprising and perhaps even perverse for any judge  to
   have concluded otherwise.)

15) The only point which gives me pause is in relation to the fourth  child,
   or alleged child, of the appellant.  Paragraph 27 of the determination by
   itself seems adequate to explain  why  the  matter  was  not  thought  to
   justify the appellant remaining in the  UK.   The  judge  says  that  the
   appellant did not know where the mother of the child was, and she did not
   wish him to have any contact.  He might even have gone further  and  said
   that in the context of the other findings  and  the  mother's  denial  of
   paternity he did not accept on balance that the child is the appellant's.
    While the issue is not well focused in the grounds of appeal it  emerged
   eventually on 14 May 2014 that at the date  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   hearing the appellant had  obtained  legal  aid  for  an  action  seeking
   declarator  of  parentage,   contact,   and   a   parental   rights   and
   responsibilities order.  Page 113 is a letter from the Scottish Legal Aid
   Board dated 8 January 2014 acknowledging the appellant's application  and
   page 2 is a letter dated 9 January 2014 from his solicitors advising that
   legal aid has been approved and asking him to make a further appointment.
    That takes him further than paragraph 27 of the determination suggests.

16) On the other hand, it does not appear that the  appellant  provided  the
   First-tier Tribunal with any further meaningful  information  about  this
   child.  I was not referred to anything in  the  evidence  which  provides
   even a gender, name or date of birth or which suggests that  (apart  from
   alleged parentage) the appellant has had any contact with  the  child  at
   all.  In relation to his older 3 children the Sheriff found in fact  that
   it would be not conducive to their  welfare  to  have  contact  with  the
   appellant (� 5 of his judgment).  The Sheriff went on  to  say  that  the
   children required to be protected from abuse or risk of abuse on the part
   of the appellant, and that their need to be protected would not be served
   by the grant of an order for contact in his favour (� 71).

17) To conclude, like the Sheriff, that  the  appellant's  desire  to  avoid
   removal is the primary reason why he seeks contact with his  children  is
   far from speculative; rather, it is much more likely than  not.   Looking
   at the determination as a whole and at the underlying evidence, I see  no
   error such as to entitle or require the Upper Tribunal to interfere  with
   the First-tier Tribunal judge's findings that the appellant plays no part
   in the lives of any of his children and that there is no basis  on  which
   he should have continuing discretionary leave.

18) The appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.    The
   determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
