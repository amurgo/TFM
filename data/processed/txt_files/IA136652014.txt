Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr R Subramanian, instructed by Lambeth Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Nkiruka Mary Okoye, date of birth 29.9.77, is a  citizen
    of Nigeria.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blair promulgated 22.8.14, dismissing her appeal against  the  decision
    of the respondent, dated 1.3.14, to  refuse  her  application  made  on
    19.12.13 for an EEA residence card as confirmation of a right to reside
    in the UK pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. The Judge
    dealt with the appeal on the papers on 15.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Ransley  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 27.11.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Blair should be set aside.

 6. In summary, the grounds submit as follows:

      a) That the judge erred in law by failing to make  clear  findings  on
         the credibility issues raised by the respondent regarding  the  EEA
         sponsor's employment  documents.  At  �7  the  judge  recorded  the
         appellant's comments on those issues. Judge Ransley  considered  it
         arguable that the failure to make a ruling on those  issued  at  �8
         represents an arguable error of law;

      b) That the judge misdirected himself  in  law  in  finding  that  the
         sponsor needed to show evidence of exercising Treaty right  in  the
         UK for a period of five years. Judge Ransley considered it arguable
         that the judge's adverse findings at �9 and �11 that  there  was  a
         lack of evidence to show the sponsor  had  been  exercising  Treaty
         rights for 'the relevant' 5-year period in the UK to  represent  an
         error of law;

      c) That the judge failed  to  properly  assess  proportionality  under
         article 8. Judge Ransley noted that the decision made no  reference
         to article 8.

      d) That the judge was wrong to disregard the evidence of the sponsor's
         current work as a cleaner in a church. Judge  Ransley  stated  that
         contrary to the assertion, the judge at �10 to �11 did take account
         of the sponsor's job at the church.

 7. Judge Ransley considered that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    has  been  shown  to  involve  arguable  errors  of  law  and   stated,
    "permission is therefore  refused.  All  grounds  may  be  argued."  It
    appears to be common ground that Judge Ransley intended to  state  that
    permission was granted.

 8. For the following reasons, I find no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision  to
    be set aside and remade.

 9. At the outset of the hearing before me, Mr Subramanian conceded that as
    article 8 had not been raised in the grounds of appeal  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal or in any other submissions to  the  Tribunal.  Thus  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was not required to  address  it.  In  Sarkar
    [2014] EWCA Civ 195, the Court of Appeal held that even when Article  8
    is in the  grounds  of  appeal,  if  no  evidence  is  adduced  and  no
    submissions made the Appellant can be taken to have abandoned it  as  a
    ground of appeal and the Judge does not err in failing to deal with it.

10. In the circumstances, there is no merit in the ground  of  appeal  that
    the judge neglected to address article 8.

11. Very little evidence was submitted in relation to  employment  and  the
    exercise of Treaty rights. There was a  wage  slip  and  an  employment
    letter from November 2013. The respondent was unable  to  confirm  that
    the business was genuine and  noted  that  the  registered  office  was
    different to that given in  the  letter.  At  �8  the  judge  found  it
    difficult to know what to make about  the  respondent's  claim  or  the
    appellant's response to this  issue.  There  was  no  evidence  of  the
    registered address of the business. Thus the judge was unable to  reach
    any finding on this issue.

12. However, this was not a material issue, as by the date of  the  hearing
    before the judge, the sponsor had left that  employment,  on  30.12.13,
    and claimed to be working part-time at  a  church,  Christ  Embassy  in
    Hounslow, where he was paid in cash. At  �11,  the  judge  reached  the
    conclusion that there was no evidence of any substance that the sponsor
    had been working or otherwise exercising Treaty rights in the UK.

13. In order to  determine  whether  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  the
    residence  card,  the  judge  was  required  to  assess  the  situation
    prevailing at the date of the hearing; not whether the sponsor had been
    working at some stage in the past, though this was potentially relevant
    to the credibility of the sponsor's claim. There  was  precious  little
    evidence of employment at  the  church.  The  letter  in  support  from
    Alexander Adesope, who did not attend the appeal hearing,  states  that
    the sponsor works part-time as a cleaner in the church for  "about"  20
    hours every week. It does not state that he is in fact employed or even
    paid. There is no evidence of any HMRC or NI payments, or receipts,  or
    bank accounts to show the funds had been  received.  It  is  not  clear
    whether this is actual  employment  or  charitable  service,  which  is
    mentioned in the letter. In the circumstances, I find  that  the  judge
    was entirely correct to conclude that there was  insufficient  evidence
    that the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights in the UK.  He  may  well
    be, but the appellant has failed  to  produce  sufficient  evidence  to
    demonstrate it. In the circumstances, the appeal was doomed to failure.



14. In passing, I note that Mr Subramanian produced to me  the  case  Begum
    (EEA - worker - jobseeker) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275(IAC),  where  the
    Upper Tribunal held that,


       "When deciding whether an EEA national is a worker for the  purposes
       of the EEA Regulations, regard must be had to the fact that the term
       has a meaning in EU law, that it must  be  interpreted  broadly  and
       that it is not conditioned by the type of employment or  the  amount
       of income derived.  But a person who does not pursue  effective  and
       genuine activities, or pursues activities on such a small  scale  as
       to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary  or  which  have  no
       economic value to an employer, is not a worker.   In  this  context,
       regard must be given to the nature of  the  employment  relationship
       and the rights and duties of the person concerned to decide if  work
       activities are effective and genuine."


15. Whilst it was not considered  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  it
    appears to me that even if the sponsor is  employed  as  claimed,  such
    employment might well be regarded as no more than purely  marginal  and
    ancillary and thus not genuine employment so as to  qualify  him  under
    regulation 6.

16. The judge was entirely wrong  to  require  at  �9  that  the  appellant
    demonstrate that the sponsor had been exercising Treaty  rights  for  a
    period of five years. That only applies to an application for  a  right
    of permanent residence. All that is required for a  residence  card  is
    for the appellant to demonstrate that she is the family  member  of  an
    EEA national present and exercising Treaty rights in the UK so as to be
    a qualified person under regulation 6.

17. However, in the light of my other findings in respect of the grounds of
    appeal, set out above, I am not satisfied that  this  somewhat  serious
    error was in fact material to the outcome  of  the  appeal.  There  was
    insufficient evidence of employment, without which the appeal could not
    succeed.

Conclusion & Decision

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The appeal of the First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
