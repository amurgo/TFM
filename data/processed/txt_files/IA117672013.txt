For the Respondent:    Ms L Ong, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  (the
    Secretary of State) against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Lucas) sitting at Taylor House,  London  and  promulgated  on  9
    September 2013.

2.   The claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh.  He  appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of  State  dated  2
    April 2013 to refuse to grant him leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 General Student under paragraph 245ZX(b) of the Immigration
    Rules.  On 9 September 2013 the First-tier Tribunal upheld  the  appeal
    and directed that the Secretary of State "should grant him an extension
    of his Tier 4 status".  There was no appearance before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for the Secretary of State.

3.   The Secretary of State has now appealed against the decision and  leave
    was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  24  September  2013.   In
    essence the ground of appeal is that the claimant did  not  fulfil  the
    conditions in paragraph 245ZX(b) and accordingly it was an error of law
    for the Immigration Judge to direct the  continuation  of  his  Tier  4
    status.

4.   The claimant was granted Tier 4 status in the United  Kingdom  from  15
    September 2009 until 24 April 2011.  On 12 April 2011 he  submitted  an
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 General Student.  This  was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 11 May 2011 on the basis  that  he
    had not demonstrated that he had no less than ï¿½1,200 in a bank  account
    for a consecutive 28-day period preceding the date of the  application.
    So, while he was awarded 30 points for attributes, he was  not  awarded
    any points for maintenance (funds).  Accordingly he  had  not  met  the
    criteria in paragraph 245ZX(b) of the  Immigration  Rules.   On  appeal
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Cockrill agreed with the Secretary  of  State
    that he had not fulfilled the criteria.  However, he adjudged that  the
    claimant had developed a private life in this country  because  he  had
    been here perfectly regularly as a student since 2009.  He had obtained
    the Bachelor of Law degree from the University of London and was due to
    complete his LLM from John  Moores  University  Liverpool  in  December
    2011.  He had explained that he had passed all his examinations and was
    due to submit his  dissertation.   Accordingly,  while  the  appeal  in
    relation to the Immigration Rules was dismissed, it was  allowed  under
    human rights grounds (Article 8).

5.   Following that decision, on 8 September 2011  the  Secretary  of  State
    granted discretionary leave to remain until 14  March  2012.   On  this
    date the claimant applied for an extension  of  his  leave.   This  was
    refused on 4 July 2012.  The claimant appealed and it was listed for  a
    hearing on 17 September 2012.  On  that  day  the  Secretary  of  State
    withdrew the refusal decision and stated  that  she  would  review  the
    decision.  The result was the refusal dated 2 April 2013.

6.   The claimant does not meet the requirement  of  paragraph  245ZX(b)  of
    the Immigration Rules.  That appears to be acknowledged by Judge Lucas.
     However, he concluded that the situation the claimant finds himself in
    was grossly unfair and an administrative mess.  The claimant had at  no
    time asked for discretionary leave but yet because of this he  did  not
    qualify for Tier 4 status.  He reminded  himself  of  the  decision  in
    Naved (Student Fairness) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 001 IAC at  paragraph  17
    where it stated:

        "When a Judge finds that there is a duty to act  fairly  that  this
        has not been complied with in the particular circumstances of  this
        case, he or she can allow the appeal on the basis that the decision
        is not in accordance with the law".

    He concluded that this was such a situation and directed the  Secretary
    of State an extension [sic]  of  his  Tier  4  status  and  return  his
    passport immediately.






7.   The appeal must be allowed.  It is quite clear that the  claimant  does
    not fulfil the criteria in paragraph 245ZX(b) for an extension of  Tier
    4 status.  The  Immigration  Judge's  reason  for  ignoring  the  plain
    meaning of the Immigration Rules was  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.  However, Naved, which he relies upon, is  not
    authority for conferring on the First-tier Tribunal a discretion to re-
    make a decision which it believes to be grossly unfair.  The  issue  in
    Naved  was  the  operation  of  Section  85A(4)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which it was argued by the Secretary of
    State operated to prevent the First-tier Tribunal looking  at  material
    which was not before the Secretary of State.  There was no  dispute  in
    that instance that had the material been before the Secretary of  State
    the appellant would have been entitled to remain in the UK as a Tier  4
    student.  The Upper Tribunal concluded  that  in  the  very  particular
    circumstances of that case the duty to act fairly had not been complied
    with and on that basis allowed the appeal.  Crucially, and  unlike  the
    Immigration Judge in this case, the Upper Tribunal did not re-determine
    the case but decided that the decision was contrary to law  leaving  it
    to the Secretary of State to remake the decision.

8.   This case is very different.  There is  no  procedural  unfairness.   A
    decision has been taken in accordance with the Immigration Rules by the
    Secretary of State.  The claimant does not contend  that  he  has  been
    denied the opportunity of presenting evidence before the  Secretary  of
    State or indeed the First-tier Tribunal and he has had full  access  to
    the appeal procedure.

9.   Accordingly we allow the appeal on the basis that the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of  an  error  of  law  and  we
    therefore set it aside.  The decision falls to be  re-made.   We  heard
    evidence from the claimant and submissions from Ms Ong and Mr Kumal who
    also presented a bundle of papers in support of his appeal.   The  only
    ground on which an appeal against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State could be sustained is on human rights grounds, Article 8.

10.  The claimant  submitted  that  he  had  completed  his  degree  at  the
    University of London and Postgraduate training at John Moores Liverpool
    University.  He was now engaged in two educational courses, one at  the
    London School of Business and Finance for an ACCA and MBA.  This  is  a
    full-time course which he commenced in March 2012 and according to  his
    evidence is due to end in 2015.  Separately he is undertaking the part-
    time Bar Professional Training Course  at  BPP  University.   That  was
    commenced in September 2011 and was due to finish on 30 June  2013  but
    we were informed that the second year was deferred  for  a  year.   The
    finish date is now 2014.  He has paid full fees for one of  the  course
    and half of the fees for the other.  He has invested  a  good  deal  of
    both time and money in these courses.  This would be lost if he was now
    forced to return to Bangladesh.

11.  In cross-examination it was put to him that having failed to  get  Tier
    4 status in 2011 the proper course of action would have been to  return
    to Bangladesh and make a fresh  application  from  there.   His  answer
    appeared to be that this would cost  money  and  he  did  not  wish  to
    interrupt his studies to return  home  to  make  the  application.   He
    wished  an  opportunity   to   finish   his   studies.    The   further
    qualifications would enhance his earning power at home in Bangladesh.



12.  Mr Kumal for the claimant  pointed  to  the  documents  in  the  bundle
    confirming the claimant's attendance on the  educational  courses.   He
    pointed to the Secretary of State's refusal letters  of  4  July  2012,
    which was withdrawn, and 2 April 2013 which was in virtually  identical
    terms.  The appeal on 6  July  2011  had  been  granted  on  Article  8
    grounds.  Immigration Judge Lucas had found that the procedure  adopted
    by the Secretary of State was grossly unfair, it was not the claimant's
    fault that he had been granted discretionary leave,  the  Secretary  of
    State's position was a disproportionate interference in the  claimant's
    private life.

13.  Ms Ong for the Secretary of State submitted that  the  only  basis  for
    allowing an appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  was  on
    Article 8 grounds.  It was accepted that he had formed a private  life.
    She referred us to paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.   Clearly
    the claimant had not lived continuously in this country for  20  years.
    However she also accepted that the Secretary of  State  had  to  comply
    with Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   Accordingly  the  issue  was  one  of
    proportionality.  The fact was that  the  appellant  had  begun  a  new
    course without any certainty that he would be granted leave to  remain.
    He knew that he had only discretionary leave and specifically  that  he
    did not have Tier 4 status.  As such he must have known that  he  could
    not obtain Tier 4  status  while  he  remained  in  this  country  with
    discretionary leave.  The correct course would have been to  return  to
    Bangladesh and to have made a fresh application from there.

Discussion

   14. The claimant does not fall within the provisions of paragraph 276ADE
       of the immigration rules.  We have, therefore, proceeded to consider
       whether, nonetheless, his removal from the United Kingdom  would  be
       in breach of his protected rights pursuant to article 8 of the Human
       Rights Convention. In doing so, we have followed the five steps  set
       out in Razgar.

   15. We find that the appellant has not established a family life in this
       country, but we do accept that he has  established  a  private  life
       here. We accept that, in the circumstances, that  his  removal  will
       interfere with his right to respect for his private life, bearing in
       mind  the  low  threshold  applicable.   The  interference   is   in
       accordance with the law, and has the legitimate aim  of  maintaining
       immigration  control.   We   therefore   ask   ourselves   if   that
       interference is proportionate, bearing in mind is for the  Secretary
       of State to prove that.

   16. We accept that the claimant has now embarked on both a full-time and
       a part-time educational course.  He has clearly invested a good deal
       of time and money in these courses and we accept that this would  be
       lost  were  he  to  have  to  return  to  Bangladesh.   We  are  not
       unsympathetic to his position.  Nevertheless we do not consider that
       the   decision   of   the   Secretary   of   State   constitutes   a
       disproportionate interference in his private life.  Following on the
       decision of Judge Cockrill in July 2011 the Secretary of State  gave
       him discretionary leave to remain until he finished his  studies  on
       which he was then engaged.  At the time he was  engaged  on  an  LLM
       course at John Moores University Liverpool which was due to  end  in
       December 2011.  It was to enable to finish that  course  that  Judge
       Cockrill  allowed  the  appeal  under  human  rights   grounds   and
       presumably the Secretary of State granted discretionary leave on the
       same basis.  That did not entitle the claimant to take the view that
       he could start further educational courses and complete them without
       applying for Tier 4 status. To  do  so  he  required  to  return  to
       Bangladesh  and  make  a  fresh  application.   The  provisions   of
       paragraph 245ZX (b) have not changed since 2011;  they  have  always
       provided that to obtain leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  migrant,  an
       applicant had to have extant leave to remain or entry  clearance  in
       one of the listed categories which does  not  include  discretionary
       leave to remain.  We do not accept that he would  have  been  unduly
       prejudiced by doing so.  He informed us that  he  had  deferred  one
       year of one of his courses so it would have been perfectly  possible
       for him to have returned to Bangladesh in  order  to  make  such  an
       application.  In any event that was what  was  required  of  him  in
       order to comply with the Rules.

Summary

15.  We allow the appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. We remake the decision by refusing
    the claimant's appeal on all grounds .
