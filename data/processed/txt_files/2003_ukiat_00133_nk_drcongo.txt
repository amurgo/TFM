   Centre)
For the respondent:    Miss N Hough


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal  by  the  Home  Office  against  the  decision  of  an
   adjudicator, Mrs N Bircher, sitting at North Shields on 24  April  2003,
   allowing an appeal by a citizen of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo
   against the grant of only limited leave to remain in this country.

2. The issues raised in the grounds of appeal  are  essentially  two.   The
   first relates to a document produced for the first time by the appellant
   in cross-examination, and the second to a report by her  GP,  which  was
   relied on to establish that she was suffering from post traumatic stress
   disorder.  We  need  to  deal  first  with  ground  1,  because  if  the
   adjudicator was wrong in what she did about that  document,  there  will
   clearly need to be a fresh hearing.

3. The adjudicator deals with it as follows, at paragraph 15:

   In cross-examination she produced a letter which confirmed that she  was
   a member of the UDPS.

      Clearly that was the first time this document had been seen by  either
   the adjudicator or the presenting officer.  The grounds of  appeal  cite
   objections made by the presenting officer  to  its  production  at  that
   point and Mr O'Ryan, who appeared for the claimant at the hearing before
   the adjudicator  as  he  has  done  before  us,  helpfully  agreed  that
   objections had been made.

4. The production of documents at or shortly before  the  hearing  has  long
   bedevilled asylum appeals.  While everyone would wish to  encourage  both
   adjudicators and presenting officers to allow appeals to be dealt with on
   their merits and on all the known facts on the day when they  are  listed
   for  hearing,  adjudicators  must  recognise  that  late  production   of
   documents may cause genuine difficulties.  If objections are  made,  then
   they must be recorded, together with the reasons for over-ruling them, if
   that is done.

5. The adjudicator went on to deal with the  effects  of  that  document  at
   paragraph 23.

   The Secretary of State noted that the  appellant  has  not  provided  any
   evidence that the  appellant  has  taken  a  prominent  role  as  section
   President UDPS.  I find that the appellant has  subsequently  produced  a
   certificate from the UDPS confirming that she held the post of  President
   of the Women's Movement within the Party.

6. The document which was actually produced at the hearing was  the  one  in
   French which appears at page 30 of the claimant's bundle.  It is on  what
   appears to be the headed writing paper of the UDPS in Katanga, and it  is
   recorded as having been signed at Lubumbashi on 11 August 2002.  As  Miss
   Hough has pointed out, the bottom of that document shows what appears  to
   be a record of electronic transmission as early as 16 September 2002,  so
   there is no question but that it  could  have  been  properly  filed  and
   served in good time in advance of the hearing before the adjudicator.

7. What actually happened, following its production during the hearing,  was
   that  the  adjudicator  had  it  informally  translated  by   the   Court
   interpreter.  There is nothing wrong with that procedure, so long as  the
   other side has had a proper opportunity to deal with the contents,  which
   in this case did not happen.

8. The next thing that happened was the adjudicator gave further time for  a
   written translation to be submitted.  That was done, and  it  was  before
   the adjudicator when she wrote her decision; but it was never  sent,  and
   again Mr O'Ryan has helpfully confirmed that, to the presenting  officer.
   That  was  a  mistake,  for  which  the  adjudicator  has  to  bear   the
   responsibility: it is elementary that any  evidence  received  after  the
   hearing must be communicated to the other party  for  an  opportunity  at
   least to comment on it.

9. Mr O'Ryan has argued that in reality  this  document  did  not  make  any
   great difference to the adjudicator's resolution of the  issues  in  this
   case.  He has suggested that there was no real issue on credibility taken
   by the Home Office in paragraphs 5 and 6 of  their  refusal  letter.   We
   disagree.   Paragraph  5  clearly  challenged,  in  the  absence  of  any
   documentary evidence, the appellant's claim to  have  taken  a  prominent
   role as Section President of the UDPS.   Paragraph  6  went  further  and
   pointed  out  that  there  were  grounds  for  doubting  the  appellant's
   credibility.  It may have been short on reasons but it  made  clear  what
   was challenged.

10. When the adjudicator made her decision, she accepted (at  paragraph  22)
   the appellant's credibility on her own history; but she went on to  state
   the issue taken by the Home Office in paragraph 5 of the refusal  letter,
   in the first sentence of her paragraph 23, and found  in  favour  of  the
   appellant in the next sentence, on the basis of the letter which had been
   produced during cross-examination.

11. In our view it is crystal clear in this case that  the  adjudicator  was
   deciding in favour of the claimant, at least to a significant extent,  on
   the basis of a document which was produced in circumstances where it  was
   unfair to the presenting officer and to  the  public  at  large  whom  he
   represented, to allow that  to  be  done  without  some  opportunity  for
   investigation.

12. It follows that there is no alternative  but  for  the  claimant's  oral
   evidence to be re-heard, with a proper opportunity for the Home Office to
   cross-examine her about the document from the UDPS.  That  will  have  to
   take place before another adjudicator who will also be able  to  consider
   the specialist medical evidence now filed  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,
   about which we say nothing.

13. The appeal is allowed with a direction for a fresh hearing (remitted  to
   another adjudicator, not to Mrs Bircher).

                                                                  (chairman)
