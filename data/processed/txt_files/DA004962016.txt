Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me  after  a  hearing  on  19  July  2017
    following which I decided that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") was to be set aside for error of law.  I include the  error  of
    law decision headed 'Decision and  Directions'  as  an  annex  to  this
    decision and to which reference should be made for the full  background
    to the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 2. However, it is as well at this point to reproduce  some  paragraphs  of
    the error of law decision  to  put  this,  my  further  decision,  into
    context.  Thus, at [2] - [12] I said as follows:

         "2.  The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania,  born  in  1976.   He
             arrived illegally in the UK in 1999, either in March according
             to the appellant, or September according to the respondent.  A
             decision to make a deportation order against him was  made  on
             22 September 2016 as a result of his conviction  on  26  April
             2013 for an offence of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue,
             for which he received a sentence of  six  and  a  half  years'
             imprisonment. The decision to deport was made  with  reference
             to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
             (as amended) ("the EEA Regulations").

         3.   The appeal under the EEA Regulations was certified pursuant to
             reg 24AA. The human rights appeal was  certified  pursuant  to
             s.94B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
             ("the 2002 Act").

         4.   The appellant's appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
             Osborne ("the FtJ") on  12  January  2017,  resulting  in  the
             appeal being allowed, both under the EEA Regulations and under
             Article 8 of the ECHR.

         5.   Permission to appeal against the FtJ's decision was granted on
             the  basis  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  FtJ  erred  in
             concluding that the appellant had acquired 10 years' residence
             in the UK, and in failing to take into account the significant
             public interest in the deportation of  the  appellant  in  the
             light of  the  fact  that  he  was  convicted  of  an  offence
             involving a  conspiracy  to  cheat  the  public  out  of  �2.3
             million.

         6.   In pursuance  of  the  deportation  order  the  appellant  was
             removed from the UK on 17 December 2016 but returned illegally
             on 7 January 2017,  without  having  made  an  application  to
             return pursuant to reg  29AA,  and  he  was  present  for  his
             appeal. The FtJ stated at [6] that  "on  the  basis  that  the
             Appellant had taken the trouble to travel  from  Lithuania  to
             the UK for the specific purpose, I had no wish  or  reason  to
             deny him  the  opportunity  of  giving  evidence  in  his  own
             appeal".

         7.   The appeal was first listed before me on 24 April  2017.   The
             appellant was not represented. I adjourned the hearing for the
             respondent to consider whether  the  appellant's  illegal  re-
             entry to the UK invalidated the appeal  before  the  FtT,  and
             also  to  consider  the  question  of  whether  it   was   the
             Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  that
             applied or the 2016 Regulations.

         8.   Mr Jarvis very helpfully provided a detailed and comprehensive
             skeleton argument setting out the respondent's position on the
             above points,  and  with  a  note  dated  18  July  2017  also
             considered the relevance of the decision of the Supreme  Court
             in Kiarie and Byndloss v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2017] UKSC 42. I consider  those  matters  further
             below. I should add that the respondent's written  submissions
             as contained in those documents were provided to the appellant
             in advance of the resumed hearing, a fact which  he  confirmed
             at the hearing.

             Further background to the deportation order

         9.   On 9 September 1999 the appellant claimed asylum  in  a  false
             name, claiming to be  a  national  of  Belarus.  However,  the
             application for asylum was refused on non-compliance  grounds.
             There was a subsequent appeal but  it  was  dismissed  without
             substantive consideration.

         10.  On 28 May 2002 the appellant was convicted of  an  offence  of
             indecent assault for which he received a conditional discharge
             and ordered to pay compensation of �250.

         11.   The  offence  which  prompted  the  decision  to  deport  the
             appellant was one of conspiracy to cheat the  public  revenue,
             as detailed above. The  sentencing  remarks  reveal  that  the
             offence involved the  making  of  fraudulent  claims  for  tax
             rebates. The two main methods were that workers, predominantly
             from Poland, were tricked into  answering  advertisements  for
             jobs in newspapers and other places. The jobs were  fictitious
             and the applicants were  tricked  into  providing  information
             such as their  national  insurance  numbers,  tax  references,
             dates of birth and so forth.

         12.  The female telephone operators who  received  the  information
             were, on the whole, illegal immigrants in the  UK.  About  200
             bank  accounts  were  opened  as  part  of   the   conspiracy.
             Fraudulent claims for tax rebates were made over a  five  year
             period, amounting to �2.3 million. Many of  the  false  claims
             were identified by Revenue  and  Customs  and  so  the  actual
             payments amounted to about �658,000. The appellant  was  found
             by the sentencing judge to have been fully aware of the extent
             of the organisation and its workings."

 3. It is evident from the error of law decision therefore,  that  the  re-
    making of the decision involves a reassessment of the extent  to  which
    the appellant is entitled to resist deportation under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations"),  and
    the level of  protection,  if  any,  afforded  to  him  under  the  EEA
    Regulations against the deportation decision.  To  that  end,  I  heard
    further evidence from the appellant.

    Oral evidence and submissions

 4. The appellant had the assistance of a Russian interpreter but confirmed
    that he would only need the assistance of the interpreter if there were
    any matters that he did not understand or if he felt unable to  express
    himself in English. In fact, he gave all of  his  evidence  in  English
    without apparent difficulty.

 5. As to why he should not be deported from the  UK,  the  appellant  said
    that he relied on the explanations he had  previously  given.   He  had
    been in the UK for about 20 years.  He said  that  was  sorry  for  the
    offences he had committed.

 6. He came to the UK in March  1999  with  his  Lithuanian  passport.   He
    registered with the Home Office when he came  back  from  Lithuania  in
    August 2004.  He moved to Worthing and did work buying and selling.  He
    never knew about the need to register with the Home Office.

 7. It was true that previously he had said that he paid �60 or �80 in 2006
    to the Home Office in order to register as a worker.   He  had  started
    looking for a job with agencies and they said  he  needed  to  register
    with the Home Office.  They gave him about a month to do that.  He paid
    �60 to the Home Office and showed the registration paper to the agency.
     He does not have that document  now.   When  he  came  out  of  prison
    everything was lost.   Not  every  agency  required  registration,  and
    everything was new for everyone.  In 2009  there  was  no  registration
    regime anymore.

 8. It was true that he had claimed asylum as a national  of  Belarus.   He
    did not speak English at the time.  As soon as he got  permission  from
    the Home Office he worked.  He registered for  work  as  a  Lithuanian.
    When he came back to the UK in 2004 he never  used  the  name  Sluzbyn,
    that he had previously used.  He used his correct name and nationality.



 9. As to the suggestion by the Secretary  of  State  that  he  may  commit
    further offences, he said that he had had enough of that last time.  He
    had lost almost everything.

10. His daughter lives in Southampton and he is still in  touch  with  her.
    He has now moved  to  Peterborough.   As  to  how  often  he  sees  his
    daughter, he tries to contact her by phone, because he could not  work.
    He is now working for Amazon and is due to start a  job  (on  Monday  5
    February 2018) as a bricklayer.

11. He lives with a woman called Nela  who  is  from  Latvia.   She  has  a
    daughter aged 9 and he would like to carry on  with  family  life  with
    them.  Nela knows about  his  case  and  almost  everything  about  his
    situation and his past.  As to whether he had asked her to  attend  the
    hearing today, his answer was "not really".  He has been with her since
    October 2017.  He thought that it would not be necessary  for  Nela  to
    come to the hearing with him because she has a daughter and there is no-
    one to look after her.

12. In cross-examination he said that he did not ask  Nela  to  attend  the
    hearing today but the last time, before the New Year, he had asked  her
    to attend the court.  They just decided that he would go  on  his  own.
    She is worried and keeps texting him  about  what  is  happening.   She
    loves him and wants to stay with him.  He had become friends  with  her
    daughter as well.

13. He had not asked her to write a letter about their relationship or  her
    feelings for him.  The fact is that  she  knows  about  his  situation.
    Even the probation officer  asked  about  that  and  whether  she  knew
    everything.

14. It was true that when he came back from Lithuania in 2004  he  paid  to
    register with the Home Office.  Otherwise he had no  contact  with  the
    Home Office.

15. He did not ask his daughter if she wanted  to  attend  the  hearing  to
    speak on his behalf.   She  went  last  time  and  she  had  written  a
    statement.  Now she is going to college.

16. As to why he could not use the skills he has obtained from  the  UK  to
    work in Lithuania, he said that he  does  not  see  himself  living  in
    Lithuania, having lived a long time in the UK.  He does not  know  what
    he would do there.  His Lithuanian is very poor.  It was true  that  he
    committed a crime, for which he is very sorry.  That crime  would  also
    prevent him from working in Lithuania.

17. He agreed with aspects of the sentencing judge's remarks which were put
    to him.  As to whether a number of EU nationals had  been  lied  to  in
    order to come to the UK and that false bank accounts were set  up,  the
    appellant said that he had paid for his crime and done  his  time.   He
    had learnt his lesson.

18. It was true that he was removed from the UK on  17  December  2016  (in
    pursuance of the deportation order).  As to his having  re-entered  the
    UK illegally, he said that he does not really know about the rules  and
    regulations.  All he knew was that he came back to  court  because  the
    court day was 13  January.   He  attended  with  all  his  luggage  and
    expected to be detained and  then  deported.   At  Colnbrook  he  cried
    sometimes and panicked as he did not want to be deported.   An  officer
    at Colnbrook said that he does not need a visa to come back to the  UK.
    He came back to the UK for the court hearing and not to live.   He  had
    asked his mother for money for the ticket.  In Lithuania  he  only  has
    his mother.

19. In submissions Mr Jarvis relied on previous skeleton arguments (all  of
    which have been provided to the appellant).

20. It was submitted that prior to the  appellant's  imprisonment  in  2014
    there had been no five year period of lawful residence, and he did  not
    qualify for the  enhanced  protection  under  a  period  of  10  years'
    residence.  He had been residing in the UK under a false  identity  and
    nationality, and using false documents in 1999 up to  2004,  pretending
    to be from Belarus.

21. Furthermore, there was no evidence that he had  ever  registered  under
    the Accession Regulations between 2004 and 2011.  The only Home  Office
    records are that he was an absconder and  the  address  that  had  been
    provided was not an address that he was  living  at,  and  he  was  not
    responding to mail.  There was no evidence on the  Home  Office  system
    that he had ever  registered  under  the  Accession  Regulations.   The
    absence of any evidence in that  respect  indicates  that  he  did  not
    register and the appellant himself had not provided any proof by way of
    any documentation that he did.

22. His most serious criminality began in around 2006 and continued  for  a
    number of years  until  he  was  arrested  and  convicted.   Thus,  the
    appellant was either deliberately working unlawfully, or  was  involved
    in a large scale criminal fraud.  He had been given permission to  work
    when posing as a national of Belarus, which does not constitute  lawful
    working (for the purpose of the EEA Regulations).

23. His entire conduct since entering the UK in 1999 has  been  deplorable,
    it was submitted, he having used a false name and nationality and  made
    a false asylum claim.  The Tribunal and the Home Office had spent  time
    and money attempting to contact him but he had simply left the UK to go
    back to Lithuania when it suited him.   He  re-entered  under  his  own
    nationality  but  worked  unlawfully,   contrary   to   the   Accession
    Regulations.

24. He had also committed an offence of indecent assault in 2002  and  then
    the extremely serious offences resulting in the sentence of six  and  a
    half years' imprisonment.  His conduct had been 'abusive' in  terms  of
    EU law.

25. Although there was no evidence of his having offended since his release
    from prison, he had continued to do as he pleased.  I  was  invited  to
    reject the appellant's claim that knew nothing about the need to  apply
    for readmission to the UK after he was  removed  in  pursuance  of  the
    deportation order.  There was a detailed decision  letter  written  for
    his benefit (F15 of the respondent's bundle) which made it  clear  that
    he would need to re-apply to come back to the UK.  The appellant has no
    regard for immigration control or EU law, it was submitted.

26. He does represent a genuine, present and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society.   He  is  only
    entitled to the lowest level of protection and there is a strong public
    interest in expelling him from the UK.

27. Even if it has been shown that he has a permanent right of residence or
    10  years'  residence,  his  overall  conduct  nevertheless   justifies
    expulsion.  Whatever level of protection he is afforded,  expulsion  is
    proportionate.

28. As to his relationships in the UK, his partner  has  not  provided  any
    evidence to the court.  However, even if the appellant  does  have  the
    relationships which he claims, with his daughter and new partner,  that
    would not outweigh the public interest.  He would be able to  adapt  to
    life in Lithuania, as he is evidently an  individual  who  is  able  to
    survive, whether posing as a national of Belarus or being  involved  in
    criminality.  There are no health issues to be taken into account.   It
    should not be  accepted  at  face  value  that  he  would  struggle  to
    communicate.  Rehabilitation does not play an important part in a  case
    where an individual is only entitled to the lowest level of protection.
     In any event, the issue of rehabilitation is not strong enough in this
    case to outweigh the public policy interest.

29. In reply, the appellant said that he had destroyed  his  life  when  he
    went to prison and the Home Office wanted to destroy his life again. He
    had committed a crime and he had paid for it. He is on probation  until
    2020. He had not made lots of money from  the  offences.  He  had  been
    working for three years in security and in a casino on the  front  door
    dealing with drunk and aggressive people.

    Conclusions

30. In the error of law decision I dealt with the question of whether it is
    the 2006 EEA Regulations that apply or those of 2016,  concluding  that
    it is the 2006 EEA Regulations.  I also dealt  with  issues  concerning
    the appellant's illegal re-entry to the UK after having  been  deported
    in pursuance of the deportation order.  For the  reasons  explained  in
    that decision, no issue arises in terms of the validity of  the  appeal
    (either before the FtJ or before me).

31. Reg 21 of the EEA Regulations provides as follows:

         "21.-   Decisions taken  on  public  policy,  public  security  and
         public health grounds

         (1)  In this regulation a "relevant decision" means an EEA decision
         taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy or public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national  who-  (a)
         has resided in the United Kingdom for a  continuous  period  of  at
         least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or  (b)   is  under
         the age of 18, unless the relevant decision  is  necessary  in  his
         best interests, as provided for in the Convention on the Rights  of
         the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations  on
         20th November 19891 .

         (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin."

32. Thus, if the appellant does not have a permanent right of residence  in
    the UK and/or has not resided in the UK for a continuous period  of  at
    least 10 years prior to the relevant decision, he may be removed on the
    grounds of public policy, public security or public health.  If he  has
    a permanent right of residence he may not be removed except of  serious
    grounds of pubic policy or public security.  If he has the requisite 10
    years' residence, imperative grounds of public  security  are  required
    before he can be removed.

33. Certain findings of fact made by the FtJ are not infected by the  error
    of law and can be preserved.  These are as follows:

       . The appellant entered the UK in March 1999.

       . The appellant resided in the UK until he returned to  Lithuania  in
         2004 for a period of  up  to  two  weeks  in  order  to  renew  his
         passport.

       . (In summary) between March 2005 and March 2009 the  appellant  left
         the UK for short periods either for work (travelling to Moscow)  or
         for holidays, including to Tenerife, Lithuania, Egypt and Cyprus.

       . He had not left the United Kingdom at all since 2009.

       . Between March 1999 to 2013 the  appellant  was  in  employment  for
         various  employers  (set  out  in  detail  at  [26]  of  the  FtJ's
         decision).

       . Throughout  his  term  of  imprisonment  the  appellant  maintained
         contact with his  daughter  through  telephone,  cards,  Skype  and
         visits.  There is a close bond between them.  He has  strong  links
         with her.

       .  Throughout  his  imprisonment  he  obtained  many  qualifications,
         including bricklaying.

34. It is also worth recording that the evidence that  the  appellant  gave
    before the FtJ was that up to 2004 he worked under the  false  name  of
    Sluzbyn, the name in which he claimed asylum in 1999.  His evidence was
    also that from 2004 to date he had used his correct name.

35. As already indicated,  if  the  appellant  has  a  permanent  right  of
    residence under reg 15, he may not be removed except on serious grounds
    of public policy or public security.  The question arises therefore, as
    to whether the appellant does have a permanent right of residence.   He
    would have such a permanent right of residence if he had resided in the
    UK in accordance with the EEA Regulations for a  continuous  period  of
    five years.  In this case, that would mean that the appellant needs  to
    establish that he had been in employment, that is working lawfully, for
    a continuous period of five years.

36. The FtJ accepted, without legal error, that the  appellant  had  worked
    for various employers from March 1999, until 2013.  He was arrested  in
    2011 but remained on bail and continued in  his  employment  until  his
    trial in 2013.  These are also matters accepted by the FtJ.

37. However, the appellant came to the UK in 1999 under a false  name,  and
    under which he claimed asylum in 1999.  His evidence was that he worked
    under that false name until 2004.  He  claimed  to  be  a  national  of
    Belarus.  His employment was not  therefore,  in  that  period,  lawful
    employment.  I agree with  the  respondent's  contention  that  illegal
    working  cannot  qualify  as  residing  in  accordance  with  the   EEA
    Regulations (see for example, Low & Ors v Secretary of  State  for  the
    home department [2010] EWCA Civ 4).

38. The appellant is then left with  the  period  between  2004  and  2013.
    Lithuania  joined  the  EU  on  1  May  2004.   Under   the   Accession
    (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 ("the  Accession
    Regulations"), which came into force on that date,  the  appellant  was
    required to register in order to obtain authorisation for employment.

39. On this, the appellant's evidence was  inconsistent.   At  the  hearing
    before me on 19 July 2017 the appellant said that he did register  with
    the Home Office, probably in 2006, and paid �60.  However, initially in
    evidence before me on 2 February 2018 he said that he  registered  with
    the Home Office when he came back from Lithuania in August  2004,  then
    said he never knew about the need to register with the Home Office.  He
    then repeated that he had in fact registered with the Home  Office  and
    had shown the registration certificate to agencies  that  required  it.
    He also said in evidence before me at the hearing on  2  February  2018
    that when he came out from prison everything was lost, but in  evidence
    on 19 July 2017 he said that he lost the certificate  because  his  ex-
    partner kept everything.

40. Furthermore, even if it could not be said that the appellant's evidence
    was inconsistent on the point, the fact is  he  has  not  produced  any
    evidence of his having  registered  as  required  under  the  Accession
    Regulations.  Furthermore, the  respondent  having  made  enquiries  in
    response to my directions, has not been able to find any evidence  that
    the appellant did so register.

41. I am satisfied therefore,  that  the  appellant's  employment  was  not
    lawful  up  until  the  Regulations  (as  amended  by   The   Accession
    (Immigration  and  Worker  Registration)   (Revocation,   Savings   and
    Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2011 ceased to have effect on  30
    April 2012.  In  effect  therefore,  almost  none  of  the  appellant's
    employment in the UK was lawful, and  thus  the  appellant's  residence
    could not be said to have been in accordance with the  EEA  Regulations
    entitling him to a permanent right of residence.

42. On that analysis, the appellant is only entitled to the lowest level of
    protection against deportation, that is on grounds of public policy  or
    public security (in this case).

43. I do not accept that the appellant  has  the  requisite  period  of  10
    years' residence in order to qualify for protection against deportation
    on imperative grounds.  In the first place, according to the opinion of
    Advocate General Szpunar in Cases C-316/16 and  C-44/16,  B  the  Land-
    Wu?rttenbrberg, and Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Frank
    Vomero, it is necessary for the appellant to have acquired a  permanent
    right of residence before qualifying for the enhanced protection  under
    10 years' residence. Having considered the Advocate General's reasoning
    in that case, I find myself in agreement with it. In the second  place,
    having regard to the matters I have set  out  above,  as  well  as  the
    matters referred to below in terms of the  appellant's  integration  in
    the UK, I am satisfied that  the  appellant's  imprisonment  broke  the
    continuity of his residence, which in principle it does, and  which  in
    fact in this case it has.

44. On the basis that the appellant is only entitled to the lowest level of
    protection against  deportation  under  the  EEA  Regulations,  I  have
    further considered the requirements set out at reg 21(5) and (6).

45. One of the questions to be answered is whether the appellant represents
    a genuine, present, and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
    the fundamental interests of society.  The OASys  Assessment  dated  24
    November 2016 (page 103 of the appellant's bundle before the First-tier
    Tribunal) refers to the appellant as being a medium risk to the  public
    in the community and a medium risk to prisoners whilst in custody.  The
    risk to the public  was  described  as  being  to  females,  given  his
    conviction for a sexual assault in 2002, and to a risk of assault given
    that he has an adjudication for punching a cellmate and co-defendant in
    the head on 22 August 2013.  At [27] of the respondent's decision dated
    22 September 2016 it states that the offender manager  found  that  the
    appellant posed a low risk of  reoffending,  although  the  only  OASys
    report before  me,  from  the  appellant's  bundle,  does  not  contain
    information  about  that  assessment.   Nevertheless,  given  that  the
    respondent's decision accepts that this is what is said  in  the  OASys
    report, I see no reason to doubt that that is  what  the  OASys  report
    states in terms of the risk of the appellant's reoffending.

46. However, even if it is right that the appellant represents a  low  risk
    of reoffending, that does not mean that there is no risk.   Factors  to
    be taken into account are  the  appellant's  conviction  in  2002,  the
    period of time over which he committed the serious offence for which he
    received a sentence of six and a half years' imprisonment, namely  from
    2006  to  2011,  and  the  fact  that  whilst  serving  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment he assaulted his cellmate, apparently a co-defendant.  The
    fact that it was an assault is evident from it having been recorded  as
    an adjudication.  The risk of harm that the appellant poses if he  were
    to reoffend is therefore a significant one in my judgement.

47. In any event, I  do  not  consider  that  the  risk  of  the  appellant
    reoffending is properly described as low.  As was submitted  on  behalf
    of  the  respondent  before  me,  the  appellant  does  demonstrate   a
    significant disregard for the law.  Not only is  that  evident  in  his
    offending, but it is evident from the fact that as long ago as 1999  he
    came to the UK illegally, under a false name and nationality, and  made
    a false claim for asylum.  Even after he was deported from  the  UK  in
    December 2016, he returned to the UK illegally.  I do not  accept  that
    he was unaware of the fact that he needed to seek permission to return.
     The respondent's decision made it very  clear  that  he  did  need  to
    reapply for admission.  It is evident that that appellant decided,  yet
    again, to pursue a course of action that suited him, regardless of  any
    legal restrictions.

48. In my judgement, there is a significant risk that  the  appellant  will
    reoffend, and thus that the risk can properly be regarded as more  than
    a low risk.

49. On that basis, I am satisfied that the appellant represents a  genuine,
    present  and  significantly  serious  threat  affecting  one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society.  However, I would have  come  to  the
    same conclusion even if it could properly be said that the risk of  his
    reoffending was only low, having regard to the matters I have  referred
    to in the preceding paragraphs.

50. I have taken into account the matters required to be considered at  reg
    21(6) of the EEA Regulations.  There is nothing about  the  appellant's
    age or state of health which militates against removal, or which  works
    in his favour in terms of resisting deportation.

51. I accept that he has a  close  relationship  with  his  daughter,  that
    having been a matter that was considered by the FtJ and upon  which  he
    made the findings to which  I  have  referred.   However,  in  evidence
    before me, it was apparent that the appellant does not see his daughter
    face-to-face, or at least not much.  His evidence was that he speaks to
    her on the phone.  He did not  give  any  evidence  about  face-to-face
    meetings with her.  Furthermore, she lives in Southampton and he  lives
    now in Peterborough.  The appellant,  according  to  his  evidence,  is
    making a new family life for himself with a new partner  with  whom  he
    has been in a relationship, according to his  evidence,  since  October
    2017.

52. Furthermore, although in his witness statement dated 7  April  2017  at
    [48] the appellant says that his daughter's mother would not let her go
    to Lithuania to see him, and his daughter is now at  college,  she  was
    born on 28 March 2001 and is now approaching an age when  she  will  be
    able to make her own decisions about making visits to him in Lithuania.
     Whilst I accept that a father's relationship with  their  child  is  a
    significant matter, even where, and  perhaps  in  particular  where,  a
    child is in their teenage years, the fact of the  matter  is  that  the
    appellant does not live with his daughter any longer.

53. As regards his relationship with a new partner, that relationship is of
    very recent duration, as inevitably is his relationship  with  his  new
    partner's young daughter.  That relationship is,  in  my  view,  not  a
    legally significant consideration to be taken into account in terms  of
    the appellant's deportation.  Furthermore, there is no reason  why  his
    new partner and her daughter cannot visit the appellant in Lithuania.

54. Although the  appellant  claims  to  have  nothing  in  Lithuania,  his
    evidence is that his mother lives there.   Between  2005  and  2009  he
    visited Lithuania on two occasions, having returned from there in 2004.
     His visits were in 2006 for a week to 10 days, and in 2008, apparently
    to visit family according to the evidence he gave to the FtJ.

55. Furthermore, I do not accept that the appellant would not be able to re-
    establish himself on return to Lithuania.  After all, that is where  he
    was born, and where he lived until he came to the UK in 1999.   He  has
    returned since and has his mother there.  In  addition,  the  appellant
    has gained qualifications since being in the UK, and would be likely to
    be able to re-establish himself on return to Lithuania,  which  is  the
    country of his nationality, and where he lived as an  adult  before  he
    came to the UK.

56. I do accept that he will have integrated to some extent in the UK, even
    if only by virtue of  the  length  of  time  that  he  has  been  here.
    However, the extent of that integration is significantly marred because
    of his having entered illegally, his having claimed asylum in  a  false
    name and worked illegally, and because of his offending over  a  period
    of years.  Furthermore, he spent a significant period in custody.

57. Even accepting the relationships that he has in the UK, and the fact of
    his having worked, the extent of his integration is such that it is not
    a factor that significantly affects or reduces the  proportionality  of
    the decision to remove him.

58. As to the question of rehabilitation, I accept that the  appellant  has
    undertaken courses whilst in custody.  However, I cannot see  that  the
    prospects for rehabilitation are any better in the UK than they are  in
    Lithuania, his country of nationality.  Whilst the appellant says  that
    he  does  not  speak  Lithuanian  very  well,   I   have   considerable
    reservations about his evidence on that,  given  that  he  lived  there
    until 1999, when he was an adult.  Although  he  says  in  his  witness
    statement that his father is Lithuanian and his mother from Belarus,  I
    do not accept that he would have lived until 1999 in Lithuania  without
    having a good working knowledge of the national language.

59. Taking all relevant factors into  account,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    respondent was  entitled  to  make  a  deportation  order  against  the
    appellant and that that decision is proportionate.

60. Even if the  appellant  does  have  a  permanent  right  of  residence,
    contrary to my conclusions, in the light of  my  analysis  above  I  am
    satisfied that the respondent was entitled to make a deportation  order
    on serious grounds of public policy or public security,  having  regard
    to the risk of reoffending and the matters to which regard must be  had
    under reg 21(5) and (6).

61. In all these circumstances, the  respondent  was  entitled  to  make  a
    deportation order against the appellant and the appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations is dismissed.

62. The Article 8 ground  adds  nothing  to  the  appellant's  appeal,  the
    Article 8 matters being  subsumed  within  the  considerations  arising
    under the EEA Regulations. Thus, the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR
    is also dismissed.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. Its decision having been set aside, the decision  is
    re-made, dismissing the appeal on all grounds.




    Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            5/03/18

                                    ANNEX


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


 1. Although the appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,
    it is convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Lithuania,  born  in  1976.   He  arrived
    illegally in  the  UK  in  1999,  either  in  March  according  to  the
    appellant, or September according to the respondent. A decision to make
    a deportation order against him was made on  22  September  2016  as  a
    result of his conviction on 26 April 2013 for an offence of  conspiracy
    to cheat the public revenue, for which he received a  sentence  of  six
    and a half years' imprisonment. The decision to deport  was  made  with
    reference to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
    (as amended) ("the EEA Regulations").

 3. The appeal under the EEA Regulations  was  certified  pursuant  to  reg
    24AA. The human rights appeal was certified pursuant to  s.94B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

 4. The appellant's appeal came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Osborne
    ("the FtJ") on 12 January 2017, resulting in the appeal being  allowed,
    both under the EEA Regulations and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 5. Permission to appeal against the FtJ's  decision  was  granted  on  the
    basis that it was arguable that the FtJ erred in  concluding  that  the
    appellant had acquired 10 years' residence in the UK, and in failing to
    take into account the significant public interest in the deportation of
    the appellant in the light of the fact that  he  was  convicted  of  an
    offence involving a conspiracy to cheat the public out of �2.3 million.

 6. In pursuance of the deportation order the appellant  was  removed  from
    the UK on 17 December 2016 but returned illegally on  7  January  2017,
    without having made an application to return pursuant to reg 29AA,  and
    he was present for his appeal. The FtJ stated at [6] that "on the basis
    that the Appellant had taken the trouble to travel  from  Lithuania  to
    the UK for the specific purpose, I had no wish or reason  to  deny  him
    the opportunity of giving evidence in his own appeal".

 7. The appeal was first listed before me on 24 April 2017.  The  appellant
    was not represented. I adjourned the  hearing  for  the  respondent  to
    consider whether the appellant's illegal re-entry to the UK invalidated
    the appeal before the FtT, and also to consider the question of whether
    it was the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  that
    applied or the 2016 Regulations.

 8. Mr Jarvis very helpfully provided a detailed and comprehensive skeleton
    argument setting out the respondent's position on the above points, and
    with a note dated 18 July 2017 also considered  the  relevance  of  the
    decision of the Supreme Court in Kiarie and  Byndloss  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42. I consider those  matters
    further below. I should add that the respondent's  written  submissions
    as contained in those documents  were  provided  to  the  appellant  in
    advance of the resumed hearing,  a  fact  which  he  confirmed  at  the
    hearing.

    Further background to the deportation order

 9. On 9 September 1999 the appellant  claimed  asylum  in  a  false  name,
    claiming to be a national of  Belarus.  However,  the  application  for
    asylum was refused on non-compliance grounds. There  was  a  subsequent
    appeal but it was dismissed without substantive consideration.

10. On 28 May 2002 the appellant was convicted of an  offence  of  indecent
    assault for which he received a conditional discharge  and  ordered  to
    pay compensation of �250.

11. The offence which prompted the decision to deport the appellant was one
    of conspiracy to cheat the  public  revenue,  as  detailed  above.  The
    sentencing remarks reveal that  the  offence  involved  the  making  of
    fraudulent claims for tax rebates.  The  two  main  methods  were  that
    workers,  predominantly  from  Poland,  were  tricked  into   answering
    advertisements for jobs in newspapers and other places. The  jobs  were
    fictitious and the applicants were tricked into  providing  information
    such as their national insurance  numbers,  tax  references,  dates  of
    birth and so forth.

12. The female telephone operators who received the  information  were,  on
    the whole, illegal immigrants in the UK. About 200 bank  accounts  were
    opened as part of the conspiracy. Fraudulent  claims  for  tax  rebates
    were made over a five year period, amounting to �2.3 million.  Many  of
    the false claims were identified by Revenue  and  Customs  and  so  the
    actual payments amounted to about �658,000. The appellant was found  by
    the sentencing judge to have been fully aware  of  the  extent  of  the
    organisation and its workings.

    The decision of the FtJ

13. The FtJ found that the appellant had established that he arrived in the
    UK in March 1999. It was accepted on behalf of  the  respondent  before
    the FtJ that the appellant had provided evidence of his  employment  in
    the UK since his arrival, except for the years 2008 and 2009.

14. The appellant's evidence was that he returned to Lithuania in 2004  for
    "up to" two weeks in order to renew his passport, and he gave  evidence
    of a number of other absences for holidays to various  places  and  for
    family visits. His evidence was that he had not  left  the  UK  at  all
    since 2009. The FtJ accepted his evidence as to those absences.

15. In  relation  to  his  employment,  the  FtJ  set  out  in  detail  the
    appellant's evidence of where he had worked  and  when.  The  appellant
    said that when he was arrested in 2011 for the  conspiracy  offence  he
    remained on bail and working in the community until his trial in 2013.

16. The FtJ said that he was satisfied that in 2008 the appellant took over
    the running of the  conspiracy  and  that  he  continued  to  head  the
    operation  until  he  was  arrested  in  2011.  Given  the  appellant's
    involvement in the conspiracy and how it was  run,  the  FtJ  concluded
    that the appellant was in the UK in 2008 and 2009 until his removal  to
    Lithuania on 17 December 2016.

17. He then concluded that the appellant  had  resided  in  the  UK  for  a
    continuous period of at least 10 years "in  accordance  with  the  2006
    Regulations pursuant to Regulation 15", and that he had lived in the UK
    for a period of 10 years by March 2009.  He also found  that  prior  to
    his imprisonment in April 2013 the appellant  had  already  acquired  a
    period in excess of 10 years "provided that the period of  imprisonment
    did not in itself break  the  'integrative'  link  established  by  the
    Appellant's residence between March 1999 and 22 September 2016".

18. He then concluded that the appellant had acquired a permanent right  of
    residence after his arrival in March 1999 by virtue of  having  resided
    for a continuous period of five  years  exercising  Treaty  rights.  He
    found that in any event, even if  the  appellant  had  not  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence, such was not necessary for  him  to  have
    established 10 years continuous  residence  prior  to  the  deportation
    decision.

19. He found that in the appellant's case his imprisonment  did  not  break
    his integrative links in the UK on the basis of the evidence  from  the
    appellant "and from the impressive oral evidence of his daughter".  The
    FtJ then gave further reasons for concluding that  there  was  a  close
    bond between him and his daughter.

20. He also  found  that  the  appellant  had  an  employment  record  that
    demonstrated that he is a hardworking individual who is able to  obtain
    employment.

21. He disagreed with the  respondent's  contention  that  the  appellant's
    offending history would  justify  deportation  on  imperative  grounds,
    referring to various decisions of the CJEU and the ECtHR.

22. At [52] the FtJ said that the appellant's offence  was  undoubtedly  "a
    most serious criminal offence", the details of which he reiterated, but
    finding that it was not an offence that fell within imperative  grounds
    of public security.

23. Referring to the fact that the OASys report assessed the  appellant  as
    representing a medium risk of harm, but a low  risk  of  offending,  he
    found that  neither  the  offence  nor  the  assessed  future  risk  of
    reoffending, meant that the appellant should be deported on  imperative
    grounds of public security.

    The grounds of appeal and submissions

24. At the hearing before me, Mr Jarvis sought to rely on a  new  argument,
    not previously pleaded, in terms of abuse  of  EU  rights.  However,  I
    indicated that if an application was  made  to  amend  the  grounds  of
    challenge to the FtJ's decision I would refuse it, because the original
    grounds were lodged in February 2017, permission to appeal was  granted
    in March 2017, the issue  was  not  raised  at  the  earlier  adjourned
    hearing  on  24  April  2017,  and  the  appellant  was   not   legally
    represented.

25. The grounds contend that the FtJ was wrong to find that  the  appellant
    had acquired either five or ten years residence for the purposes of the
    EEA Regulations. The appellant had claimed to  be  from  Belarus  until
    2004 when he returned to Lithuania to obtain a new passport.  That  was
    the year that Lithuania  joined  the  EU,  on  1  May.  Nationals  from
    countries that acceded to the EU on 1 May  2004  could  only  claim  EU
    rights from that date, and not before.  Thus,  the  earliest  date  the
    appellant  could  gain  permanent  residence  was  1  May   2009.   The
    appellant's offence occurred between 2006 and 2011. Furthermore,  there
    was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  completed  the  necessary
    qualifying year under the Workers Registration Scheme.

26. Although the FtJ said that the appellant was present in the UK  between
    2008 and 2009, there was no  documentary  evidence  of  his  exercising
    Treaty Rights.

27. In addition, it is said that the FtJ was wrong  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant did not need to  have  acquired  permanent  residence  before
    qualifying under the 10 year period.

28. In terms of the 10 year period, the contention in the grounds  is  that
    the appellant's integrative links are undermined  by  his  criminality.
    The seriousness of the offence is also relied on in  terms  of  whether
    there are imperative grounds justifying the appellant's deportation.

29. In relation to Article 8, the FtJ had not adequately  reasoned  why  he
    allowed the appeal on that ground.

30. In submissions before me, Mr Jarvis relied on the grounds,  a  skeleton
    argument, and a supplementary skeleton argument. It was submitted  that
    the question of integration required a holistic assessment. One of  the
    factors to be taken into account was the seriousness of the offence and
    its duration over a number of years. I was referred to the decisions in
    Warsame v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    16, and Case C-145/09 Tsakouridis [2010] ECR I-11979.

31. The FtJ had looked at one side of the coin only in terms of  the  issue
    of integration. The FtJ needed to engage with the criminal behaviour of
    the  appellant  in  the  period  counting  back  from  the  period   of
    imprisonment.

32. In response to those  submissions,  the  appellant  said  that  he  did
    register with the Home Office, probably in 2006, and paid �60. He  lost
    the  certificate  because  his  ex-partner  kept  everything.  He   had
    registered for national insurance from 2007, and before that he used  a
    temporary NI number. From 5 April 2008 until April 2009 he worked.

33. It was true that before 2004 he used a different name  and  nationality
    as Belorussian. He had gone through a very hard time  and  lost  nearly
    everything because of his crime. There is nothing in Lithuania for him.
    He had served his sentence and paid the confiscation order.

    Assessment

34. At the adjourned hearing of 27 April 2017, I had  asked  Mr  Jarvis  to
    consider two issues. Those were, whether the  appellant's  illegal  re-
    entry to the UK invalidated the appeal before the FtT, and  whether  it
    was the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  that
    applied or the 2016 Regulations.

35. There is also the added question, canvassed at the earlier hearing,  in
    terms of the appellant having come back to the UK to be present at  his
    appeal, despite the human rights claim having been  certified  pursuant
    to s.94B of the 2002 Act.

36. In his skeleton argument dated 10 May 2017, Mr  Jarvis  very  carefully
    explains why it is the respondent's view that the appellant having come
    back to the UK illegally did not affect the validity of the  appeal  to
    the FtT in relation to the EEA  Regulations  (deportation)  appeal.  To
    summarise, the respondent's view is that the FtT  had  jurisdiction  to
    consider the appeal and did not procedurally err  in  hearing  evidence
    from the appellant.

37. It is said in the skeleton argument that the situation is otherwise  in
    relation to the human rights appeal which was  certified  under  s.94B,
    because the appeal in that regard needed  to  have  been  brought  from
    outside the UK. Thus, the FtJ's conclusions in relation to  Article  8,
    allowing the appeal, were unlawful. It is acknowledged in the  skeleton
    argument that the FtJ's main findings were in terms of the  deportation
    appeal. In so far as an amendment to the grounds  in  this  respect  is
    needed, that application is made in the skeleton argument.

38. On the s.94B point, being one of jurisdiction, I do not  consider  that
    an amendment to the grounds is strictly necessary but  if  it  is,  the
    application is granted. However, events have  overtaken  that  argument
    given the decision of the  Supreme  Court  in  Kiarie  and  Byndloss  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42. It seems  to
    me that in the light of that decision there is no validity to any point
    about the FtJ's  jurisdiction  to  hear  the  human  rights  appeal  in
    circumstances where the appellant returned to the UK illegally.

39. As a matter of substance however,  the  respondent  does  rely  on  the
    appellant's illegal return to the UK as a further demonstration of  his
    personal conduct indicating that the public interest  does  favour  his
    deportation on the basis of his "flagrant  disregard"  for  immigration
    control. That is said to  be  a  further  example  of  the  appellant's
    natural inclination to do what he wants regardless of the consequences,
    as well as evidence of his lack of integration.

40. In relation to the appellant's illegal return to the UK, I do  consider
    that the FtJ misjudged the situation in the sense that it appears  from
    [6] of his decision (referred to at my [6] above)  that  he  considered
    that it was a matter to be  considered  in  favour  of  the  appellant,
    referring to him as having taken the trouble to travel  from  Lithuania
    to the UK to be present for his appeal. I cannot see how this action on
    the part of the appellant can rationally be seen as anything other than
    what the respondent suggests is a flagrant  disregard  for  immigration
    control in the UK. I would add, that it has echoes of the  offence  for
    which he was convicted.

41. Mr Jarvis' skeleton argument also explains why it is suggested that  it
    is the 2006  EEA  Regulations  that  apply,  and  I  accept  that  that
    proposition is correct.

42. It is asserted on behalf of the respondent that because  counting  back
    from the beginning of  the  appellant's  imprisonment  (in  2013),  the
    necessary 10 year period (for enhanced protection from deportation) pre-
    dated  Lithuania's  accession  to  the  EU  (on  1  May  2004).  It  is
    acknowledged that on the basis of Ziolkowski (Freedom of  movement  for
    persons) [2011] EUECJ C-424/10 (21  December  2011)  a  person  can  in
    principle rely on a period of residence before accession of the  member
    state in question as long as the person is in compliance  with  Article
    7(1)  of  Directive  2004/38/EC  (and  see  also  Vassallo  (Qualifying
    residence; pre-UK accession) [2014]  UKUT  00313  (IAC)  to  which  the
    respondent's attention was drawn at the hearing before  me).   For  the
    purposes of this appeal, that involves a consideration of  whether  the
    appellant was a worker (or self-employed).

43. It is argued that the appellant was  not  a  worker  during  that  time
    because he was not lawfully resident in the UK, was  working  illegally
    and was not a worker within Article  39  of  the  Treaty  of  Rome.  In
    addition, he did not reside in the UK in reliance on his UK nationality
    but on the  basis  of  a  claimed  Belarussian  nationality  and  false
    identity, until the beginning of 2004.

44. Furthermore, it is contended that the appellant did not  register  with
    the Home Office for a certificate as a worker  as  required  under  the
    Workers' Registration Scheme during Lithuania's accession  period,  and
    thus was not a qualified person under the  EEA  regulations  (or  their
    predecessor Regulations of 2000).

45. In the alternative, it is argued that for the appellant now to rely  on
    such a period for  retrospective  qualification  would  be  a  "further
    abuse" of EU law. But I have already indicated that the  respondent  is
    precluded from advancing that particular argument,  at  this  stage  at
    least.

46. However, the point about the  appellant's  failure  to  register  as  a
    worker, and his employment at a time when he was claiming  to  be  from
    Belarus, are matters that are relevant to the question of  whether  the
    appellant was exercising Treaty rights from the time of his arrival  in
    1999.

47. The question of the appellant's  registration  as  a  worker  does  not
    appear to have been raised before the FtT. The appellant said to me  in
    reply to Mr Jarvis' submissions that he  did  register  with  the  Home
    Office as a worker, he thought in 2006. However,  that  does  not  deal
    with the point made on behalf of the respondent in terms of his  needed
    to have registered prior to that. I do consider that this is a relevant
    matter in terms of the question of the appellant's integration,  linked
    to his having worked under a false premise, in  the  initial  years  at
    least.

48. However, it is also relevant to the FtJ's conclusion at [39]  that  the
    appellant had acquired a permanent right  of  residence  by  virtue  of
    having exercised Treaty rights for a period of  five  years  after  his
    arrival in March 1999, which is a conclusion that takes no  account  of
    the issues to which I have referred in [46] and [47] above.

49. The FtJ did conclude at [40], with reasons, that the appellant did  not
    need to have acquired a permanent right of residence  in  order  to  be
    able to establish 10 years' residence. However, that conclusion must be
    open to doubt now in the light  of  the  Opinion  of  Advocate  General
    Szpunar in Cases C-316/16 and C-424/16, B v Land Baden-W�rttemberg, and
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Frank  Vomero,  which  of
    course the FtJ did not have the benefit of when he made his decision.

50. I also consider that there is merit in the respondent's complaint about
    the FtJ's assessment of whether the appellant's imprisonment broke  the
    10 year  period  of  continuous  residence.  The  FtJ  found  that  the
    appellant's imprisonment did not  break  the  "established  integrative
    links"  that  the  appellant  has  in  the  UK.  However,   with   some
    justification Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  the  matters  that  the  FtJ
    assessed at [43]-[45] of his decision (relationship with his  daughter,
    employment record, courses in prison,  and  English  language  ability)
    represent one side of the coin only. His serious offending was a matter
    to be considered, and the nature of that  offending,  as  well  as  his
    conduct overall.

51. In the light of the matters I have referred to above,  I  am  satisfied
    that the FtJ erred  in  law  in  allowing  the  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations. The errors of law relate to the FtJ's failure to  consider
    the relevance of the  fact  that  the  appellant  returned  to  the  UK
    illegally, as explained at [40] above, and his  assessment  of  whether
    the appellant had acquired 10 years residence in the  UK  in  terms  of
    whether his imprisonment  broke  the  continuity  of  residence.  Those
    errors of law are such as to require the decision to be set aside.

52. The issue of whether  the  appellant's  deportation  was  justified  on
    imperative grounds of public security was resolved in  the  appellant's
    favour by the FtJ who concluded that the offence of conspiracy to cheat
    the public revenue, considered with any risk of further offending,  was
    not serious enough to justify that conclusion. He referred to the OASys
    report which assessed the appellant as representing a  medium  risk  of
    harm but a low risk of reoffending.

53. If the appellant could not be said to have acquired 10 years' residence
    then the question of whether there are imperative grounds  falls  away.
    Mr Jarvis submitted that a case could be made for concluding that there
    were imperative grounds in this case, although suggesting that such  an
    argument had not previously been advanced. Actually,  it  seems  to  me
    that that argument is advanced in the (original) grounds of  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal. However, I am inclined to the view that there is no
    error of law in the FtJ's assessment of this issue, although I  do  not
    need to express a concluded view on the  matter  in  the  light  of  my
    conclusions as to the errors of law otherwise in the FtJ's decision.

54. Similarly, I do not express any concluded view at this stage  in  terms
    of whether the FtJ erred in concluding that the appellant did not  need
    to acquire a permanent right of  residence  in  order  to  be  able  to
    establish that he had acquired 10 years' residence.  Although  the  FtJ
    found that the appellant had given a credible account of his employment
    in the UK, the issue in relation to whether the appellant had  acquired
    a permanent right of residence at all in the light of his need to  have
    registered as a worker from an Accession State is a  matter  that  will
    require further consideration.

55. The ground of appeal in relation to the FtJ's decision under Article  8
    is subsumed within the matters arising under the EEA Regulations.

56. Whilst it was suggested on behalf of the respondent that were I to find
    an error of law requiring the decision of the FtT to be set aside,  the
    appeal could be remitted to the FtT, I do not consider that that is  an
    appropriate course. Some findings of fact can be preserved and there is
    no  reason,  taking  into  account  the  Senior  President's   Practice
    Statement at paragraph 7.2, for the appeal to be remitted. Accordingly,
    the decision will be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

57. At the resumed hearing the level of protection to which  the  appellant
    is entitled as a citizen of the  EU  will  be  considered  afresh.  The
    question  of  abuse  of  EU  rights  is  a  matter  that  is  open  for
    consideration at the further hearing, given that the decision is to  be
    re-made. Mr Jarvis indicated that, if requested to do so, he  would  be
    able to make enquiries in relation to the appellant's registration as a
    worker from an Accession State, and I direct  that  such  enquiries  be
    made.

58. In summary, the decision of the FtT is set aside for error of law.  The
    decision will be re-made in the Upper Tribunal at a further hearing.

                               DIRECTIONS

    1.   No later than  7  days  before  the  next  date  of  hearing,  the
         respondent is to file and serve a skeleton argument setting out all
         lines of argument on behalf of the respondent.

    2.       The respondent is to make the enquiries referred  to  at  [57]
    above.
