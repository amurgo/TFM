Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involves protection issues. We find that it is appropriate to  continue
the order. We make  clear  that  the  order  is  not  made  to  protect  the
respondent's reputation following  his  conviction  for  criminal  offences.
Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  respondent  is
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any member of his family. This direction  applies
both to the respondent and the appellant.

Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S. Cunha, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr P. Georget, instructed by Stirling Ackroyd Legal

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity, we shall refer  to  the  parties  as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal although technically the  Secretary
    of State is the appellant before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant (AO) appealed the Secretary of  State's  decision  dated
    05 September 2018 to revoke protection status and  to  refuse  a  human
    rights claim. The decision was  made  in  the  context  of  deportation
    proceedings. A deportation order was signed on 04 September 2018.

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge A.A.  Wilson  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal on Refugee Convention grounds but allowed the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds, in a decision promulgated on 08 May 2019.

4.     After  having  considered  the  evidence  and  the  country  guidance
    decision in MOJ (returns to Mogadishu) Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 00442 the
    judge concluded that the appellant's refugee status had not ceased  [7-
    15]. The Secretary of State asserted that the appellant  was  a  person
    who, having been convicted of a particularly serious crime, constituted
    a danger to the  community  for  the  purpose  of  section  72  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA 2002"). Section  72
    NIAA 2002 is said to reflect Article 33(2) of the  Refugee  Convention,
    although it inaccurately describes  the  effect  of  the  provision  as
    'exclusion' from Refugee Status rather than framing  the  provision  in
    terms of permitted refoulement. The effect of section 72  is  that  the
    judge was required to consider whether the appellant had  rebutted  the
    presumption that he was a danger to the community. The judge  concluded
    that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption [16-17]. Section
    72(10) then required him to dismiss the appeal in so far as  it  relied
    on grounds relating to the Refugee Convention, and he did so.

5.    The judge went on to consider whether the  appellant's  removal  would
    be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 ("HRA  1998").
    He made clear that the burden of proof lay on  the  appellant  to  show
    that his removal would give rise to a real risk of serious  harm  under
    Article 3 of the European Convention [19]. He went on to repeat many of
    the same factors that he had already considered in relation to risk  on
    return to Mogadishu, when addressing the appellant's refugee status. He
    concluded that the appellant's removal would give rise to a  real  risk
    of serious harm under Article 3  [20-22].  He  went  on  to  find  that
    removal would also amount to a breach of  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention. This was for largely the same reasons he had already  given
    for finding real risk of a breach of Article 3 [26].

6.    The Secretary of State appealed the First-tier Tribunal decision.  The
    original grounds were diffuse and unparticularised. At the hearing,  Ms
    Cunha formulated them into the following three points.

       i) The First-tier Tribunal failed  to  apply  the  country  guidance
          decision in MOJ properly, failed to give adequate weight  to  the
          fact that the appellant could apply for initial support from  the
          Facilitated Returns Programme, understood some Swahili,  and  was
          fit and able to work.

      ii) The second point was vague and was not  clarified  adequately  at
          the hearing. As we understood the submission,  the  Secretary  of
          State makes a general  assertion  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
          failed to follow the approach outlined in  SSHD  v  MA  (Somalia)
          [2018] EWCA Civ 994 and SSHD v MS (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345.
          It was not open to the judge to  find  that  unacceptable  living
          conditions falling below humanitarian  standards  amounted  to  a
          breach of Article 3.

     iii) If the First-tier Tribunal erred in the Article 3 assessment,  it
          follows that the assessment under Article 8 was also flawed.

Decision and reasons

7.          At the outset, we observe that the Secretary of State's  grounds
    of appeal were poorly pleaded. It is difficult for the  Upper  Tribunal
    to assess the case put forward by a party, or for the  other  party  to
    respond, if the grounds of appeal do not identify the alleged errors in
    a clear and logical manner. In this case, the Secretary of State argued
    additional points in the skeleton argument, which were not contained in
    the grounds of appeal, without applying for or obtaining permission  to
    argue those points.

8.    The appeal to the judge was dismissed with reference  to  the  Refugee
    Convention. The Secretary of State's grounds appeared to focus  on  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings relating to Articles  3  and  8  of  the
    European Convention.

9.    The original grounds of appeal appeared nonetheless to  criticise  the
    judge for his approach to the cessation of refugee status. The  grounds
    stated that the correct approach regarding cessation of refugee  status
    was set out by the Court of Appeal  in  MA  (Somalia)  and  quoted  the
    decision, but no argument, or none that was coherent, was developed  in
    relation to cessation.

10.   When it came to the challenge to the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings
    relating to Article 3, nothing of significance was said in the  grounds
    until [9], where it was merely stated that the Court of Appeal in  SSHD
    v Said [2016] Imm AR 1084, found that there was no violation of Article
    3 by reason only of a person being returned  to  a  country  which  for
    economic reasons cannot provide him with basic living standards. Beyond
    that bare statement, no reasons were given as  to  why  the  First-tier
    Tribunal might have erred.

11.    The  Secretary  of  State's  skeleton  argument,  under  the  heading
    "Submissions: Article 3", attempted to put forward further arguments as
    follows:

            "Despite 'SSHD vs MA (Somalia)'  having  been  promulgated  long
           before the FTTJ's consideration under Art 3, having  upheld  the
           s72 certificate, the FTTJ fails to direct themselves to this  at
           Para 9/10 when considering the case law of MS (Article  1C(5)  -
           Mogadishu) Somalia [2018 UKUT 00196 (IAC) and AMA (Article 1C(5)
           - proviso -  internal  relocation)  Somalia  [2019]  UKUT  00011
           (IAC), or when considering relevant matters at Para 21/22 (it is
           assumed reference here to CG case of 'MHA'  should  be  read  as
           'MOJ'?). The finding that the Appellant would be forced to  live
           in an IDP camp (and would 'perceived' to be a westerner in them)
           itself being undermined by errors identified  above  as  to  the
           FTTJ's assessment of 'MOJ'.


             This  error  is  of  material  significance  given  the  recent
           authority of Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  MS
           (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345 where the Court of Appeal clearly
           found the approach MS (Art 1C(5)  -  Mogadishu)  Somalia  [2018]
           UKUT 00196 (IAC) to be flawed and the comments in  AMA  (Article
           1C(5) - proviso  -  internal  relocation)  Somalia  [2019]  UKUT
           000011 (IAC) to be too generalised ...


            [MS (Somalia) quoted]


            The FTTJ therefore fell into material error,  in  light  of  the
           above guidance, in their approach at Para 52-54 (which  somewhat
           surprisingly fall between para 10  and  11),  and  Para  20-22."
           (sic)


12.   These incoherent arguments referred to authorities that  consider  the
    proper approach to internal relocation in the context of  cessation  of
    refugee status. They have nothing to do with the  correct  approach  to
    Article 3.  Nor  were  any  arguments  relating  to  the  second  point
    developed in any clear or meaningful way in oral submissions.

13.   In so far as the authorities of MA (Somalia)  and  MS  (Somalia)  have
    been cited, we note that they deal  with  the  approach  to  cessation,
    which is not the subject of the appeal before the Upper Tribunal. It is
    now well established that the assessment of cessation of  status  is  a
    'mirror  image'  of  a  decision  determining  refugee  status   albeit
    cessation  must  involve  a  restrictive  approach  and  includes   the
    additional consideration of whether any change in circumstances is of a
    significant and non-temporary nature such that the circumstances giving
    rise to the fear of persecution no longer exist and there is  no  other
    reason to fear persecution.

14.   The decision in MS (Somalia) is of little relevance to the  assessment
    of Article 3 of European Convention which, in the context of this case,
    is focussed solely on the conditions in the proposed place  of  removal
    i.e. Mogadishu. MS (Somalia) reiterated that a court should follow  the
    'mirror image' approach endorsed in MA (Somalia), which  could  include
    consideration of whether there was a safe  area  to  which  the  person
    could internally relocate. The test of whether it would be 'reasonable'
    to expect a person to stay in another  area  of  the  country  for  the
    purpose  of  the  Refugee  Convention  can  include  consideration   of
    humanitarian conditions: see [28] Said. Given that Mogadishu  would  be
    the appellant's place of internal relocation it was open to  the  judge
    to consider the humanitarian conditions he might face there.

15.   The Court of Appeal decision in Said is more relevant to the  argument
    we think the Secretary of State was attempting  to  make.  It  focussed
    more directly on the proper  approach  to  Article  3  in  relation  to
    humanitarian conditions. The court noted the 'fork in the road' between
    the Strasbourg jurisprudence in D v UK (1997) 24 EHRR  423  and  MSS  v
    Belgium & Greece 53 EHRR 28 and emphasised the distinction made by  the
    Strasbourg court in Sufi and Elmi v UK 54 EHRR 209 at [282].

          "282.  If the dire humanitarian conditions in Somalia were solely
                 or even predominantly attributable to  poverty  or  to  the
                 State's  lack  of  resources  to  deal  with  a   naturally
                 occurring phenomenon, such as a drought, the test in N.  v.
                 the United Kingdom may well have been considered to be  the
                 appropriate one. However, it is clear  that  while  drought
                 has contributed to the humanitarian crisis, that crisis  is
                 predominantly due to the direct and indirect actions of the
                 parties to the conflict.  The  reports  indicate  that  all
                 parties  to  the  conflict  have  employed   indiscriminate
                 methods of warfare in densely populated urban areas with no
                 regard to  the  safety  of  the  civilian  population  (see
                 paragraphs 82, 123, 127, 132, 137, 139-140 and 160, above).
                 This fact alone has resulted in widespread displacement and
                 the   breakdown   of   social,   political   and   economic
                 infrastructures. Moreover, the situation has  been  greatly
                 exacerbated by al-Shabaab's refusal to permit international
                 aid agencies to operate in the  areas  under  its  control,
                 despite the fact that between a third and  a  half  of  all
                 Somalis are living in a situation  of  serious  deprivation
                 (see paragraphs 125, 131, 169, 187 and 193, above)."

16.   The court in Said went on to consider the findings made by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in MOJ relating to the humanitarian  conditions  in  Mogadishu
    and concluded that the findings made at [407] and  [408]  of  MOJ  were
    likely to have been connected to the issue of internal  relocation  and
    could not amount to a finding that  the  poor  humanitarian  conditions
    breached Article 3 "(save in extreme cases)" [26][28]. The  court  then
    considered what the  Upper  Tribunal  said  about  the  conditions  for
    Internally Displaced  Persons  (IDPs).  At  [30]  of  Said,  the  court
    recognised that some  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's  analysis  touched  on
    concerns relating to  violence  in  IDP  camps,  which  would  be  more
    relevant to an MSS  Article  3  analysis,  but  other  aspects  of  the
    evidence relating to destitution  would  be  more  relevant  to  the  D
    approach. The conflation of the two approaches meant that there was  no
    clear finding that the conditions in an IDP camp breached Article 3 per
    se. Indeed, the Upper Tribunal made clear that each case will  fall  to
    be decided on its own facts. The Court of Appeal concluded:

                      "31.     I  entirely   accept   that   some   of   the
                 observations made in the course of the  discussion  of  IDP
                 camps may be taken to suggest that if  a  returning  Somali
                 national can show that he is likely to  end  up  having  to
                 establish himself in an IDP camp, that would be  sufficient
                 to engage the protection of article 3.  Yet  such  a  stark
                 proposition of cause and effect would be inconsistent  with
                 the article 3 jurisprudence of  the  Strasbourg  Court  and
                 binding authority of the domestic courts.  In  my  judgment
                 the position is accurately stated in para 422. That draws a
                 proper  distinction  between  humanitarian  protection  and
                 article 3 and recognises that the individual  circumstances
                 of the person concerned must be considered.  An  appeal  to
                 article 3 which suggests that the  person  concerned  would
                 face  impoverished  conditions  of  living  on  removal  to
                 Somalia should, as the Strasbourg Court indicated  in  Sufi
                 and Elmi at para 292, be viewed by reference to the test in
                 the N case. Impoverished conditions which were  the  direct
                 result of violent activities may be viewed  differently  as
                 would cases where the risk suggested is of direct  violence
                 itself." [emphasis added]

17.   In so far as MA (Somalia) considered what was said in Said it did  not
    take the issue any further. In our assessment the highest Said goes  is
    to state that the findings in MOJ did not amount to a finding that  the
    conditions in IDP camps in Mogadishu in themselves amount to  a  breach
    of Article 3. The Court of Appeal did not find  that  Article  3  could
    never be engaged in such circumstances, but properly concluded that  it
    would depend on the individual circumstances of the  case  and  whether
    any of the principles in MSS and Sufi and  Elmi  applied.  Whether  the
    judge erred in relation to his assessment of Article 3 will  depend  on
    the nature of his findings on the facts of this case.

18.   The respondent's first and third points stand  or  fall  together.  In
    assessing the risk on return to Mogadishu  the  judge  was  obliged  to
    consider the country guidance decision in MOJ. He undertook that  task.
    He did so as part of  his  consideration  of  whether  the  appellant's
    refugee status had ceased [15] and when he turned to consider Article 3
    [20-22].  The process of assessing the  factual  circumstances  is  the
    same, whether it is undertaken in the context of the Refugee Convention
    or for the purposes of the European Convention. The judge set  out  the
    contents of the headnote to MOJ in full, and clearly had regard to  the
    guidance [8]. He made close reference  to  various  paragraphs  of  the
    headnote in MOJ and took  into  account  the  factors  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal suggested might be relevant [15].

19.   At [19], the judge turned to consider Article 3. It is  not  arguable,
    as Ms Cunha suggested, that the judge indirectly placed the  burden  on
    the  Secretary  of  State  in  relation  to  Article  3.  He  correctly
    identified that the burden was on the Secretary of State in relation to
    the issue of cessation [15],  and  he  correctly  identified  that  the
    burden was on the appellant in relation to Article 3 [19]. At [20],  he
    set out similar factors to the ones he had already considered. He  took
    into account the fact that the appellant spoke English  and  understood
    some Swahili. He noted that the appellant did not speak  or  understand
    Somali. He was satisfied that the appellant, who came to the UK when he
    was only one year old, did not have any ties to  Somalia.  Nor  did  he
    have any cultural connections or a network of social or clan ties  that
    he could fall back on to assist him to adapt to life in Somalia.  Those
    findings were open to him on the evidence.

20.   It was open to the judge to conclude that the  appellant's  family  in
    the UK were unable to provide any  meaningful  financial  support.  The
    appellant lives with his  mother,  who  suffers  from  depression  with
    psychotic features. She does not work and is reliant on  public  funds.
    Similarly, the evidence given by the appellant's father was that he was
    unemployed. The appellant said that his father recently gave him  �5-�6
    to visit his probation officer, but the sum was so insignificant it did
    not indicate that his father was likely to be able to  provide  regular
    remittances to the appellant that would make any meaningful  difference
    to his situation. The judge's finding that the appellant's  family  was
    unable  to  provide  remittances  was  within  a  range  of  reasonable
    responses to the evidence.

21.    Although  the  judge  recognised  that  the   appellant   had   "some
    preliminary qualifications", he had no demonstrable employment history.
    His profile suggested that there were not likely to be  any  "immediate
    employment opportunities without support" in Mogadishu. The  judge  was
    satisfied that the up-to-date evidence relating to  the  conditions  in
    Mogadishu did not disclose any material  change  in  the  circumstances
    since the country guidance  decision.  Although  the  judge's  decision
    refers to "MHA" it is reasonable to infer that this is a  typographical
    error and that the judge was in fact referring to the country  guidance
    in MOJ [21].

22.   The judge was aware that  there  is  a  "rehabilitation  allowance  on
    voluntary returns": [21]. Ms Cunha made  much  of  this  issue  at  the
    hearing, suggesting that this was a potential source of  funding  which
    the judge had wrongly left out of account.  However, it is difficult to
    see how the judge could fairly be said to have erred in concluding that
    there was no evidence to indicate that the  appellant  would  be  given
    such an allowance. The respondent's decision letters  include  standard
    information about the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS),  but  they  make
    clear that it was only an option "if you are accepted by  the  scheme".
    Mr Georget argued that  the  respondent's  policy  on  the  Facilitated
    Return Scheme (Version 8.0 - 03/10/16) makes clear that it only applies
    if a person is willing to make a voluntary departure, and in any event,
    the appellant was ineligible because he was pursuing a  protection  and
    human rights claim on appeal. In the absence of any evidence to support
    the Secretary of State's assertion that the appellant would be  granted
    financial support under the scheme, the judge was clearly  entitled  to
    make the finding he did, and the contrary is not reasonably arguable.

23.   In any event, the amount provided by the scheme is  only  a  temporary
    stop gap to assist a person to re-establish themselves on  return.  The
    same factors identified by the judge that might act as barriers to  the
    appellant being able to establish a life in Mogadishu  would  still  be
    apparent after a short period of initial financial support. He does not
    speak Somali, the main language spoken in Mogadishu, and has no social,
    cultural or familial connections that might  assist  him  to  secure  a
    livelihood.

24.   The appellant is a from a  minority  group  that  does  not  have  any
    meaningful connections or influence in Mogadishu.  The  Country  Policy
    and Information Note on Somalia relating to majority clans and minority
    groups in south and central Somalia, which was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, states that the Bajuni live in Kismayo  and  the  surrounding
    islands [5.4.1]. The report states that even in  their  home  area  the
    local Bajuni  population  is  being  exploited  by  Somali  businessmen
    [5.4.2]. Some Bajunis live in Mogadishu,  in  an  area  which  includes
    other coastal groups. However, the district  administration  is  mainly
    made up of members of a majority clan (Hawiye)  [5.4.3].  Although  the
    judge did not specifically refer to the  fact  that  the  appellant  is
    Bajuni, it is clear he was aware of the fact and that he had regard  to
    relevant factors that might lead to a  person  from  a  minority  group
    being  forced  into  the  unacceptable  humanitarian  conditions  of  a
    makeshift IDP camp [2][22].

25.   Paragraph (vii) of the headnote in MOJ states that a person will  need
    to look to family members for assistance to re-establish himself and to
    secure a livelihood. The Tribunal noted that a  person  might  also  be
    able to seek assistance from clan members who are not close  relatives,
    but such assistance is unlikely to be forthcoming from minority  groups
    who are more disadvantaged and "may have little to  offer".  The  judge
    considered the factors outlined at paragraph (ix) of  the  headnote  to
    MOJ, including whether the appellant had any connections to  Mogadishu,
    access  to  financial   resources,   employment   prospects   and   the
    availability of remittances from abroad. Even if the appellant  is  fit
    and able to work, the  evidence  shows  that  a  person  must  rely  on
    familial or clan connections in  order  to  secure  a  livelihood.  The
    reason why the appellant did not have those connections was because his
    family are not from Mogadishu. Even if there is a small Bajuni presence
    in Mogadishu the country guidance indicates that a minority group would
    have little to offer in terms of support.

26.   Paragraph (xii) of the MOJ headnote  states  that  those  who  do  not
    originate from Mogadishu might be able to relocate to the city  without
    being  subject  to  Article  15(c)  risk  or   risk   of   destitution.
    Importantly, however, it goes on to say that  relocation  to  Mogadishu
    for a person from a minority group with no former links to the city, no
    access to funds and no other form of clan, family or social support  is
    unlikely to be realistic and may lead to the real possibility of having
    to live in conditions that would  fall  below  acceptable  humanitarian
    standards. The appellant's case fell squarely within this aspect of the
    guidance.

27.   The judge found that the appellant  would  be  viewed  as  an  obvious
    "Westerner", which might place him at increased risk  of  targeting  or
    robbery. Since the appellant has lived in the UK for most of his  life,
    and has no experience of life in Somalia, it was open to the  judge  to
    conclude that he had no knowledge  of  Somali  "street  life  or  other
    general survival skills within Somalia" [20].

28.   Whether minority group status might be a factor that  could  direct  a
    case down the MSS route of assessment was not considered by  the  Court
    of Appeal in Said or MA (Somalia). It is not clear  whether  the  judge
    was referred to the decision in Said. The First-tier Tribunal  decision
    does not make any clear distinction between the two paths that could be
    taken with reference to the Strasbourg case law. However, what is clear
    is that the judge found that a  number  of  factors  distinguished  the
    appellant's circumstances from  those  of  the  average  returnee  with
    previous experience of life in Somalia who may still  have  connections
    there. It is also clear that he considered factors that  were  relevant
    to the approach taken in MSS and Sufi and Elmi. At [22] he  noted  that
    the IDP camps arose due to large scale conflict and the displacement of
    minority populations, and due to the lack of any effective government.

29.   The evidence indicated that this was a case that was  appropriate  for
    assessment under the MSS route. The Secretary of State's own report  on
    majority clans and minority groups in south and central  Somalia  dated
    January 2019 accepted that minority group members in Mogadishu  without
    support networks, skills or education, and who have no real prospect of
    securing access to a livelihood are generally likely to face  difficult
    living conditions that amount to serious harm [2.4.13].

30.   Although the Tribunal in  MOJ  did  not  find  that  membership  of  a
    minority group, taken alone, gave rise to a real risk of serious  harm,
    the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  continued  to  show  that
    minority groups are more likely to face political, social, economic and
    judicial  discrimination  and  human  rights  abuses  [2.4.19].   Other
    evidence showed that minority groups make up a disproportionate part of
    the population of the informal settlements in Mogadishu  and  are  more
    likely to have been displaced by conflict [5.1.2]. Minority groups  are
    still  disproportionately  subjected  to   killings,   torture,   rape,
    kidnapping for ransom and looting. Many minority  communities  continue
    to live  in  "deep  poverty  and  to  suffer  from  numerous  forms  of
    discrimination  and  exclusion"  [5.1.4].  The  same  report   included
    evidence to show that members of minority groups are  potentially  more
    vulnerable to criminal acts  such  as  robbery  [5.1.6].  The  security
    forces were generally  ineffective  and  lacked  sufficient  resources.
    Security forces abused civilians and often failed to prevent or respond
    to societal violence [7.2.1].  Most  people  in  IDP  camps  come  from
    minority communities. A significant proportion felt  threatened  within
    the camps by criminals and the police. The camps are  not  secure  from
    "government-affiliated  militia,  which  despise  the  minority  clans"
    [8.1.3].

31.   The evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  the  present  case
    indicated that the conditions the appellant would face in Mogadishu  do
    not arise from the usual kind of poverty or deprivation.  The  evidence
    made  clear  that  minority  groups  are  more  likely  to  face   such
    deprivation, are more likely to be physically attacked in IDP camps and
    that government-affiliated groups are likely to be involved  in  abuses
    within the camps. As a member of a minority group and  someone  who  is
    likely to be identified as a 'Westerner' the appellant would also be at
    greater risk of  attack  for  the  purpose  of  robbery.  Although  the
    situation in Mogadishu has changed to some extent since the decision in
    Sufi  &  Elmi,  the   evidence   shows   that   minority   groups   are
    disproportionately more likely to be the  subject  of  deprivation  and
    human rights abuses. Some of those abuses  are  carried  out  with  the
    active support or acquiescence of the state. In such circumstances, the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal clearly pointed to the kind  of
    circumstances that engaged the MSS route of assessment.

32.   The judge was required to evaluate whether there was a real risk  that
    the appellant would face conditions that were sufficiently  serious  to
    amount to a breach of Article 3. It  was  open  to  him  to  take  into
    account the fact that the appellant would be  a  stranger  to  Somalia,
    that he only spoke English and understood some Swahili, that he has  no
    familial or clan connections that would assist him to establish himself
    in Mogadishu, that there was no evidence to show that he would  receive
    funds under the Facilitated Returns Scheme or that his family were able
    to afford remittances. It was also open to him to take into account the
    fact that the IDP camps largely comprise of minority populations  where
    people are forced to live in  conditions  that  fall  below  acceptable
    humanitarian standards.

33.   We bear in mind the recent comments of the Court of Appeal in UT  (Sri
    Lanka) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1095. Although the  decision  might  have
    benefited from a better structure, and could  have  been  more  clearly
    expressed in places, it is apparent that the judge  considered  factors
    that were relevant to a proper assessment of Article 3,  and  that  his
    overall conclusion was within a range of reasonable  responses  to  the
    evidence. The Secretary of State's arguments  consist  largely  of  the
    repetition of general submissions made to the First-tier Tribunal. They
    fail to disclose any errors of law that  would  have  made  a  material
    difference to the outcome of the decision.

34.   We agree that the judge's findings relating to Article  8  are  rather
    confused and lack structure, but the judge was entitled to rely on  his
    findings relating to Article 3. Even  if  there  is  an  error  in  the
    judge's  approach  to  Article  8,  it  would  have  made  no  material
    difference to the  outcome  of  the  appeal  brought  on  human  rights
    grounds.

35.   We conclude that the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  relating  to  the
    human rights claim did not involve the making of a  material  error  of
    law.
