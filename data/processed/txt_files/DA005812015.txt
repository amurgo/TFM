For the Appellant:         Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Livingstone

For the Respondent:    Mr Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge David C Clapham SSC, dismissing his appeal against deportation to
    Poland under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 20016.



 2. Ground 1 is headed "failing to apply the 'serious grounds' standard  in
    the correct manner". It is broken down into (i)  offences  insufficient
    to merit a finding of serious grounds; (ii) absence of any findings  on
    assessment of low risk; (iii) failure to  recognise  2  convictions  of
    September 2015 as isolated  offences;  (iv)  failure  to  recognise  no
    reoffending in 5 months since release; (v) no finding  on  whether  the
    appellant  represents  a  "genuine  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat"; (vi) cannot be said that the appellant was a  genuine  present
    and sufficiently serious  threat;  and  (vii)  tribunal  influenced  at
    paragraph 57 by the 'public  interest',  which  is  irrelevant  to  EEA
    offenders.

 3. Ground 2 is headed "failing to consider rehabilitation  when  assessing
    proportionality" and is broken down into (i) failure to assess  whether
    the appellant has rehabilitated himself, and if so whether it is  still
    proportionate  to  return  him  and  (ii)  failure  to  assess  whether
    prospects for rehabilitation better than UK than Poland,  the  tribunal
    being under a duty to undertake such assessment whether or  not  raised
    by the appellant; better prospects in the  UK  where  his  fiancï¿½e  and
    children and sister live, etc.

 4. The main points which I noted from the submissions  for  the  appellant
    were as follows. The Presenting Officer in the FtT emphasised the  fact
    of the appellant's re-offending while on bail, a point also given great
    significance by the judge.  The grant of  permission  implied  that  in
    relation to rehabilitation the judge might not have taken account of  a
    number of relevant factors. The judge's description of the  appellant's
    offending at paragraph 46 as  "of  the  gravest  significance"  was  an
    overstatement.  The  appellant's  representative  in   the   first-tier
    tribunal had submitted that the appellant did  not  know  what  he  was
    involving himself in. The judge had been right to note that would  have
    been a defence and to discount it, but it was unclear  to  what  extent
    the judge accepted that  the  appellant  had  been  under  pressure  to
    offend. The judge noted at paragraph 46 that a drink-driving offence in
    2011 would not "on its own" merit deportation, which  implied  that  he
    had taken it into account to  some  extent  when  basing  his  eventual
    decision on the appellant's offending. That was taking  something  into
    account which ought to have been entirely  excluded.  Contrary  to  the
    grounds, Mr Caskie (correctly) accepted that there is a public interest
    in deportation in an EU case, although the regulations  frame  that  in
    different terms to the deportation scheme in non-EU cases. This  was  a
    case  where  "serious  grounds"  had  to  be  established.  The  family
    situation was accepted, including children aged 7  and  9  years,  both
    here since birth. The  older  child  by  the  date  of  the  first-tier
    tribunal decision was within months of having a right to register as  a
    UK citizen. That length of residence, particularly in the case  of  the
    older child, had not been taken into account. It  was  unclear  whether
    the judge in his eventual conclusion at paragraph 57 properly  excluded
    any deterrent element, as he was bound to do. The decision also  failed
    to distinguish clearly  between  mere  grounds  of  public  policy  and
    serious grounds of public policy. As  the  appellant  might  well  have
    fallen to have his case differentiated between those 2  standards,  the
    required  analysis  was  missing.  The  likely  rehabilitation  of  the
    appellant in the UK had not been factored in. Those were errors such as
    to require a fresh decision in the first-tier tribunal.

 5. I asked what case, if any, had been  put  to  the  first-tier  tribunal
    regarding rehabilitation and the  relative  risks  of  reoffending.  Mr
    Caskie said there was a social work report finding the appellant of low
    risk, and this had to be evaluated in  the  context  of  his  partner's
    position that if he were deported to Poland, she and the children would
    stay here.

 6. The main points I took from the  submission  for  the  respondent  were
    these. The judge had clearly been aware of his task, and  set  out  the
    threshold correctly at paragraph 47. Even if there were not a  separate
    sentence explicitly to that effect, it was plain that the decision  was
    based on a finding that deportation was merited on serious grounds, and
    of a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
    the fundamental interests of society, specified at paragraph 48. It was
    hardly surprising that the judge focused in particular  on  the  second
    drugs offence, committed while the appellant was on bail for the first.
    That was clearly the most serious  feature  of  the  case.  Given  that
    behaviour, the judgement reached was  well  within  the  scope  of  the
    judge. Any lack of an express conclusion was  plainly  immaterial.  The
    appellant  had  not  chosen  to  make  anything  of  the  prospects  of
    rehabilitation comparatively in the UK and  in  Poland,  so  the  judge
    would have been right to assume that rehabilitation prospects were more
    or less the same in either country. That was only one  element  of  the
    judgement, and there was no reason to think in any event the judge  had
    got it wrong. All the circumstances to which the appellant now referred
    had clearly been before the  judge  in  the  first-tier  tribunal.  The
    decision was not affected by any error of law.

 7. Dealing with a comment I had made in course of submissions,  Mr  Caskie
    submitted that  where  the  judge  used  the  phrase  "of  the  gravest
    significance" at paragraph 46, he was placing  reoffending  within  the
    scale of criminal offending,  not  in  relation  to  the  test  of  the
    regulations.  He  also  said  that  although  the  presenting   officer
    suggested that rehabilitation was not a major issue in the  case,  that
    could hardly be so; if there were no risk of reoffending, that could be
    no serious  grounds,  and  the  protective  factors,  family  life  and
    employment, were in the UK.

 8. I reserved my decision.

 9. The judge did not wrongly apply an element of deterrence.  He  said  at
    paragraph 48, "Matters isolated from the particulars of the case  which
    relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do  not  justify  the
    decision".

10. The clear and fair reading of the judge's comment at  paragraph  46  is
    that he was evaluating the drugs offences in relation to the  threshold
    of the regulations, and no more.  It  would  be  plain  that,  although
    serious, this is not the very highest category of criminal offending.

11. The drink-driving offending played no material part in the outcome.







12. I am unable to derive  from  the  grounds  and  submissions  more  than
    disagreement with the assessment reached by the FtT,  firmly  based  on
    the facts and evidence, and applying the correct test.  It is plain the
    test was recognised, as that is what the case presented by  both  sides
    was all about, and it is quoted.  There is no reason to think the judge
    had anything less in mind when reaching his conclusion.

13. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
