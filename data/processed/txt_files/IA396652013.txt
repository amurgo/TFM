Representation:

For the Appellant:     no appearance in person or by legal representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. Neither the appellant nor anyone instructed  on  her  behalf  appeared
      before me. The notice of hearing was sent to her last notified address
      and has not, so far as  I  am  aware,  been  returned  undelivered.  I
      therefore proceeded to determine  the  appeal  and  announced  at  the
      hearing that I was going to dismiss  the  appeal  and  would  give  my
      written reasons later which I now do.


   2. The respondent, for reasons set out in the decision dated 20 September
      2013 refused to vary the appellant's  leave  to  remain  from  Tier  4
      (General) Migrant to Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  and  made  a  decision  to
      remove her pursuant to s47  Immigration  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
      2006. The First-tier Tribunal in a determination promulgated  on  12th
      September 2014 dismissed her appeal against that decision. She  sought
      and was granted permission to appeal on the grounds
   a) the judge erred in failing to consider whether the  decision  breached
      Article 8
   b) the judge erred in failing to consider "evidential flexibility"
   c) the judge erred in determining what evidence was before the respondent
      when she made her decision
   d) the judge erred in failing to consider whether  the  appellant  should
      have been granted discretionary leave given  that  she  fulfilled  the
      spirit albeit not the letter of the law
   e) the judge erred in making significant errors of fact.


   3. For some reason  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  made  an  anonymity
      direction. There is no basis for such a direction; the  appellant  has
      not asserted that she fears persecution (if she did the proper  course
      is to claim international protection) and there is no  submission  why
      such a direction should  have  been  made  other  than  that  she  has
      contacts with high profile people and she has a duty to protect  their
      privacy. The appellant is involved in public proceedings; the  letters
      in support were written either for those proceedings or to support  an
      application. None of them have asked for anonymity. There is no  basis
      for these proceedings to be anonymised. I lift the anonymity order.



   4. The appellant does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
      The findings of the judge in so far as  the  funding  asserted  to  be
      available from Lord M, the issue of the Venture Capital  Business  and
      the failure to produce evidence that funds for the  proposed  business
      were held in a regulated financial institution  were  not  challenged.
      The challenge was that the judge failed to take account of  the  power
      of attorney held by her over her mother's account and that meant  that
      she could meet the maintenance requirements. Although the judge  erred
      in her conclusion that the  Power  of  Attorney  was  not  before  the
      respondent, that error is not material. Even if the  judge  had  found
      that she had access  to  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the  maintenance
      requirements, she  still  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules in so far as Attributes were concerned.

   5. The appellant relies  on  the  "evidential  flexibility  policy".  The
      finding that at the date of application the  applicant  did  not  have
      access to the required funds is  not  challenged.  In  particular  the
      finding in paragraph 43 of the  determination  that  at  the  date  of
      application the funds were not in the client account of the  firm  but
      were expected imminently and that the funds were nothing more  than  a
      pledge is not challenged. Although evidence produced subsequent to the
      respondent's decision showed that as at 9th October  2013  there  were
      funds this evidence not only post dates the application but  does  not
      provide evidence  that  the  funds  were  in  place  on  the  date  of
      application. There is no requirement on the part of the respondent  to
      request information, which on the face of  the  application  does  not
      appear to be available and does not fall into the category as set  out
      in paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules.  But  even  if  she  had
      requested further information of funds available as  at  the  date  of
      application, those funds were not there as  confirmed  by  the  letter
      from the accountants stating that the funds were expected  imminently.
      There is no error of law in the failure of the respondent to  exercise
      'evidential flexibility" and no error of law in the judge  failing  to
      take account of evidence that  post-dates  the  application  when  she
      considered  whether  the  applicant  met  the  requirements   of   the
      Immigration Rules.


   6. In so far as the pleaded ground that  the  judge  failed  to  consider
      whether the respondent should have exercised her discretion  to  grant
      leave to remain given she met the spirit if not the letter of the law,
      there is no such discretion in the PBS Rules. Although the  respondent
      does of course retain an inherent right to exercise her discretion  if
      she considers it appropriate, the failure to exercise such  discretion
      is not a matter susceptible to statutory  appeal  (s86(6)  Nationality
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002); the proper remedy for such challenge
      is by way of judicial review. There is no error of law  by  the  judge
      failing  to  consider  and  make  findings  on  the  exercise  of  the
      respondent's discretion.

   7. In so far as the alleged errors of fact  are  concerned,  the  judge's
      findings are not errors of fact:  he  correctly  identified  that  the
      funds asserted to be available from Lord M were not in fact there  and
      he correctly found that Equity Stake Limited were not providing funds.
      There is no error of fact such as to amount to an error of law.

   8. In so far as Article 8 is concerned, the  grounds  seeking  permission
      also refer to s6 Human Rights Act 1998. Although the respondent in her
      decision did not address Article  8  because  the  appellant  had  not
      previously raised this, the respondent included in the decision a s120
      notice; the appellant relied upon Article 8 human  rights  grounds  in
      her grounds of appeal - as she was entitled to do in  accordance  with
      s84 Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the judge erred in
      law in failing to reach a decision on that ground of appeal - she  was
      required to reach a decision on  all  grounds  argued.  The  issue  is
      whether such error was material such that the decision of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal should be set aside to be remade.

   9. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal as regards Article  8  was
      as follows:

   a) The appellant has lived in the UK since 2005.
   b) She does not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
   c) She has established a wide circle of friends and business contacts.
   d) To undertake a similar business enterprise in  Belarus  would  involve
      her in undertaking research etc of an economic  and  legal  base  with
      which she is unfamiliar given her length of residence in  the  UK  and
      the skills she has acquired whilst here.
   e) Her business in the UK, when established will create jobs.
   f) She has the potential to establish a successful business and a  number
      of prominent people have attested to her enthusiasm and skills.
   g) She has integrated into British Society  and  has  initiated  projects
      promoting home and international projects for young people.
   h) She has become a high profile member of the artistic community.
   i) She has a strong relationship with a person and they intend to  marry;
      they do not live together; he cannot go to  her  country  although  he
      does not say why not. He says she cannot go to  his  country  (Latvia)
      but does not say why not. It is not clear what his immigration  status
      in the UK is, how long he  has  been  in  the  UK  or  whether  he  is
      exercising Treaty Rights as a Latvian citizen. No evidence other  than
      assertion that he had a business was produced.
   j) She previously won an immigration appeal in  2009  to  enable  her  to
      continue her studies.


  10. The grounds do not identify any other evidence  that  was  before  the
      judge and there is none apparent from the papers.


  11. Although removal of the appellant from the UK will interfere with  her
      private life, she has not established family life, albeit there is  an
      intention to do so in the future. There was  no  explanation  why  she
      could not live with her fianc� in Belarus or why she  could  not  live
      with him in Latvia or why she could not apply for leave to enter as  a
      spouse or fianc�e in the future.  Although  she  had  previously  been
      successful in an appeal that was involved  with  the  interruption  to
      studies, those studies have now been completed and  the  decision  the
      subject of  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  against  a
      decision to refuse to vary her leave to  remain.  Furthermore  it  was
      some considerable time ago and a decision is taken  on  the  basis  of
      relevant facts at the date of hearing. There is no other submission as
      to why that decision is relevant other  than  she  has  a  history  of
      success in the tribunal against a decision of the respondent.  Part  5
      of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2014 came into force  on
      28th July 2014. The judge failed  to  take  account  of  this  and  in
      particular to consider s117B of the 2002 Act.

  12. The appellant has been in the  UK  lawfully  since  2005;  she  speaks
      English; she has been financially independent whilst here  in  the  UK
      and the evidence, which was produced after the decision confirms  that
      she has financial  backing  for  her  business  proposition.  S117B(5)
      states that little weight should be given to private life  established
      in the UK when status is precarious. S117B also refers to  the  public
      interest in maintaining effective immigration control.

  13. The dictionary definition of 'precarious'  includes  phrases  such  as
      dependant on chance, uncertain, insecure. Plainly the appellant had  a
      student visa; her residence in the UK as a  student  was  not  thereby
      precarious. She had lawful valid  status  which  was  not  subject  to
      challenge and was certain. Her residence during her period of  studies
      with a student visa was not subject to chance.

  14. The appellant does not fall foul of s117B.

  15. The factors set out in s117B are not exhaustive and the fact  that  an
      applicant meets those criteria does not mean that s/he succeeds in  an
      appeal on Article  8  grounds.  The  Tribunal  is  still  required  to
      undertake a 'balancing act" and to  assess  the  applicant's  history,
      background, circumstances and so on in the context of  the  overriding
      public interest in maintaining effective immigration control.

  16. As was made clear in Patel [2013] UKSC 72, Article 8 is not a  general
      dispensing power; Article 8 is concerned with private or  family  life
      and not education as such. The same approach is relevant to this case.
      The fact that the appellant may (although I make no  finding  in  that
      regard) now be able to meet the requirements of the Rules  is  not  an
      argument in support of a finding that the  objectives  of  immigration
      control should carry less weight - see [45] and  [56]  of  Patel.  For
      this applicant, she did not meet the Rules, she may meet the Rules now
      as an entrepreneur, she does not meet the 'long residence'  rules  and
      she has not established family life in the UK. Throughout her time  in
      the UK she has been on a  visa  that  was  limited  in  time  with  no
      expectation that she would be able to remain permanently.

  17. Taking all of those matters into account it is  inconceivable  that  a
      judge would have found that her private life in the UK was such as  to
      outweigh the overriding interest and objective of immigration control.
      Her appeal on Article 8  grounds  would  not  have  been  allowed  and
      therefore,  although  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  erred  in  not
      reaching a decision on all the pleaded grounds, the outcome would have
      been the same namely her appeal would have been dismissed.

  18. Mr Tufan informed me that although he had not received an  explanation
      why the appellant had not attended the hearing, he was aware  tat  she
      had submitted an application for a residence permit as the  spouse  of
      an EEA national. This may be the explanation why she has not  attended
      the hearing today.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside to be re-made.

     I do not set aside the decision


    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


    I lift that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008).
