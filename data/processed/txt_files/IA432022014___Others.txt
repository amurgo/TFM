Representation
For the Appellants:    Mr A. Chohan, Counsel instructed by Immigration
                    Chambers (Ilford)
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Kola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellants are citizens of India. The first and second appellants
       are married and the third and fourth appellants are  their  children.
       The second, third and fourth appellants are dependents of  the  first
       appellant, whose date  of  birth  is  10  February  1978,  and  their
       immigration status depends on her. In this appeal I will refer to the
       first appellant as the appellant.

    2. The appellant entered the UK as a Tier  4  General  Student  and  was
       thereafter granted leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  Post  Study  Work
       Migrant until 17 August 2014.

    3. On 12 June 2014 she took over and became the director  of  a  company
       called 3D Accountax Ltd, which changed its name to Simhan  Morden  HR
       Consultant Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "the company").

    4. On 16 August 2014 she applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System.

    5. This appeal arises from the respondent's decision, dated  15  October
       2014, to refuse the appellant's application for leave to remain as  a
       Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the decision of First-tier Tribunal
       ("FtT") Judge Grant, promulgated on  20  May  2015,  to  dismiss  the
       appellant's appeal.

  Relevant Immigration Rules

    6. The Immigration Rules that are relevant to this appeal are set out in
       Appendix A  and  are:  provision  (d)  in  Table  4;  the  evidential
       requirements in Paragraph 41-SD(e); and Paragraph 46-SD (c) (iii).

    7. Under provision (d) in Table 4 the appellant was  required  to  show,
       inter alia, that from 11 July 2014 until the date of the  application
       she was continuously engaged in business activity and registered with
       HMRC as self employed or with Companies House as a director of a  new
       or existing business.

    8. Under Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) the appellant was required to  provide,
       in support of her application, for a period commencing before 11 July
       2014 up to no earlier than  three  months  before  the  date  of  the
       application, advertising  material,  including  printouts  of  online
       advertising, that had been published locally or  nationally,  showing
       her name together with the business activity.

    9. Under Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) the appellant was required  to  provide,
       for a period commencing before 11 July 2014 up  to  no  earlier  than
       three months  before  the  date  of  the  application,  one  or  more
       contracts for service.

   10. Under Paragraph 46SD(c) (iii) the appellant was required  to  provide
       documentation from HMRC confirming that her business  was  registered
       for corporation tax.

  Decision of the respondent and the FtT

   11. The respondent accepted that the requirements of (d) in Table 4  were
       met including that the appellant had been continuously engaged  since
       11 July 2014 in a  business  of  which  she  was  registered  as  the
       director, but did not accept that the requirements of paragraphs  41-
       SD(e)(iii), 41-SD(e)(iv) or 46-SD(c) (iii) were satisfied and because
       of this rejected the application.

   12. In respect of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii), the respondent stated that the
       advertising material submitted by the appellant  was  from  after  11
       July 2014. In respect of 41-SD(e)(iv), the respondent's position  was
       that the contract submitted by the appellant, although stated  to  be
       effective from 1 February 2014 (ie before 11 July 2014),  was  signed
       on 15 July 2014 (ie after 11 July 2014). With respect to the evidence
       of corporation tax  required  under  paragraph  46-SD(c)  (iii),  the
       respondent stated that this was not submitted.

   13. The appellant appealed and her appeal was heard by FtT  Judge  Grant.
       The  FtT  considered  each  of  the  three  grounds  upon  which  the
       respondent had refused the application and agreed with them  for  the
       reasons the respondent  gave.  With  regard  to  evidence  concerning
       registration for corporation tax, the judge stated that  he  did  not
       believe the appellant's claim to have submitted a  letter  from  HMRC
       with her unique tax reference number on it as he did not believe  the
       respondent would overlook an HMRC document if it had  been  genuinely
       supplied.

  Grounds of appeal

   14. The grounds of appeal submit that the FtT erred because:
        a.  Sufficient  advertising  material  had  been   submitted.   The
           appellant had taken over an  existing  business  and  there  was
           evidence of paying for ongoing material on 3 July 2014.
        b. There was a continuous contract in place from  before  11   July
           2014 and the judge erred by treating the contract signed  on  15
           July 2014 as a new  contract  rather  than  an  addendum  to  an
           existing contract to reflect only a change in name and  addition
           of services.
        c. There was no basis for stating  that  the  appellant  was  being
           untruthful about submitting the HMRC document.   There  were  no
           findings to question her credibility and it was more likely than
           not it was submitted with the application

Consideration

   15. Paragraphs 41-SD and 46-SD of Appendix A  to  the  Immigration  Rules
       stipulate  specified  documents  that  must  be  submitted  with   an
       application. This appeal turns on three such categories  of  document
       that the respondent did not accept, but which the appellant contends,
       were properly submitted with the application. I will consider each in
       turn.

Advertising material under paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)

   16. Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) provides that:
           '(e) If the applicant is applying under the provisions in (d) in
           Table 4, he must also provide  one  or  more  of  the  following
           specified documents covering (either together or individually) a
           continuous period commencing  before  11  July  2014  up  to  no
           earlier than three months before the date of his application:
                (1) advertising or marketing material,  including  printouts
                of online advertising, that has been  published  locally  or
                nationally, showing the applicant's name (and  the  name  of
                the business  if  applicable)  together  with  the  business
                activity  or,  where  his  business   is   trading   online,
                confirmation of his ownership of  the  domain  name  of  the
                business's website,
                (2) article(s) or online links to article(s) in a  newspaper
                or other publication showing the applicant's name  (and  the
                name of  the  business  if  applicable)  together  with  the
                business activity,
                (3) information from a trade fair, at  which  the  applicant
                has had a stand  or  given  a  presentation  to  market  his
                business, showing the applicant's name (and the name of  the
                business if applicable) together with the business activity,
                or
                (4) personal registration with a UK trade body linked to the
                applicant's occupation;'

   17. Mr Chohan, for the appellant, argued that the material  submitted  by
       the appellant was sufficient  to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  this
       paragraph. At the error of law hearing Mr Chohan, at my request, took
       the tribunal through the material that  had  been  submitted  by  the
       appellant to the respondent. The first document was  an  invoice  for
       ï¿½650 dated 3 July 2014 for business cards,  letterheads  and  flyers,
       website design, domain hosting and social media marketing. The second
       document was an undated copy of a business card.  The  third  was  an
       undated copy of a leaflet stating "proof" on it. The fourth  document
       was a copy of a draft leaflet dated in the bottom right hand corner 2
       July 2014.

   18. It is clear that the FtT has taken the aforementioned  evidence  into
       consideration. At paragraph [7] it states that the appellant, in oral
       evidence, confirmed she received the final draft on 2 July 2014 of  a
       brochure. This can only be a reference  to  the  document  Mr  Chohan
       identified at the hearing. Whilst I accept that this brochure, if  it
       were final, could  constitute  advertising  material  that  satisfies
       Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii), the evidence before the FtT  was  that  this
       was only a draft brochure.  Only  on  a  strained  interpretation  of
       Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii) could it be  said  that  draft  documentation
       satisfies the requirement and therefore I find it was open to the FtT
       to conclude that the appellant had not satisfied the requirements  of
       the Rule.

The contract under paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv)

   19. Paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) provides that:
           'If the applicant is applying under the  provisions  in  (d)  in
           Table 4, he must also provide  one  or  more  of  the  following
           documents showing trading, which must cover (either together  or
           individually) a continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014
           up to no earlier than  three  months  before  the  date  of  his
           application:
                (1) one or more contracts for service. If a contract is  not
                an original the applicant must sign each page. Each contract
                must show:
                    (a) the applicant's name and the name of the business,
                    (b) the service provided by the applicant's business;
                    (c) the name of the other party or parties  involved  in
                    the contract and their contact details, including  their
                    full address, postal code and, where available, landline
                    phone number and any email address; and
                    (d) the duration of the contract;'

   20. I accept  Mr  Chohan's  argument  that  the  FtT  has  erred  in  its
       interpretation of the contract but because of my findings in  respect
       of the advertising material and HMRC documentation the error  is  not
       material.

   21. The contract in question is between a third party and the appellant's
       company and was in existence, and covered a period, prior to 11  July
       2014. The appellant, upon becoming director of the company  -  before
       11 July 2014 - became responsible for  the  contract.  Paragraph  41-
       SD(e)(iv) requires the appellant to submit  a  contract  for  service
       covering  a continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 up to no
       earlier than three months before the date  of  his  application.  The
       evidence demonstrates that she had done this and  therefore  the  FtT
       erred (but not materially) in finding she had not.

   Evidence of corporation tax required under paragraph 46-SD(c)(iii)

   22. Paragraph 46-SD(c) (iii) provides:
           'If the applicant is a director of a business, the business must
           be registered for corporation tax and the applicant must provide
           documentation from HM Revenue & Customs which confirms this.'

   23. Mr Chohan argued that there was no basis for  the  FtT  to  find  the
       appellant was not telling the truth about submitting  a  letter  from
       the HMRC confirming the company was registered for  corporation  tax.
       The company was registered and there was no reason to doubt that  she
       submitted the required information. If the respondent  did  not  have
       the HMRC documentation amongst the  papers  the  appellant  submitted
       with her application it was  not  because  the  appellant  failed  to
       supply it.

   24. Mr Kotas argued, in response,  that  the  FtT  was  entitled  to  not
       believe the appellant. He drew my attention to the appellant's bundle
       before the FtT. In that bundle the documents relating to the  company
       being registered with  HMRC  are  dated  after  the  application  was
       submitted to the respondent. Mr Kotas questioned  why  the  appellant
       would not include in her bundle the letter from HMRC she  purportedly
       submitted to the respondent. I put this to Mr Chohan and gave him  an
       opportunity to locate the said document but he was unable to do so.

   25. Having considered the submissions made by Mr Chohan and Mr  Kotas,  I
       am satisfied that the FtT did not make an error  of  law  by  finding
       that the  appellant  did  not  submit  the  evidence  required  under
       Paragraph 46-SD(c) (iii). In the refusal letter the respondent stated
       categorically that the appellant  did  not  submit  evidence  of  her
       business being registered. The appellant's response to  this  was  to
       assert that she did. However, in the bundle submitted to the FtT  the
       appellant included only a letter from HMRC dated 6 December 2014  and
       a letter dated 19 April 2015. Given that her application was made  on
       16 August 2014,  it  is  clear  that  these  are  not  the  documents
       submitted with the application. I further note that the letter  dated
       6 December 2014 is a letter from HMRC that appears to be  written  in
       response to a question asking for confirmation of the  company's  tax
       reference number. If documentation from HMRC  was  submitted  to  the
       respondent on 16 August 2014 it raises the question  as  to  why  the
       appellant felt it necessary to request  the  information  again  such
       that she received a letter confirming her tax reference less  than  4
       months later. Given the absence of documentation to  corroborate  the
       appellant's account  (i.e.  a  copy  of  what  she  claimed  to  have
       submitted to the respondent), it was open to the FtT to find that the
       appellant had not submitted the required document to the respondent.

Decision

   26. For the aforementioned reasons I find that the decision of the First-
       tier Tribunal did not contain a  material  error  of  law  and  shall
       stand.

   27. The appeal is dismissed.

   28. No order for anonymity is made.
