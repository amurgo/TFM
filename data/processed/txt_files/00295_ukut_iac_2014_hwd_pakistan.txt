                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

 Appellant:   Mr I MacDonald QC, Mr M Iqbal and Mr S Khan (both of  Counsel)
                    instructed by Farani Javid Taylor Solicitors
 Respondent:  Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


   1) The requirements listed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of the Rules  are  to
      be  construed  reasonably  and  sensibly,  in  their   full   context.
      Approached in this way, the  letters  required  from  banks  or  other
      financial institutions are not designed to provide, and do not  commit
      them to, any form of guarantee or assurance to any party.  Rather, the
      function of the prescribed letters is to attest to the  state  of  the
      relevant bank account on the date when they are written and to provide
      certain  other  items  of  information   designed   to   confirm   the
      authenticity of the application for entrepreneurial migrant status and
      its economic viability.  There is no difficulty  in  the  third  party
      bank, with its customer's consent, expressing its understanding, based
      on the customer's instructions, that the use of specified funds in the
      customer's bank account/s is contemplated or proposed by the  customer
      for  the  purpose  of  financing  the  applicant's  proposed  business
      venture. Accordingly, there is no substance in the argument  that  the
      relevant requirements contained in paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)  produce  an
      absurd result and  must,  therefore,  be  interpreted  in  some  other
      manner.


   2)  The question of whether a policy exists is one of fact.  There is  no
      evidence that some policy on evidential flexibility,  independent  and
      freestanding of paragraph 245AA, survived  the  introduction  of  that
      paragraph in the immigration rules.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This appeal was heard together with three others, namely those  in  the
    cases of Kiran Fayyaz, Pavaiz Akhter and Chandni Maqbool.  The last two
    mentioned cases form a unitary pair.[1]  We shall make reference to our
    decision in the other cases where appropriate. The relevant  provisions
    of the Immigration Rules are appended hereto.

 2. The factors which are common to all of these appeals are that  each  of
    them has its origins in an unsuccessful application for entrepreneurial
    migrant status under the Immigration Rules and each raises issues about
    the construction  of  certain  provisions  of  the  Rules.  Each  case,
    however, possesses certain distinguishing features.

 3. Hazrat Waqas Durrani (hereinafter "this Appellant") is  a  national  of
    Pakistan, aged 29 years.  He has been lawfully present  in  the  United
    Kingdom  at  all  material  times,  dating  from  01  September   2007.
    Initially, his immigration status was that of  student.   Latterly,  he
    converted to the status of Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant, which  was
    scheduled to expire on 23 February 2013.  On this date, he applied  for
    further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as   a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant. We shall, for  convenience,  describe  this  as
    "entrepreneurial migrant status".

 4. A distinctive feature of this Appellant's application is that while  it
    was made in his own name, there was  another  member  of  the  proposed
    entrepreneurial team, Mr "R". The Appellant was seeking to  demonstrate
    the necessary funding (�50,000 in his case) by reference  to  both  his
    own finances  and  those  of  Mr  R.  The  documents  accompanying  the
    Appellant's application included two letters from banks.  The first  of
    these, written by Lloyds TSB, stated:

          "Dear Mr Durrani


          I am pleased to confirm the following details as at 22/02/2013.


          Account number - [specified]
          Balance - �27,043.10"

    The second was a letter from the Santander bank, in these terms:

          "To whom it may concern, I am writing to confirm that Mr [R] holds
          an account with Santander numbered  ..........   This  account  is
          registered   at   his   home   address   which    we    hold    as
          ........................  The available balance as of 22  February
          2013 is �25,014.77."


    While we have omitted the bank account number and the account  holder's
    address from the passage quoted, in the interests  of  confidentiality,
    both were provided.

 5. By letter dated 04 April 2013, the UK Border Agency  ("UKBA")  informed
    the Appellant that his application had been  refused.   The  assessment
    was that whereas he had successfully claimed 10 points  in  respect  of
    the English language requirement  and  10  points  in  respect  of  the
    maintenance (funds) requirement, he qualified for an award of no points
    in relation to three other "attributes", namely:

       a) Access to funds as required (25 points).


       b) Funds held in a regulated financial institution (25 points).

     c) Funds disposal in the United Kingdom (25 points).

    In order for his application to succeed, it  was  necessary  under  the
    Rules that the Appellant achieve the maximum  score  of  25  points  in
    respect of each of these  attributes,  a  total  of  75  points.    His
    assessed score was nil.


 6. Duly analysed,  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  proffered  three
    reasons for  refusing  the  Appellant's  application.   The  first  was
    expressed in the following terms:


          "....  You have not provided evidence from  the  bank  holding  Mr
          [R's] funds to confirm that you have access to these funds as part
          of the �50,000.  As a result you have only  provided  evidence  to
          show that you have access to funds of �27,043.10."

    The second reason articulated for refusing the application was based on
    the  "specified  documents"  requirement  contained  in  paragraph  41-
    SD(c)(iii) of the Rules.  Having rehearsed this provision,  the  letter
    continued:


          "You have not provided any evidence of business  activity  in  the
          form of advertising,  newspaper  articles  or  other  publications
          and/or information from a trade fair or personal registration with
          a trade's body."

    This  was  stated  to  be  in  contravention  of  the  four  prescribed
    "specified documents" requirements in question.  The third  reason  for
    refusal was expressed in the following terms:


          "You have  claimed  25  points  for  funds  held  in  a  regulated
          financial institution under paragraph 245DD(b) and Appendix  A  of
          the Immigration Rules ....


          You have failed  to  provide  sufficient  acceptable  evidence  to
          demonstrate that you have access to sufficient funds."


    The second element of this reason was, in essence, a restatement of the
    substance of the first reason.   Both expressed the Appellant's failure
    to demonstrate access to the necessary minimum funding of �50,000.

 7. The first ground of appeal pursued before the First-tier Tribunal ("the
    FtT") was that paragraph 41-SD(a) of the Rules did not  apply  to  this
    Appellant's application.  The Judge rejected this argument in  [20]  of
    his determination.  We record that it was no longer pursued before this
    Tribunal.  The second ground of appeal, advanced  in  the  alternative,
    was that the requirement enshrined in paragraph  41-SD(a)(i)(9)  should
    not be construed literally since to do so produces an  absurd  outcome.
    This argument was based on an assertion that the third  party  bank  in
    question (Santander) would not confirm that Mr R's funds were available
    to the Appellant as it was against their policy to do  so.   The  Judge
    did not deal with the absurdity argument.  The reason for this  appears
    to be his construction of paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) to the effect that,  in
    a "third party funder" case, the relevant  financial  institution  does
    not have to certify that the  requisite  funds  are  available  to  the
    applicant: see [24].  The Judge did not focus specifically on  what  is
    required  by  sub-paragraph  (9).  Rather,  he  concentrated  on   sub-
    paragraphs (6) and (10), finding that the  Santander  letter  was  non-
    compliant with the Rules because it did not state the Appellant's name,
    contrary to sub-paragraph (6), and did not state the  account  holder's
    telephone number and email address, contrary to sub-paragraph (10).


 8.  Next, the Judge found that the Appellant's application  suffered  from
    the further flaw of non-compliance with  any  of  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD(c)(i), noting that this failure was accepted:  although
    the Judge refers to requirement (i) rather than (iii), this appears  to
    reflect the  second  reason  proffered  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision for refusing the Appellant's  application:  thus  the  correct
    reference is requirement (iii).  The final ground  of  appeal  advanced
    was that the Secretary of State's decision was not in  accordance  with
    the law on account  of  a  failure  by  UKBA  to  make  an  "evidential
    flexibility" request for further documents.  The  Judge  rejected  this
    argument succinctly on the ground that, per paragraph 245AA(c)  of  the
    Rules,  there  is  no  obligation  on  UKBA  to  request  documents  in
    circumstances where "a specified document has not been submitted".

 9. In common with the conjoined appeals, the main  argument  canvassed  on
    behalf of the Appellant in this appeal is that  certain  provisions  of
    paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)  of  the  Rules  must  be  construed  other  than
    literally in order to avoid absurd results. We refer  to  [21]-[23]  of
    our  decision  in  Fayyaz,  where  the  essence  of  this  argument  is
    rehearsed. The distinguishing feature of the present appeal is that the
    financial institutions concerned are English, not foreign,  banks.   In
    contrast, the other related appeals involve Pakistani banks.   In  this
    context,  in  support  of  the  absurdity  argument,  Mr  MacDonald  QC
    submitted that, literally interpreted,  the  bank  letter  required  by
    paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)(6) and the bank statement required  by  paragraph
    41-SD(a)(ii)(4), if these sub-paragraphs are construed  literally,  are
    not capable of being provided by a United Kingdom  bank  by  reason  of
    privity of contract and the  relationship  of  confidentiality  between
    bank and customer.  Thus, it was submitted,  a  literal  interpretation
    must be avoided as it gives rise to an  absurdity.   It  was  contended
    that this absurdity is avoided  in  the  first  of  the  aforementioned
    provisions by substituting "account  holder's"  for  "applicant's"  and
    deleting all of the words which follow "name"  where  this  word  first
    appears.  As regards the second of the provisions under  scrutiny,  the
    proposal was more modest, involving only the substitution  of  "account
    holder's" for "applicant's".


10. The second ground of appeal pursued in this  forum  was  based  on  the
    "evidential  flexibility"  issue.   It  was  not  submitted  that   the
    Secretary of State's refusal decision was not in  accordance  with  the
    law by reference to paragraph 245AA of the Rules.  Rather, the argument
    developed was that there remains a "flexibility policy", independent of
    paragraph 245AA, conferring a discretion on the relevant case worker to
    request further information or documents  of  the  applicant.   It  was
    contended that, in essence, the error of law committed was a failure to
    appreciate the existence of this freestanding policy.

OUR CONCLUSIONS

11. It is common  ground  that  it  was  incumbent  on  this  Appellant  to
    demonstrate the availability of a total sum  of  �50,000  minimum.  The
    Rules permitted him to rely partly on his own financial  resources  and
    partly on those of a third party.  In such circumstances, two  separate
    bank letters are required.  The first, from the applicant's  own  bank,
    must state the applicant's name and the amount of  money  available  in
    his  account/s:  this  is  the  clear  and  obvious  meaning   of   the
    requirements enshrined in sub-paragraphs (6) and (8) of  paragraph  41-
    SD(a)(i) of the Rules.  The second letter must emanate from  the  third
    party's bank.  This must state two names: those of the  applicant,  per
    sub-paragraph (6) and the third party account holder, per sub-paragraph
    (10).  This we consider to be the clear  and  obvious  construction  of
    these discrete requirements.  By  virtue  of  sub-paragraph  (9),  this
    second letter must also "confirm the amount of money  provided  to  the
    applicant from any third party (if applicable) that  is  held  in  that
    institution".  In our decision in Fayyaz, we have construed  the  words
    "provided to" as denoting "available to". See [28]:

12. All of the requirements listed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i)  of  the  Rules
    are to be construed reasonably and sensibly,  in  their  full  context.
    Approached in this way, we consider it clear that the letters  required
    from banks or other financial institutions are not designed to provide,
    and do not commit them to, any form of guarantee or  assurance  to  any
    party.  Rather, the function of the prescribed letters is to attest  to
    the state of the relevant bank  account  on  the  date  when  they  are
    written and to provide certain other items of information  designed  to
    confirm the authenticity of the application for entrepreneurial migrant
    status and its economic viability.  The letters do not commit either of
    the banks, whether the applicant's own bank or that of the third party,
    to releasing a specified sum of money in order to finance the  proposed
    business venture.  Furthermore,  we  consider  that  there  can  be  no
    conceivable difficulty in the third party  bank,  with  its  customer's
    consent,  expressing  its  understanding,  based  on   the   customer's
    instructions, that the use of specified funds in  the  customer's  bank
    account/s is contemplated or proposed by the customer for  the  purpose
    of financing the applicant's  proposed  business  venture.    A  simple
    statement to this effect, based on the customer's instructions  to  the
    bank, is  less  onerous  and  intrusive  than  the  disclosure  of  the
    customer's name, account number and account balance.  We consider  that
    sub-paragraphs (6) and (9) are to be construed in  this  uncomplicated,
    reasonable and sensible fashion.

13. We are not persuaded that there is  any  principle  of  United  Kingdom
    banking law precluding the construction of the relevant  provisions  of
    the Rules which we have espoused above.  The relationship of banker and
    customer is contractual in nature.  The bank owes a duty of loyalty and
    confidentiality to the customer,  sometimes  described  as  a  duty  of
    secrecy: see Jones - v - Law Society [1969] 1 Ch 1, 9, per Diplock  LJ.
    However, as the leading authority of Tournier - v - National Provincial
    and Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461 makes clear, the implied duty
    of confidentiality does not apply where the customer  consents  to  the
    bank disclosing the information in question.  Bankes LJ, having  asked,
    rhetorically, what are "the qualifications of the contractual  duty  of
    secrecy implied in the relation of banker and customer", continued,  at
    473:

          "On principle I think that the qualifications can be classed under
          four heads: (a) where disclosure is under compulsion by  law;  (b)
          where there is a duty to the public to  disclose;  (c)  where  the
          interests of the bank require disclosure; (d) where the disclosure
          is made by the express or implied consent of the customer."


          [Our emphasis.]

    While the first of these four qualifications, or exceptions, could also
    conceivably, apply to paragraph 41-SD(i) and (ii)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, we would observe that we received no  argument  on  this  point.
    What is clear beyond peradventure,  in  our  estimation,  is  that  the
    disclosure by a bank of information pertaining to a customer's  account
    is lawful where the customer consents.  No argument to the contrary was
    developed on behalf of the Appellant.

14. Thus we consider that, construed in this way, there is no substance  in
    the argument that the relevant requirements contained in paragraph  41-
    SD(a)(i) produce an absurd result and must, therefore,  be  interpreted
    in some other manner.  There is  no  evidence  that  this  construction
    gives rise to an absurdity or anomaly.  Nor, viewed objectively and  in
    the abstract, is any absurdity or anomaly to be inferred.  Finally,  we
    are satisfied that this construction of the  provisions  of  the  Rules
    under scrutiny is harmonious with the relevant  principles  of  banking
    law. Accordingly, the first ground of appeal must fail.

15. The cornerstone of the second  ground  of  appeal,  properly  analysed,
    consists of an assertion.  The assertion  is  to  the  effect  that  an
    "evidential flexibility" policy of sorts survived the  introduction  of
    paragraph 245AA.  The latter provision of the Rules came into operation
    on 06 September 2012. It is common ground that paragraph 245AA governed
    all of the applications for entrepreneurial migrant  status  generating
    this cluster of appeals.  The FtT's primary reason for  rejecting  this
    ground of appeal was the absence of  any  evidence  that  some  policy,
    independent and freestanding of paragraph 245AA, also applied to  these
    applications: see [32]. We endorse this reasoning and  conclusion.   In
    doing so, we highlight the distinction between argument  and  evidence.
    The question of whether a policy exists, in whatever context it arises,
    is a question of fact.  This ground of appeal fails because it  has  no
    supporting evidence, direct or inferential.


16. In our judgement, this ground of appeal must fail on the further  basis
    that whereas  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Rodriguez  held  that  the  two
    documents  appended  to  its  decision  constituted  a  policy  of  the
    Secretary of State of wide ranging  scope  and  effect,  the  Court  of
    Appeal reversed this holding: see Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]
    UKUT 00042 (IAC), [9] - [13] and Appendices and Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department - v - Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2,  [82]  -  [101].
    Insofar as necessary, we are also mindful of  the  additional  evidence
    adduced on behalf of the Secretary of State in Rodriguez see  [47]  and
    [65].  While this was not admitted on the basis  of  the  new  evidence
    principles, we cannot pretend that it  does  not  exist  and  were  not
    invited to do so.

17. Thus, the Appellant's appeal must be dismissed.  To this we  would  add
    that the Appellant's application and both ensuing appeals were, in  our
    estimation, doomed to failure in any event on account of the  egregious
    and irremediable  failure  to  comply  with  all  of  the  requirements
    enshrined in paragraph 41-SD(c) of the Immigration Rules.

DECISION

18. For the reasons elaborated above, we dismiss this appeal and affirm the
    decision of the FtT.
