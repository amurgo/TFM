                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Safar, Counsel, instructed by Lisa's Law
                       Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellants are citizens of China with an immigration history
           that it  is  unnecessary  to  rehearse.  Their  appeals  against
           decisions to refuse them protection and to remove them from  the
           UK were dismissed on all  grounds  by  decision  of  First  tier
           Tribunal Judge T Jones, promulgated on 18 January 2017.
        2. The Appellants were granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
           Tribunal the decisions upon their Article 8 appeals by  decision
           of First tier Tribunal Judge Froom of 26 April 2017 on the basis
           their child was entitled to British citizenship, a  matter  that
           had not been taken into account, so that  no  consideration  had
           been given to the reasonableness  of  the  requirement  that  he
           leave the UK; paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv). There  was  no  grant  of
           permission in relation to the  decision  to  dismiss  the  First
           Appellant's asylum appeal; which must therefore stand.
        3. Thus the matter comes before me.


      The hearing
        4. When the matter was called on for hearing it was identified that
           the Appellants had not been represented at  the  hearing  before
           the First tier Tribunal. Neither the Respondent, nor the  Judge,
           had identified that the child of  the  family  was  entitled  to
           registration as a British citizen; the point was overlooked.
        5. The child of the family has now been  registered  as  a  British
           citizen by decision of 20 June 2017.
        6. In the circumstances, it is conceded on behalf of the Respondent
           that the Judge erred in his approach to the  Article  8  appeals
           that were before him. In  the  light  of  the  Respondent's  own
           policy, and current jurisprudence, the child of the  family  did
           meet at the date of the hearing the  requirements  of  paragraph
           276ADE(1)(iv), and thus the Article 8  appeals  of  all  of  the
           family should in those circumstances have been allowed.
        7. Accordingly the parties invite me by consent to  set  aside  the
           Judge's decision upon the Article  8  appeals,  and  remake  the
           decisions in relation to the Article 8 appeals so  as  to  allow
           them.





   DECISION


      The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on  18
      January 2017 did involve the making of an error of law  that  requires
      the decision upon the Article 8 appeals to be set aside and remade.


      The Article 8 appeals are allowed.



Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008
      Unless and until the Tribunal directs otherwise  the  Appellants  are
        granted anonymity throughout these proceedings. No report of  these
        proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  her.   This
        direction applies both to the Appellants  and  to  the  Respondent.
        Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to  proceedings
        being brought for contempt of court.
