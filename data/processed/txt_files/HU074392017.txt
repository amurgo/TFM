Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Rene of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India born in 1978.  He appealed  against
    a decision of the respondent made on 21 December  2016  to  refuse  his
    application  for  entry  clearance  under  paragraph  320(11)  of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. It is relevant to note the immigration history.  It is not wholly clear
    but was agreed to be as follows: the appellant made an application  for
    leave to remain in 2008 stating he had arrived in 1997 as a visitor and
    had overstayed.  It was refused in 2008 on the basis that there was  no
    record of his entry or visa.

 3. A second application was submitted in 2012, the appellant  claiming  he
    had been in the UK for around 14 years and had mental health issues.

 4. A third application was made in August 2013 stating he feared return to
    India.

 5. A fourth application was made in October  2013  on  the  basis  of  his
    relationship with a British citizen.

 6. The current application for entry clearance as a spouse was made on  11
    November 2014.  It was refused on 29  December  2014.   An  appeal  was
    allowed on 10 October 2016 to the limited extent of the decision  being
    not in accordance with the law.

 7. The respondent considered the matter afresh and refused the application
    for the second time on 21  December  2016.   It  is  from  that  latter
    refusal that the appeal is brought.

 8. The basis of the refusal under paragraph 320(11) was that he had  "made
    false representations in an  application  for  leave  to  remain,  made
    frivolous applications for  leave  to  remain  by  continuously  making
    applications for leave to remain outside the Rules on the same grounds"
    and that he had "worked illegally in the UK."

 9. Going on to consider aggravating factors the respondent noted that  the
    appellant had admitted to working illegally and it was  unclear  if  he
    had paid tax or national insurance contributions.  Also, he had said in
    an application that he was suffering from a mental  illness.   However,
    no  evidence  in  support  was  provided  and  he  had  stated  in  his
    application that he had never received treatment here.

10. Further, he had made frivolous applications.

11. The respondent concluded: "Given the above I am  satisfied  that  these
    amount to aggravating  factors  and  I  am  not  prepared  to  exercise
    discretion in your favour".

12. He appealed.

    First tier hearing

13. Following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 10  August  2018  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Jones QC dismissed the appeal.

14. At [7] having noted that the appellant left the UK in November 2014 the
    judge stated: "I was not informed whether he was  compulsorily  removed
    or whether he departed voluntarily.  For the purposes of this decision,
    the distinction ultimately makes no difference".

15. He went on at [20] to state: "I keep in mind that the respondent had to
    be  satisfied  that  any  such  misleading  information  was   provided
    dishonestly.  Absent any innocent explanation  being  provided  by  the
    appellant, the  respondent  was  fully  entitled  so  to  conclude.   I
    independently arrive at the same conclusion."

16. Then, at [21] he considered "... aggravating  circumstances;  one  such
    ... being identified in the  Immigration  Rules  being  the  making  of
    frivolous applications".  He stated: "I am entirely satisfied that  the
    respondent was entitled  to  conclude  that  the  appellant's  previous
    repetitive applications were made frivolously in an attempt to prevent,
    or at the very least, delay his departure from the United  Kingdom  ...
    The one exception is the fact that he had been married on  12  December
    2013.  That could properly be put  forward  as  a  material  change  of
    circumstances."

17. The judge then went on to conclude that although there is family  life,
    with the need for immigration control, refusal of entry clearance would
    not be disproportionate.

18. The appellant sought permission to appeal which  was  refused  but  was
    granted on 23 December 2018 on re-application to the Upper Tribunal.

    Error of law hearing

19. At the error of law hearing before me Ms Cunha agreed  with  Mr  Rene's
    submission that the judge's decision showed material error of law.   It
    suffices to note the following: The judge was wrong to  state  that  he
    was  not  informed  whether  the  appellant  was  removed  or  departed
    voluntarily.  There was evidence before him that he left voluntarily in
    order to make an application for entry  clearance  and  regularise  his
    position in the proper way.  Further, he was wrong to state it made  no
    difference.  Voluntary departure raised different issues in respect  of
    the public interest from those which would have been  at  play  if  the
    appellant had been forcibly removed: PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion :
    care needed) India [2010] UKUT 440.

20. In addition, in respect of frivolous applications the judge referred to
    one exception, the application based on marriage.  He did not, however,
    examine the other applications  and  look  at  the  claimed  change  in
    circumstances.   He  simply  accepted  the  assertions  made   by   the
    respondent.

21. It was agreed that the decision must be set aside to be remade.

    Resumed hearing

22. We were able to resume the hearing immediately.  Ms Cunha  stated  that
    the sole issue was paragraph 320(11).  If that fell away the respondent
    accepted that the appellant met all the requirements of the Rules.


23.  Mr Rene led the sponsor Suman Verma in brief evidence.

24. She adopted her statement.  She married the appellant in December 2013.
     He returned voluntarily to India in 2014.  Since then she has  visited
    him eight or nine times although less often since the  birth  of  their
    child, who is a British citizen, her doctor having advised  against  it
    for six months.  They keep in touch by WhatsApp and similar means  many
    times a day.  She earns ï¿½30,000 a year as a bank employee, supports her
    husband in India and pays for her own travel.

25. In submissions, Ms Cunha acknowledged that the appellant is now seeking
    to regularise his status.  However, in his witness statement he had not
    addressed his past conduct which included being untruthful twice in his
    applications not  least  in  2008  when  he  claimed  to  have  arrived
    lawfully.  He had worked illegally as well as being an illegal entrant.
     The respondent's decision was sustainable.

26. In reply Mr Rene accepted that there was a  lack  of  response  in  the
    appellant's  witness  statement  about  the  claims  of  past  conduct.
    Nonetheless, it was unclear that the respondent had  produced  evidence
    in support of the assertion of false representations.  In any event the
    evidence did not indicate that the four  applications  were  frivolous.
    There was over three years between the refusal of the first application
    and the second, a significant passage of time; it was  not  clear  that
    the matter refused in August 2013 about  his  health  was  in  fact  an
    application rather than a letter, as a decision  was  made  only  eight
    days later. The application in 2013 in respect of the relationship  was
    clearly not frivolous.  Mr Rene emphasised that the appellant had  left
    the UK voluntarily.  There is a strong public interest  in  encouraging
    those here illegally to go through the proper process and he should  be
    given credit for that.

    Consideration

27. Paragraph 320(11) states:

         "Grounds on which entry clearance or  leave  to  enter  the  United
         Kingdom should normally be refused"


         ...


         "(11)     Where  the  applicant  has  previously  contrived  in   a
         significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:


          i) overstaying; or


         ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or


        iii) being an illegal entrant; or


         iv) using deception in an application for entry  clearance,  leave
             to enter or remain or in order to obtain  documents  from  the
             Secretary of State or a third party required in support of the
             application (whether successful or not);


         and there are other aggravating circumstances, such as  absconding,
         not meeting temporary admission/  reporting  restrictions  or  bail
         conditions, using  an  assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,
         switching  nationality,  making  frivolous  applications   or   not
         complying with the redocumentation process."

28. Thus, there must have been breaches which frustrated  the  Rules  in  a
    significant way plus aggravating circumstances.   There  should  be  no
    overlap between a "significant  way"  and  "aggravating  circumstances"
    otherwise  there  would  be  double  counting.   Decision  makers   and
    Tribunals must "exercise great care" (per PS headnote) in  deciding  to
    apply paragraph 320(11) to a family member, and must  ensure  that  the
    aggravating circumstances relied on are "truly aggravating"  (PS  [14])
    otherwise  there  is  a  risk  of  discouraging  migrants  from  making
    applications to regularise their stay, which would be contrary  to  the
    public interest.

29. The refusal letter (21 December 2016) made in response to the  decision
    made by the Tribunal in October 2016 allowing the appeal to the  extent
    that the respondent's decision was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
    because no evidence had been  provided  of  aggravating  circumstances,
    whilst  it  does  refer  to  such,  appears  to  conflate  these   with
    "significant ways."

30. The respondent does satisfy me that the  appellant  used  deception  by
    making false  representations  in  respect  of  the  first  and  second
    applications.  The appellant  effectively  made  no  challenge  to  the
    respondent's position that there was no record that he had been granted
    a visit visa and had entered the UK on it in 1997. It is  evidence  one
    would reasonably expect him to have. In what appears to have  been  the
    second application he offered no evidence in support of  his  claim  to
    suffer mental health problems. He has given no response to the comments
    of the respondent that no evidence was produced as to how such had been
    diagnosed  as  he  said  in  the  application  he  had  never  received
    treatment.

31. In any event, as indicated, the respondent concluded the  consideration
    of "contrived in a significant way  to  frustrate  the  intentions"  by
    stating that as well as making false representations he made "frivolous
    applications ... by  continuously  making  applications  for  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules on the same grounds  ...  and  that  (he)  had
    worked illegally in the UK." That, however, was a matter which fell  to
    be considered under "aggravating factors."

32. The respondent then proceeded,  as  required,  to  assess  "aggravating
    factors."  In that regard,  he  repeated  that  no  evidence  had  been
    submitted by the appellant about mental illness and then he had  worked
    illegally.  The respondent appeared to conclude that these amounted  to
    "aggravating factors" and that taken as a whole  the  applications  had
    been frivolous.

33. I see  several  problems  with  this.  First,  the  appellant  did  not
    "continuously make applications," the first was in 2008, the second  in
    2012, the rest were over two years. Also, they were not  "on  the  same
    grounds." Circumstances change over time. A further problem is that the
    respondent had already apparently found  against  the  appellant  as  a
    false representation the  mental  illness  claim.   It,  as  indicated,
    cannot  be  double  counted.   Second,  the  respondent's  decision  to
    characterise  unlawful  working   as   an   "aggravating   factor"   is
    inconsistent with  the  view  taken  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  ZH
    (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 8 that such employment is part  and
    parcel of illegal residence. The result is that  "aggravating  factors"
    have not been established.

34. Further, despite having been alerted by the previous Tribunal  in  2016
    to PS and the requirement to  exercise  great  care  in  assessing  the
    aggravating circumstances said to justify refusal  the  respondent  did
    not do so. The respondent should have specifically recognised that  the
    appellant had voluntarily left with a view to regularising his  status.
    There is no question but that the marriage is a genuine one.  There  is
    now a British citizen child. If the aggravating  circumstances,  as  PS
    stated, are not "truly aggravating" there is in this context a  serious
    risk that those in the position of the appellant will  simply  continue
    to remain in the UK unlawfully and will not seek  to  regularise  their
    status  as  he  has  sought  to  do.  The  effect  is  likely   to   be
    counterproductive to the general purposes of the relevant rules and  to
    the maintenance of a coherent system of immigration.

35. I conclude that the respondent was wrong to decide for the  reasons  he
    gave that the conduct of the appellant showed "aggravating factors" and
    that taken as  a  whole  the  applications  were  frivolous  such  that
    paragraph 320(11) was applicable.

36.  There  being  no  dispute  that  the  appellant  satisfies   all   the
    requirements in respect of entry clearance as a spouse under the Rules,
    the public interest is thus satisfied. Accordingly, the appeal succeeds
    on human rights grounds.
