Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Cogan instructed by Farani Javid Taylor,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Jordan born on 12 April 1978,  as  the
    appellant herein.

2.   The appellant arrived in this country in July 2006  as  a  student  and
    was granted further extensions of leave until 13 March 2012 on the same
    basis.  On 4 July 2012 he was given leave to remain until 4  July  2014
    as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant, subject to  certain  conditions.
    On 5 August 2014 he made an application for  further  leave  to  remain
    which was refused.  However on 6 October 2014 he was granted  leave  to
    remain until 20 December 2014 as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, subject to
    conditions.

3.   The appellant applied on 20 December 2014 for further leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant but this application was  refused  on  12
    January 2015.  The appellant appealed and  his  appeal  came  before  a
    First-tier Judge on 23 July 2015.

4.   The judge summarises the Secretary of State's decision in paragraphs  3
    to 5 of her decision as follows:

         "3.  The reasons for the Secretary of State's decision are given in
             a letter dated 12 January 2015 and is to the effect  that  the
             appellant could not be awarded the 20 points  for  appropriate
             salary under Appendix A  of  the  Rules  for  Tier  2  General
             applicants, but he was awarded the 10  points  required  under
             Appendix B for English language and a further 10 points  under
             Appendix C (Maintenance (Funds)).


         4.   The Secretary of State notes that the salary included  on  the
             appellant's Certificate of Sponsorship was not at or above the
             appropriate rate for the job, as specified under Appendix A of
             the Immigration Rules and Codes of Practice  (which  are  also
             specified under Appendix J of the Immigration Rules).   It  is
             noted that the appellant's Certificate of Sponsorship,  states
             that his prospective employment most  closely  corresponds  to
             occupation code 3416 on the Codes of Practice (which are  also
             specified under Appendix J of the Immigration Rules).


         5.   From 6 April 2013, a new policy  on  rates  of  pay  for  "new
             entrants"  and  "experienced  workers  within  the  Codes   of
             Practice was introduced".  The minimum acceptable rate of  pay
             for a 39 hour working week  for  the  appellant's  prospective
             employment is �25,600 per annum, as stated on occupation  code
             under the experienced worker  appropriate  salary  rate.   The
             Secretary of State notes that the appellant's  Certificate  of
             Sponsorship states that his salary would be �21,500 per  annum
             for a 40 hour week, which equates to �20,962 per annum  for  a
             39 hour week.  As his prospective salary is not  at  or  above
             the minimum rate as specified in the Codes  of  Practice  (SOC
             2010) under the experienced worker  level  and  the  appellant
             does not meet any exemptions as specified in Appendix A of the
             Immigration Rules, the Secretary of State did not consider  it
             to be at the appropriate rate for the job.  The appellant  was
             therefore  not  awarded  points  for  appropriate  salary  and
             therefore the Secretary of State could not be  satisfied  that
             the appellant met the requirements to be awarded a minimum  of
             50 points, under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules."

5.   At the appeal hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant  was
    represented by Mr Kannangara.   There  was  no  Presenting  Officer  on
    behalf of the Secretary of State.  The judge  summarises  the  evidence
    and the submissions and her conclusions as follows:

         "13. The appellant states that the assessment by the  Secretary  of
             State in respect of his pay is irrelevant, as at the  time  he
             was a new entrant and earned the requisite amount.  His Tier 2
             Migrant visa was for only three months and  he  can  therefore
             not be labelled  as  an  experienced  worker.   The  appellant
             states that he no longer works for the aforementioned  company
             and so his circumstances have changed.   He  has  secured  new
             employment at the British Muslim TV network, who have informed
             him that they will sponsor him under SOC code  3416  and  that
             his salary will be �30,500.  The appellant states that all  he
             has worked for in his life is building up to this position and
             that due to his unstable immigration status, he has  not  been
             able to work, despite securing his position  already.   He  is
             heavily anticipating beginning his role and has been robbed of
             the chance to begin working as soon as  possible,  because  of
             the decisions of the Secretary of State.


         14.  The appellant states that this role he has been preparing  for
             all his life and that  he  has  done  the  requisite  academic
             training and practical training for the role.  In  preparation
             he  has  a  Masters  degree  in  film  making  from   Kingston
             University, so that he is suitably qualified  to  be  able  to
             handle all the duties required.   He  already  has  real  work
             experience in his field,  following  his  time  at  the  Islam
             Channel network and is sure that he will be able  to  transfer
             all his skills to his new role, so that he is best equipped to
             perform at a high standard.


         15.  The appellant states that he has made great strides  recently,
             both professionally and personally.   He  recently  married  a
             British national, Victoria Ann Joyce,  on  19  November  2014.
             They have been living together since April 2015.   They  first
             met in August 2014 and their relationship blossomed  and  they
             became very close.  Shortly after, he proposed to  her  as  he
             believes she is the one for him and he  has  ensured  that  he
             would be able to  provide  for  her.   The  two  of  them  see
             children in their future and cannot wait until they reach this
             stage of their lives.  The thought of having to  be  separated
             due to a mere formality, is simply heartbreaking.   They  have
             many hopes for the future.  If the  appellant  was  forced  to
             move back to Jordan, he does not know what he will do.


         16.  The appellant states that he and his partner will be  marrying
             in November 2015 following their Islamic marriage on 19  April
             2014.  he believes it would be a contravention of the sanctity
             of marriage, if he were to  be  forced  out  before  they  are
             officially recognised under British law as man  and  wife,  as
             this would have deep personal ramifications  on  their  lives;
             but they will carry on despite the insurmountable obstacles in
             play.  In these circumstances he requests that his  appeal  be
             allowed.  Further in evidence the appellant explained that  he
             was granted Tier 2 leave in 2014 for two  months,  giving  him
             time to make his last application.


         17.  Mr Kannangara addressed me and explained  that  the  appellant
             had a post study work visa and made an application before  his
             leave expired, which was refused.  A fresh application however
             granted him a Tier 2 visa from 6 October to 20  December  2014
             and before that leave expired, he was given what he needed  by
             the same employer to apply  to  continue.   His  annual  gross
             salary of �21,500 for a 40 hour a week contract was calculated
             by the Home Office as a 39 hour a week contract at a salary of
             �20,962.  Mr Kannangara referred the Tribunal to E2 and E3  of
             the respondent's bundle and asked the Tribunal to note page  7
             to 9 regarding  the  code  and  the  salary  rates.   For  new
             entrants the salary rate is �20,800 and  for  the  experienced
             �25,600.  The appellant states that he has been categorised as
             a new entrant and if  so,  then  his  salary  was  within  the
             requirements, as for his 39 hour week he was paid �20,962  per
             annum whereas the required level  is  �20,800.   He  submitted
             therefore that the Secretary of State's approach was wrong, as
             the appellant was here as a post study worker, became a Tier 2
             migrant and was given only three months  therefore  as  a  new
             entrant, should have been considered as  such  and  given  the
             appropriate 20 points under Appendix A for his salary.


         18.   After  the  refusal  the  appellant  left   that   particular
             employment and secured new employment, but as he is  under  3C
             leave, he cannot make a new application whilst this appeal  is
             pending.


         19.  Mr Kannangara asked the Tribunal to accept that the  appellant
             should have been viewed as a new entrant, as at  the  date  of
             decision he was with his old employer.  Documents  in  respect
             of the new employment is in the appellant's bundle, from which
             it can be seen that he has a 39 hour a  week  contract  and  a
             gross annual salary  of  �30,500,  which  is  well  above  the
             required rate.  In his submission the appeal  can  be  allowed
             and remitted back to the Home  Office.   As  at  the  date  of
             decision the Home Office can grant him 60  days  in  order  to
             make the application.  It can be sent back to the Home  Office
             on the basis that the decision is not in accordance  with  the
             law, which means his application is  outstanding  and  he  can
             vary the application to the Home Office using the new COS.








         The Law


         20.  This appeal falls to be  determined  in  accordance  with  the
             Immigration  Rules  for  Tier  2  General   applicants   under
             paragraph 245HD of the Immigration Rules and under Appendix  A
             with reference to Appendix J.  The burden of proof is  on  the
             appellant and the  standard  of  proof  is  on  a  balance  of
             probabilities.


         Findings and Conclusions


         21.  I had the opportunity of hearing and observing  the  appellant
             give evidence which he did in a  straightforward  and  helpful
             manner and I have no reason to disbelieve anything he told the
             Tribunal and find him credible.


         22.  Mr Kannangara explained the position very clearly and I  agree
             with his submissions and in all the circumstances, remit  this
             matter back to the Secretary of State, on the basis  that  the
             decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.   There  is
             therefore an application outstanding which the  appellant  can
             vary using his new COS".


6.   The judge  accordingly  allowed  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision was not in accordance with  the  law  and
    the matter was remitted back to the Secretary of State.

7.   The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  on  the  basis
    that the judge had given no reasons for coming to  her  conclusion  and
    insofar as she adopted the reasons given by Counsel these were affected
    by a material error of  law.   The  Secretary  of  State  set  out  the
    relevant parts  of  paragraph  245HD  of  HC  395  which  set  out  the
    requirements for leave to remain as a Tier 2  (General)  Migrant.   The
    salary level  for  a  new  entrant  was  �20,800  and  �25,000  for  an
    experienced  worker.   The  Secretary  of  State  set   out   in   bold
    subparagraph (d) which reads as follows:

         "(d) Where both "new entrant" and "experienced  worker"  rates  are
             stated in Tables 1 to 5, the  "new  entrant"  rate  will  only
             apply if the applicant:


             i.   is applying as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant  and  scores
                  points from the Post-Study Work provisions of Appendix A,


             ii.  is applying as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant  and  scores
                  points from the Resident Labour Market Test provisions  of
                  Appendix A, on the basis that his Sponsor has carried  out
                  a university milk-round,


             iii. is applying as a Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer)  Migrant
                  in the Graduate Trainee sub-category, or


             iv.  was under the age of 26 on the date the  application  was
                  made,


             and is not applying for a grant of leave that would extend his
             total stay in Tier 2 and/or as a Work Permit Holder  beyond  3
             years and 1 month.


             The "experienced worker" rate will apply in all other cases."

8.   Mr  Avery  relied  on  the  grounds.   The  appellant  was  clearly  an
    experienced worker under the Rules.

9.   Mr Cogan acknowledged that there was a difficulty in the outcome  given
    that if the appellant complied with the relevant  Rules  it  would  not
    have been necessary to allow the appeal on the basis  of  an  error  of
    law.  The appeal would simply have been allowed under the  Rules.   The
    determination  was  a  short  one  and  the  respondent  had  not  been
    represented which was unfortunate.  However the  judge,  he  submitted,
    had applied the Rules correctly and had correctly directed  herself  on
    the burden and standard of proof.  He had only been in  the  employment
    for some three months and had no relevant work experience.  He could be
    regarded as a new entrant to the labour market.  The  judge  had  heard
    oral  evidence  and  accepted  it.   The  word  experienced  should  be
    interpreted in a common-sense manner.  Mr Avery in  response  submitted
    that the question of whether the appellant was experienced or  not  was
    defined in the Rules.  The appellant could not meet the Rules.

10.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I can  of
    course only interfere with this decision if it was materially flawed in
    law.

11.  It is of course unfortunate that the respondent was not represented  at
    the hearing before the First-tier Judge.   The  appellant  had  claimed
    that he was not experienced and should be dealt with as a  new  entrant
    and I am invited in effect to adopt a  common-sense  interpretation  of
    the word experienced.  This approach is made slightly difficult in  the
    light of what the judge records in paragraph 14 of her decision which I
    have reproduced above in which the appellant claimed to have real  work
    experience in his field.   However  I  am  quite  satisfied  that  when
    considering the meaning of  the  word  one  must  have  regard  to  the
    Immigration Rules and I have reproduced the relevant part above.   That
    rule makes it quite clear that the "new entrant" rate will  only  apply
    in certain circumstances and that the "experienced  worker"  rate  will
    apply in all other cases.  The appellant had  already  been  granted  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant visa in October 2014 and the application under
    consideration in this case was an application made in December 2014 for
    an extension of that visa.  On that basis the appellant was not  a  new
    entrant and it was not argued before me that  he  could  bring  himself
    within the relevant part of  sub-paragraph  (d)  to  qualify  as  such.
    Accordingly he fell to be dealt with as an experienced worker.

12.  I see no answer to Mr Avery's submissions.  While  the  judge  accepted
    the evidence given by the appellant, that did not bring him within  the
    rule as a new entrant.  Had  it  been  the  case  that  the  judge  was
    satisfied that the appellant did fall within  the  rule  there  was  no
    reason as I have said to allow the appeal on the basis that she did.  I
    respectfully agree  that  while  it  is  open  to  a  judge  to  accept
    submissions and incorporate them by reference into  the  determination,
    in this case the outcome is  somewhat  puzzling  and  the  reasoning  a
    little opaque.

13.  For the reasons I have given, I am satisfied that the  points  made  by
    Mr Avery make it clear that there was a material error of law  in  this
    decision and I remake it.

I substitute a fresh decision: this appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction made.


FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and I make none.
