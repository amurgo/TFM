                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO"),  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as they were in the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. This is the determination of the Upper Tribunal re-making the  decision
    following the setting aside of the First-tier Tribunal's decision in my
    error of law decision sent on 30 September 2020.  In setting out  below
    the background and the appeal proceedings, I have borrowed text from my
    earlier determination.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  On 8 March 2019, she  made  an
    application for entry clearance to join her husband, Mr Tariq Bashir, a
    British Citizen in the United Kingdom under the 'partner' rule (Section
    EC-P) in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).   On
    24 May 2019, the ECO refused the appellant's application.

 4. The ECO was satisfied that the appellant met all  the  requirements  of
    the Rules, including the eligibility, suitability and English  language
    requirements, apart from one.  The  ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements in E-ECP.3.1. to 3.4.  The ECO
    was not satisfied that the appellant had established, by the  specified
    evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE, that her husband, the sponsor,  had
    a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum as required by  E-ECP.3.1.
    The ECO was not satisfied that the appellant had provided pay slips  or
    bank  statements  covering  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to   the
    application with the most recent falling within 28 days of the date  of
    application as required by para 2 of Appendix FM-SE.  The ECO concluded
    that the most recent pay slip was dated  December  2018  and  the  most
    recent bank statement was dated 11 December 2018.  In addition, the ECO
    was not satisfied that the appellant had provided the  required  letter
    from  the  sponsor's  employer  setting  out  his  employment  details,
    including his gross annual salary.  For those reasons, the ECO  refused
    the appellant's application for entry clearance.

 5. The application was reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager ("ECM") and
    on 8 October 2019, the  ECM  maintained  the  ECO's  refusal  of  entry
    clearance.  The ECM maintained the decision but on a somewhat different
    basis.  The ECM accepted that there were pay  slips  between  30  April
    2018 and 28 February 2019  which,  therefore,  covered  the  six  month
    period prior to the date of application and the final one of which fell
    within 28 days of that application.  Nevertheless,  the  ECM  concluded
    that the bank statements did not meet the requirements of the Rules and
    there was still a failure to provide the  required  letter  of  support
    from the sponsor's employer.

 6. The ECM's reasons were as follows:

         "It is noted that the appellant  has  supplied  the  sponsor's  pay
         slips from 30/04/2018 to 28/02/2019 and bank statements  (Yorkshire
         Bank account ending []) for the same period.   However,  this  does
         not appear to be the bank account  that  the  sponsor's  wages  are
         being paid into.  The sponsor is moving his monthly wages from HSBC
         account (account ending []) between 1 and 2 weeks after being paid.

         The appellant has also failed to provide:

         (b) A letter from the employer(s)  who  issued  the  pay  slips  at
         paragraph 2(a) confirming (i) the  person's  employment  and  gross
         annual salary; (ii) the  length  of  their  employment;  (iii)  the
         period over which they have been or were paid the level  of  salary
         relied upon in the application; and (iv)  the  type  of  employment
         (permanent, fixed-term contract or agency)".

 7. As a consequence, the ECM upheld the ECO's refusal.



The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant appealed.   Judge  Foudy  first  considered  whether  the
    appellant met the requirements of  the  Rules  as  a  partner  and,  in
    particular, the financial requirements.

 9. At paras 6-7, Judge Foudy gave her  reasons  for  concluding  that  the
    appellant did meet the financial requirements of the Rules:

         "6.  The Respondent does  not  accept  that  the  Sponsor  met  the
             minimum income threshold under Appendix FM of the  Immigration
             Rules as she found that he had not provided the specified  pay
             slips and bank statements with the application  to  prove  her
             income.

         7.   The decision is clearly wrong as the specified pay  slips  and
             bank statements were enclosed in the Respondent's  own  bundle
             of documents as ones attached to the  application.   It  would
             appear that they were overlooked by the decision-maker".

10. Having concluded that the appellant met the requirements of the  Rules,
    the judge went on to  allow  the  appeal  under  Art  8,  applying  the
    approach of the Court of Appeal in TZ (Pakistan)  and  Another  v  SSHD
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, that as the requirements of the Rules were met it
    was  a  disproportionate  interference  with   the   appellant's   (and
    sponsor's) family life to refuse to grant the appellant entry clearance
    to join the sponsor in the UK.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

11. The ECO sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the  basis
    that the judge failed to  give  anxious  scrutiny  to  the  appeal,  in
    particular the ECO's reasoning in relation to the pay  slips  and  bank
    statements  and  whether  the  appellant  had  provided   the   correct
    documents.

12. On 24 April 2020, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge O'Keeffe) granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal essentially on the ground that:

         "The judge has given no  specific  reasons  for  finding  that  the
         documents  required  by  Appendix  FM-SE  had  been   provided   in
         circumstances where the respondent asserted the documents  provided
         to her were not the correct documents".

13. Following directions from the UT seeking, in the light of the  Covid-19
    crisis, the parties' views, inter alia, on whether it  was  appropriate
    that the error of law issue should be decided without  a  hearing,  the
    ECO made written submissions on 23 June 2020 in line with  the  grounds
    of appeal.  No objection was raised to the error  of  law  issue  being
    determined  without  a  hearing.    The   appellant   and   her   legal
    representatives made no submissions in response to those directions.

14. In the light of the parties' submissions,  and  having  regard  to  the
    interests of justice and the overriding objective  of  determining  the
    appeal  justly and fairly and the nature of the legal issues raised,  I
    determined that it was in the interests of  justice  to  determine  the
    error of law issue without a hearing under  rule  34  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  and
    para 4 of the Amended General Pilot  Practice  Directions:  Contingency
    Arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  (14
    September 2020) issued by (then) Vice Senior President (and now) Senior
    President of Tribunals, the Rt. Hon. Sir Keith Lindblom.

15. In my determination sent on 30 September 2020,  I  concluded  that  the
    judge had materially erred in  law  and  set  aside  her  decision.   I
    decided that the judge had overlooked the ECM's reasons  for  upholding
    the ECO's refusal and had, instead, allowed the  appeal  on  the  basis
    that he ECO's reasons were not sustainable on the evidence.  The  judge
    erred by failing to make any findings upon the actual issues under  the
    Rules which were 'live' following the ECM's decision.  I adjourned  the
    appeal for a resumed remote hearing to be listed so that  the  decision
    could be re-made.

16. The resumed hearing was listed on 14 January 2021.  I was based in  the
    Cardiff Civil  Justice  Centre  and  Ms  Hashmi,  who  represented  the
    appellant, joined the hearing by Skype for Business.  Mr  Howells,  who
    represented the respondent, due to technical difficulties  was  content
    to join the hearing by phone.  The sponsor, who was in Pakistan, joined
    the hearing by Skype.

17. At the outset of the hearing, I raised with the representatives that  I
    had determined the error of  law  issues  under  rule  34  and  invited
    submissions on the impact,  if  any,  of  the  decision  in  R(JCWI)  v
    President of UTIAC and another [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin).  Ms Hashmi and
    Mr Howells both indicted that they were content that my  error  of  law
    decision should stand and that I should re-make  the  decision  on  the
    basis of the evidence.

The Applicable Rules

18. The relevant financial requirement which the appellant had to establish
    is set out in para E-ECP.3.1. of Appendix FM of the Rules as follows:

         "The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of -

         (a)  a specified gross income of at least -

             (i)  �18,600;

             ...."

19. In order to establish the required income, which in  this  case  arises
    from the sponsor's employment, para 2 of Appendix FM-SE  sets  out  the
    documents which must be provided in order to establish  that  income  -
    the "specified evidence".  So far as relevant it provides as follows:

         "2.  In respect of salaried employment in the UK ...,  all  of  the
             following evidence must be provided:

             (a)  Pay slips covering:

                  (i)   a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application if the person has been employed by  their
                      current employer for at least six months ....;

                  .....

             (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the pay slips at
                  paragraph 2(a) confirming:

                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

                  (ii) the length of their employment;

                  (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid
                      the level of salary relied upon in  the  application;
                      and

                  (iv)  the  type  of  employment   (permanent,   fixed-term
                      contract or agency).

             (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to  the  period(s)
                  as the pay slips  at  paragraph  2(a),  showing  that  the
                  salary is being paid into an account in the  name  of  the
                  person or in the name of  the  person  and  their  partner
                  jointly".

20. Paragraph 1(l) of Appendix FM-SE provides that:

         "Where this Appendix requires the applicant  to  provide  specified
         evidence relating to a period which ends with the application, that
         evidence, or the more recently dated part of it, must be  dated  no
         earlier than 28 days before the date of application".

Discussion

21. The representatives agreed that there were two outstanding issues under
    the Rules:

       a) Whether the appellant had provided the required letter  from  the
          sponsor's  employer  containing  the  specified  information   as
          required by para 2(b) of Appendix FM-SE; and

       b) Whether the appellant  had  provided  the  required  person  bank
          statements corresponding to, and showing,  the  sponsor's  salary
          being paid in as set out in his payslips as required by para 2(c)
          of Appendix FM-SE.

22. As regards (a), Mr Howells accepted that the letter from the  sponsor's
    employer dated 28 February 2019 in the appellant's bundle (at p.44) met
    the requirement of Appendix FM-SE.  Also, on the respondent's  database
    was an equivalent letter dated 30 October 2018.   Mr  Howells  accepted
    that the requirement in para 2(b) was met.

23. As regards (b), Mr Howells accepted that the bank statements  from  the
    Yorkshire Bank submitted by the sponsor appeared to show the payment of
    his salary into that account corresponding  to  the  required  payslips
    that had been submitted.  He acknowledged that it was not clear on what
    basis the ECM had taken the view that these statements showed a payment
    in of the appellant's salary from an HSBC account.

24. To deal with this issue, the appellant briefly gave oral evidence.   He
    said that he did not have an HSBC account; only one with the  Yorkshire
    Bank.  He had no idea why the ECM had referred to an HSBC account.  His
    salary was paid into his Yorkshire Bank account.

25. Mr Howells did not cross-examine the sponsor and, at the conclusion  of
    the sponsor's evidence in chief, Mr Howells indicated that he  accepted
    the sponsor's evidence.

26. As a consequence, Mr Howells accepted that the appellant  had  provided
    the necessary bank statements showing payments into his Yorkshire  Bank
    account of his salary corresponding to the required payslips and so the
    appellant met the requirements of para 2(c).

27. No other matter now being in dispute,  Mr  Howells  accepted  that  the
    appellant met all the requirements for entry clearance as  a  'partner'
    in Section EC-P of Appendix FM and was entitled to entry clearance as a
    'partner'.  On this basis, Mr Howells invited me to  allow  the  appeal
    under Art 8 of the ECHR following the approach in TZ (Pakistan).

28. I am satisfied that the appellant met all the requirements of  Appendix
    FM as a 'partner'. It is not suggested that she does not continue to do
    so.  She is entitled to entry clearance on that basis.

29. Further, as a result, there is  no  public  interest  to  outweigh  the
    interference with her 'family life' with the sponsor in  the  UK  which
    results from the refusal decision (TZ (Pakistan) at [34]).  The refusal
    of entry clearance is a disproportionate interference with that  family
    life and is a breach of Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

30. As a result of my decision sent on 30 September 2020, the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's  appeal  involved  the
    making of an error of law and that decision was set aside.

31. For the reasons I have given,  I  re-make  the  decision  allowing  the
    appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.



                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                             14 January 2021
