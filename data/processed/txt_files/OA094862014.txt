Representation

For the Appellant:     The sponsor, Mr Daniel Donkor
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above, but the rest of this  determination
    refers to them as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana, born on 21  September  1988.   She
    has not asked for an anonymity direction, and none has been made.

 3. The appellant applied for clearance to enter the UK under  Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules as the partner  of  the  sponsor.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer refused that application  for  reasons  stated  in  a
    decision dated 20 August 2014.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Designated  Judge
    Murray allowed her appeal by decision promulgated on 6 July 2015.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer's grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    are based on "material misdirection of law".  Reference is made to  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for  the  specified  evidence  by
    which the sponsor's annual income of at least ï¿½18,600 had to be  shown.
    The application was made on 26 June 2014, so the  last  full  financial
    year was 2013 - 14.  As the application depended on  income  both  from
    employment and from self-employment of the sponsor, the relevant income
    from employment required also to be earned in the financial year 2013 -
    2014.  The judge erred by having regard  to  the  sponsor's  employment
    from  "2  February  2014  for  one   year"   (paragraph   15   of   the
    determination).

 6. On 11 November 2015  Designated  Judge  Shaerf  granted  permission  to
    appeal, on the view that  the  judge  arguably  did  not  look  at  the
    partner's income for the relevant  period,  being  the  past  financial
    year, and so misdirected herself in arriving at the conclusion that the
    sponsor had an income in excess of the minimum  income  requirement  of
    the Immigration Rules.

 7. The determination might bear the construction that there had been  some
    concession by  the  Presenting  Officer  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    However, Mr Matthews was able to demonstrate that  the  extent  of  the
    submission for the respondent was that the appellant might be  able  to
    succeed on a fresh application, but was unable to do so by reference to
    the evidence for the financial year 6 April 2013 to 5 April 2014.

 8. Mr Donkor referred to a form P60, to a letter from  HMRC,  and  to  his
    payslips.  However, it became clear that  the  evidence  supports  only
    earnings for the relevant period which fall short of the sum required.

 9. The sponsor approached the  matter  in  a  straightforward  and  candid
    manner, and  from  information  available,  it  appears  that  a  fresh
    application is likely to be granted.  It is  perhaps  unfortunate  that
    the entry to  the  UK  of  the  appellant  and  of  the  child  of  the
    relationship has been delayed through these proceedings.  (I  explained
    to the sponsor that a successful outcome to a fresh application  is  of
    course not guaranteed,  being  contingent  on  satisfactory  supporting
    evidence.)

10. The judge based her decision on evidence which did not  relate  to  the
    correct period of time.  She reached a conclusion which was not open to
    her, correctly applying the rules to the evidence which did go to  that
    period.  Her determination of the First-tier Tribunal  has  to  be  set
    aside, and there can only be one outcome.

11. The appeal, as  originally  brought  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is
    dismissed.
