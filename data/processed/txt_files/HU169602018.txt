                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Callow, promulgated on 29 May 2019. Permission to appeal was granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor on 26 July 2019.




Anonymity

   2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason for  one
      now

Background

 3. On 17 September 2001, the appellant entered  the  United  Kingdom  with
    entry clearance as a student. He was granted further periods  of  leave
    in  the  same  capacity  until  31  October  2004.  The  appellant  was
    hospitalised with a rare illness during 2003. He overstayed his  leave.
    During September 2008, he submitted an application for  further  leave.
    This application was refused on  15  January  2010,  with  a  right  of
    appeal, which the appellant did not exercise because he was not  served
    with the decision. On 22 November 2013, he sought leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds, which was refused with no right of  appeal  on  3
    January 2014.  The appellant made further  submissions  on  20  January
    2016, which followed service of a notice of removal. It is the  refusal
    of those submissions, by way of a letter dated 31 July 2018,  which  is
    the subject of this appeal.

 4. In the decision letter of 31 July 2018, the Secretary of State rejected
    the appellant's claim for leave  to  remain  under  the  partner  route
    because he had not been cohabiting with his partner, KSC, for two years
    prior to the date of the application and because there was no  evidence
    to show that they cohabited. It was not accepted that the  relationship
    was genuine and subsisting. The Secretary of State noted that there was
    no indication that the appellant had a biological child in  the  United
    Kingdom. Nor was it accepted that there were very significant obstacles
    to the appellant's integration in Jamaica, notwithstanding his  medical
    condition, which did not appear to be life-threatening. Article  3  was
    not said to be engaged.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, only the Article 8 claim
    was  pursued,  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's relationship with KSC and her three children from a  former
    relationship. The judge accepted that the appellant's relationship with
    KSC, who is a Jamaican national with indefinite leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom, was genuine and subsisting. He did not accept that  the
    youngest child  'M'  (who  had  no  relationship  with  his  biological
    father), was a qualifying child and therefore section 117B (6) did  not
    apply.  The judge found that the appellant's removal would not lead  to
    unjustifiably harsh consequences, that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles nor exceptional  circumstances  sufficient  to  outweigh  the
    public interest concerns.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal argued firstly, that there had been a failure  by
    the judge to engage with the specific facts of the appellant's case  in
    reaching his findings; secondly, that the judge  failed  to  take  into
    consideration the best interests of the affected children; thirdly, the
    judge made a mistake of fact in stating  that  he  was  misled  by  the
    appellant and in any  event  did  not  state  how  he  was  misled  and
    fourthly, the judge failed to take into account the submissions made on
    the appellant's behalf and relevant case law regarding M.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis sought.

 8. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response.

The hearing

 9. Mr Briddock contended  that  each  ground  stood  alone.  He  made  the
    following points.

10. Firstly, there had been a  lack  of  consideration  of  the  individual
    circumstances  of  the  appellant,  his  partner  and   her   children,
    particularly in relation to M who aged 6. While the judge was not bound
    to allow the appeal, had he considered all factors it could not be said
    he would have dismissed the appeal.  The appellant's private  life  had
    not been considered, including his length of residence, his serious ill
    health which led him to overstay, his  ignorance  of  the  respondent's
    2008 decision until it was disclosed in response to  a  Subject  Access
    Request  (SAR) in 2013, he had missed his right of appeal, he had given
    evidence regarding VAT fraud in a trial  and  his  evidence  led  to  a
    conviction and that he had family in the UK.  Secondly, while the judge
    directed himself appropriately as to the best interests of the affected
    children at [16], his only consideration of this  issue  was  to  state
    that it was in M's best interests to remain with his mother, which  was
    not the question. It was incumbent on the judge to consider whether the
    appellant's removal from the UK was in  M's  best  interests.  Thirdly,
    there was no evidence that the  appellant  had  misled  the  respondent
    regarding his cohabitation with his partner. It was not in dispute that
    they had not lived together for 2 years at the date of the application.
    It was unclear where this comment came  from.  Lastly,  the  judge  had
    failed to take into account  the  relevant  case  law,  none  of  which
    depended on M being a qualifying child.

11. Mr Walker did not attempt to defend the decision. He accepted that  the
    appellant did not try and mislead anyone regarding the  length  of  his
    relationship; that there was a lack of findings by the judge  regarding
    the individual children and nothing regarding the best interests of all
    3 children, including M.

Decision on error of law

12. The lack of consideration by the judge of the  individual  features  of
    the appellant's private and family life or the best  interests  of  the
    children, amounts to a clear error of  law.  Accordingly,  the  judge's
    decision is set aside.

Remaking

13. Mr Briddock asked me to proceed to  remake  the  decision,  making  the
    following submissions. The facts were  not  in  dispute,  reliance  was
    placed on the same evidence and skeleton argument before the First-tier
    Tribunal, which had concluded that there was a subsisting  relationship
    between the appellant and all 3 children. M's father had no involvement
    in his life and he had left the  family  home  as  a  result  of  KSC's
    pregnancy. It was not in M's best interests for  the  appellant  to  be
    removed. M would not leave the United Kingdom if the appellant left and
    it would not be reasonable to expect him to do so. The case boiled down
    to proportionality.

14. Taking into consideration s117B, the appellant spoke English, was not a
    burden on the taxpayer, he ran a successful business and was integrated
    which was shown by his cooperation with HMRC. While little  weight  was
    to be accorded to the appellant's private life or  relationship  formed
    while his stay was precarious, this was not a  straight-jacket  and  in
    any event his partner and children were not to be blamed for him  being
    an overstayer. It was disproportionate to expect the appellant to leave
    the UK.

15. Mr Walker stated that all points argued by Mr Briddock were  made  out,
    however he was not in a position to concede  the  appeal.  He  accepted
    that family life had been established and referred to the letters  from
    the children in the appellant's bundle.

16. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Decision on Remaking

17. The undisputed facts are that the appellant has resided in  the  United
    Kingdom for 18 years and that his leave has either been  precarious  or
    unlawful. He did not extend his leave in 2004 because the  year  before
    he was hospitalised  with  a  rare  illness,  Helicobacter  Pylori  and
    suffered from a range of unpleasant debilitating symptoms. Once he  had
    recovered sufficiently, he applied to resume  his  studies,  submitting
    such an application in September 2008, which was accompanied by details
    of his diagnosis, symptoms and treatment. A full account is set out  in
    the appellant's witness statement and it is not necessary to  replicate
    it here. The appellant did not receive the 2010 decision refusing  that
    application until 2013, when his current solicitors received a response
    to a SAR. By then the appellant had missed his  opportunity  to  appeal
    and his circumstances had changed by  2013,  in  that  he  was  relying
    solely on human rights grounds.

18. The appellant has been in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with
    KSC since the beginning of 2015 and they have been cohabiting since the
    end of 2015 onwards. They knew each other for about two years prior  to
    the relationship commencing. Therefore, at the time of the application,
    theirs was not a qualifying relationship. The appellant has  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with KSC's children now aged 15, 10 and  6.
    His relationship with M, the  youngest  child,  is  particularly  close
    because M has never had a  relationship  with  his  biological  father,
    unlike his older siblings. That relationship was formed from when M was
    aged 2. The strength of that relationship is  attested  to  in  witness
    statements from the appellant, KSC  as  well  as  letters  from  all  3
    children, including M.

19. The  appellant  recently  gave  evidence  for  Crown  in  a  successful
    prosecution of an  accountant  found  guilty  of  cheating  the  public
    revenue, money laundering and fraud offences. HMRC confirmed  the  same
    in a letter dated 28 February 2019. A newspaper article  confirms  that
    the accountant was sentenced to a total of  9  years  imprisonment  and
    that the sum involved was over �700,000.

20. It was not in dispute that the appellant enjoyed a family life with KSC
    and her three children. I therefore examine the best interests of those
    children, as a primary consideration in the balancing exercise.

21. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I find that M's  best
    interests, in particular, are served by the appellant remaining in  the
    UK, by some margin. The relevant factors  are  that  M  has  spent  his
    entire life in the United Kingdom, a period of nearly six  and  a  half
    years. He has no significant ties  to  Jamaica,  a  country  which  his
    mother left many years ago and long before her eldest child was born in
    2004.  M does not have a relationship with his  biological  father  and
    has forged a close bond with the  appellant.  The  appellant  is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with M's mother  and  has  a  close
    relationship to M's siblings.

22. In view of the content of the letters from the older two  children  and
    KSC's witness statement as to the extent of the appellant's involvement
    in their lives, I also find that it would be in  their  best  interests
    for the appellant to remain in the United Kingdom.

23. I am mindful that the best interests' assessment is  not  determinative
    of the appeal, ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 at [26] considered.

24. Owing to section 117A (2) of Part 5A of the 2002  Act,  in  considering
    proportionality, I am obliged to  have  regard  to  the  considerations
    listed in section 117B and do so below.

25. The  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is clearly engaged in this case, but to a  lesser  extent  for
    the following reasons.

26. The appellant came to overstay between 2004  and  2008  owing  to  ill-
    health which led to a  series  of  hospital  admissions  and  extensive
    treatment. He  brought  his  circumstances  to  the  attention  of  the
    respondent as soon as he was able  to  and  sought  to  regularise  his
    situation in 2008 so that he could continue  his  accountancy  studies.
    The appellant was never served with the decision made  to  refuse  that
    claim. By the time he became aware of it in 2013, his circumstances had
    changed. The appellant has continued to seek to  regularise  his  claim
    thereafter. A further  relevant  matter  is  that  the  appellant  gave
    evidence in a prosecution which contributed to  the  conviction  of  an
    accountant in 2018.  The latter point is strong evidence of the  extent
    of the appellant's integration in the UK.

27. I am mindful of the fact that the M is still not  a  qualifying  child,
    because he does not turn 7 until April 2020. While the appellant has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with M's older siblings, it is  the
    case  that  their  biological  father  is  involved  in  their   lives.
    Nonetheless, they are qualifying children it would not be reasonable to
    expect the older children to leave the United Kingdom because they have
    lived here their entire lives, they are educated in  this  country  and
    the eldest child is at a crucial stage of her education.  In  addition,
    the older two children have a close relationship  to  their  biological
    father, have other relatives in the United Kingdom as well  as  friends
    and interests.  The handwritten letters from all three children provide
    credible detail as to the impact the appellant has had on their  lives.
    Whereas the statement from KSC  states  that  the  appellant's  removal
    would have a devastating impact on all of the children and mentions the
    appellant's involvement with  all  parental  responsibilities  for  the
    three children and that he takes an active interest in their respective
    development and progress.

28. That the appellant speaks fluent English is a  neutral  matter  in  the
    balancing exercise. As  is  the  fact  that  he  is  not  a  burden  on
    taxpayers, in that he has  been  self-employed  and  resides  with  his
    partner who works.

29.  I have regard to the considerations at sections 117B (4) and (5)  that
    little weight should be given to the  appellant's  private  life  or  a
    relationship formed at a time when his immigration  status  was  either
    precarious or unlawful. Considering the misfortunes  and  errors  which
    led the appellant to overstay and be unaware of  the  decision  on  his
    2008 application for five years, I am prepared to attach more weight to
    his  private  life  than  I  otherwise  would.  I  am  guided  by  Kaur
    (children's best interests / public interest interface) [2017] UKUT  14
    (IAC) where the Upper  Tribunal  concluded  that  the  "little  weight"
    provisions "do not entail an absolute, rigid  measurement  or  concept;
    "little weight" involves a spectrum which,  within  its  self-contained
    boundaries, will result in the measurement of  the  quantum  of  weight
    considered appropriate in the fa the fact sensitive  context  of  every
    case."

30. Furthermore, Sales LJ observed at [53] of Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803;
    the "generalised normative guidance may be overridden in an exceptional
    case by particularly strong features of the private life  in  question,
    where it is not appropriate in Article 8 terms to  attach  only  little
    weight to private life." I find that this is such a case,  the  private
    and family life of the appellant has a special and compelling character
    in that it was established at a time when, despite his  misfortune,  he
    was doing his best to regularise his immigration status as well as that
    he was  willing  to  assist  the  authorities  in  the  above-mentioned
    prosecution.

31. The respondent's policy guidance, entitled "Family Life (as  a  partner
    or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes"  updated  on  22  February
    2018, says the following; "Significant weight must be given to  such  a
    period of continuous residence. The longer the child has resided in the
    UK, and the older the age at which they have  done  so,  the  more  the
    balance will begin to shift towards it being unreasonable to expect the
    child to leave the UK, and strong reasons will be required in order  to
    refuse a case where the  outcome  will  be  removal  of  a  child  with
    continuous UK residence of seven years or more." As emphasised above  M
    is not a qualifying child, however his residence  in  the  UK  to  date
    helps to shift the balance towards it being unreasonable to expect  him
    to leave the  UK  in  order  to  continue  his  family  life  with  the
    appellant.  The only countervailing factor in this  case  is  that  the
    appellant has no legal right to remain in the UK and has not  had  such
    since 2004, albeit  I  accept  that  he  had  no  intention  to  breach
    immigration law.

32. Having considered all the relevant matters in the round, including  the
    public interest considerations set out above, I am satisfied  that  the
    strong factors in support of the appellant remaining in the UK are  not
    outweighed by the countervailing considerations,  outlined  above.  The
    appellant's removal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences to
    him, his partner and all three children.

33. I conclude that it would be a disproportionate breach of Article 8  for
    the appellant to be removed. Accordingly,  his  appeal  succeeds  under
    Article 8.



Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision to be re-made.

I substitute a decision allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.

No application for anonymity was made and I saw no reason  to  make  such  a
direction.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of any fee which has been paid or may be  payable  for  the  following
reason. The case advanced at appeal was not  materially  different  to  that
made to the respondent in the application of 17 October 2016.
