For the Appellant:          Mr  S  Walker,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting

                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals against the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal  Judge  J  Bartlett,  promulgated  on  20  February  2017
    allowing the appeal of Mr Herpreet Singh against the  decision  of  the
    ECO to refuse entry clearance as a spouse pursuant to section  EC-P  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (the Rules). Hereinafter, I  shall
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a national of India born on 25 November  1989.  On  13
    January 2015 he was married to Ms Charnjit Kaur Singh, - hereafter 'the
    sponsor' - in India. On 3 February 2015 the Appellant applied for entry
    clearance with a view to settlement as the spouse of the  sponsor.  The
    application was refused for reasons set out in a Notice of  Immigration
    Decision dated 17 March 2015, with particular reference  to  paragraphs
    EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM of the Rules. Essentially  the
    Respondent was not satisfied that: (i) the couple were in a genuine and
    subsisting relationship; and (ii) that the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules were met  by  reference  to  the  sponsor's  income,  and  in
    particular that there had been a failure to provide specified documents
    in accordance with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 3. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

 4. The judge noted there were two issues before her  in  the  appeal.  The
    first concerned the genuineness and  subsistence  of  the  relationship
    between  the  Appellant  and  sponsor.   The  judge  found   that   the
    relationship was subsisting and that the  Appellant  intended  to  live
    permanently with the sponsor. The second issue concerned the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 5. The judge observed at [15] that:

 "it is not disputed that at the time of the application the  appellant  did
    not submit bank statements covering the full six-month  period  or  the
    letter from the employer setting out all the  information  required  by
    appendix FM-SE. However I consider that I  am  entitled  to  take  into
    account evidence submitted after the application so far as it  pertains
    to the situation as it was at the date of application."

"I also considered  that  the  letter  from  the  employer  which  has  been
    provided for the purposes of this appeal, complies with appendix FM-SE.
    In addition I find that Ms Singh has provided bank statements  covering
    the entire six month period an issue (sic). Therefore I  conclude  that
    the appellant has satisfied the financial requirement  in  appendix  FM
    and the requirements of appendix FM-SE."

 6. The judge proceeded to consider the  claim  outside  of  the  Rules  on
    Article 8 grounds and reached a somewhat odd conclusion that: as  there
    was no gap between the Immigration Rules and Article 8, as  the  former
    had been met, the Article 8 claim fails [19].

 7. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge McGinty on 4 September 2017.

8.    The grounds of appeal assert that  the  judge  erred  in  taking  into
    account documents that were not submitted with  the  application,  when
    considering whether or not the requirements of Appendix FM-SE had  been
    met, in respect of specified documents necessary to prove the financial
    requirements of the Rules.

Submissions

9.    Mr Walker in amplifying the grounds submitted that  the  judge  should
    not have considered documents at the date  of  hearing  that  were  not
    before the ECO at the date of decision. As the specified documents were
    not submitted to the ECO the judge should  have  dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Rules.

10.   Mr Anyene submitted that all the specified  documents  were  submitted
      with the appeal but were not considered by the Entry Clearance Manager
      (ECM). He submitted that the refusal decision  acknowledged  that  the
      documents were submitted. He  referred  to  the  bank  statements  and
      submitted that they were deficient of the requisite six  month  period
      by "eleven days at the beginning of the sequence". Mr Anyene submitted
      that that was sufficient to apply the "evidential flexibility policy".
      He invited the tribunal to find that there was no  material  error  of
      law in light of the documents that were  before  the  ECO  whose  main
      concern was the genuine nature of the relationship.

Consideration

11.   I consider that the central submissions  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
      Respondent by Mr Walker are correct.

12.   Under Appendix FM the Appellant must prove that the  sponsor's  income
      meets the minimum income threshold of ï¿½18,600 as specified within that
      appendix and is to be proved by the provision of  specified  documents
      as set out in Appendix FM-SE. That Appendix states at paragraph D(a):

      "In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix  states
      that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance Officer
      or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will  consider  documents
      that have been submitted with the application, and will only  consider
      documents submitted after the application where sub-paragraph (b), (e)
      or (f) applies."

      And at paragraph 2:

      "In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph 9
      applies), all of the following evidence must be provided"

13.   The  Rules  therefore  required  the  Appellant  to  provide  all  the
      specified documents to the ECO. The judge records at [15]  that  there
      was no dispute at the time of the application the  Appellant  did  not
      submit bank statements covering the full six-month period or a  letter
      from the employer setting out all the information required by Appendix
      FM-SE. That seems to me to be a fairly clear record of an admission on
      the part of  the  Appellant  that  the  required  documents  were  not
      submitted with the application.

14.   While before me  it  is  asserted  that  the  missing  documents  were
      provided to the ECO when the appeal was lodged but not  considered  by
      the ECM, I have not been directed  to  any  evidence  that  shows  the
      documents were so submitted. I note in  particular  that  the  missing
      documents  are  not  specifically  referred  to  in  the   Appellant's
      representatives covering letter attached to the grounds of  appeal  to
      the First-tier Tribunal or in the  grounds  themselves,  and  the  ECM
      noted that the Appellant had "not provided us with the documents  that
      were clearly mentioned  in  the  refusal."  Further,  the  Appellant's
      skeleton argument before the judge does not state that  the  documents
      were submitted to the ECO on appeal. Further still, the judge  records
      at [15]; "I also considered that the letter from  the  employer  which
      has been provided for the  purposes  of  this  appeal,  complies  with
      appendix FM-SE. In addition, I find that Ms Singh  has  provided  bank
      statements covering the entire six-month period an issue" (sic), which
      strongly supports the view that the documents were  not  submitted  to
      the ECO either at the time of  application  or  appeal.   I  therefore
      proceed on the basis that the Appellant has not established  that  the
      missing documents were submitted to the ECO at all.

15.   While I acknowledge  that  the  Rule  anticipates  the  submission  of
      additional evidence after an application has been filed with the  ECO;
      it does not, in my opinion, cover the present circumstance  where  the
      Appellant has not supplied the documents with the application and  has
      then, in effect, kept it back for use in appeal proceedings.

16.   In this context I consider that the judge erred in finding that  post-
      decision evidence was not to be excluded  if  it  shed  light  on  the
      circumstances appertaining at the time of  the  Respondent's  decision
      (section 85A(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  -
      see also DR (ECO:  post-decision  evidence)  Morocco  *  [2005]  UKIAT
      00038).

17.   In order to  succeed  in  his  application  for  entry  clearance  the
      Appellant had to meet the requirements of the Rules at the date of the
      Respondent's decision. In respect of  the  financial  requirements  he
      was, pursuant to the Rules, required: (a) to demonstrate  the  sponsor
      had a  level  of  income  in  accordance  with  that  specified  under
      paragraph E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM; (b) to demonstrate that the income
      was from specified sources (E-ECP 3.2); and (c) to establish  (a)  and
      (b) by the production of specified evidence pursuant to  Appendix  FM-
      SE.

18.   The  circumstances  appertaining  at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
      decision included  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  produce  the
      specified evidence. The availability of such evidence  now,  does  not
      alter the circumstances appertaining at the date of  the  Respondent's
      decision. The post-decision production of the omitted documents cannot
      alter the fact that at the  date  of  the  Respondent's  decision  the
      Appellant did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules because he had
      not complied with those requirements in respect of specified evidence.

19.   As the Appellant has not, therefore, submitted the  missing  documents
      at all to the ECO, I do  not  see  that  Appendix  FM-SE  paragraph  D
      applies. Furthermore, sub-paragraph (f) provides that a decision maker
      may contact the  applicant  or  their  representative  in  writing  or
      otherwise to request further information  or  documents.  It  was  not
      necessary, in my opinion, for the ECO or ECM to exercise a  discretion
      in favour of the  Appellant  where  the  missing  documents  were  not
      provided.

20.   In so far as it is argued that the judge erred  in  failing  to  apply
      the "evidential flexibility policy" I find there is no  merit  in  the
      Appellant's  submissions.  The  missing  bank   statements   did   not
      constitute documents omitted from a sequence of  documents  that  were
      submitted with the application. This  was  not  a  situation  of  gaps
      within the documents  submitted  that  might  have  been  filled;  the
      missing documents essentially were in respect of a period prior to and
      after  the  sequence  of  documents  that  were  submitted  with   the
      application.  The  application  failed  in  this  regard  because  the
      Appellant had failed to submit documents covering the whole  six-month
      period; it did not fail because there were documents  missing  in  the
      sequence of documents actually submitted.

21.   Given the rejection of the above aspect of the challenge, I find  that
      the Appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Rules and the appeal
      thereunder falls to be dismissed.

22.   The representatives agreed that, in the  event  I  should  reach  this
      conclusion, the fairest course  would  be  to  rehear  the  appeal  on
      Article 8 grounds outside of  the  Rules  as  this  was  not  properly
      considered by the First-tier Tribunal  and  was  predicated  upon  the
      judge's conclusion in respect of the Rules. An Article 8 claim outside
      of the Rules may well prove to be a difficult hurdle for the Appellant
      to cross in the circumstances,  but  I  make  no  affirmative  comment
      either way as the parties were not able to deal the claim and  I  have
      not heard any evidence or submissions on it. The appropriate forum  in
      the circumstances in which to do so is the First-tier Tribunal.

23.   I add one further comment. That is, as the Appellant is in  possession
      of the requisite specified documents, he may deem  it  appropriate  to
      make another application to the ECO under the Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of  law
      and is set aside. I remake the decision dismissing  the  appeal  under
      the Rules.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the
      Appellant's Article 8 claim. The judge's finding that the relationship
      requirements of the Rules is met is preserved.

           The appeal is to be heard by any judge apart from Judge J
      Bartlett.



No anonymity order is sought or made.
