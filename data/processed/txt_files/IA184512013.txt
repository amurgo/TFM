                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Borsada
    made following a hearing at Birmingham on 20th August 2013.





Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India, born on  23rd  October  1981.   He
    came to the UK in 2001 on a visit visa and overstayed.

 3. He was arrested in June 2009 on suspicion of immigration offences.   He
    subsequently made an application for leave to remain as  the  unmarried
    partner of a person present and settled in the UK which was refused.  A
    second application was again rejected in February 2010.  The  Appellant
    did not leave the UK but instead married his UK Sponsor in January 2012
    and made an application for leave to remain for a purpose  not  covered
    by the Immigration Rules.

 4. The application was refused on the basis that  the  Appellant  did  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor were in  a  long-term
    relationship and intended to stay together permanently as a couple. The
    Appellant knew that he was illegally in the country  for  a  very  long
    period of time and chose to do nothing about it. He noted that  it  was
    conceded that the couple made a mistake in not  seeking  to  regularise
    his stay before 2009 following the  expiry  of  his  initial  leave  to
    remain.

 6. He said that it was the Sponsor's evidence that she could not leave the
    UK after living here for  such  a  long  period  of  time.   She  is  a
    naturalised British citizen having originally  come  to  the  UK  as  a
    spouse from India and then been widowed.  She has two  adult  children.
    The judge said that it would not be reasonable for her to  return  with
    the Appellant to India although it would not be impossible for  her  to
    do so.  He accepted that the Sponsor was dependent on the Appellant for
    a number of domestic duties but her adult son lives at home  and  could
    help her and her other student son could offer  assistance  during  his
    holidays.

 7. He said any separation would be time limited given the expectation that
    the Appellant would be able to obtain a grant of entry  clearance.   He
    had a place to return to in India.  The relationships which  he  enjoys
    with the Sponsor's children are adult relationships  and  there  is  no
    evidence of any emotional dependency.

 8. He was  not  satisfied  that  it  would  be  disproportionate  for  the
    Appellant to be removed.  He noted that the Appellant had been here for
    a very long time but the longevity of the residence was achieved by his
    failing to regularise his stay and this seriously counted  against  him
    in the balancing exercise.  He wrote as follows:

         "I also do not find that anything has been stated in evidence which
         amounts to compelling compassionate circumstances and having regard
         to the adverse impact on the couple I am not satisfied that this is
         sufficient to tip the balance in favour of the Appellant given  the
         need to maintain effective immigration control in circumstances  in
         which the Appellant has remained unlawfully in the UK  for  a  very
         long time."





The Grounds of Application

 9. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had not applied the principle in  Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40,
    unlawfully applied a test of compelling compassionate circumstances and
    misapplied the weight in the proportionality exercise.   The  House  of
    Lords in Chikwamba stated that it would be comparatively rare that  the
    appeal would be dismissed on the basis that it would  be  proportionate
    and more appropriate for the Appellant to apply for leave to enter from
    abroad.  The Chikwamba principle can apply where there are no  children
    involved (Hayat v SSHD [2011] UKUT 00444).

10. The test of compelling  compassionate  circumstance  was  unlawful  and
    contrary to the spirit of Chikwamba.  Alternatively  the  decision  was
    perverse and ought to be re-made.

11. On 8th October  2013  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.  It was acknowledged that the judge did not specifically
    reference Chikwamba but this case was distinguishable and in any  event
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules have changed since  the  case
    was decided.

Submissions

12. Ms Hutton relied on her grounds and her skeleton argument.  This was  a
    long-term relationship.  She relied on the proposition in EB (Kosovo) v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 41 for the proposition that:

         "It will rarely be proportionate to uphold an order for removal  of
         a spouse if there is a close and genuine bond with the other spouse
         and that spouse cannot reasonably be expected to follow the removed
         spouse to the country of removal."

13. In this case the judge had found that it was  not  reasonable  for  the
    wife to go and live in India.

14. She submitted that the judge ought to have considered Chikwamba and was
    wrong to base his decision on the basis that separation would  only  be
    for a matter of weeks.  It was not possible  to  say  on  the  evidence
    before the judge whether the maintenance requirements could be met  nor
    indeed whether he could pass the English  language  test  although  her
    instructions were that he could.

15. She also submitted that  the  judge  had  applied  the  wrong  test  in
    referring  to  compelling,  compassionate   circumstances   which   was
    equivalent to a requirement of exceptionality.

16. Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no error of law in the  decision.
    She noted that the Appellant used  an  interpreter  in  court  and  the
    question of whether he could pass the relevant test was unproven.   His
    circumstances in the UK had not been assessed.  This  case  was  wholly
    different from the Appellant in Chikwamba who was returning to Zimbabwe
    and who, it was accepted, could meet the requirements of the Rules. The
    judge had not said that it was impossible for the wife to  return  with
    him to India and there was nothing to stop  the  Appellant  making  the
    appropriate application.

Findings and Conclusions

17. There is no error of law in the judge not  referring  to  the  case  of
    Chikwamba.  It is by no means clear that  the  Appellant's  application
    for entry clearance would be a mere  formality.  The  evidence  at  the
    hearing was that the Sponsor had earnings of ï¿½1,000 net from  her  shop
    and rental income but no proper assessment of  her  circumstances  have
    been made.  It is also far from clear that the Appellant would meet the
    English language requirements.

18. The assessment of proportionality was  a  matter  for  the  judge.   Ms
    Hutton referred to EB (Kosovo).  The Sponsor in  this  case  originally
    comes from India and she has no dependent relatives  for  whom  she  is
    responsible in the UK.  It was generous of the judge to  find  that  it
    would not be reasonable for her to go with her husband,  although  that
    was his finding, and he did say that it would not be impossible for her
    to do so.  However, against that, he balanced the Appellant's  terrible
    immigration history and the fact that he had been here unlawfully for a
    very long period of time.  That was a judgment for him to make.

19.  The  grounds  are  right  to  state  that   compelling   compassionate
    circumstances are not the correct test in the assessment of Article  8.
    However even if the judge had applied the correct test  his  conclusion
    would have been the same.  It is not disproportionate  in  all  of  the
    circumstances of this case to expect the Appellant to make the  correct
    application for entry clearance and to demonstrate that he can meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules in the normal way.  There  is  no
    error in the judge coming to that conclusion.

Decision

20. The judge's decision will stand.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
