                               (27.08.15), Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr Blundell, Counsel instructed by M & K
                               Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's appeal on Article  8
    grounds outside the Rules against the  decision  by  the  Secretary  of
    State to refuse to grant her leave to remain as the spouse of a British
    national.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction,
    and I do not consider that the claimant should  be  accorded  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of Venezuela, whose  date  of  birth  is  21
    January 1961.  On 1 April 2004 she flew in to Heathrow Airport, and was
    granted leave to enter for a period of six months as  a  visitor.   She
    made a valid in-time application for  ILR  to  remain  as  a  dependent
    relative of her niece on 30 September 2004,  but  the  application  was
    refused on 4 February 2005.  An appeal was lodged against this decision
    on 10 February 2005, and her appeal against this refusal  decision  was
    dismissed on 5 May 2006.  A subsequent application  for  a  High  Court
    review was refused on 26 May 2006, and  the  claimant's  appeal  rights
    became exhausted on 8 June 2006.

 3. There was no further contact with the claimant until 19 July 2010  when
    she applied for leave to remain on compassionate  grounds  outside  the
    Rules.  The application was refused without a right  of  appeal  on  31
    August 2010.  Subsequently, pre-action protocol letters were  submitted
    in  January  and  June  2012   whereby   the   claimant   requested   a
    reconsideration of her application.  On 10 April  2013  responses  were
    issued  to  the  pre-action  protocol  letters  upholding  the  initial
    decision.  Two further pre-action protocol letters  were  submitted  in
    May and November 2013.

 4. On 25 April 2014 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the application for leave to remain on reconsideration, and for  making
    directions for her  removal  in  accordance  with  Section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 5. It was noted that in the pre-action protocol letter of 29 May 2013  the
    claimant's solicitors had relied upon a  material  development  in  the
    claimant's case.  The material development was  the  claimant  and  her
    partner Mr Edward  Stephens  registering  their  marriage  at  a  civil
    ceremony on 9 April 2013.  The claimant's solicitors submitted  it  was
    unreasonable for Mr Stephens, a British national who had been born  and
    raised in the UK, to be expected to be uprooted from  his  settled  and
    established life in the UK  and  to  relocate  to  Venezuela  with  the
    claimant.

 6. With effect from 9 July 2012, the new Immigration Rules  established  a
    Rules-based approach to the consideration of Article 8 by defining  the
    basis on which an applicant could enter or remain  in  the  UK  due  to
    their family or private life.

 7. Accordingly, consideration had been given as to  whether  the  claimant
    qualified for leave to remain under Rule 276ADE(vi).  She was a  fluent
    Spanish speaker, and thus there was no linguistic impediment  posed  by
    her  return  to  Venezuela.   She  had  been  raised  and  educated  in
    Venezuela, and had spent 43 years of her life there.  Moreover, it  was
    noted that during her previous appeal hearing she had advised that  she
    had two daughters and two sisters still resident in Venezuela.   Whilst
    she had never had any legal entitlement to live and work in the UK, she
    had managed to support herself apparently without  recourse  to  public
    funds.  So there would be no undue hardship in expecting her to do  the
    same in her country of origin, where she could lawfully engage in  work
    and would have the assistance of her family to aid reintegration.

 8. With respect to family life, it was noted that there was  no  reference
    to the claimant's relationship with Mr Edward Stephens at the  time  of
    her  appeal  in  2005  and  2006.   The  claimant  did  not  meet   the
    requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner under  R-LTRP  as
    she had not made a valid application for limited leave to remain  as  a
    partner.  Consideration had been  given  as  to  whether  she  met  the
    requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(d), one of the  requirements  of  which  was
    that paragraph EX.1  applied.   The  claimant  needed  to  satisfy  the
    following criteria: "(b) the applicant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a  British  Citizen
    ... and there are insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with  that
    partner continuing outside the UK."

 9. It was accepted on the basis of the evidence produced that the claimant
    was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with a person  settled  in
    the UK.  But it was not accepted there were insurmountable obstacles to
    the family life enjoyed by the claimant and Mr Stephens being continued
    in  Venezuela.   In  determining  whether  there  were   insurmountable
    obstacles, consideration had been  given  to  the  seriousness  of  the
    difficulties  which  the  claimant  and  her  partner  would  face   in
    continuing family  life  outside  the  UK  and  whether  they  entailed
    something that could not be overcome even with a degree of hardship for
    one or more of the individuals concerned.

10. There were no impediments to  the  claimant  entering  or  residing  in
    Venezuela with Mr Stephens.  It was noted  that  Mr  Stephens  suffered
    from a heart attack in 2011, but he had not  evinced  evidence  of  any
    ongoing health complaints which merited ongoing treatment.

11. The alternative which  would  involve  least  disruption  would  be  to
    require the claimant to return to Venezuela of her own volition, and to
    seek entry clearance in the correct capacity.   The  claimant  and  her
    partner  had  at  all  material  times  been  fully  cognisant  of  the
    claimant's immigration status.  She did not attempt to  regularise  her
    status, after she became appeal rights exhausted in 2006, for a further
    four years.  That being the case, they would have  been  aware  of  the
    impermanence of their  relationship  as  the  claimant  was  liable  to
    removal by virtue of her remaining in the UK without leave.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. The claimant's appeal came before Judge North sitting at Bennett House,
    Stoke-on-Trent, on 19 August 2014.  Mr Halligan of Counsel appeared  on
    behalf of the claimant, and the Secretary of State was  represented  by
    Ms Hussain, Home Office Presenting Officer.  The  judge  received  oral
    evidence from the claimant and Mr Stephens.

13. In his subsequent decision,  Judge  North  said  that  the  appeal  was
    pursued on the basis that there were insurmountable difficulties in the
    claimant and her husband continuing their  family  life  in  Venezuela;
    alternatively, it would not be proportionate to expect the claimant  to
    return to Venezuela and make an application for entry  clearance  as  a
    spouse from there.

14. At paragraph 8 he found that the claimant had met Mr Stephens in August
    2004, when she was living with her niece, her niece's husband  and  her
    great nephew.  Her relationship with Mr  Stephens  deepened,  and  they
    decided to live together in 2006.  The claimant had divorced her  first
    husband in 2004, and Mr Stephens divorced his first wife in  May  2011.
    He had two children by that marriage and  grandchildren,  whom  he  saw
    regularly.

15. At paragraph 9, the judge found that Mr Stephens was 67 years  of  age.
    Although he was past retirement age, he still worked as a lorry  driver
    for Leicestershire Council on a part-time basis.  Although he no longer
    saw a consultant in respect of a heart attack which he had suffered  on
    13 July 2011, he needed to take appropriate medication.  He had chronic
    obstructive pulmonary disease, for which he took medication in the form
    of oral sprays.  He did not speak Spanish.  With his state pension  and
    earnings, he had sufficient to be able to fund the claimant's return to
    the UK as his spouse if necessary.  His annual income from his  pension
    and wages was in excess of �16,400.  He also  had  savings  of  �32,000
    which were accruing interest.

16. At paragraph 10 the judge found that Mr Stephens could  not  reasonably
    be expected to relocate to Venezuela. Given his age and health history,
    he would not find alternative employment either in Venezuela  or  again
    in the UK if required to interrupt  his  present  employment.   He  had
    experienced serious health  problems  in  the  past,  and  he  did  not
    discount that the stress of moving to an unknown  country  and  culture
    would significantly impact on Mr  Stephens.   The  judge  continued  in
    paragraph 11:

         "The alternative suggestion is that  the  claimant  can  return  to
         Venezuela and make an application to re-enter the United Kingdom as
         a spouse.  I am mindful of the  provision  in  Chikwamba.   On  the
         evidence before me, it appears  highly  likely  that  the  claimant
         would be granted entry clearance to re-enter the UK as a spouse.  I
         am in no doubt that her relationship with Mr Stephens  is  genuine,
         subsisting and longstanding.  In the  particular  circumstances  of
         this case, I find so much must be set  against  concerns  that  the
         claimant might be seen to be queue-jumping if she does  not  return
         to Venezuela to make the application."

17. The judge concluded in paragraph 12 that while the Secretary of State's
    decision  was  in  accordance  with  the   Rules,   the   consequential
    interference with the private and family life of the claimant  and  the
    sponsor was disproportionate to the  need  to  enforce  firm  and  fair
    immigration control.  So he allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

18. Ms Jamila Hussain on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  settled  an
    application for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   She
    submitted that the judge  had  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    findings on material matters.  The concerns that arose around Chikwamba
    were the prospective length and degree of family disruption involved in
    the claimant going  abroad  for  entry  clearance.   Provided  all  the
    relevant and requisite information was provided with  any  application,
    the visa would only take a few months to process.   During  that  time,
    either the sponsor could accompany the  claimant  to  Venezuela  or  he
    could stay here.  That would not be a disproportionate interference.

19. The  claimant's  circumstances  did  not  amount  to  compassionate  or
    compelling circumstances,  especially  when  taken  in  line  with  her
    immigration history.  She was an overstayer for four years, and  having
    been fully aware she had no right to remain in the UK, she still formed
    or  developed  a  relationship  while  her   immigration   status   was
    precarious.  Her explanation for not contacting  the  Home  Office  for
    four years was that she believed that an application was put  in  place
    by her previous solicitors, and it appeared  that  the  judge  accepted
    this.  But the case of BT (Nepal) stated that if an appeal is based  in
    whole  or  in  part  on  allegations  about  the  conduct   of   former
    representatives, there must be evidence  that  those  allegations  have
    been put to the former representative, and the Tribunal must  be  shown
    either the response or correspondence  indicating  there  has  been  no
    response.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

20. On 9 October 2014 Judge Reid  granted  permission  to  appeal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "It is arguable that the judge failed to give adequate reasons  for
         finding, absent medical evidence, the claimant's husband could  not
         reasonably be expected to move to Venezuela (where the claimant has
         two adult daughters).  It is arguable that the judge speculated  as
         to the husband's employment  prospects  in  Venezuela.   The  judge
         noted an entry clearance application was highly likely  to  succeed
         however it is arguable he failed to give adequate reasons  why  the
         claimant's immigration history should carry little  weight  in  the
         proportionality analysis or why it would be  unreasonable  for  the
         claimant's husband to accompany her to Venezuela while she made the
         application."

The Error of Law Hearing

21. Mr Avery submitted that the judge had failed to follow a structured two-
    stage approach, and when dealing with  proportionality  had  failed  to
    take any account of the claimant's adverse immigration history.   There
    was also no reference to Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

22. In reply, Mr Blundell submitted that there were in essence two  grounds
    of  appeal,  one  relating  to  the  question  of  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to the couple settling in Venezuela;  and  the
    other relating to the question of whether the judge had given  adequate
    reasons for finding that it was not reasonable to expect  the  claimant
    to return to Venezuela  to  seek  entry  clearance  to  the  UK  as  Mr
    Stephens' spouse.

23. He referred me to the definition of insurmountable obstacles  contained
    in EX.2 which was inserted from 28 July  2014:  "For  the  purposes  of
    paragraph EX.1(b) 'insurmountable obstacles' means the very significant
    difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their partner  in
    continuing their family life together outside the UK  and  which  could
    not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
    or their partner."

24. Mr Blundell accepted that the judge had not in terms  assessed  whether
    the evidence met the high threshold of insurmountable  obstacles.   But
    he submitted that, following Edgehill and Another v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 402  the  judge  was  right  to
    conduct a freewheeling Article 8 assessment  outside  the  Rules  under
    which he was merely required to determine whether it was reasonable  to
    expect Mr Stephens to settle with the claimant in  Venezuela,  in  line
    with old authorities  such  as  VW  (Uganda).   This  was  because  the
    decision under appeal related back to an  application  which  had  been
    made in 2010, and hence before the introduction of  the  new  Rules  in
    June 2012.

25. As to the judge's approach to the Chikwamba issue,  he  submitted  that
    his approach was compliant with the observations of the Court of Appeal
    in Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  Hayat  and  Another
    [2013] Imm AR 1 and his conclusion was open to him on the evidence.  He
    relied on the well-known passage from Piglowska  Piglowski  [1999]  WLR
    1360 at 1372(d) to (f) where Lord Hoffmann said:

         "First, the appellate court must bear in mind the  advantage  which
         the first instance judge had in seeing the parties  and  the  other
         witnesses.  This is well understood on questions of credibility and
         findings of primary fact.  But  it  goes  further  than  that.   It
         applies also to the judge's evaluation of those facts.   If  I  may
         quote what I said in Biogen Inc. v Medeva Ltd. [1997] R.P.C. 1, 45:

             'The need for appellate caution in reversing the trial judge's
             evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid  grounds
             than professional courtesy.  It is because  specific  findings
             of fact, even by the most meticulous judge, are inherently  an
             incomplete statement of the impression which was made upon him
             by the primary evidence.  His expressed  findings  are  always
             surrounded by  a  penumbra  of  imprecision  as  to  emphasis,
             relative weight, minor qualification and nuance ...  of  which
             time and language do not permit exact  expression,  but  which
             may  play  an  important   part   in   the   judge's   overall
             evaluation.'"

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

26. The decision under appeal is not the decision which was taken in  2010,
    which did not attract a right of appeal.  Moreover, the decision  taken
    in 2010 was only to refuse  to  grant  the  claimant  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules.  There  was  not  a  concomitant  decision  to  make
    directions for her removal.

27.  The  eventual  decision  to  remove  the  claimant  came  about  after
    protracted correspondence between the  claimant's  solicitors  and  the
    Home Office.  The  first  two  pre-action  protocol  letters  from  the
    claimant's solicitors preceded the introduction of the new  Rules,  but
    the two most recent pre-action protocol letters were  sent  well  after
    the introduction of the new Rules, following a response letter from the
    Home Office dated 18 April 2013.

28. The two grounds on which  the  claimant's  solicitors  asked  the  Home
    Office to reconsider the claimant's case were firstly  that  there  had
    been a material change of circumstances and secondly that the  claimant
    wished a decision to be made on removal, so as to give her a  right  of
    appeal against an adverse decision on removal.  The material change  of
    circumstances  relied  on  was  the  claimant  getting  married  to  Mr
    Stephens, an event which took place after the introduction of  the  new
    Rules.

29. In all the circumstances, I do not consider  that  the  decision  under
    appeal can be treated as relating back to an application made in  2010.
    The ratio of Edgehill is that the transitional provisions  set  out  in
    the Statement of Changes HC 194 provided that an  application  for  ILR
    made before 9 July 2012  but  not  yet  decided  would  be  decided  in
    accordance with the old Rules, and  that  it  was  therefore  wrong  to
    assess an application for ILR made before 9 July 2012 under the new and
    less favourable twenty year Rule, rather than under the  old  and  more
    favourable fourteen year Rule.  Here, the application made in 2010  was
    decided in 2010.  It is debatable whether  the  correspondence  in  the
    first part of 2012 constituted a fresh application.   But  even  if  it
    did, the application was refused in April  2013.   The  decision  under
    appeal is a response to further representations  received  after  April
    2013, and so the Secretary of State is not debarred from assessing  the
    Article 8 claim by reference to the new Rules.

30. As stated in the latest published Home Office guidance, the  assessment
    of whether there are insurmountable obstacles is a different  and  more
    stringent assessment than whether it would be reasonable to expect  the
    applicant's partner to join  them  overseas.   The  judge  referred  to
    insurmountable difficulties in paragraph 7, but did not go on to make a
    finding of insurmountable obstacles.  He merely found at  paragraph  10
    that Mr Stephens could  not  reasonably  be  expected  to  relocate  to
    Venezuela, having considered the evidence referred to in  paragraph  9.
    While the judge began on the correct trajectory,  he  ended  up  asking
    himself the wrong question.

31. If he meant to find that there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    couple enjoying family life  together  in  Venezuela,  the  judge  gave
    inadequate reasons for reaching such a conclusion.   Alternatively,  if
    the judge  accepted  that  the  evidence  fell  short  of  establishing
    insurmountable obstacles within  the  meaning  of  EX.1(b),  the  judge
    needed to state this; and  the  judge  needed  to  go  on  to  identify
    compelling reasons not sufficiently recognised under the  Rules  as  to
    why the claimant should nonetheless be granted Article 8 relief.

32. As stated in the refusal letter, the least disruptive  option  for  the
    claimant and her husband was for the claimant to return to Venezuela to
    make an application for entry clearance.  The judge's assessment of the
    reasonableness of that option is  wholly  inadequate.   The  claimant's
    poor immigration history was a highly material consideration which  the
    judge wholly failed to take into  account.   The  judge  also  did  not
    address the question of how long any period of separation was likely to
    be.

33. In Hayat, at paragraph [50] Elias LJ said that the first instance judge
    had rightly focused on three matters which went both to the substantive
    merits of an Article 8 claim and were also  relevant  to  the  question
    whether it was in any event legitimate to require the applicant to make
    his application from Pakistan:

         "The first is that as persons only permitted to be  temporarily  in
         the UK, neither the applicant  nor  his  wife  had  any  legitimate
         expectation of a right to remain.  The second is  that  the  family
         life could continue  in  Pakistan,  although  the  wife  would  for
         obvious reasons not wish to return.  The third was that any  period
         of separation would be short.  In Chikwamba Lord Brown specifically
         identified the length and degree of family disruption as  a  factor
         which would be highly  relevant  to  the  question  whether  it  is
         proportionate to insist that the application be  made  from  abroad
         ..."

34.  At  paragraph  [51],  Elias  LJ  said  that  these  were  all   proper
    considerations to weigh in the balance when considering the  merits  of
    the Article 8 claim.  As the Secretary of  State  pointed  out  in  her
    submissions, there was strong Strasbourg and domestic authority to  the
    effect that only in exceptional circumstances would a  couple  who  had
    formed a union in full knowledge of the precarious  immigration  status
    of either of them be entitled to remain pursuant to Article  8  rights:
    see Y v Russia [2010] 51 EHRR 21 paragraph 104.

35. Accordingly, Elias LJ continued in paragraph [52], the  Upper  Tribunal
    was not justified in concluding that the only factor militating against
    the application of Article 8 was the fact that the  applicant  had  not
    made his application from Pakistan.  On the contrary, there were cogent
    factors justifying the conclusion that Article 8 was not  infringed  by
    requiring the appellant to return to Pakistan.

36. Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal is vitiated by a material  error  of  law  such  that  it
    should be set aside and remade.

Directions for Remaking

37. Mr Blundell and Mr Avery were in agreement that this is a suitable case
    to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  Mr  Avery  was  content  that  the
    decision should be remade on the  evidence  as  it  stood,  whereas  Mr
    Blundell  said  he  wished  to  adduce  additional  evidence   on   the
    availability of the sponsor's  medication  in  Venezuela,  and  on  the
    conditions prevailing in Venezuela generally, which he  indicated  were
    dire.  I was persuaded that it was in accordance  with  the  overriding
    objective that the claimant  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  adduce
    additional evidence on these topics.

38. I gave the claimant permission to adduce additional evidence  that  was
    not before the First-tier Tribunal on the topic of  (a)  the  sponsor's
    current  medication,  and  the  availability  of  such  medication   in
    Venezuela; and (b) conditions in  Venezuela  generally,  provided  such
    evidence was served in a paginated and indexed bundle on the Specialist
    Appeals Team and the Upper Tribunal not less than seven days before the
    resumed hearing. I also directed that the  resumed  hearing  should  be
    fixed at the convenience of Mr Blundell of Counsel if possible.

The Resumed Hearing

39. For the purposes of remaking the decision,  the  claimant's  solicitors
    filed with the Upper Tribunal an extensive number of documents relating
    primarily to the topic of the sponsor's  current  medication,  and  the
    availability of such medication in  Venezuela,  but  also  relating  to
    conditions in Venezuela generally.

40. A Spanish interpreter had not been requested for the hearing, but  this
    did not present a procedural obstacle, as Mr Duffy made it  clear  that
    he was not proposing to cross-examination the appellant on her evidence
    in any event.  Mr Blundell simply asked  the  appellant  to  adopt  the
    witness statement which she had made for the hearing in the  First-tier
    Tribunal, and her command of English was sufficient to enable her to do
    so.

41. Mr Stephens was called as a witness, and was examined at  length  about
    his various medical conditions, and about the medication which  he  was
    required to take on a daily basis in order to manage these  conditions.



42. In cross-examination, Mr Stephens acknowledged  that  he  continued  to
    work part time and that he was also able to draw on two  pensions.   He
    estimated that his current annual income, including  the  two  pensions
    which yielded �14,500 per annum, was just  under  �23,000.   He  worked
    part-time for the council as a lorry driver.   The  property  which  he
    owned was worth between �145,000 and �155,000, and it was  unmortgaged.
    He also had between �40,000 to �45,000 in savings.

43. In his closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr
    Duffy relied on what was said in the decision letter of 25  April  2014
    on the topic of insurmountable obstacles.  The focus had to be  on  the
    family life which would be enjoyed in the country to which an applicant
    would be returned not a comparison to the life they  would  enjoy  were
    they to remain in the UK.  On the topic of the impact of  a  mental  or
    physical disability, it was noted that Mr Stephens had suffered from  a
    heart attack in 2011.  However  he  had  evinced  no  evidence  of  any
    ongoing health complaints which merited treatment, accordingly  it  was
    not considered unreasonable to expect him to continue his  family  life
    in Venezuela.

44. While he did not in dispute that Mr Stephens took the medication  which
    was referred to in  the  disclosed  documents,  he  submitted  that  Mr
    Stephens  had  sufficient  funds  available  to  him  to  purchase  the
    medicines he required in Venezuela privately.  Even  if  he  could  not
    source them locally, he could either import the medicines  from  abroad
    or he could travel to other countries to obtain the  medicines.   As  a
    British national, he had the freedom  of  movement  to  get  his  drugs
    elsewhere.

45. In reply, Mr Blundell referred me to his skeleton argument and drew  my
    attention to pages 258 to 260  of  the  supplementary  bundle.   In  an
    article dated 28 April 2015 which was carried online by the Daily  Mail
    it was reported that desperate patients had  been  forced  to  beg  for
    medicine on Twitter on Venezuela because the crumbling economy had left
    the country  unable  to  import  medical  supplies.   Venezuelans  were
    pleading with foreigners to send them  medicines  using  the  hash  tag
    "Servicio publico".  They were in desperate need of treatment  for  all
    manner of medical conditions - including blood disorders,  viruses  and
    infections.  Venezuela's economy was  crumbling  and  medical  supplies
    were  running  out.   Pharmaceutical  companies  were  unable  to   pay
    international suppliers due to  a  lack  of  foreign  currency  in  the
    country.  One tweet using the "Servicio publico" hash tag was  sent  on
    behalf of a 22-year-old, who desperately needed 10mg  of  solution  for
    use in injections to treat her severe coronary  condition.   The  tweet
    itself was sent by her uncle who, despite being a pharmacist with  good
    contacts, had had no luck obtaining his niece's medicine himself.   The
    uncle was quoted as saying that if those who  were  inside  the  pharma
    business could not locate the products, what could  a  regular  citizen
    expect to find?  Pharmacy shelves lay  empty,  with  even  basics  like
    vitamin C, folic acid, headache pills and remedies for  mosquito  bites
    almost entirely unavailable in the capital Caracas.  Medical  shipments
    had dried up as Venezuelan pharmaceutical companies  seek  to  pay  off
    their combined debts of well in excess of 245,000,000  dollars,  rather
    than bring in additional expensive products.  A black market  in  goods
    was understood to have been established, with drugs being  smuggled  in
    from neighbouring Colombia, but the supply was  not  nearly  enough  to
    provide medicine for all who needed it.  The article continued:

         'The only response from the Venezuelan government to the developing
         crisis so far had  been  to  issue  a  directive  stating:  'It  is
         strictly  prohibited  for  patients  or  their  families  to  bring
         medicines  or  medical  supplies  for  their  treatment,  even   if
         hospitals don't have the necessary supplies.'

46. Mr Blundell also relied on a report  on  Mr  Stephens  prepared  by  Dr
    Skehan, consultant cardiologist, of 14 July 2015. Dr Skehan opines that
    Mr Stephens has made continued good progress  after  a  previous  heart
    attack.  However there has to be continued adherence to the disciplines
    of regular prophylactic medications, as well as not smoking and keeping
    his exercise level to a reasonable intensity.  He says that Mr  Stevens
    is a generally low risk status at the  moment,  but  there  is  a  real
    potential for problems  where  modern  medical  surveillance  might  be
    important for him.

Discussion and Findings

47. The issue which arises on the evidence is whether Mr Stephens would  be
    likely to encounter very significant difficulties  in  maintaining  his
    drugs regime, and hence his health, if he was  required  to  settle  in
    Venezuela with the appellant on a permanent  basis;  and  whether  such
    difficulties could  not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious
    hardship for either him or his wife.

48. I do not consider that  this  issue  is  adequately  addressed  in  the
    decision letter.  The decision maker proceeded on  the  mistaken  basis
    that Mr Stephens  has  not  evinced  evidence  of  any  ongoing  health
    complaints since 2011 which merit treatment.  On the contrary, there is
    clear evidence of Mr Stephens having ongoing  health  complaints  which
    require him to take some ten or eleven different drugs daily  in  order
    for them to be managed and kept under control.

49. Although Mr Stephens might well have the financial resources to  obtain
    privately the medicines he needs in Venezuela, it is very unlikely  (as
    things stand) that many of these drugs, or suitable alternatives, would
    actually be available  in  Venezuela  to  be  purchased.   Indeed,  the
    situation is so dire that it is questionable whether any of them  would
    be available for private purchase.

50. It is not an adequate answer on Mr Duffy's part to say that Mr Stephens
    can arrange for the medicines he requires to be imported, as there is a
    government ban on the import of medicines, and  the  claimant  and  her
    partner cannot be expected to break the law.  Given the ban, it is also
    not a reasonable proposition that Mr  Stephens  should  travel  out  of
    Venezuela and bring back the medicine he requires in his luggage.  This
    would still breach the ban on the importation of medicines.

51. One of the conditions that Mr Stephens suffers from is CPOD.  For  this
    he is prescribed an Oxis6 turbohaler, which he must puff on  twice  per
    day.  Mr Stephens gave  credible  and  unchallenged  evidence  that  he
    needed these sprays to  assist  him  in  breathing,  and  it  was  very
    difficult for him to breath without them.  The level  of  distress  and
    discomfort which Mr Stephens would suffer in Venezuela if  he  was  not
    able to access a spray which assisted him in breathing would be  likely
    to be very considerable, and would amount to very serious hardship.

52. I accept that the couple's relocation to Venezuela for settlement on  a
    permanent basis is a purely  theoretical  consideration,  in  that  the
    obvious and far more attractive alternative  is  for  the  claimant  to
    return to Venezuela on her own to seek entry clearance to return as  Mr
    Stephen's  partner,  an  application  which  is  very  likely   to   be
    successful.  But the claimant is entitled to resist removal, and  hence
    the requirement to return to Venezuela to seek entry clearance, if  she
    can show that there are insurmountable obstacles, within the meaning of
    paragraph EX.2, to her and her partner carrying on  family  life  on  a
    permanent  basis  in  Venezuela.   On  a  holistic  assessment  of  the
    evidence, I find that the claimant has discharged the burden of proving
    that her appeal should be allowed under Appendix FM.
