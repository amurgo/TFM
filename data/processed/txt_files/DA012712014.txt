Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Walsh, instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Malawi, born on 17 December 1990. He has
      been given permission to appeal against the decision of the First-tier
      Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision  that
      section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied.

   2. The appellant first entered the United Kingdom  on  31  January  1994,
      aged three, with his mother and siblings. They were granted  leave  to
      enter until 31 January 1996. On 3 December 1994 he returned to  Malawi
      to live with his grandmother but he re-entered the United  Kingdom  on
      10 May 1996, aged five, and was granted further leave to enter for six
      months. His leave  was  extended  annually,  as  a  dependant  on  his
      mother's student visa, until 21 November 2000. On 20 November 2000 his
      mother made an  application  on  his  behalf  for  leave  outside  the
      immigration rules, which was refused on 15  May  2001  and  an  appeal
      against that decision was dismissed on 17 November 2004. The appellant
      made a further application for leave to remain on human rights grounds
      on 29 December 2004, but that was refused on 25 June 2007.

   3. Between June 2008 and March 2014 the appellant received 6  convictions
      for 9 offences in the United Kingdom: On 26 June 2008 he was convicted
      of possessing a knife blade in a public place for which he received  a
      ten month referral order; on 23 June 2009  he  received  an  18  month
      community order for possession of controlled drug Class B -  cannabis;
      on 26 February 2010 he was convicted of two counts  of  possession  of
      class A drugs (heroin and crack cocaine) with  intent  to  supply  and
      received  two   sentences   of   30   months'   imprisonment   running
      concurrently; on 10 February 2011 he was fined �50 for possession of a
      class B drug - cannabis; on 4 July 2013 he was convicted of possession
      of a class B drug - cannabis; on 28 January 2014 he was  convicted  of
      having an article with a blade in a public place and, together, on  25
      February 2014  was  convicted  of  unlawful  wounding,  for  which  he
      received on 21 March 2014  a  sentence  of  12  months  and  6  months
      imprisonment running concurrently.

   4. Following the appellant's  conviction  on  26  February  2010  he  was
      notified of his liability for automatic deportation.  His  mother  was
      granted indefinite leave to remain on 11 May  2010  on  the  basis  of
      having lived in the United  Kingdom  for  over  14  years  and  on  22
      November 2010 a decision was made not  to  pursue  deportation  action
      against him. A warning letter was issued to him. On 22  November  2010
      he was granted discretionary leave to remain until 16  November  2013.
      His application, made on 18 November 2013, for  further  discretionary
      leave, was refused.

   5. As a  result  of  the  most  recent  convictions,  the  appellant  was
      notified,  on  10  April  2014,  of  his   liability   for   automatic
      deportation. He made  representations  in  response  on  9  May  2014,
      claiming that his deportation would breach his  human  rights  on  the
      basis of his family and private life, referring in particular  to  his
      British citizen child and  his  length  of  residence  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

   6. A deportation order was signed against the appellant on 16  June  2014
      and a decision was made that section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007
      applied. The decision was served on him on 19 June 2014.

   7. In that decision the respondent noted that the appellant had  a  three
      year old daughter who was a British citizen, but did not  accept  that
      he was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with her.  An  attempt
      had been made to contact his daughter's mother for confirmation of the
      relationship but no response was received and there was no evidence of
      a  subsisting  relationship.  The  appellant  accepted  that  he   had
      separated from her mother  and  accordingly  he  could  not  meet  the
      requirements in paragraph 399(a) and (b).  With  regard  to  paragraph
      399A, the respondent accepted that the appellant was under the age  of
      25 and that he had spent  more  than  half  his  life  in  the  United
      Kingdom, but did not  accept  that  he  had  no  ties  to  Malawi  and
      considered that he had a subsisting cultural link which could aid  him
      in reintegration. It was noted that his passport showed  that  he  had
      visited Malawi  in  June/  July  2012  and  September/  October  2012.
      Accordingly it was not accepted that he could  meet  the  requirements
      under paragraph 399A. The respondent considered  that  there  were  no
      exceptional circumstances  outweighing  the  public  interest  in  his
      deportation.

   8. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal was  heard
      on 16 December 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles.

Appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

   9. Judge Miles heard from the appellant, his mother and his  brother  and
      had before him a witness statement from his sister. He did not  accept
      that the appellant had a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his
      daughter, noting that he did not know the whereabouts of  her  or  her
      mother and, as such, found that he did not meet  the  requirements  of
      paragraph 399(a) and (b) of the  Immigration  Rules.  With  regard  to
      paragraph 399A, it was noted that  the  rule  had  changed  since  the
      decision  was  originally  made  and  the  judge  concluded  that  the
      appellant could not meet  the  requirement  at  paragraph  399A(a)  of
      having been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for  most  of  his
      life. He calculated that the appellant had been lawfully  resident  in
      the United Kingdom for a total of twelve years, four months and  three
      days as at the date of the hearing, which he took to be  the  relevant
      date, rather than the date of the immigration decision, noting that no
      submissions were made otherwise in that latter respect.  He  included,
      within that period, the initial period of leave from 31 January  to  3
      December 1994 of ten months and three days and the  subsequent  period
      from 10 May 1996 which, at the date of the hearing, was  eleven  years
      and six months. He found that the appellant, being one day short of 25
      years of age at the  date  of  the  hearing,  had  not  been  lawfully
      resident in the United Kingdom for half of his life and he found that,
      on that basis, he had not been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom
      for most of his life. Accordingly he found that  the  requirements  of
      399A could not be met and did  not  go  on  to  consider  the  further
      requirements in paragraph 399A(b) and (c), relating to integration. He
      found there to be no compelling circumstances  over  and  above  those
      described in paragraphs  399  and  399A  and  he  concluded  that  the
      appellant's deportation would not breach his Article 8  human  rights.
      He dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

  10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought on behalf of the
      appellant, on the grounds that the judge, having made an error in  the
      appellant's age at the date of the hearing, was  wrong  in  concluding
      that he had not spent more than half his life in the  United  Kingdom.
      Since he had not gone on to consider the question of integration, that
      remained to be considered.

  11. Permission was granted on 22 January 2014.

Appeal hearing and submissions

  12. The appeal came before me on 9 March 2015.

  13. Mr Avery accepted that the judge had made an error in the  appellant's
      age and that he did in fact meet the requirement at paragraph 399A(a),
      but he submitted  that  that  was  not  a  material  error  since  the
      appellant could not meet the requirements in paragraph 399A(b) and (c)
      in any event. However I preferred the submissions made by Mr Walsh  in
      that respect, namely that the  error  was  a  material  one  and  that
      accordingly the decision had to be re-made  by  considering  paragraph
      399A(b) and (c).

  14. Mr Walsh was happy to proceed  with  the  re-making  of  the  decision
      without an adjournment, on  the  basis  of  the  documentary  evidence
      already available. The appellant's mother,  brother  and  sister  were
      present but Mr Walsh advised  me  that  they  simply  stood  by  their
      previous statements and evidence and had nothing to add.

  15. The appellant, however, gave further oral evidence and  confirmed  his
      previous statement. He said that he had  last  had  contact  with  his
      daughter at the end of 2012. There was no contact between her and  any
      of his family members. He was in the  process  of  commencing  contact
      proceedings before going to prison but could not pay  the  solicitors'
      fees. He planned to continue when released from  prison.  His  mother,
      brother and sister are all settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  had
      visited Malawi twice in 2012, first with his mother and then with  his
      brother, for a month each time and stayed in a hotel.  He  went  there
      because he was getting into trouble here and had been shot at and  his
      mother suggested that he went on holiday with her to keep himself  out
      of trouble. The second time was also to keep himself out  of  trouble,
      but also to sort out a headstone for his grandfather's grave. He could
      not go back to live in Malawi as his family was all here and he needed
      to be around  for  his  daughter.  Also  he  would  find  it  hard  to
      communicate as English was spoken only in business  and  in  shops  in
      Malawi whereas the main language was Chichewa.

  16. When cross-examined, the appellant said that he had accepted his guilt
      in the stabbing offence and confirmed that he was carrying a knife and
      was intoxicated at the time. He was mixing in the wrong crowd and  was
      na�ve. He had not been able to come up with the �750 for the mediation
      process for contact with his daughter but hoped to find the  money  to
      continue the process.

  17. In response to my enquiries, the appellant confirmed that he had  been
      told that he had a half-brother and sister through his father but  had
      never met them and did not know where they were.

  18. Mr Avery submitted that the appellant had had the opportunity to  make
      some progress in seeking contact with his daughter but had  not  taken
      it and there was no reason to disturb the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's
      findings in regard to his relationship with his daughter. He  had  not
      met the test with regard to integration in the United  Kingdom  as  he
      had committed serious offences.  He  had  significant  connections  in
      Malawi and it was of note that his family's reaction to  his  problems
      in the United Kingdom was to take him to Malawi. The family  therefore
      maintained strong connections to  Malawi.  Neither  was  the  test  in
      paragraph 399A(c) met as the appellant was  unable  to  show  anything
      like very significant obstacles to integration in Malawi.  There  were
      no other circumstances to consider outside the rules. The  seriousness
      of the offence and his history  of  criminal  offending  weighed  very
      heavily against him.

  19. Mr Walsh submitted  that  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  and  the
      criminal offending was not  relevant  to  paragraph  399A,  which  was
      geared only towards consideration of life in the United Kingdom and in
      Malawi. Section 117 was of no relevance as the  test  under  paragraph
      399A was a free-standing one. Mr Walsh took me through the documentary
      evidence  of  the  appellant's  family  relationships  in  the  United
      Kingdom, his studies and his achievements, as well  as  his  potential
      involvement with his child, as demonstrating his social  and  cultural
      integration in the United  Kingdom.  He  relied  on  the  case  of  YM
      (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA  Civ
      1292 in relation to the question of the appellant's ties to Malawi and
      submitted that there were significant obstacles to his integration  in
      Malawi.

Consideration and findings

  20.  The  relevant  provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  relating   to
      deportation and Article 8, as amended in July 2014, in so far as  they
      are relevant to this appeal, are as follows:

    Deportation and Article 8

    398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary to
    the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention,
    and


         (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
         public good and in the public interest because they have been
         convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
         (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
         public good and in the public interest because they have been
         convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12

         months; or
         (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law,

    the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider whether
    paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the public interest
    in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where there are
    very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.


    399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -


0.              (a) the person has been lawfully  resident  in  the  UK  for
   most of his life; and

         (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles  to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."

  21. It is  not  in  dispute  that  the  appellant  is  able  to  meet  the
      requirement at paragraph 399A(a) and thus the decision is with respect
      to the appellant's integration in the United Kingdom and prospects for
      integration in Malawi.

  22. Turning first of all to paragraph 399A(b), and whether  the  appellant
      is "socially and culturally integrated" in the United  Kingdom,  there
      are, as Mr Avery submitted, various factors  which  detract  from  the
      question of integration, in particular  his  criminal  offending.  The
      appellant has demonstrated, through his repeat offending and disregard
      of the warning received when a  previous  threat  of  deportation  was
      lifted, that he has little regard to the public and to society and has
      to an extent put himself outside the accepted norms of society. It  is
      also the case that the appellant, having continued to  live  with  his
      mother when not in prison, has grown up and continues to be part of  a
      Malawian family environment  with  close  connections  to  the  Anglo-
      Malawian community  (as  described  in  the  respondent's  deportation
      decision). I also agree with Mr  Avery's  observation  that  there  is
      significance in the fact that the first reaction  of  the  appellant's
      family, when he found himself in trouble after being shot at,  was  to
      take him to Malawi. It is also relevant to note that there  have  been
      periods of residence in the United Kingdom without any form  of  leave
      and that from November 2004 when his section 3C leave expired, he  was
      without leave until the grant of discretionary leave in November  2010
      and after the expiry of that leave in November 2013.

  23. However, it seems to me that ultimately the most  significant  factors
      are that the appellant has been living here continuously since the age
      of five years after returning from a one year stay in Malawi following
      his initial entry to the United Kingdom at the age of three years  and
      that he has been educated  in  the  United  Kingdom,  having  attended
      primary and secondary school and sixth form college and obtained GSCEs
      and has spent his most  formative  years  in  this  country.  Of  less
      significance, but also relevant, is the fact that he  has  worked  for
      some periods of time and that his close  family  members,  namely  his
      mother, sister and brother,  are  settled  here.  I  find  that  these
      factors indicate a high level of integration into the  United  Kingdom
      and that, despite the undermining factors referred to above, it cannot
      ultimately be  concluded  that  the  appellant  is  not  socially  and
      culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. I find, therefore, albeit
      with the reservations stated, that the appellant is able to  meet  the
      requirements of paragraph 399A(b).

  24. I do not, however, find that the appellant meets the  requirements  in
      paragraph 399A(c). I do not agree with Mr Walsh that the test of "very
      significant obstacles to integration" is the same  as  the  "no  ties"
      test in the rule prior to amendment.  It  seems  to  me  that  it  was
      precisely because of the  interpretation  of  that  test  in  Ogundimu
      (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 60 and as considered in YM
      (Uganda) that the rule has been clarified in its new form and that the
      test as it now stands is a much more rigorous one for an applicant.

  25. In the appellant's case it is clear, as already stated,  that  he  has
      grown  up  as  part  of  a  Malawian  family  environment  with  close
      connections to the Anglo-Malawian community and that his family retain
      at the very least strong cultural links to that country.  It  is  also
      significant, again as stated  above,  that  the  appellant's  family's
      first reaction to his problems in the United Kingdom was to  send  him
      to Malawi. It is the appellant's claim that when he went to Malawi  he
      stayed in a hotel on both occasions since there are no family or other
      connections  in  the  country.  However  I  have  concerns  about  the
      truthfulness of his evidence, and  that  of  the  witnesses,  in  that
      regard. It is notable that the reasons given for those visits are  not
      entirely consistent: the appellant in his  statement,  said  that  the
      visit with his mother was to see his grandmother's grave and the visit
      with his brother was simply for a holiday and that on  both  occasions
      he took the opportunity to get away from the problems he  had  in  the
      United Kingdom. He also said  that  he  and  his  brother  arranged  a
      headstone for his grandfather's grave,  which  was  confirmed  by  his
      brother in his oral evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal.  However
      it was the evidence of the appellant's mother  and  sister,  in  their
      statements, that the appellant and his brother  arranged  a  headstone
      for  their  father's  grave  during  their  visit.   The   appellant's
      statement, at paragraph 46, also appears to suggest that  he  went  to
      Malawi twice with his mother and then once with  his  brother,  rather
      than once with his mother and once with his brother as  was  his  oral
      evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  although  that  is   not
      consistent with the stamps in his passport. Further,  the  appellant's
      oral evidence before me was that he went to Malawi for a month in June
      2012 with his mother and for another  month  in  July  2012  with  his
      brother, whereas the stamps in his passport indicate that  the  visits
      had been in July and October 2012. There clearly are discrepancies  in
      the evidence which suggests that the precise nature of the  visits  to
      Malawi is not entirely as has been claimed.

  26. It is also significant, I find, that none of  the  statements  of  the
      appellant and his witnesses make any mention  of  the  fact  that  the
      appellant and his sister and brother have  two  half-siblings  through
      their father's second marriage in Malawi. That was mentioned  only  at
      the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  when  the  appellant's
      mother's evidence was that there had never been any contact  with  her
      ex-husband's children from his new wife and  that  she  did  not  know
      where those children were. The appellant's brother, however, said that
      he had thought he had met them in 2011. The appellant, at the  hearing
      before me, said that he had never met his half-siblings and had  never
      thought of making contact with them. I find the contradiction  between
      the evidence of the appellant's mother and brother to be striking  and
      it seems to me that the claim as to a  lack  of  any  extended  family
      members or any contacts in Malawi is not an entirely truthful one.

  27. In the circumstances it seems to me that the appellant has  failed  to
      demonstrate that there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
      integration into Malawi. He is a healthy, single  young  man  who  has
      spent around two months in the country fairly  recently  and  who  has
      grown up within the Anglo- Malawi community  in  the  United  Kingdom.
      Whilst he claims not to speak the local language, it is the case  that
      English is the official  language  of  the  country.  Other  than  his
      mother, brother and sister, there are no specific  details  of  family
      ties to the United Kingdom. He has no contact with  his  daughter  and
      does not even know where she is. He has no basis of stay in the United
      Kingdom, having been refused a further period of discretionary  leave.
      I do not accept that he has no  remaining  family  or  other  ties  in
      Malawi and consider that he has at  least  some  half-siblings  living
      there. In any event, the requirement for there to be realistic  family
      or other ties, as set out at [54] of YM (Uganda) is no  longer,  as  I
      have already said above, the relevant test. There is no reason why  he
      would not be able to find work there and re-establish himself in  that
      country, with the benefit of the qualifications he has gained  in  the
      United Kingdom. Neither has any satisfactory reason been offered as to
      why his mother, brother and sister would not be able to assist in  his
      integration from the United Kingdom.

  28. Accordingly I find that the appellant cannot meet the requirements  of
      paragraph 399A(c). Exception 1, at section 117C(4) of  the  2002  Act,
      does not, therefore, apply and pursuant to section 117C(3) of the 2002
      Act the public interest requires the appellant's deportation.

  29. Turning to the question, in paragraph 398, of whether there exist very
      compelling circumstances over and above those described in  paragraphs
      399 and 399A which would outweigh the public interest in  deportation,
      the First-tier Tribunal made detailed findings in that regard, as  set
      out [23] to [27] of its decision, considering all relevant factors and
      taking into account paragraph s117B  and  s117C  of  the  2002.  Those
      findings have not been challenged and, aside from a  brief  submission
      in his skeleton argument at [20] which, in my view,  adds  nothing  to
      the findings already made, Mr Walsh did not seek to  argue  before  me
      that such circumstances existed. Accordingly I see no reason to depart
      from the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings,  which  were  clearly  and
      cogently made, and I conclude, as did the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that
      the appellant's deportation would not be in breach of his rights under
      Article 8.

DECISION

  30. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
      error on a point of law with respect  to  its  findings  on  paragraph
      399A(a). The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in relation  to  that
      matter is therefore set aside. I re-make the  decision  by  dismissing
      the appeal on all grounds.
