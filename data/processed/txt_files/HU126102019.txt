                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. In an effort to dispose of its business justly when there  are  severe
      restrictions on hearing room availability as a consequence of the well-
      known "Covid-19" crisis, the Tribunal has issued extensive  Directions
      that have generated further written submissions, particularly from  Mr
      Stephen Knafler QC for the appellant.

   2. The parties now agree that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  and
      its decision should be set aside. The short point is,  as  alleged  in
      Ground 2.2 of the Grounds of  Appeal,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      "treated an earlier FTT decision as  determinative,  rather  than  the
      "starting point"."

   3. I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law and I set  aside  its
      decision.

   4. I have decided that the appeal should be heard again in the First-tier
      Tribunal. There has to be a complete rehearing and I do  not  want  to
      make a decision that limits the appellant's future avenues of appeal.

   5. Other than saying that the appeal should not be heard by Judges of the
      First-tier Tribunal Devittie and Bulpitt I make  no  directions  about
      the progress of the case but I draw to the attention of the First-tier
      Tribunal that both parties agree that there should be a "face to face"
      rather than a "remote" hearing.

Notice of Decision

   6. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law. I set  aside  its  decision  and
      direct that the case be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal, not by
      Judge Devittie or Judge Bulpitt.
