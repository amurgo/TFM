Representation

For the appellant:           Ms Patel of Counsel
For the respondent:          Ms Johnson a Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a Liberian citizen  of  Touareg  ethnicity  from  the
      south of Libya, who was born on 14th January, 1978. On 27th  December,
      2008 he was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom  as  a  student,
      expiring on 29th October, 2009.  He then entered the United Kingdom in
      March 2009 for a relatively brief sojourn.  On 26th October,  2009  he
      was again granted leave to enter the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student,
      expiring on 30th December, 2010.  Subsequently, he entered the  United
      Kingdom on 1st December, 2009.  His movements and  whereabouts  during
      the following year are unclear.  On 25th January, 2011 he was  granted
      leave to enter the United  Kingdom  for  a  third  time,  again  as  a
      student, expiring on 31st October, 2011.  On 27th  January,  2011,  he
      flew from  Libya  to  the  United  Kingdom.   Having  made  a  timeous
      application for extended leave to remain in the United Kingdom , as  a
      student, his leave was extended to 30th March, 2013.  On  31st  March,
      2013, his leave to remain having expired, he claimed asylum.

2.          The claimant claimed that he was at  risk  on  return  to  Libya
      because he had been a member of Colonel Gaddafi's Revolutionary  Guard
      between 1999 and 2007 and because as an ethnic Touareg he would in any
      event be perceived on return to Libya as having been pro-Gaddafi.

3.    The appellant's claim for asylum  was  refused  by  the  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department and the appellant appealed to the  First
      Tier Tribunal.  His appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge  JDL
      Edwards and dismissed  in  a  determination  promulgated  following  a
      hearing in Manchester on 29th July, 2013.  That decision was set aside
      by the Upper Tribunal (The President, The Hon  Mr  Justice  McCloskey,
      sitting  with  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Perkins)  in  a   determination
      promulgated on 30th October 2013, because of the failure of the  First
      Tier Tribunal Judge to properly address the country evidence, make  an
      assessment of it and make his findings accordingly.

4.    On 14th July,  2014  the  Country  Guidance  case  of  AT  and  Others
      (Article  15c;  risk  categories)  (CG)  [2014]  UKUT  318  (IAC)  was
      published..  That decision makes it clear (at paragraphs 174  to  177)
      that persons of Touareg ethnicity are at real risk of persecutory ill-
      treatment and Article 3 harm on return to Libya and that  there  would
      be  no  sufficiency  of  protection  or  viable  option  of   internal
      relocation for them.

5.    Ms Johnson, the Home Office Presenting  Officer  advised  me  that  in
      view of the decision in AT, the appellant is entitled to the grant  of
      asylum and invited me to prepare a brief determination recording  that
      fact.

5.    I am satisfied that Ms Johnson was entirely correct to agree that  the
      respondent was  entitled  to  have  his  appeal  allowed  in  all  the
      circumstances.   I  indicated  that  I  would   prepare   this   short
      determination recording the agreement between the parties and allowing
      the respondent's appeal.

6.    The determination of First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  JDL  Edwards  having
      earlier been found to contain errors on points of law and  set  aside,
      my decision is that the respondent's appeal be allowed.

Decision


      This appeal is allowed.
