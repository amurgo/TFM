Representation:
For the Appellant: the sponsor, Moshood Animashaun
For the Respondent: Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The  appellant,  a  national  of  Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
  Tribunal against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO)  dated
  1 March 2013 to refuse her application for entry clearance as  a  visitor
  to visit her brother, the sponsor, in the UK. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
  Cohen dismissed the appeal and the appellant now appeals with  permission
  to this Tribunal.

2. The ECO refused the  application  for  entry  clearance  as  he  was  not
  satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of  paragraph  41  (i),
  (ii), (vi) and (vii) of the Immigration Rules. In particular the ECO  was
  not satisfied that the appellant had provided evidence  that  she  is  in
  receipt of her stated income and that he was therefore unable  to  assess
  her true financial circumstances. The ECO  was  not  therefore  satisfied
  that the appellant had shown that her intentions were as stated  or  that
  she intends to leave the UK at the end of her  visit.  The  ECO  was  not
  satisfied that the appellant would be maintained and accommodated in  the
  UK without recourse to public funds or that she is able to meet the  cost
  of the return or onward journey.

Error of law

3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen set out the background to the appeal  and
  the oral evidence given to him by the  sponsor.  The  Judge  appeared  to
  accept that the  appellant  is  employed  and  that  the  respondent  had
  incorrectly stated that she is self-employed [9]. However the Judge  went
  on to consider the case in terms of paragraph 320 (7A) of the Rules  from
  paragraphs 10-16 of the determination. The ECO  did  not  refer  to  this
  ground of refusal in the refusal decision. There is nothing in the papers
  before me to indicate that the ECO relied on paragraph 320 (7A)  in  this
  case. The grounds contend that there are a number of discrepancies in the
  First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision. For example paragraph 10 refers  to
  previous applications which had  not  been  disclosed  but  there  is  no
  evidence of any such applications in this case. Paragraph 11 refers to  a
  previous passport but there is no evidence of a previous passport in this
  case. Paragraph 12 says that there is a discrepancy in  relation  to  the
  appellant's date of birth but neither date of birth referred  to  relates
  to the appellant. I am satisfied that it  is  clear  from  reading  these
  paragraphs that the Judge made findings on the facts of another unrelated
  appeal. Apart from paragraph 9 the Judge did not  make  any  findings  in
  relation to the evidence before him on this appeal.

4. In these circumstances the Judge made a material error of law and  I  set
  his decision aside in its entirety. Mr Nath applied for an adjournment so
  that he could consider all of the evidence submitted  to  the  First-tier
  Tribunal in this case. However the sponsor objected to the application on
  the basis that he returned from Nigeria to attend the hearing and that he
  is going back there and does not know when he will return to  the  UK.  I
  refused the application for an adjournment and instead gave Mr Nath  time
  to consider the  documents  and  I  heard  evidence  and  submissions  in
  relation to remaking the decision.

Remaking the decision

5. I remind myself that the burden of proof is  on  the  appellant  and  the
  standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. The relevant date  for
  consideration of the evidence is the date of the ECO's decision which was
  made on 1 March 2013.

6. I firstly deal with the maintenance and  accommodation  requirements  set
  out in paragraph 41 (vi) and (vii) of the Rules. In her application  form
  the appellant said that the  sponsor  and  his  wife  will  maintain  and
  accommodate her and pay for her travel to the UK. The sponsor's Santander
  bank statement for the period from 6 December 2012 to 5 March 2013  shows
  that the sponsor and his wife  had  savings  of  ï¿½8,224.21.  This  is  in
  addition to the sponsor's current account. The sponsor also submitted his
  tenancy agreement. I am satisfied on the basis of this evidence that  the
  sponsor can maintain and accommodate the appellant on a visit as claimed.

7. The ECO was not satisfied as to the  appellant's  personal  circumstances
  in Nigeria. She said in her application form that she has  been  employed
  as a sales representative with YS Afolabi Nigeria since August  2006  and
  that she earns 38, 364.30  nett  per  month  from  her  employment.   She
  submitted a copy  of  letters  of  appointment  and  of  confirmation  of
  appointment as well as details of her salary package which are consistent
  with her claimed period of employment and salary. The appellant submitted
  a letter from YS Afolabi Nigeria confirming that she  is  employed  there
  and that she is paid 38, 364.30 in cash. She submitted pay advices  which
  reflect this amount. I accept hat the bank statements do not reflect  all
  of this pay. However I am satisfied on the basis of the  evidence  before
  me that the appellant is employed as claimed.

8. The appellant also said in her application  form  that  she  manages  her
  late parents' estate. The sponsor said that their parents had  owned  six
  properties and two shops and that he has two siblings. He said  that  the
  appellant looks after these properties on behalf of all  three  siblings.
  He also said that  he  travels  to  Nigeria  to  look  after  the  family
  properties. He talked about a building project he  is  involved  in.  The
  appellant submitted rent receipts and some of  the  lodgements  into  her
  bank account reflect these receipts. I am satisfied on the basis  of  all
  of this evidence that the appellant manages family property in Nigeria.

9. The appellant submitted birth certificates which show that  she  has  two
  children with her husband, they were born in 2004 and 2007. She submitted
  letters from the children's school and a letter  from  her  husband.  She
  also submitted a letter from her husband's employer confirming that he is
  employed as a Quantity Surveyor. I am satisfied  on  the  basis  of  this
  evidence that the appellant has a husband and young children  in  Nigeria
  as claimed.

10. In his oral evidence before me the sponsor said that his  wife  is  from
  Poland and that they now have two children. He said that he and his  wife
  are keen to have the children's christening or  dedication  and  that  he
  cannot celebrate this event without representation from  his  family.  He
  said that he feels shame in relation to this issue and is  keen  for  his
  sister to come to the UK to celebrate the children's christening. He said
  that this would be preferable to bringing all of  his  wife's  family  to
  Nigeria from Poland. I accept that the sponsor's evidence in relation  to
  this matter is credible.

11.  I have considered all of the evidence before me. I  am  satisfied  that
  the appellant has significant ties in Nigeria and that she therefore  has
  an incentive to return there. I accept that she will be travelling to the
  UK for a specific purpose and that she intends to return  to  Nigeria  at
  the end of her visit.

12. I am satisfied that the appellant has discharged the burden upon her  to
  demonstrate that she met the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Rules at
  the date of the decision.

Conclusion:
The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

I set the decision aside and remake it by allowing the appeal.

Signed
                       Date: 6 January 2015
