                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision of First-
        Tier Tribunal Judge Aziz who, in a decision promulgated on 12  July
        2018, allowed the appeal against the decision to deport Mr Ali from
        the United Kingdom.









Background


     2. Mr Ali is a citizen of the Netherlands born on 23 October 1990. His
        immigration history shows he arrived in the United Kingdom in  2015
        and on 28 July 2017 was convicted at York Crown Court of conspiring
        to defraud for which he was sentenced, on 24  August  2017,  to  12
        months imprisonment. The Secretary of State wrote to Mr Ali  on  10
        November 2017 informing him that he intended to make a  deportation
        order the grounds of public policy in  accordance  with  Regulation
        23(6)(b) and Regulation 27 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
        Area) Regulations 2016. A number of  letters  were  written  by  Mr
        Ali's representative setting out  reasons  why  he  should  not  be
        deported. On 23 January  2018  the  Secretary  of  State  served  a
        deportation order.
     3. There is no dispute of the Judge's analysis of the facts or law and
        I find no error made in relation to the Judge's assessment  of  the
        offence leading to the  deportation  order.  The  Judge  summarises
        those circumstances at [15 - 17] in the following terms:


             15.  The circumstances of the appellant's offence were that in
                  October 2014 the appellant along  with  his  co-defendants
                  was involved in  a  sophisticated  conspiracy  to  defraud
                  involving the use of cloned credit cards and  debit  cards
                  in order to obtain high value goods.  The  money  obtained
                  during this conspiracy was used to furnish an  extravagant
                  lifestyle. This was a serious crime  which  was  committed
                  for  profit  and  the  appellant  and  his   co-defendants
                  operated as a gang. They were involved in a  sophisticated
                  fraud with a significant degree of planning and the amount
                  that was expected to be realised was in excess of ï¿½10,000.
                  They were thwarted by security staff.


             16.  The sentencing judge commented that during the trial  the
                  appellant had betrayed a considerable degree of  arrogance
                  and a belief that he could talk his way  out  of  trouble.
                  The Judge came to  the  conclusion  that  he  was  heavily
                  involved, 'from first to last in this conspiracy'.


             17.  Crimes involving the cloning of fraudulent bank cards are
                  not a victimless offence. It is an attack on  the  banking
                  system. The  banks  pass  on  the  cost  of  dealing  with
                  fraudulent  transactions  to  their  customers.  Moreover,
                  individuals whose accounts were targeted would suffer  the
                  shock  of  intrusion  into  their  financial  affairs  and
                  distress and  fear  of  liability  for  debts  accrued  by
                  criminals. The appellant had shown no regard  to  this  or
                  the consequences for those who would be unable  to  access
                  their accounts whilst  the  fraudulent  transactions  were
                  being investigated.


     4. The Judge accepts at [19] that it is reasonable to conclude that if
        Mr Ali does not find employment,  he  may  associate  himself  with
        negative peers, revert to  reoffending  in  order  to  finance  his
        lifestyle and continue to pose a risk of harm to the  public  or  a
        section of the public.
     5. The Judge's findings are set out from [97] in which the Judge found
        each of the appellant's witnesses  to  have  given  an  honest  and
        truthful  account  with  regard  to  the   appellant's   character,
        especially post arrest, and that the Judge had no real issues  with
        any of the evidence. The Judge refers to the sentencing remarks  at
        [102] together with the  other  documentary  evidence  provided  at
        [118].
     6. At [120 - 123] are the core findings in the following terms:


             120.     As stated above, the first question which I  need  to
                  address  when  assessing  the   respondent's   deportation
                  decision  is  whether  the  appellant's  personal  conduct
                  represents a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                  threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                  society as is required under Regulation 27(5).


             121.     Looking at all the evidence in the round,  I  am  not
                  persuaded that the appellant represents a genuine, present
                  and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
                  fundamental  interests  of  society  as   per   Regulation
                  27(5)(c).  The  appellant  is  someone  of  previous  good
                  character. During a period in his life from  2013  -  2014
                  there were a unique set of circumstances (detailed in  his
                  evidence)  that  led  to  him  becoming  associated   with
                  negative peers. He  ought  to  have  been  an  intelligent
                  enough individual to have realised that he should not have
                  associated   himself   with    these    negative    peers.
                  Nevertheless, he did and was eventually  arrested  by  the
                  police in the autumn of  2014  for  being  involved  in  a
                  sophisticated and  serious  fraud  involving  credit/debit
                  cards. However, since his arrest his life  has  materially
                  changed. His family life is now much more stable.  He  has
                  gone on to marry and have a child. His family  unit  exert
                  an extremely positive  influence  on  him.  He  has  found
                  employment,  plays  semi-professional  football   and   is
                  engaged  in  a  number   of   voluntary   and   charitable
                  activities. All of these have  played  a  positive  impact
                  upon him.  Whilst  it  was  completely  wrong  of  him  to
                  maintain a not guilty plea, I accept that his reasons  for
                  doing so were because she was afraid of  going  to  prison
                  and being away from his wife and child.  While  this  does
                  not necessarily condone his behaviour, having  heard  from
                  him I accept that he has very much reflected  on  what  he
                  has done and come to regret his actions. More than  anyone
                  else, he realises the impact that his offending has had on
                  him and his family. His family members came to support him
                  at the appeal hearing and the appellant knows that he  has
                  let them all down.


             122.     I am persuaded by Mr  Bradshaw's  key  argument  that
                  this is essentially a man of previous good character, who,
                  during one period of his  life  in  2013  -  2014,  became
                  involved in criminal wrongdoing but  has  since  seen  the
                  error of his ways and will  not  return  to  any  form  of
                  reoffending. The evidence has backed this up. He  has  not
                  committed  any  further  offences  since  2014.   He   has
                  established a stable family unit. He has found  employment
                  and  is  fully  engaged  in  charitable   and   vocational
                  activities. All of the reports from the probation services
                  and other professional organisations indicate that  he  is
                  someone of low risk of reoffending. Therefore, looking  at
                  all the evidence in  the  round,  I  come  to  an  overall
                  conclusion that  the  respondent  has  not  been  able  to
                  establish that the appellant represents a genuine, present
                  and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
                  fundamental interests of society.


             123.     In light of this finding, it is not necessary for  me
                  to go on to consider whether the deportation  decision  is
                  proportional.


     7. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  which  was
        granted by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal, the  operative
        part of the grant being in the following terms:


             4.   It is arguable, as contended in the Grounds of Appeal  at
                  [7], that in the balancing exercise seen to be applied  at
                  [119] the FTTJ fails to attach sufficient  weight  to  the
                  fact that the appellant maintained  his  not  guilty  plea
                  (rather than guilty plea as stated) until 2017; and to the
                  fact  that  the  appellant  had  limited  opportunity   to
                  reoffend  given  that  he  had  only  been  released  from
                  detention in  February  2018.  It  is  arguable  that  the
                  comments by the FTTJ about maintaining a not  guilty  plea
                  seen at [121] are inconsistent with the judge's sentencing
                  remarks set  out  at  [102]  especially  those  about  the
                  arrogance displayed by the appellant; and that these might
                  cumulatively illustrate  that  the  "FTTJ  had  failed  to
                  appreciate the seriousness of the offence" as contended at
                  [8].


     8. The appellant has filed a Rule 42  Response  repeating  submissions
        made on his behalf at the hearing  in  opposing  the  Secretary  of
        State's application.



Error of law


     9. Mrs Aboni relied upon the grounds of  appeal  submitting  that  the
        Judge had erred in law in allowing the appeal in a  case  in  which
        the appellant had committed a serious offence.
    10. Even if, as pleaded at [5] of the Grounds the  fact  the  appellant
        had not committed any offences since  autumn  2014  is  at  best  a
        neutral  factor  in  accordance  with  the  Secretary  of   State's
        submissions it is still a factor the Judge  was  entitled  to  take
        into account. The Judge examines the circumstances of  the  offence
        and notes this is the only conviction Mr Ali has against his  name.
        The Judge does not challenge the  lawfulness  of  the  decision  to
        deport which it is accepted the Secretary of State was entitled  to
        make. Whether that decision is sustainable in law or susceptible to
        challenge by way of appeal is not arguable as Mr Ali was  given  an
        in country right of appeal against the same  and  was  not  removed
        from the United Kingdom.
    11. The Judge was only able to comment upon evidence made available and
        it is the Secretary  of  State  who  determined  the  date  of  the
        deportation decision which led to the appeal. The  fact  there  may
        have been  a  short  period  between  the  Mr  Ali's  release  from
        detention and the date of the hearing is as a  consequence  of  the
        chronology which only the Secretary of  State,  arguably,  had  any
        control or influence upon. No arguable legal error is made  out  in
        the Judge concluding that  since  release  the  appellant  had  not
        reoffended. There was nothing on the evidence before the  Judge  to
        permit, at this stage, a finding of the existence  of  evidence  to
        show a propensity to reoffend in the future,  giving  rise  to  the
        required risk under the Regulations.
    12. The grounds at [9]  assert  the  decision  to  deport  Mr  Ali  was
        proportionate  but  the  Judge  was  not   required   to   consider
        proportionality in a case in which the core finding is that it  had
        not been made out that Mr  Ali  presented  a  genuine  present  and
        sufficiently serious threat affecting a fundamental interest of the
        society of the United Kingdom.
    13. Mr Ali was, arguably, entitled to maintain his not guilty  plea  in
        the proceedings before  the  Crown  Court.  Effective  disposal  of
        litigation for those who are guilty is encouraged by the  discounts
        given on sentencing to those  who  plead  guilty  at  the  earliest
        opportunity. Mr Ali  did  not  choose  to  benefit  from  any  such
        discount but chose to exercise his right as a citizen to plead  his
        innocence until proven guilty does not, arguably, indicate  Mr  Ali
        lacks remorse, without more. A person is  entitled  to  plead  'not
        guilty' even if they know they have committed  the  offence  solely
        for the purposes of seeing if the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  can
        prove their case to the requisite criminal standard.
    14. The Judge does not allow the appeal on the basis this  is  a  first
        offence solely or the explanation by Mr Ali as to why he maintained
        his guilty plea. The Judge clearly took all relevant aspects of the
        evidence and  submissions  into  account  before  arriving  at  the
        overall conclusion.
    15. It is not disputed that the offence for which Mr Ali was  convicted
        is a serious offence within the terms of the Regulations. This  is,
        however, not a case that was made out before the Judge in which the
        personal conduct of Mr Ali caused deep public revulsion, sufficient
        to warrant removal.
    16. Relevant cases which have  been  considered  include  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department v Robinson (Jamaica) [2018] EWCA  Civ
        85 in which the Court decided that Bouchereau continued to bind the
        courts of this country albeit it was confined to the sort  of  case
        where the facts were very extreme as one was looking for  a  threat
        to the requirements of public policy caused simply by past  conduct
        which has caused  deep  public  revulsion.   The  Court  of  Appeal
        declined to give an exhaustive definition but suggested that  grave
        offences of sexual abuse or violence against young  children  might
        have been the sort of case the court was thinking of.
    17. In Bonsignore (1975) ECR 297 (ECJ) it was said that, if  a  finding
        is made that a threat to public security  exists  it  "implies  the
        existence in the individual concerned of a propensity to act in the
        same way in the future, it is possible that past conduct alone  may
        constitute such a threat to the requirements of public policy".
    18. In Commission v the Netherlands Case C-50/06  the  Commission  said
        that under article 3(1) of the Directive 64/221 measures  taken  on
        the grounds of public policy or public security were  to  be  based
        exclusively on the conduct of the person concerned.   Article  3(2)
        specified that previous criminal convictions were not in themselves
        to constitute grounds for taking  such  measures.   They  could  be
        taken into account only in so far as the  circumstances  which  had
        given rise to that conviction were  evidence  of  personal  conduct
        constituting a present threat to the requirement of public policy.
    19.  In  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department   v   Arturas
        Dumliauskas, Lukasz Wozniak and ME (Netherlands)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
        145 it was stated at paragraphs 40 and 55 that if there is no  real
        risk of reoffending then the power to  deport  nationals  of  other
        Member States on the grounds of public policy  or  public  security
        does not arise.
    20. It is not made out the conclusion of the Judge that the appellant's
        conduct did not represent a threat to the fundamental interests  of
        society as a result of a real risk of further offending is  outside
        the range of findings reasonably available on the evidence. It does
        not matter that another judge may make a different finding or  come
        to a different conclusion. It has not been made out Judge Aziz  has
        erred in law in a manner material to  the  decision  to  allow  the
        appeal sufficient to enable the Upper Tribunal to interfere in this
        judgement.
