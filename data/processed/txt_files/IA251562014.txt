                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Carlos Alberto Pina Bello, date of birth 5.12.85,  is  a
    citizen of Venezuela.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Greasley  promulgated  12.12.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  leave  to  enter  and  to
    cancel his leave to remain as a partner pursuant to paragraph  321A  of
    the Immigration Rules. The Judge heard the appeal on 4.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Coates  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.2.15.  However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan granted permission to appeal  on
    20.5.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 16.9.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no material error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as
    to require the decision of Judge Greasley to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant first came to the UK in January 2010. In October of that year
    he met JB, a British national, and they  subsequently  entered  into  a
    relationship. She went with the appellant to  visit  his  family  on  a
    couple of occasions in 2011.  They  married  in  December  2012.  Their
    daughter was born in 2013, and is now  two  years  of  age.  They  made
    another visit to Venezuela in January 2014. However, JB separated  from
    the appellant in February 2014 and she and their daughter  returned  to
    live with her own family. The  appellant  left  the  UK  in  May  2014,
    returning to the UK on 16.6.14. By that stage, JB had notified the Home
    Office that the marriage had broken down. On arrival  at  Heathrow  the
    appellant produced his visa granting  leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse,
    issued on 22.3.13 and valid until  22.3.15.  He  claimed  that  he  was
    seeking entry as a returning  spouse  of  JB.  He  was  questioned  and
    further  interviewed.  The  respondent   was   satisfied   that   false
    representations were employed or material facts not disclosed  for  the
    purpose of obtaining  leave  and  there  had  been  such  a  change  of
    circumstances since the leave was granted that it should be  cancelled,
    in accordance with the mandatory grounds under paragraph  321A  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The appellant spent about a month in detention.

 7.  Judge  Greasley  concluded  that  there  had  been  such   change   of
    circumstances since leave had been  granted  to  demonstrate  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was properly taken. The  judge  then
    went on to consider  the  appellant's  circumstances  under  Article  8
    private and family, finding that he could not meet the requirements  of
    either Appendix FM or  paragraph  276ADE.  Ultimately,  conducting  the
    Razgar  stepped  approach  of  which   the   crucial   stage   is   the
    proportionality balancing exercise between on the one hand  the  rights
    of the appellant and his daughter, and on the other the legitimate  and
    necessary aim of protecting the economic well-being of the  UK  through
    immigration control, the judge concluded that the  decision  to  cancel
    leave and refuse entry was proportionate.

 8. I note that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to justify going on to
    consider whether the private and  family  life  circumstances  were  so
    compelling and insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  render
    the decision of the Secretary of State unjustifiably  harsh  so  as  to
    require, exceptionally, the appeal to be allowed outside the  Rules  on
    the basis of Article 8 ECHR, consistent with the principles set out  in
    both SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and Singh v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    74. The judge  simply  moved  to  the  second-stage  of  an  Article  8
    assessment. Whilst the Court of  Appeal  has  held  that  there  is  no
    threshold or intermediary requirement of arguability before a  decision
    maker moves to consider the second stage of consideration  outside  the
    Rules on the basis of Article 8 ECHR,  whether  that  second  stage  is
    required will depend on whether all the  issues  have  been  adequately
    addressed under the Rules. In other words, there is no need to  conduct
    a full separate examination of Article 8 outside the Rules where in the
    circumstances of a particular case, all issues have been  addressed  in
    the consideration under the Rules. However, there is no appeal  against
    the decision of the judge to go on to consider private and family  life
    outside the Rules under Article 8 ECHR and thus there  is  no  relevant
    error of law in this regard.

 9. In essence, the grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed
    to  take  into  account  evidence  material  to  a  proper  Article   8
    assessment, including in  particular  evidence  to  show  that  despite
    separating from his wife, the appellant had supervised contact with his
    daughter and was in the process of family proceedings. In that  regard,
    when  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Canavan  considered  it
    arguable that the judge failed to  consider  Mohammed  v  SSHD  (Family
    Court proceedings outcome) [2014] UKUT 00419 and  may  have  failed  to
    take into account evidence material to a proper  determination  of  the
    appeal, in particular the Article 8 assessment.

10. In addition, Judge Canavan  considered  it  "quite  apparent  from  the
    decision that the judge failed to make any findings in relation to  the
    best interests of the child. The Tribunal finds that this is an obvious
    point of law and that it is arguable  that  this  is  a  further  error
    relating to the proper assessment of Article 8 in the circumstances  of
    this particular case."

11. Mr Khalid relied on the decision  in  Mohammed  v  SSHD  (Family  Court
    proceedings outcome) [2014] UKUT 00419, in  which  the  Upper  Tribunal
    considered the guidance of RS  (Immigration  and  Family  Court)  India
    [2012] UKUT 00218 (IAC), and held that the guidance is  concerned  with
    whether there is a realistic prospect of  the  Family  Court  making  a
    decision that will have a material impact on the relationship between a
    child and the parent facing immigration measures such  as  deportation,
    such as to justify an adjournment or allowing the appeal with a view to
    limited discretionary leave to pursue contact in the Family  Court.  Mr
    Khalid submitted that the appellant's circumstances are more favourable
    as unlike the appellant in Mohammed, he  had  been  granted  supervised
    contact with his daughter.

12.  It  is  evident  from  the  decision  that  Judge  Greasley  carefully
    considered all the evidence placed before the Tribunal.  He  took  into
    account evidence from the appellant's former  spouse  as  well  as  the
    appellant's evidence, including his oral evidence and behaviour at  the
    appeal hearing.

13. I reject Mr Khalid's submission that as the family  court  at  Uxbridge
    decided that a fact finding hearing was "not  necessary  in  this  case
    because the nature of the allegations are such that the court does  not
    require such a hearing in order to be able to decide  whether  to  make
    the orders sought," that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  should  have
    adopted the same approach and not made findings of  fact  on  the  core
    dispute between the appellant and JB on the allegations of physical and
    emotional abuse to JB and their child. The family court did not need to
    resolve the factual dispute because the appellant was willing  to  make
    an undertaking not to harass,  pester  or  intimidate  JB  and  not  to
    contact her directly by phone, or attempt to enter her  home.  However,
    the First-tier Tribunal judge was entitled to address and make findings
    on this issue. In essence, the appellant was found to  be  a  dishonest
    witness who failed to rebut any of the many  allegations  made  against
    him. As noted at �26 neither in his  witness  statement  nor  his  oral
    evidence did the appellant "deny the allegations, or suggest that  they
    are fabricated, or indeed provide any general explanation  in  response
    to these complaints."

14. At �27 the judge found "there has been significant discord  within  the
    marital relationship, including physical and emotional abuse, which has
    resulted in JB and her young daughter moving out of the family home and
    joining her parents." At �28 the judge continued, "I accept, to a  high
    degree of probability, that these incidents have occurred, as described
    by JB."

15. The judge was also concerned about the attitude of the  appellant,  who
    was confrontational, belligerent, bordering on disruptive, interrupting
    the  submissions  of  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer.  He   was
    threatened with being removed from the hearing. Of  particular  concern
    was the threat uttered by the appellant, and accepted by the  judge  to
    be genuine, that if he was given the chance he would remove  the  child
    on the first flight out of the UK.

16. It is obvious from the decision that the judge was fully aware  of  the
    supervised  contact  arrangements  and  that  there  had  been   family
    proceedings. However, those  were  several  months  before  the  appeal
    hearing, the undertaking had expired on 23.11.14, and it was not  clear
    what stage any divorce or family court  proceedings  had  reached.  The
    judge was handed a  handwritten  application  for  child  arrangements,
    dated 18.11.14, not stamped as being lodged with the court, and  it  is
    not  clear  if  such  an  application  for  further  contact  was  ever
    submitted. The judge was rather left in  the  dark  as  to  the  likely
    conduct of any further  contact  application.  The  burden  is  on  the
    appellant to demonstrate that he was likely to be able to  maintain  or
    increase contact with his daughter, or that the extent  of  his  family
    life with his daughter would continue in the light of the history.  The
    most that could be said that he had been  granted  limited,  supervised
    contact with the child. Further, there was no  application  to  adjourn
    the appeal hearing to await the outcome of any family proceedings.

17. It is clear from several points of the decision that the judge  had  in
    mind the appellant's wish to maintain, if  not  increase,  the  contact
    with his daughter. For example, at �32 the judge pointed  out  that  it
    would be open to him to make application to visit the UK and noted that
    given the marital history any future contact arrangements would  likely
    need to be supervised through the intervention of the  courts.  At  �33
    the judge also noted that the  appellant  would  be  able  to  maintain
    communication with his daughter from  outside  the  UK  through  modern
    means of communication.

18. I note that "best interests" of the child  was  not  a  ground  of  the
    application for permission to appeal; it was raised only by  the  judge
    granting permission to appeal.

19. Although the judge does not specifically refer to an assessment of  the
    best interests of the child, it is clear that the judge weighed in  the
    balance the extent of  the  appellant's  limited,  supervised,  contact
    (family life) with his daughter, when considering the  public  interest
    in removal and the proportionality of the decision of the Secretary  of
    State. In that assessment, it is implicit from the  way  in  which  the
    judge addressed the issues that he had the best interests of the  child
    at the forefront  of  those  considerations.  At  �29,  the  judge  was
    satisfied having considered the oral and  documentary  evidence,  "that
    the appellant has not played such a significant and important  parental
    role in the upbringing of his daughter as he  appears  to  suggest,  or
    would have me believe. The complaints suggest that  the  appellant  has
    not been supportive of JB during her ectopic pregnancy or that  he  has
    shown a supporting role as a father, since the birth (of  the  child)."
    The judge also took account of his finding that the appellant  did  not
    deny the allegations of physical and emotional abuse. Effectively,  the
    judge considered but rejected the appellant's claim  to  care  for  his
    daughter, finding his account to be dishonest.  It is  clear  that  the
    judge had reached the conclusion that  the  appellant  had  no  genuine
    interest in the child, but was using family proceedings as a device  to
    remain in the UK.

20. In the circumstances of this case, and on the findings of the judge, it
    is far from clear that the best interests of the  appellant's  daughter
    are to have any significant family life or contact with the  appellant.
    It follows that the appellant has failed to demonstrate  that  had  the
    judge outlined a specific assessment  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    child, that assessment would not have been of  any  assistance  to  the
    appellant, or made any  difference  to  the  negative  outcome  of  the
    appeal. There remains an avenue open to  the  appellant  to  apply  for
    discretionary leave to remain for the purpose pursuing contact with his
    daughter.

21. In the circumstances, I  reject  the  submission  in  the  grounds  and
    advanced in Mr Khalid's oral submissions that the judge failed to  take
    account  of  material  evidence  in   making   the   Article   8   ECHR
    proportionality assessment.  It follows that I find no  material  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusion & Decision:

22. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an anonymity order. Given the  circumstances,  I  make
no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
