                     THE ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, NAIROBI

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Winter, Advocate, instructed by Peter G Farrell
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

In contrast to the requirement  of  para  GEN  1.2(iv)  of  Appendix  FM,  a
requirement (such as in paragraph  352AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules)  that
"parties have been living together  in  a  relationship  akin  to  either  a
marriage or a civil partnership which has subsisted for two years  or  more"
does not require two years cohabitation, but two years  subsistence  of  the
relationship.  Whether the relationship still subsists, as required  by  the
tense of that requirement and as may be separately required, is a  different
issue.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Eritrea.  She applied to the  respondent
    for entry clearance to enable her to settle in the  United  Kingdom  as
    the wife of a refugee, her sponsor, Amanuel  Fassil.   Her  application
    was refused on 10 April 2012, she appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    on the basis that the decision was wrong  in  its  application  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and that it breached her entitlement under Article 8
    of the ECHR.  At the hearing on 22 July 2013, First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Quigley was told that the appellant now accepted  that  she  could  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules under which she had applied, because
    her claimed marriage to the sponsor had not  been  registered  and  she
    could not therefore be regarded as his  wife.   She  claimed  that  she
    should instead have been found to meet the  requirements  of  paragraph
    352AA of the Statement of Changes in  Immigration  Rules,  HC  395  (as
    amended), as a partner of the sponsor.  The judge heard the  appeal  on
    that basis.  She found that the appellant did not meet the requirements
    of paragraph 352AA.  She  found  also  that  there  were  a  number  of
    discrepancies between the appellant's and  the  sponsor's  accounts  of
    certain matters, and that there was very limited  evidence  of  contact
    between  them.   She  concluded  that  the  relationship  between   the
    appellant and the sponsor was not a genuine and  subsisting  one.   She
    accordingly found that the refusal of entry clearance  to  the  sponsor
    was not a disproportionate interference in family life.  She  dismissed
    the appeal.  The  appellant  now  has  permission  to  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant and the sponsor claim to have  been  through  a  marriage
    ceremony on 16 July 2006, having presumably met some time before  that.
    The clear evidence was that they had not  lived  together  before  that
    date.  The sponsor left Eritrea in March 2008.  The  judge  found  that
    there was "little or no evidence of any contact between  the  appellant
    and the sponsor since he left Eritrea in 2008".

 3. The sponsor had male twins, born to another woman (not  the  appellant)
    on 3 June 1995.  One of them died in 2012.   In  the  appellant's  visa
    application form she stated that the sponsor did not have any children.
     She also stated, in a different part of the form, that she herself did
    not have any children.  The judge considered the explanations given for
    the discrepancy between the sponsor's evidence that he had children and
    the  appellant's  statement  that  he  did  not:  she  rejected   those
    explanations and found that:
           "There is a  clear  discrepancy  between  the  evidence  of  the
           appellant and that of the sponsor on  a  matter  of  fundamental
           importance.  It seems to me that the fact that the appellant was
           unaware that the sponsor had two children  does  suggest  to  me
           that their relationship is not subsisting and genuine.  The fact
           of the matter is that the application  was  made  and  the  form
           signed on 10 February 2012, almost six years after the date when
           the sponsor claims he and the appellant started living  together
           on 16 July 2006".

 4. The judge also had concerns about some of the  documentation  presented
    to her.  She accepted that the sponsor  had  travelled  to  Entebbe  in
    September 2011, but noted that other than their own evidence, there was
    nothing to show that the appellant and the sponsor had spent  any  time
    together then.  (Indeed the evidence before  the  judge  was  that  the
    sponsor arrived in Entebbe very late at night on 20 September 2011  and
    stayed until 27 September 2011, but the appellant  said  that  she  had
    last seen the sponsor  on  20  September  2011.)   Although  there  was
    documentation evidencing payment by the sponsor to the appellant, these
    all post-dated that visit.

 5. Before the judge there were four witnesses on the appellant's side: the
    sponsor and three other men, each of whom gave evidence that they  knew
    the sponsor and had visited him and the appellant  in  the  matrimonial
    home soon after the ceremony of marriage.  All these men were  able  to
    give the names of the sponsor's twin boys: one (but only one) was  able
    to give the name of the sponsor's previous partner, their  mother.   In
    her determination the judge noted that these four witnesses  had  given
    oral evidence and been cross-examined, but not  re-examined.   She  did
    not specifically record either her view of the evidence  given  by  the
    witnesses other than the sponsor, or its impact on her decision.

 6. The grounds of appeal, as presented by Mr Winter,  raise  two  specific
    issues.  The first  relates  to  the  interpretation  of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules; the second asserts that the judge's failure to  deal
    fully with the witness's evidence made her decision erroneous in law.

 7. Paragraph 352AA of the Immigration Rules sets out "the requirements  to
    be met by a person seeking leave to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the unmarried or the same-sex partner of  a  refugee".   The
    requirements include the following:

          "(ii)  the parties have been living  together  in  a  relationship
              akin to either a marriage or a civil  partnership  which  has
              subsisted for two years or more; and
          ...
          (v)   each of the parties intends to  live  permanently  with  the
              other as his or her unmarried or same  sex  partner  and  the
              relationship is subsisting".

 8. In the present case the relationship  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor is said to be that which began with the  marriage  on  16  July
    2006, continued up to the date of the decision,  and  continues  still.
    The sponsor's evidence makes  it  clear  that  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor did not live together for two years: he left Eritrea less  than
    two years after the date of the  ceremony  of  marriage.   Mr  Winter's
    submission (which was  also  made  by  the  appellant's  representative
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge) is that paragraph 352AA(ii)  does
    not require two years' cohabitation: it requires (a) a relationship  of
    more than  two  years'  duration;  and  (b)  living  together  in  that
    relationship.  Mr Winter pointed out  that  the  same  wording  appears
    elsewhere  in  the  Immigration  Rules,  for  example   in   paragraphs
    295A(b)(i) and 295D(vi); but he did not point to any decisions  on  the
    meaning of the phrase.  Mr Parkinson's submission was that the ordinary
    meaning of the phrase is that the parties should  have  lived  together
    for the specified period.

 9. The  matter  is  not  free  from  doubt,  but  we  prefer  Mr  Winter's
    submissions.  The insertion of the words "which has  subsisted"  before
    the specification of the period seems to us crucially to  separate  the
    specified period from the requirement to have  "lived  together".   The
    "subsistence" of the relationship is an additional requirement in  this
    subparagraph and later in the Rules, so it does not need to  appear  in
    this part of the rule save for the purpose of  clarifying  what  it  is
    that has to have happened for the  specified  period.   There  may,  we
    remind ourselves, be a number of reasons why a couple, whether  married
    or unmarried, do not in fact live together: the demands  of  employment
    maybe such a reason; so may a need to flee the country.   Such  factors
    do not necessarily  destroy  a  relationship,  which  may  continue  to
    subsist despite the separation.  A relationship  said  to  be  akin  to
    marriage, but in which the cohabitation has been minimal,  may  not  be
    able to be established as "subsisting", so there is no  danger  of  our
    interpretation leading  to  a  view  that  (for  example)  one  night's
    cohabitation would be enough to claim entitlement under the Rules.   It
    is  to  be  noted  that  the  requirement  under  Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration  Rules  is  different,  and  does  impose  the  requirement
    adumbrated by Mr  Parkinson.   In  the  Definitions  section,  GEN  1.2
    provides that:

           For the purposes of this Appendix 'partner' means -
           (i)   the applicant's spouse;
           (ii)  the applicant's civil partner;
           (iii) the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or
           (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in
              a relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for at
              least two years prior to the date of application, unless  the
              context otherwise requires.


10. For this reason, we think that the judge was wrong to say that, because
    the appellant and the sponsor had lived  together  for  less  than  two
    years, the appellant could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    352AA.  That, however, is not necessarily material to  the  outcome  of
    the appeal: because, as we have said, the judge in addition found  that
    the relationship was not a subsisting one.   The requirement  that  the
    relationship be a subsisting one at the date of the decision appears in
    two places: obviously in subparagraph (v) and more subtly in the  tense
    "have" in subparagraph (ii).

11. We have noted above what the judge had said about the evidence going to
    the relationship.  It is true, and perhaps regrettable, that the  judge
    expressed no clear view on the evidence  of  the  three  witnesses  who
    accompanied the sponsor.  But, other than indicating that shortly after
    the marriage ceremony the appellant and  the  sponsor  could  be  found
    together, they did not purport to say anything about the nature of  the
    relationship between the appellant and the sponsor.  In  our  judgment,
    they  added  little  or  nothing  to  the  evidence  of   whether   the
    relationship between the appellant and the sponsor was a subsisting one
    either when the sponsor left Eritrea in 2008, or when  the  application
    for entry clearance was made, or when it was  decided.   As  the  judge
    noted, the evidence that the relationship was subsisting at the date of
    the decision was very sparse indeed, and it does not appear to us  that
    there is any proper basis for saying that the judge's decision on  that
    issue was legally flawed.

12. As we have said, Mr Winter also argued the case on Article  8  grounds.
    The position, however, is that the relationship between  the  appellant
    and the sponsor at the date of the decision has not been  shown  to  be
    what they claim it was.   In these circumstances there is no  basis  of
    credible  evidence  upon  which  it  can  properly  be  said  that  the
    maintenance of the status quo by refusing the appellant entry clearance
    is a disproportionate infringement of  the  right  to  family  life  of
    either the appellant or the sponsor.

13. For the foregoing reasons we dismiss this appeal.
