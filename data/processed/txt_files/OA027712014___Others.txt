Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Harding, instructed by Sentinel Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting Officer
                    appearing on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The first appellant is the first wife  of  the  sponsor,  Mr  Abdullahi
    Mohamed, and the subsequent four appellants (second appellant to  fifth
    appellant) are said to be the children of the first appellant  and  the
    sponsor.

 2. The last six appellants are said also to be the children of the sponsor
    and his second wife  Faduma  (she  made  no  application  to  join  the
    sponsor). The first appellant  is  the  step-mother  of  the  last  six
    appellants.

 3. For clarity I have listed the mother  (or  step-mother)  as  the  first
    appellant and the next four appellants (the children of the sponsor and
    first appellant) in birth order and the subsequent six appellants  (the
    children of the sponsor and the second wife) also in birth order.

 4. They made applications on 2nd January 2014 to join the sponsor  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Those applications were dismissed and appeals  lodged.
    The matter came before First Tier Tribunal Judge Devittie who dismissed
    the appeals on all grounds.

 5. It was agreed at the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer should have considered the matter under Paragraph  352A  rather
    than Appendix FM.

Application for Permission to Appeal

 6. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis  that  at
    the First-tier Tribunal, a concession  was  made  by  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer to the effect that the appeals  of  the  first  five
    appellants should be granted.  Permission  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kelly and he noted that he could not locate  the  Record
    of Proceedings. He granted permission in respect of all  appellants  on
    the basis that should the first five appellants succeed this may affect
    the decisions in relation to the remaining appellants.

 7. At the first hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal  I  requested  witness
    statements of both representatives be submitted as to  any  concession.
    The matter was adjourned to allow  for  witness  statements  from  both
    representatives at the First-tier Tribunal to be submitted.

Conclusions

 8. There would appear to be confusion as to any concession and the  extent
    of any concession.  Mr Bose, Home Officer  Presenting  Officer  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal, indicated in his witness  statement  that  to  his
    recollection the appellants could potentially qualify under the  Family
    Reunion Policy but he had made no unqualified concession.  Mr  Collins,
    representative at the First-tier Tribunal for the appellants,  tendered
    a statement to the effect that at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Mr  Bose
    conceded that the appeals of  the  first  five  appellants  (as  listed
    above) fell to be allowed.

 9. There was no record of any reference to any concession in the  decision
    of Judge Devittie and nothing to clarify the matter from any Record  of
    Proceedings.  Clearly the matter was discussed and was  of  fundamental
    importance but there was no reference made to it  in  the  decision  or
    otherwise.

10. As such there was an error of law in a failure  to  record  and  engage
    with an important issue which may have a material effect on the outcome
    and indeed affect the overall findings in respect of all appellants. In
    the  interests  of  justice  and  in  accordance  with  the  overriding
    objective of the Tribunal, and the nature and extent of the findings to
    be made, I find the all the appeals listed above should be remitted  to
    the First Tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo.

11. I also note that I  could  not  locate  a  decision  regarding  Mohamed
    Abdullahi Mohamed Said (OA/01847/2014) and this should be addressed  by
    the respondent.  The issue of DNA  evidence  was  also  raised  at  the
    hearing before me. The sponsor made clear that he did  not  require  an
    interpreter at any subsequent hearing.

12. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
