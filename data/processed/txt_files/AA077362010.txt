                              MR MASHOOD IQBAL

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance by or on behalf of the appellant
For the Respondent:    Mrs K Pal, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 4 July 1979.  His
    appeal against the respondent's refusal to grant him asylum was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio in a determination dated 2
    August 2010.  On 6 September 2010 the appellant was refused permission
    to appeal the judge's decision.

2.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appellant's appeal under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  The respondent was granted permission to appeal
    the judge's conclusions in respect of the appellant's article 8 claim.

3.   At the hearing today there was no appearance by the appellant or on
    his behalf and there was no explanation for his non-appearance.

4.   I was informed by Mrs Pal that on 18 May 2011 the Secretary of State
    granted the appellant leave to remain for three years to expire in May
    2014. She asked that the appeal be treated as abandoned under section
    104 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

5.   I find that section 104 cannot be used by the Secretary of State to
    abandon an appeal brought by her.  Having granted the appellant leave
    to remain, the Secretary of Sate could have withdrawn their appeal.
    The Secretary of State did not.  In the circumstances, the only
    decision I can make is to dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

6.   The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
