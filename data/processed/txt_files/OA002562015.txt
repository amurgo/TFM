Representation:

For the Appellant:             Mr D.  Coleman,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by
                 Daniel Aramide Solicitors.
For the Respondent:      Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Presenting  Officer.




                           Decision and Directions


 1. The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on 14 June 2006, appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal against a  decision  of  the  respondent  of  8
    December 2014 to refuse his application under para 301 of the Statement
    of Changes in the Immigration Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)  (hereafter
    referred to individually as a "Rule" and collectively the "Rules")  and
    under Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention for the  Protection  of
    Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) to join  his  parents  who
    are Nigerian nationals settled in the United Kingdom as their dependent
    minor child.

 2. The  respondent  did  not  accept  that  the  appellant  satisfied  the
    following requirements:

    i.     (para 301(i)) that the appellant was related as claimed  to  his
    sponsors;

    ii.     (para  301  (i)  (b)  and  (c))  that  one  parent   had   sole
         responsibility for his upbringing or that there  were  serious  and
         compelling family or other considerations which made his  exclusion
         undesirable;

    iii.   (para 301(iv)) that he will be accommodated  adequately  without
         recourse to public funds;

    The respondent did not accept that the decision was in  breach  of  any
    protected rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The appellant's  appeal  was  heard  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal K Lester, who dismissed the appeal.

 4. By the date of the hearing before the judge,  the  appellant's  parents
    had separated. The judge heard evidence that the appellant's mother had
    received some benefit payments. Relying upon RM (Kwok  on  Tong:  HC395
    para 320) India [2006] UKAIT 00039, the judge  raised  the  maintenance
    issue and decided that the appeal must fail because the  appellant  did
    not satisfy the requirement in para 301((iva), that "he can,  and  will
    be, maintained adequately by the parents or parents without recourse to
    public funds".

 5. It is clear from the decision that the judge  decided  the  maintenance
    issue on the basis of the circumstances as at the date of the hearing.

 6. In his decision, the judge accepted that the appellant was  related  as
    claimed to his parents and that his mother had sole responsibility  for
    his upbringing.

 7. On 29 March 2016, the appellant was granted permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal.

 8. At the hearing, Mr Coleman accepted on behalf of the appellant that the
    judge was entitled to require the appellant to address the  maintenance
    and accommodation issues, pursuant to RM. He also accepted that, if the
    appellant's appeal failed under the Rules, he could not succeed on  the
    basis of Article 8.

 9.  Mr  Coleman  and  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  agreed  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law in deciding the maintenance issue by  reference
    to the circumstances as at the date of the  hearing,  contrary  to  the
    terms of s.85(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    (the "2002 Act"). Para 16 of the judge's decision  indicates  that  the
    judge may have been misled into making this error by the submissions of
    the Presenting Officer at the hearing before him.

10. The judge's decision does not disclose that he  received  any  evidence
    relating the circumstances appertaining as at the date of the  decision
    on the maintenance issue, no doubt because it only became apparent from
    the oral evidence of the appellant's mother that her circumstances  had
    changed since the appellant's application was made  by  reason  of  the
    fact that she and the appellant's father had separated.

11. I am satisfied that, whilst the  judge  was  entitled  to  require  the
    appellant to address the maintenance issue, he materially erred in  law
    by deciding this issue on the basis of the circumstances as at the date
    of the hearing. I therefore set aside his decision to refuse the appeal
    under the Rules.

12. I direct that the re-making of the decision is limited to  whether  the
    appellant satisfies the accommodation and maintenance  requirements  of
    para 301 of the Rules. The following findings of the judge shall stand:



    i.     that the appellant has established that he is related as claimed
    to his mother;

    ii.    that the sole responsibility requirement in  para  301(i)(b)  is
         satisfied. It is therefore  unnecessary  to  consider  whether  the
         requirement in para 301(i)(c) is satisfied.

13. There will be no need to consider Article 8 because Mr Coleman accepted
    that the appellant's Article 8 claim cannot  succeed  if  he  does  not
    satisfy the requirements of para 301 of the Rules.

DIRECTIONS:

14. The direction below  shall apply in addition to any direction givens by
    the First-tier Tribunal:

    Any documentary evidence, whether  by  way  of  supporting  documentary
    evidence or witness statements, must be served by the appellant no less
    than 28 days before the hearing date. The appellant is on  notice  that
    the purpose of this direction is to give the respondent (who is abroad)
    an opportunity to consider the documents. Failure to comply  with  this
    direction may lead to evidence being  excluded  or  the  hearing  being
    adjourned.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  errors  on
points of law such that the decision is set  aside  in  its  entirety.  This
case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing on the  merits  on
all issues by a judge  other  than  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  K.
Lester.
