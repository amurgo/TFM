                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the entry clearance officer" and the
    respondent as "the  claimant."  The  entry  clearance  officer  appeals
    against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  19
    November 2014.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of India, aged 34, and was sponsored  by  his
    wife, aged 30, who was living in the UK since 2 May 2008 and has become
    a permanent resident since October 2012.

 3. The appeal against the decision by the entry clearance  officer  on  11
    March 2014 to refuse the claimant entry clearance under the Immigration
    Rules, was dismissed by the First-tier tribunal panel under  the  rules
    but allowed under the Human Rights Convention.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the claimant failed to comply at
    the time of the application with E-ECP 3.1 in that he did  not  provide
    the required documentation to the entry  clearance  officer  [14(iii)].
    The decision was accordingly in accordance with the law.

 5. The panel however allowed the appeal under the Human Rights Convention,
    taking into account the unchallenged evidence of the sponsor  that  she
    had recently given birth to a son, the child of the claimant. The panel
    had regard to decisions such as  Beoku-Betts  [2008]  UKHL  39  and  ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4. It was noted that the claimant had not
    seen his new baby son. Nor had the child seen his father and should not
    be prevented or unnecessarily delayed from meeting him and establishing
    a relationship with him. It was not in the best interests of the  child
    for the claimant to be denied entry clearance to the UK.

 6. The Tribunal considered s.117A-D under the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 as amended by the introduction of a new Part 5A.

 7. The sponsor earned an annual income in excess of ï¿½19,000. Although  the
    sponsor had not satisfied 'that particular requirement of the Rules'  -
    the specified evidence in Appendix FM-SE of the  Rules  -  taken  as  a
    whole however, it was disproportionate to  refuse  the  claimant  entry
    clearance to the UK [27-28].

 8. The entry clearance officer's application for permission to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers on
    8 January 2015.  It was arguable that the Tribunal did  not  adequately
    consider the possibility of the sponsor relocating  to  India  to  live
    with the claimant there. Further, it was arguable that the Tribunal did
    not  adequately  consider  the  possibility  of  a  fresh   application
    supported by documentation that did meet the requirements of the rules.



 9. Ms Holmes submitted that the panel failed  to  consider  whether  there
    were any obstacles to family life continuing in India. That was nowhere
    mentioned in the proportionality assessment. Husbands and wives had the
    right to respect for their  family  life  even  if  they  had  not  yet
    established a home together. The Convention  does  not  give  them  the
    right to choose where that home shall be.

10.  It  was  only  peripherally  alluded  to  at  paragraph  26   of   the
    determination where the Tribunal noted that it could not be  reasonable
    for the claimant's wife to leave the UK as she has lived here  for  six
    years, has employment and at the time of application was pregnant.  The
    panel 'understood' that she had recently given birth.

11. The mandatory specified evidence had not been  provided,  even  at  the
    date of hearing. Although the panel referred to s.117B(1) of  the  2002
    Act, namely that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in
    the public interest, the Tribunal did not grapple with  the  importance
    of that interest. There was not a disproportionate interference in  the
    circumstances  as  the  claimant  could  re-apply  if  and   when   the
    requirements of the rule were met. That had not even been considered.

12. On behalf of the  claimant,  Ms  Shaw  submitted  that  the  Court  has
    considered proportionality from  paragraphs  19-28.  The  child's  best
    interests were taken into account.

13. During the course of her submissions, she  noted  that  an  application
    could perhaps be made under Appendix FM E-ECPT.2.1-4.2.

14. However, the child has been growing  up  without  the  benefit  of  the
    father's presence. The father has not even met the child.

15. She also relied on the Rule 24 response, including the reference by the
    panel to Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40. Policies that involve  people
    cannot be, and should not be, allowed to become rigid, inflexible rules
    (Lord Scott, paragraph 20).

16. Moreover, regard must be had to the effect on other family members - in
    this case the husband of the sponsor, who has a right  to  respect  for
    their family life being taken into account.

17. A fresh application  would  lead  to  a  further  breach  of  the  UK's
    obligations under the Human Rights Convention. In this case, there  was
    a UK born child, who  is  a  family  member  for  the  purpose  of  the
    Convention.

18. In reply, Ms Holmes submitted that the  best  interests  of  the  child
    constituted a primary consideration but not a decisive one.

    Assessment

19. As part  of  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal,  the  entry
    clearance officer submitted that the mandatory  specified  evidence  in
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules had not been provided, "even at
    the date of hearing (accepted by the appellant at  paragraph  13(iii)".
    That is an overstatement however as   it  was  in  fact  accepted  that
    although  the  claimant  had  not  not  provided   all   the   required
    documentation, much of it was present in the bundles.

20. The Tribunal properly directed itself in  relation  to  the  assessment
    pursuant to s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009.
    In particular, the Tribunal had regard to the statements of Lady  Hale,
    referring to the fact that the best interests of the child  must  be  a
    primary consideration which can be outweighed by the cumulative  effect
    of other  considerations.  Lady  Hale  also  referred  to  Lord  Hope's
    statement and that of Lord Kerr in ZH (Tanzania) that it is not  merely
    one consideration that weighs in the balance alongside other  competing
    factors. Where the best interest of the child clearly favours a certain
    course, that course should be followed unless countervailing reasons of
    considerable force displace them [23].

21. I find that the  Tribunal  did  not  properly  take  into  account  and
    consider section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act, namely that  the  maintenance
    of effective immigration control is in the public interest.  The  panel
    set out the provisions of s117B, including s.117B(1) of the  2002  Act,
    but  gave  no  consideration  at  all  to  that  sub  paragraph,   only
    considering s.117B(2), s117B(3) and s117B(6). However, the Tribunal  is
    required to have regard to each of the public  interest  considerations
    which were applicable in this case.

22. I have had regard to the Upper Tribunal's decision in Hameed  (Appendix
    FM-Financial Year) [2014] UKUT 00266 (IAC). There, the panel, including
    the vice-President, noted that the effect of the First-tier  Tribunal's
    adverse decision was simply that the appellant in that case had to  re-
    apply if and when the requirements of the rules can be met. They  found
    that this could not be a disproportionate interference [6]. The grounds
    in that case refer generally to Article 8. That case  did  not  involve
    any considerations relating to the best interests of a child.

23. The panel in the present appeal, however, has not considered any  other
    permissible responses. There was no proper consideration  given  as  to
    whether there were any obstacles to  family  life  being  continued  in
    India, even in the short term. Nor did it  consider  whether  it  would
    have been a proportionate response to dismiss the appeal  allowing  the
    claimant to submit a fresh application, which  included  the  necessary
    missing evidence as specified in the rules.

24. In the circumstances, I find that the First-tier Tribunal  has  made  a
    material error of law in failing to give adequate effect  to  s.117B(1)
    of the 2002 Act.

25. In the circumstances, I set aside the determination and re-make it.

26. In re-making the decision, I have regard to  the  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

27. The claimant failed to meet the relevant provisions of paragraph  FM-SE
    and had not provided all the specified evidence, even at  the  date  of
    decision. That evidence however was required to be provided as  at  the
    date of application.

28. In considering the Article 8 claim I bear in  mind  the  need  to  have
    regard to the interests of the child as a primary consideration. I have
    considered those interests including the fact that the  child  has  not
    yet 'seen' his father and that a further delay might ensue.

29. I find that the interests of the child are however  outweighed  by  the
    cumulative  effect  of  other  considerations.   In   particular,   the
    immigration rules are stringent with regard to the need to provide  the
    necessary specified evidence as at the date  of  application.  In  this
    case, that clearly did not  happen.  Moreover,  even  at  the  date  of
    hearing, not all the evidence had been provided.

30. Ms Shaw did not submit that the specified  evidence  which  was  absent
    from the application and the appeal would be difficult to obtain.

31. In giving effect to the public interest consideration in  s.117B(1),  I
    find that notwithstanding a short delay, it is appropriate  to  require
    the claimant to reapply if and when the requirements of the  rules  can
    be met.

    Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law. Having set it aside, I re-make the decision  dismissing  the
claimant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
