                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Rudd, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
I direct that the appellant be identified only  by  initials  in  connection
with these proceedings.

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria who is now about 32 years old.  He
    appeals a decision of the respondent on 22 November 2012  to  refuse  to
    revoke a deportation order made against him.

 2. The appellant is a married man and his  wife's  personal  circumstances,
    including details of her  fertility,  are  a  significant  part  of  the
    evidence that was before  the  Tribunal.   Whilst  the  nature  of  that
    evidence and its relevance to my decision are a proper matter for public
    concern, I see no reason whatsoever  for  the  appellant's  wife  to  be
    identified and so I have made an anonymity order in this case.

 3. The appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Milligan-Baldwin and Dr J O De Barros,  non  legal  member)  in  a
    determination promulgated on 7 March 2013.   Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Garratt.

 4. I have no hesitation in finding that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    law because it conspicuously failed to consider the human rights of  the
    appellant's wife when making its decision.  It  is  trite  law  that  in
    cases such as this the human  rights  of  the  family  members  directly
    affected by removal are an important consideration.

 5. I am also satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  by  not
    making any findings in the balancing exercise about the gravity  of  the
    offence that precipitated the decision to deport the appellant and  made
    no rational findings on the availability of fertility treatment for  the
    appellant's wife in the event of her choosing to live in Algeria.

 6. Correcting any of these errors could lead to  a  different  outcome.  It
    follows that I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    remake the decision. It is for the appellant to prove on the balance  of
    probabilities that he satisfies the requirements of the rules or, to the
    extent that a standard of proof is meaningful  in  an  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds, that there is a real risk of his rights  being  breached
    in the event of his return. If he shows that is  removal  would  engaged
    article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights then the respondent
    must show that his removal is justified.

 7. The appellant entered the United Kingdom irregularly having travelled on
    the back of a lorry on 20 May 2003.  He obtained work as a cleaner.   He
    was employed by an independent contractor  but  worked  for  the  London
    Borough of Waltham Forest.  With other men in very similar circumstances
    he worked long and unsociable hours for modest reward.  He paid the  tax
    and national insurance due from a person earning as he did.   Some  time
    in 2007 the council decided to employ its street cleaners  directly  and
    the appellant had so conducted himself that the council wanted to employ
    him.  He was asked to produce identity  documents  and  he  proffered  a
    forged French passport in  an  effort  to  secure  employment  with  the
    council.  He was caught and pleaded guilty to an offence of possessing a
    false identity document with the intention  of  using  it  to  establish
    registrable facts  about  himself  contrary  to  Section  25(1)  of  the
    Identity Cards Act 2006.  For this offence he was  sentenced  to  twelve
    months' imprisonment on 12 September 2007.

 8. On 9 October 2007 he claimed asylum which application was refused and he
    appealed.  At some time he indicated an intention of applying for  leave
    to remain on the basis of his relationship with a British  citizen.   On
    13 December 2007 he was served with a decision  to  make  a  deportation
    order.

 9. On 7 January 2008 he went through an Islamic marriage ceremony whilst in
    immigration detention.

10. By letter dated 22 June 2010 the Immigration Advisory Service (a  highly
    respected organisation committed to the representation of immigrants and
    asylum seekers) stated in an open letter  that  it  had  acted  for  the
    appellant but had been instructed on 20 March 2008  that  the  appellant
    was preparing to leave the United Kingdom  and  the  IAS  was  asked  to
    inform the  Tribunal  accordingly.   By  letter  the  IAS  informed  the
    Tribunal "that our client had left UK and returned to his home country".

11. On 11 April 2008 the appellant's appeal against a decision to  make  him
    the subject of a deportation order was heard by Immigration  Judge  B  W
    Dawson (as he then was)  with  Mr  C  Thursby,  non-legal  member.   The
    Tribunal appellant did not appear. The Tribunal appears not to have seen
    the letter claiming that the  appellant  had  left  the  United  Kingdom
    because it considered the case on its merits and dismissed the appeal.

12. The appellant next came to  the  attention  of  the  authorities  on  16
    September 2012 when he  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  theft  by  the
    Cambridge police.

13. On 22 September 2011 the appellant married according  to  the  rites  of
    the Church of England.  This marriage  is  recognised  in  English  law.
    However I note that  the  appellant  was  married  by  licence  so  that
    publishing banns of marriage was not required. The wedding ceremony  may
    have been arranged at short notice but the evidence that  the  appellant
    and his wife have  been  committed  to  each  other  for  some  time  is
    compelling.

14. A deportation order was signed on 17 November 2011.

15. The appellant applied to revoke the  deportation  order  on  7  November
    2012 and that application was refused on 22 November 2012.

16. A letter from the solicitors representing him in  that  matter  confirms
    that he was acquitted after a trial at Cambridge Magistrates'  Court  on
    11 January 2013.

17. The reasons for refusal to revoke the deportation order are set  out  at
    length in a letter dated 22 November 2012.  The substantial  points  are
    that the Rules prescribe that a deportation order will not  normally  be
    revoked in less than 10 years after it was made and  that  removing  the
    appellant would be in accordance with the Immigration Rules dealing with
    the United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights.

18. The appellant gave evidence before me and adopted  his  statement  dated
    20 December 2012.

19. There he said that he was born in Algeria in July 1981 and  lived  there
    with his mother and two sisters.  He had problems beginning in 2003.

20. His father was separated from his mother and the appellant did not  live
    with his father.  He claimed he left Algeria for France,  travelling  on
    his own passport.  He lost his passport  and  obtained  a  false  French
    passport with the assistance of a  distant  relative.   He  entered  the
    United Kingdom in April 2003 having travelled on Eurostar  and  went  to
    Walthamstow where he had friends.

21. He  used  his  assumed  false  French  identity  to  obtain  a  national
    insurance number and he worked as a street cleaner  for  Waltham  Forest
    Borough.  He  did  not  effect  to  his  intention  of  approaching  the
    authorities immediately on arriving because he had been advised he would
    have been removed.

22. He met the woman who is now his wife in February 2005 at a nightclub  in
    London.  By August 2006 they were very much  in  love  and  he  proposed
    marriage.  They began to live together at the end of 2006.  She was  not
    aware of his irregular presence in the United Kingdom until about  March
    2007 when he had to explain why he could not accompany her on  a  family
    holiday to Dubai.  She disapproved of his status and encouraged  him  to
    contact the authorities.

23. In June 2007 he was arrested at work by  the  police  and  was  soon  in
    custody for using false documents.

24. His  wife  visited  him  regularly  in  prison  and  whilst  he  was  in
    immigration detention.

25. He claimed asylum whilst he was in detention  but  withdrew  the  asylum
    claim.

26. On 7 January 2008 he and his  wife  went  through  an  Islamic  marriage
    ceremony at the detention centre that was witnessed by a small number of
    her friends and  detainees.   It  was  never  his  wife's  intention  to
    practice the Islamic faith but she wanted some ceremony  to  bind  them.
    At that time his wife was a Sikh.

27. The appellant  was  released  from  detention  subject  to  a  reporting
    condition which he ignored after a time.  He said his wife was suffering
    from depression and he feared he would be removed and that  would  upset
    his wife.

28. He insisted that he stopped reporting  because  he  was  afraid  of  the
    consequences and not because he was disrespectful of the United  Kingdom
    law and authorities. I  do  not  accept  that  there  is  a  significant
    difference  between  these  positions.  The  fact  is  that  he  stopped
    reporting so that the respondent would find it harder to remove him.

29. The appellant and his wife decided that rather than  engaging  with  the
    appeal process it would be better to return voluntarily to  Algeria  and
    apply to return as the husband of a British national.  He said  he  gave
    appropriate instructions to his legal representatives and  assumed  they
    would be carried out.

30. Nevertheless he did not leave the United Kingdom. He said that this  was
    because he did not want to leave his wife by herself.

31. In 2010 his wife wanted to start a  family.   They  could  not  conceive
    naturally  and  his  wife  started  to  have  treatment  including   IVF
    treatment.

32. He said his wife was becoming more interested  in  the  Christian  faith
    where she found solace.  She had attended  church  with  her  neighbours
    since she was a young child.  She was baptised  as  a  Christian  on  28
    August 2011.

33. After her conversion the appellant's wife wanted them to be married  and
    they were married on 22 September 2011.  He said that as time passed  it
    became harder for him to  contemplate  approaching  the  authorities  to
    regularise his position.

34. In September 2012 he was arrested by the police.  He  was  suspected  of
    being involved in theft.  He denied that he had any criminal intent  and
    was acquitted.

35. He said that he was  shocked  to  know  that  a  deportation  order  was
    recorded as being served against him.  He had not seen one.

36. He took legal advice and was told that he would be able  to  argue  that
    removing him would be contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

37. He helped his solicitors present such a claim.

38. He said that his wife and he had  been  in  a  "genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship since 2005" and he believed it would be impossible for  his
    wife to return to Algeria with him.

39. He explained that his wife  is  a  British  citizen  who  was  born  and
    brought upon the United Kingdom and had strong family ties in the United
    Kingdom.

40. Additionally he had promised that any children of the marriage would  be
    raised in the Christian faith.  His mother was aware that he had married
    and his mother and sister said they would not accept  his  wife  because
    she was not a Muslim.  He said that the fact she is Christian and he  is
    Muslim would stand out and make difficulties.  The difficulties would be
    enhanced by the fact that  she  is  "of  Indian  origin"  and  would  be
    noticeably not Algerian.

41. She did not speak  French  or  Arabic  and  so  communication  would  be
    difficult.  She did not expect to obtain work.

42. He said that he regarded  himself  as  very  much  part  of  his  wife's
    family.

43. In answer to additional questions he said that he had not told his  wife
    that he did not have permission to be in the United  Kingdom  until  she
    went to Dubai for a holiday in 2007.

44. He did not appeal the deportation notice because he was going  home  but
    his wife was too depressed for him to leave her.

45. His family would disown him if he returned with a Christian  wife.   His
    wife had strong family links with the United Kingdom.

46. In  cross-examination  he  confirmed  that  his  wife  had  tablets  for
    depression.  His wife's family would pay for IVF treatment just as  they
    had helped support him in custody.  He insisted that he had had no  work
    since leaving prison.

47. His wife was a customer service worker for orange telephones.

48.  The  appellant's  wife  gave  evidence  before  me.   She  adopted  her
    statement of 20 December 2012.

49. She confirmed that she had met the appellant in February 2005 at a  club
    in Leicester Square.  He proposed marriage on her birthday in  2006  and
    she made plans for them to share a life and have children.

50. She thought he was French because he speaks French so well but  she  had
    never asked him about his immigration status.  She  was  "shocked"  when
    she discovered that he was unable to travel with  her  to  Dubai  for  a
    holiday.

51. He was arrested on 12 June 2007.  She had to ring every  police  station
    in London to find him.  She visited him at Wormwood Scrubs three times a
    week for three months and altered her shifts at work so that  she  could
    visit him as well as do her job.  They spoke every day that  he  was  in
    prison.  She visited him while he was in detention.

52. They took part in an Islamic marriage ceremony  in  January  2008.   She
    had hoped that he would be released in time for the marriage ceremony to
    be out of custody but that did not happen.  She talked about the time he
    was taken into prison and said:

         "I was crying all the time and I felt depressed and alone.  I  felt
         like my world had ended; it was horrible.  I now feel the same  way
         again as I fear that he will be taken away from me and returned  to
         Algeria."

53. She could not contemplate living in Algeria.  Her whole  family  was  in
    the United Kingdom and they were very close.  Her father was not a  well
    man and she wanted to be reasonably near to him.  She spoke Punjabi  and
    English.  She needed to speak French or Arabic to live in Algeria.   She
    was used to being an independent woman but could not do that if she  was
    unemployable in Algeria.  She could not see how she could  adjust  to  a
    society that had different expectations about the role of  a  woman  and
    she was concerned about how  she  would  dress  and  how  she  would  be
    treated.

54. She described herself as a "practicing  Christian"  and  did  not  think
    that a mixed marriage would be acceptable in Algeria.

55. It was a  condition  of  the  marriage  in  the  Church  of  England  in
    September 2011 that the appellant would allow any children to be  raised
    as Christians.  The appellant could not keep this promise in Algeria.

56. She could not conceive naturally.  She hoped  to  benefit  from  an  egg
    donation so that she could experience pregnancy and deliver a child.

57. She confirmed in answer to additional questions that she  suffered  from
    depression and could not contemplate coping without her husband after he
    had been released from detention.

58. She said that she had been born in the United  Kingdom  and  her  family
    never had any problems with immigration matters and  it  was  a  strange
    world for her to find that the appellant was not lawfully in the country
    and had to go to prison.  She coped.

59. She spoke frankly and movingly about her desire  to  have  children  and
    her frustrations at not being able to conceive.

60. She also talked of her close family ties with the United  Kingdom.   She
    was asked what she would do if her husband was deported.   She  said  it
    was too much to cope with.  She wanted to stay in the United Kingdom and
    have a child.

61. She was cross-examined.

62. She said that her family were not strongly  religious  although  one  of
    her sisters went to  church  sometimes.   She  turned  to  religion  for
    comfort.

63. The appellant's wife is rather older than the appellant.  She  was  born
    in 1967 and told me on more than one occasion in her evidence  that  she
    was aware of her biological clock ticking.

64. Neither witness was re-examined.

65. There is evidence confirming that the appellant's wife has been  treated
    for depression for significant periods in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

66. Mr Walker began by describing the evidence from the  appellant  and  his
    wife about their  relationship  and  circumstances  as  "credible".   Of
    course that is a matter for me not a matter for Mr Walker but he was not
    being disrespectful.  He was being realistic.  I am quite  satisfied  on
    the evidence that I have heard that the appellant and his wife are  fond
    of each other.  I am satisfied that at least one of his reasons for  not
    leaving the United Kingdom when he should have done was to  support  his
    wife who was  suffering  from  depression.   I  am  satisfied  they  are
    committed to each other.  I am satisfied that she  would  find  it  very
    difficult in Algeria.

67. I accept as well that it would not be  possible  for  the  appellant  to
    conceive a child by IVF treatment in Algeria.  I have the benefit  of  a
    report from Emile  George  Howard  Joff�.   Dr  Joff�  is  a  well-known
    commentator in the Middle East.  He says in a report dated 12  May  2013
    that although in vitro fertilisation treatment is available in  Algeria,
    at significant cost, third party donation  is  just  not  available  and
    neither is it available in neighbouring Muslim states.

68. I am also satisfied that this is an appeal  that  cannot  succeed  under
    the Rules.

69. However I do not accept that a person's Article 8 rights are  considered
    adequately simply by applying the Immigration  Rules.   I  rely  on  the
    decision of the Tribunal in MF (Article 8 - new  Rules)  Nigeria  [2012]
    UKUT 00393 (IAC) and Izauazu (Article 8 -  new  Rules)  [2013]  UKUT  45
    (IAC) where the effect of the new Rules has been considered  at  length,
    and unless I am told by a higher court or act  of  Parliament  that  the
    approach in those cases is wrong then I cannot  limit  consideration  of
    Article 8 issues to an application of the Rules.

70. Mr Rudd has prepared a realistic and helpful skeleton argument which  is
    laden with authority.

71. He particularly draws to my  attention  the  decision  of  the  European
    Court of Human Rights in Maslov v Austria  which  identifies  points  of
    particular relevance.

72. Clearly the offence for which the appellant has been sent to  prison  is
    not the most serious in the criminal  calendar.   Nevertheless,  he  has
    been convicted of an offence that strikes at  the  core  of  immigration
    control.  The public generally have an interest  in  removing  from  the
    United Kingdom people who have no business to be in the  United  Kingdom
    and that interest is enhanced when the person has used  dishonest  means
    to enter or lengthen his stay.  Whilst  the  removal  of  the  appellant
    might not be as necessary  as,  for  example,  removing  a  person  with
    several convictions for the most unspeakable offences  against  children
    and an inclination to continue them, I am also satisfied that it  is  in
    the public interest that he be removed.

73. He has been in the United Kingdom for about 10  years.   However,  until
    he was 22 he lived in the country of which he is a national and he still
    has connections with that country because he talks about  fairly  recent
    contact with his wife and sister.  If he were to be removed  to  Algeria
    he would not be removed to a country where he has lived as an adult  and
    where he would know how to conduct himself.

74. The offence that led to his deportation was committed nearly  six  years
    ago and he has not been convicted of anything  since  as  far  as  I  am
    aware.  The Secretary of State is probably in  a  better  position  than
    anyone in the United Kingdom to know about a person's  criminal  records
    and can be relied upon to have  told  me  if  he  had  been  in  further
    trouble.

75. However, I cannot look at the  appellant's  circumstances  and  conclude
    that he is a man who is sorry for his criminal  activities  or  who  has
    learned by his experiences in custody.  He  allowed  his  solicitors  to
    indicate that he had left the United Kingdom.  He admitted  he  had  the
    intention of leaving but instead of doing that he remained and no  doubt
    would have remained living irregularly unless he had been detected.

76.  Whilst  I  cannot  know  that  he  actually  received  a  copy  of  the
    deportation order I conclude from his decision, taken at a time when  he
    was represented properly, to walk away from an appeal against a decision
    to make him the subject of such an order that he must have known that it
    was at least highly likely that such an order would have been  made.   I
    find this very significant.  The whole  regime  of  immigration  control
    depends on people who do not want to be  in  the  United  Kingdom  being
    removed.  Whilst the need to remove somebody may well be  diminished  by
    the passage of time so that  even  people  convicted  of  quite  serious
    offences do not necessary have to be removed when all the  circumstances
    are considered, I find that there is need to remove  a  person  who  has
    defied the system by entering illegally and  who  has  remained  knowing
    that he had no business being in the United  Kingdom  and  after  having
    indicated an intention to leave  weight  heavily  in  the  balance  when
    article 8 is evaluated.

77. If the appellant was the only person to be  considered  then,  like  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in concluding
    that his removal would have been wholly proportionate.

78. As is so often the case in deportation appeals the  difficult  parts  of
    the case concern not the human rights of the appellant but of those  who
    would be affected deeply by his removal.

79. As is explained above, the appellant's wife is  an  impressive  lady  in
    many respects.  She is deeply loyal to the appellant.  Having  reflected
    carefully on her story I believe that she did not  realise  he  was  not
    entitled to be in the United Kingdom until after their relationship  had
    become rather serious when he could not go on holiday with her to Dubai.
     I accept that she is not a person  experienced  with  people  who  have
    irregular immigration  status  and  I  accept  that  it  was  inherently
    believable that  the  appellant  was  a  French  citizen  and  therefore
    entitled to be in the United Kingdom.   The  appellant's  wife  did  not
    allow the relationship to become  serious  in  defiance  of  immigration
    control.

80. Nevertheless, she knew for some years that he had  no  business  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I am quite confident about that.  She presented  as  an
    intelligent woman well able to use to  the  internet  to  research  such
    matters and able to take the  initiative  in,  for  example,  trying  to
    arrange for the appellant's marriage.

81. I accept that she was suffering from depression and I make it plain  for
    the avoidance of doubt that I recognise that  depression  is  a  serious
    mental illness.  Nevertheless, she has helped him remain in  the  United
    Kingdom when she should have known, and did know,  that  he  should  not
    have been there. Although the appellant's wife would benefitted from his
    presence when she was ill she has a  strong  supportive  family  in  the
    United Kingdom. He could have left her being supported by them. She  did
    not and does not need his presence in the United Kingdom  to  cope  with
    her illness although I do not doubt that she would be aided by it.

82. I accept that the appellant's wife longs to be a mother.  I do not  know
    if she will ever be able to achieve that.  There is no reason to  assume
    that the kind of fertility treatment contemplated would  actually  work,
    but I understand that she wants the chance.  It has not  been  explained
    to me that arrangements could not  be  made  for  the  treatment  to  be
    carried out in the United Kingdom in the absence of  the  appellant  and
    that is, I find, a surprising omission from the story.  Without  in  any
    way trivialising the pain a woman must feel when she cannot conceive,  I
    cannot determine this appeal as if she would become a mother unless  the
    appellant was removed.  His removal  will  make  it  harder  to  achieve
    something that may not happen anyway.

83. I do not think she can reasonably be expected to live in  Algeria.   She
    is used to earning her  own  living  and  I  accept  that  it  would  be
    difficult for her to find a job without first learning a language  which
    she clearly could not do in the immediate future.  I  also  accept  that
    there would be significant societal prejudice against her because of her
    appearance and religion.  This is not a case where the appellant's  wife
    has presented herself as a person of great piety  who  would  be  deeply
    frustrated at being unable to associate with other Christians or worship
    in a Protestant church.  She has not put the case that way and  that  is
    to her credit, but her religious instincts are those of a Christian, and
    she will find it hard to give expression to that in Algeria.  I  do  not
    consider it reasonable to expect her to  embrace  the  big  change  that
    would be consequent on her removing to Algeria.

84. I am quite confident that if  I  dismiss  this  appeal  I  will  make  a
    decision that will hurt her very deeply.  I must now ask myself if  that
    kind of disturbance to her private and family life is  proportionate  to
    the  proper  purpose  of  enforcing  immigration  control.   After  much
    hesitation I have come to the conclusion that it is.  The problem is not
    the severity of the appellant's offence but the complete disregard  that
    it shows for immigration control in the United Kingdom.

85. Although I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal because  it
    was wrong in a very important way, having heard all the evidence I  come
    to the same conclusion which is to dismiss the appeal.
