For the Appellant:     Mr A Mackenzie, Counsel instructed by Theva
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, who was born on 22 June  1989,  is  a  national  of  Sri
    Lanka.  He first entered the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student on 24 September 2009.  He remained here in that capacity  until
    5 December 2011 when he returned to Sri Lanka after he had been refused
    further leave and a subsequent appeal had been dismissed.   In  January
    2012 started a relationship with the woman, who was also a national  of
    Sri Lanka, and they became engaged in April 2012.

2.   The appellant left Sri Lanka on 23 October 2012 and entered the  United
    Kingdom illegally on 26 October 2012.  He called the  Home  Office  the
    same day and made a formal application for asylum on 19 November  2012.
    The respondent refused his application  on  18  December  2012  and  he
    appealed.

3.   His first appeal was allowed but was overturned by the  Upper  Tribunal
    and was remitted to another First-tier Tribunal Judge. This appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla, who dismissed his appeal on 9
    July 2014.   But  in  his  determination  and  reasons  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge made very positive findings of fact  in  favour  of  the
    appellant. In particular, he found that  the  Appellant's  fianc�e  had
    been working as a teacher and had met the son of the President  of  Sri
    Lanka when he attended a  sports  day  event  at  her  school  on  12th
    September 2012.  This man asked her to  join  him  at  his  hotel  that
    evening but she declined his offer.  She was  then  abducted  the  next
    morning and has not been seen  or  heard  from  since.   The  Appellant
    informed the police of her abduction on 14th September  2012  but  they
    failed to take any action. The Appellant then filed what I presume  was
    a habeas corpus action in the High Court in Sri Lanka  on  1st  October
    2012 for her to be produced and this  led  to  him  being  detained  by
    members of the CID the same day. He was then held  until  23rd  October
    2012 and interrogated and tortured before being released as the  result
    of his uncle paying a bribe. He then fled to  the  United  Kingdom  via
    India arriving here on 25th October 2012.

4.   However, in paragraph 53 of his decision and  reasons  he  went  on  to
    find that the Appellant was not entitled to asylum as he had  not  been
    suspected of being a political person in the past or  the  present.  He
    also found that there was no reason to  assume  that  he  could  be  of
    continuing interest to the Sri Lankan  authorities  or  that  his  name
    would be on the "stop list" at the airport.   Therefore,  he  concluded
    that he was not at risk of persecution in Sri Lanka in the light of  GJ
    and others (post-civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013]  UKUT  00319
    (IAC).

5.   In paragraph 50 of his decision and  reasons  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge found that there were no material credibility  issues  left  that
    undermined the Appellant's account. At paragraph 52 he went on to  find
    that,  whilst  in  detention,  the  Appellant  was  fingerprinted   and
    photographed and he  was  asked  questions  about  the  LTTE.  He  also
    accepted that his ID was taken from him.

6.   In addition, having considered the psychiatric report  by  Dr.  Dhumad,
    he found that his removal to Sri Lanka would not give rise to a  breach
    of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights as, although he
    had attempted to commit suicide in the past, he could  be  treated  and
    supported in Sri Lanka.

7.   The Appellant appealed against this decision. Permission to appeal  was
    refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison on 29th July  2014
    but was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 30th October 2014  on
    both asylum and human rights grounds.

8.   In a Rule  24  response,  dated  21st  November  2014,  the  Respondent
    asserted that the credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    were inadequately reasoned.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

9.   The Appellant's counsel noted that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    found the Appellant's account to be credible in its entirety.  He  also
    noted that the Appellant had said that whilst he was  in  detention  he
    had been accused of being involved in the LTTE  and  asked  to  sign  a
    document which he could not read.  He then reminded me that in  GJ  and
    Others the Tribunal found that a person could be at risk because he was
    "perceived to be" political.

10.  The Home Office Presenting Officer replied and  argued  that  perceived
    involvement in the LTTE on  a  limited  basis  was  not  sufficient  to
    attract a need for protection in the context of GJ and Others. He  also
    argued that there was no evidence that the Appellant would  be  on  the
    "stop list".  In addition, he noted that Dr. Smith had said that  there
    was no evidence that the President's son had previously  been  involved
    in any sexual assaults or attacks.

11.  He then went on to say that he accepted in the  light  of  the  medical
    evidence  that  the  Appellant  suffered  from  post  traumatic  stress
    disorder and posed a suicide risk but [refer to page  57  of  objective
    evidence] referred to KH (Afghanistan). In addition, he  said  that  he
    was not going to pursue the argument raised in the Rule 24 Notice  that
    the Appellant's account had not been credible. He explained  that  this
    was because it was clear from  paragraph  3  of  the  Notice  that  the
    Respondent had not been  in  possession  of  a  complete  copy  of  the
    decision and reasons when the Notice was drafted. He went  on  to  note
    that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  had  been  very  generous  to  the
    Appellant but accepted that even though the account  was  extraordinary
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had believed it and he would have to live
    with these findings.

12.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted the Appellant's account  in  its
    entirety. In particular, at paragraph 50 of his  decision  and  reasons
    the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  found  that  there  were  no  material
    credibility issues left that undermined  the  Appellant's  account.  At
    paragraph 52 he  went  on  to  find  that,  whilst  in  detention,  the
    Appellant was fingerprinted and photographed and he was asked questions
    about the LTTE. He also accepted that his ID was taken from him. In her
    decision letter the Respondent had  asserted  that  the  Appellant  not
    produced any documentary evidence to support his case but at  paragraph
    49 of his decision and reasons the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that
    "the Appellant had provided a letter from a member of  Parliament,  Mr.
    Pon Selvarasa in which ... he confirmed that the Appellant had filed  a
    suit seeking justice as a result of which he was arrested on 1  October
    2012 ... He further confirmed that the Sri Lankan authorities  had  not
    given up their interest in the Appellant as they  were  still  visiting
    and making enquiries about him from his parents".

13.  Therefore, the accepted  evidence  indicated  that  not  only  had  the
    Appellant been previously detained and tortured, he had been  suspected
    of being connected to the LTTE, the Sri Lankan authorities had  his  ID
    card, fingerprints and photograph  and  were  still  looking  for  him.
    Therefore, he clearly was of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities.

14.  It was against this factual matrix that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    should have considered whether or not the  Appellant  fell  within  the
    risk categories contained in GJ but he failed to do so.

15.  For example, in paragraph 53 the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  said  that
    there was no reason to assume that the Appellant would be of continuing
    interest to the authorities. This was in direct contradiction with  his
    finding of fact in paragraph 49 that there was  a  letter  from  an  MP
    which stated that the Sri Lankan authorities were  still  visiting  the
    Appellant's home and asking about him.

16.  He also did not explain the basis upon which  he  had  found  that  the
    Appellant would not be on any "stop list"  when  he  had  escaped  from
    detention by the use of bribery and  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  had
    retained his ID card and fully documented him.

17.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge also asserted that the situation  in  Sri
    Lanka had fundamentally changed but did not explain  what  had  changed
    and when. The incidents upon which the Appellant relied  occurred  long
    after the LTTE had been defeated and the Sri Lankan authorities had re-
    gained control of the island. Therefore,  if  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge was basing his decision  in  part  that  the  Appellant  was  not
    entitled  to  international  protection,  he  needed  to  explain   the
    significance of this assertion.

18.   Furthermore, in GJ the Tribunal held at paragraph  7(c)  of  the  head
    note  that  "the  current  categories  of  persons  at  real  risk   of
    persecution or  serious  harm  on  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  whether  in
    detention or otherwise, are:

         '(a) Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat  to  the
         integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are,  or  are
         perceived to have a significant role in relation  to  post-conflict
         Tamil  separatism  within  the  diaspora  and/or   a   renewal   of
         hostilities within Sri Lanka.'

19.  The findings of fact were  that  the  Appellant  had  been  accused  of
    involvement with the LTTE and had made a very serious allegation  about
    the President's son. These were capable of being  viewed  as  political
    actions.  Therefore,  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   should   have
    considered whether the Appellant was perceived to be a  threat  to  the
    integrity of Sri Lanka because of the accusations he had made about the
    President's son.

20.  In addition, the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to  consider  whether
    even if the Appellant were not perceived to be a threat on  account  of
    any involvement with the LTTE, the particular circumstances of his case
    placed him at risk of detention and torture if removed to Sri Lanka.

21.  In paragraph 56 of his decision and  reasons  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge also accepted the evidence of Dr.  Dhumad,  which  was  that  the
    Appellant was suffering from post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  his
    suicide risk was likely to be significant if he were to be returned  to
    Sri Lanka.  Then in paragraph 57 he found that the MP who had submitted
    a letter on behalf of the Appellant's family could assist  in  securing
    the requisite mental health treatment for the Appellant  and  that  Sri
    Lanka had reasonable psychiatric facilities available, although not  to
    the same standard as those in the United Kingdom  or  another  European
    country. The evidential basis for these assertions was unclear and  did
    not accord with the accepted evidence at paragraph 454 of GJ. This said
    that "... there are only 25 working psychiatrists in the whole  of  Sri
    Lanka".  Although there are some mental health facilities in Sri Lanka,
    at paragraph 4 of the April 2012 UKBA Operational Guidance Note on  Sri
    Lanka, it records an observation by Basic Needs that "... money that is
    spent on mental health only really goes  to  the  large  mental  health
    institutions in capital cities,  which  are  inaccessible  and  do  not
    provide appropriate care for mentally ill people"[1].

22.  As a consequence, I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision
    and reasons in relation did include material errors of law  and  should
    be set aside.

23.  However, the Respondent  did  not  seek  to  challenge  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's findings of fact and, therefore, I  do  not  set  them
    aside but retain them as the factual basis upon to remake the decision.



24.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    detained and tortured in the past by the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  and
    that they were still looking for him. This clearly amounted to  serious
    harm for the purposes of Article 15  of  the  Qualification  Directive.
    Article 4.4 of the Directive also notes that the fact that an applicant
    has already been subject to persecution or serious harm  is  a  serious
    indication of the applicant's well-founded fear of persecution or  real
    risk of suffering serious harm.

25.  The Appellant was accused of an involvement with  the  LTTE  whilst  in
    detention but the trigger point for his detention and ill-treatment was
    the accusation he made  that  the  President's  son  had  abducted  his
    fianc�e and the fact that he had taken legal  proceedings  against  him
    for her return.  The fact that this man was  a  member  of  the  ruling
    party in Sri Lanka and  that  the  security  forces  had  detained  and
    tortured the Appellant meant that the Appellant  had  been  subject  to
    state persecution for the purposes of Article 6(a) of the Qualification
    Directive. I also find that, given the fact that  the  Appellant  is  a
    Tamil,  his  very  public  accusations  of  misconduct  aimed  at   the
    President's son may have been viewed as a challenge to the integrity of
    the Sri Lankan state.

26.  In reaching this  conclusion,  I  have  reminded  myself  that  Article
    10.1(e) of the Qualification Directive provides a  wide  definition  of
    political opinion, which includes "the holding of an  opinion,  thought
    or belief on a matter related to the potential  actors  or  persecution
    mentioned in Article 6 and to their policies or methods, whether or not
    that opinion, thought or belief has been acted upon by the applicant".

27.  Furthermore, the fact that the Appellant had  taken  appropriate  legal
    action against the President's son does not prevent  his  actions  from
    being imputed with a political motive and as found in Adan v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [1998] Imm AR  251  political  opinion
    may be express, implied or imputed.  When considering imputed political
    opinion consideration must be given to the opinion  attributed  to  the
    victim, rightly or wrongly. (See Danian v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [1999] INLR 533 and Asante [1991] Imm AR 78.)

28.  The fact that the Appellant was accused of involvement with  the  LTTE,
    was documented and was detained gives rise  to  a  serious  possibility
    that his political opposition to the Sri Lankan  government  was  being
    imputed to him, whether or not cover up the accusations he was making.

29.  The fact that the accusations were being levelled  at  an  MP  and  the
    President's son and that the Appellant was still being looked for  also
    confirms that he could not seek protection from the state.

30.  I have also taken into account the fact that in GJ the  Upper  Tribunal
    held that "if a person is detained by the Sri Lankan security  services
    there  remains  a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  or   harm   requiring
    international protection". It also found that "internal  relocation  is
    not an option within Sri Lanka for a person at real risk from  the  Sri
    Lankan authorities, since the government now controls the whole of  Sri
    Lanka and Tamils are required  to  return  to  a  named  address  after
    passing through the airport".

31.  In addition I note the fact that the Sri  Lankan  authorities  retained
    the Appellant's ID card and for this reason alone  he  will  inevitably
    have to have contact with the authorities  if  he  is  removed  to  Sri
    Lanka. Then on the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  which
    still stand, he will be revealed  as  someone  who  was  documented  in
    detention and then escaped.

32.  Taking all of this  into  account  I  find  that  there  is  a  serious
    possibility that the Appellant will be persecuted  on  account  of  his
    purported political opinion if he is removed to Sri Lanka.

Notice of Decision

1.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision and  reasons  to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal did include material errors of law and I  set  aside
    his decision.

2.   However, these  errors  did  not  undermine  the  positive  credibility
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  his  decision  and
    reasons and I do not set these aside.

3.   I remake the decision under  Section  12(2)(b)(ii)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  and  allow  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the decision by the Respondent to refuse to grant him asylum.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
