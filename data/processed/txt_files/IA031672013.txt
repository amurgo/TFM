Representation:

For the Appellant:     in person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Fletcher-Hill  promulgated  on  6  September
    2013.  In  that  determination  Judge   Fletcher-Hill   dismissed   the
    appellant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent  made  on  2
    November 2012 to refuse to grant her further leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom and to remove her from the  United  Kingdom  by  way  of
    directions  made  under  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2002  and
    was granted leave to enter as a visitor  until  30  August  2002.   She
    later obtained further leave to remain as a visitor until January  2003
    and on several occasions afterwards was granted leave to  remain  first
    as a student and subsequently under the Points-based scheme as a Tier 4
    Student Migrant.

 3. It is at this stage important to note that  the  appellant's  leave  to
    remain as a student expired on 30 June 2009.  Prior  to  that  she  had
    made an application for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  Student
    Migrant which was refused on 21 August 2009.  Although  she  was  later
    granted further leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
    until 10 October 2011, the application which led to that was made at  a
    time when she did not  have  extant  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  That is a point to which I will turn later.

 4. On 7 October 2011 the appellant made a further application for leave to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student migrant which  was  refused  on  2
    November 2012, that decision giving rise to this appeal.

 5.  The  reasons  given  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  refusing  the
    application are set out in the  refusal  letter  of  2  November  2012.
    The Secretary of State was satisfied that the appellant was entitled to
    the 30 points  claimed  under  Appendix  A  (Attributes)  but  was  not
    satisfied that  the  appellant  had  provided  evidence  that  she  had
    sufficient funds to acquire the necessary 10 points under  Appendix  C.
    This is because she did not have evidence that she held ï¿½1,200  in  her
    account over the relevant 28 day period prior to her application.

 6. The appellant appealed against that decision on four principal grounds:



       i) That she was entitled under the immigration rules to further leave
          to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.

      ii) That the decision of the Secretary of State was not in  accordance
          with the law on the basis that she had not  properly  applied  the
          evidential flexibility policy;

     iii) That the decision to make a decision to remove her  taken  at  the
          same time as the  decision  to  make  the  appellant  leave  under
          Section 47 of the 2006 Act was incorrect; and,

      iv) That the decision  to  remove  her  was  contrary  to  the  United
          Kingdom's obligations pursuant to Article 8 of  the  Human  Rights
          Convention.

 7. In her determination First-tier Tribunal Judge Fletcher-Hill concluded:

     i) that the respondent's decision  under  the  Immigration  Rules  was
        correct as theappellant had not shown that she  held  the  relevant
        funds for the relevant period;

    ii) that the evidential flexibility policy was not of  benefit  to  the
        appellant;  and,

   iii) that the appeal fell to be dismissed under paragraph 245ZXD of  the
        Immigration Rules.

 8. The appellant then  applied  for  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision on the grounds:

     i) that the Immigration Judge  had  erred  in  not  dealing  with  the
        Section 47 refusal;

    ii) that the judge had failed properly to deal  with  the  respondent's
        failure to apply the evidential flexibility policy;

   iii) that the judge had failed to consider whether the  appellant  would
        have qualified for indefinite leave to remain pursuant to the  long
        residence rule set out in paragraph 276B; and,

    iv) that the judge had failed to consider the Article 8 claim.

 9.  On  29  November  2013  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Kamara   granted
    permission, finding that the first ground was misconceived  given  that
    the respondent's representative had withdrawn the Section  47  decision
    at the hearing as was clear from paragraph 27  Second, that  there  was
    no error in the judge concluding that the evidential flexibility policy
    would have assisted the appellant given that the appellant  was  unable
    even at the date of hearing  to  show  that  she  met  the  maintenance
    requirement, but Judge Kamara found that the judge had erred in failing
    to determine the Article 8 claim and failing  to  appreciate  that  the
    appellant had managed to accumulate ten years' lawful residence between
    the hearing and the date of the determination.  All grounds  were  said
    to be arguable.

10. When the matter came before me the appellant  was  unrepresented.   She
    explained that the solicitors whom she had instructed, Malik and Malik,
    were not in a position to represent her as she had been unable to  meet
    their requests for payment.  That was subsequently confirmed in  a  fax
    sent to the Tribunal by Malik and Malik.  I was satisfied,  given  that
    the appellant had had the opportunity to instruct  solicitors  but  had
    not done so and because she said that she was prepared to proceed, that
    it would be in all the circumstances unfair and unjust  to  proceed  to
    determine the appeal.

11. I deal with the grounds in turn. There is no merit  in  the  submission
    made in grounds that the judge erred with respect  to  the  Section  47
    decision.  As Judge Kamara made clear, it is evident from  the  judge's
    determination that that decision had been withdrawn at  the  appeal  by
    the Presenting Officer.  Second, in terms of the  long  residence  rule
    (paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules), whilst it is fair that  this
    was matter properly put before the judge, and is referred to in  detail
    in the  skeleton  arguments  submitted  to  her  at  the  appeal,  when
    questioned the appellant accepted that her leave to remain  had  ceased
    in June 2009.  It is clear that it was extended by virtue of Section 3C
    of the 1971 Act until the date at which the application was refused  on
    12 August 2009 but the appellant  was without extant leave after  that,
    and when she made her ultimately  successful  application  for  further
    leave to remain.

12. Whilst the appellant was granted further leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom, that does not have the effect of granting her leave to  remain
    retrospectively. The position is that because no valid application  had
    been made whilst the appellant had extant leave to remain in the United
    Kingdom her presence here was unlawful  and  accordingly  there  was  a
    period in excess of the year when she was present here  without  leave.
    That breaks the  continuity  of  residence.  Accordingly,  while  Judge
    Fletcher-Hill erred in failing to consider this issue that error  could
    not have been material as it would have been inevitable that the appeal
    would have been dismissed on that point as the appellant could not meet
    the requirements of the Rules to have had ten years continuous'  lawful
    residence.

13. Turning to the issue of evidential flexibility, as the judge  noted  in
    her determination [51], there had never been any  suggestion  that  the
    additional evidence which it is said would have been available  had  it
    been asked for, that is, evidence from her brother or evidence that she
    met the funds at the relevant date, was in fact available.   The  judge
    also noted also, as she was entitled to do, that  the  relevant  period
    for which availability of funds needed to be shown was not  covered  by
    the brother's on line statement which did not in  any  event  meet  the
    evidential requirements of the rules; further, as her  brother  he  did
    not fall into the  category  of  those  permitted  to  sponsor  Tier  4
    migrants financially. Given the decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rodriguez [2014] EWCA  Civ
    2 it cannot properly be argued that the judge's approach to  evidential
    flexibility was incorrect.  The ground of appeal on this point does not
    identify any error on the part of the judge.

14. With respect to the failure to consider Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
    Convention, Mr Whitwell quite properly conceded that the judge had  not
    considered that issue and whilst I accept there is perhaps  some  merit
    in his submission that it would have made no difference, the issue  was
    live before her and it could not be said that there was  an  inevitable
    outcome as the evidence from the appellant raises the issue of  private
    life and family life and it she has been living in the United  Kingdom,
    albeit for periods without leave, for a substantial period.

15. For that reason I consider that the error was capable of being material
    and that the decision required to be remade.  I asked the appellant  if
    she was prepared to deal with that and she indicated that she was.

16. I then heard evidence from the  appellant  who  relied  partly  on  her
    witness statement. She explained that she has a brother in this country
    who is a diplomat.  She does not live with  him but he does support her
    financially.   She has some family in Malawi - a sister, a brother  and
    mother.  She has friends in the United Kingdom but she  said  that  she
    had not been studying since 2011 as she was unable to do as she did not
    have a proper visa.  She said that it would be easier for her to return
    to Malawi if she had a qualification and that is the reason she  wished
    to remain in the United Kingdom, and  that  it  was  her  intention  to
    return if she had a qualification.

17. In cross-examination the appellant said that she had wished to obtain a
    Bachelors degree. It was put to her that it had taken her  eight  years
    of study yet she had not yet obtained  one,  despite  it  usually  only
    taking three years  It was also put to her that  she  did  not  have  a
    family life with her brother.

18. I then heard submissions.

19. I am not satisfied that the appellant has  established  a  family  life
    with her brother.  They do not live together and whilst he does, on the
    appellant's evidence, support her financially  he  did  not  provide  a
    witness statement for the  hearing.  They  are  both  adults  and  lead
    independent lives. There is insufficient evidence of dependency to show
    that their relationship is such as to constitute family  life  for  the
    purposes of Article 8.

20. I am satisfied that the appellant does have  a  private  life  in  this
    country but the contents of this are limited.  I accept that she has  a
    number of friends here, but equally there appears to be no good  reason
    why she would be unable to maintain those friendships from  abroad  by,
    for example,  email,  telephone  and  similar  electronic  means.   The
    appellant has had  the  opportunity  to  study  here  but  she  is  not
    currently following any particular course and I note that she has  been
    unable to explain why, despite the number of years she has spent  here,
    she has not  obtained  the  Bachelors  degree  she  wished  to  obtain.
    Further, I consider that the  appellant  has  been  unable  to  explain
    properly why she needed to remain here, over and above a wish to study.



21. Bearing in Patel and Others v Secretary of State [2013]  UKSC  72,  and
    Nasim and Others (Article  8)  Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT  25.   I  am  not
    satisfied, given that the appellant has no course to follow,  has  only
    ever had temporary permission to be here in  a  limited  capacity  that
    could not have given her the expectation that she would be  allowed  to
    remain here permanently,  and  bearing  in  mind  Article  8's  limited
    utility in private life, that any interference caused by removal of the
    appellant to Malawi is sufficient to engage  Article  8  of  the  Human
    Rights Convention given that the interference if  it  be  such  relates
    solely to her private life.

22.  Further  and  in  the  alternative,  I  am  satisfied  that  any  such
    interference  would  be  proportionate  given  the  need  to   maintain
    immigration control and accordingly I remake the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal by dismissing the appeal on all grounds.

SUMMARY OF DECISIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error of law, and I set it aside.

 2. The decision to remove the appellant by way of directions  pursuant  to
    section 47  of  the  2006  Act  was  withdrawn  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The appeal against that decision to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    is therefore no longer in issue.

 3. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal against the decision  to
    refuse to vary the appellant's leave on all grounds.
