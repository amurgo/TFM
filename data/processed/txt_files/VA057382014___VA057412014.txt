Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms A Childs (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mrs H Aboni (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For the avoidance of doubt, in this appeal, the Appellant  is  referred
    to in the manner as he was referred to before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    below, and the Respondent, who is the Secretary of State,  is  referred
    to as she was at the hearing below.  It  is  the  Respondent  here  who
    appeals against  the  decision  and  reasons  statement  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Amin that was promulgated on 14th  August  2015.   Judge
    Amin allowed the appeal of the Appellant, Mr Muhammad Awais Akram,  and
    his wife, Mrs Samina Awais to seek entry to the UK as visitors.

 2. Mr Akram, and his wife Mrs Awais, were represented  by  Mrs  Childs  at
    this hearing and the Respondent was  represented  by  Mrs  H  Aboni,  a
    Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

 3. Mrs Aboni, relied upon the Grounds of Appeal.  She submitted  that  the
    judge had allowed the appeal below, in what was a limited appeal on the
    basis of human rights  arguments,  under  Article  8  without  properly
    considering that there was an established family life beyond going what
    was the normal between adult siblings, parents and adult children.  She
    relied upon a number of cases, such as MS [2004] UKIAT 00064;  Kugathas
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31; ZB (Pakistan)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  834  and  Ghising
    [2013] UKUT 00567, the latter case which emphasises the principle that,
    "adults will need to be valuing and depending on each other for  mutual
    support and affection", with emotional or  financial  dependence.   She
    submitted that none of this criteria appeared to have been  present  in
    this case.  The judge found that there was a "very close  relationship"
    (paragraph 44) between the Appellants and their only son in the UK  but
    failed to give reasons for this  finding,  such  as  the  existence  of
    additional dependency beyond normal emotional ties.

 4. In the absence of the judge being able to identify the true  nature  of
    the relationship, the failure to refer  to  the  principles  in  Razgar
    meant that the judge was unable to demonstrate that there had  been  an
    interference with family life in the manner required.  It could not  be
    said therefore that any interference, supposing it existed, amounted to
    a disproportionate interference.  She asked me to allow the appeal  and
    to remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  considered
    afresh.

 5. For her part, Ms Childs referred to her skeleton argument and submitted
    that the appeal by  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State  amounted  to
    nothing more than a disagreement with the  conclusions  of  the  judge.
    There was no dispute on the facts whatsoever.  Those facts were set out
    at the beginning of the judgment by Judge Amin.   Ms  Childs  submitted
    that the reference to a "very close relationship"  (paragraph  44)  was
    actually implicit in the judge's wider determination.

 6. First, the purpose of the visit was to see their  only  grandchild  (at
    paragraph 10).

 7. Second, the Sponsor, Mr Harris Awais, the only son of  the  Appellants,
    was very close to his mother as he had lost his brother some  time  ago
    (at paragraph 13).

 8. Third, the First Appellant,  had  transferred  money  into  Mr  Harris'
    account in Birmingham, in order to enable Mr Harris and his Polish born
    wife to purchase a better house in this country in  the  light  of  the
    birth of their grandchild (at paragraph 14).

 9. Fourth, the First Appellant maintains  contact  with  Mr  Harris  Awais
    through Skype and WhatsApp (at paragraph 15).

10. Finally, the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren was an
    important aspect of the promotion of  family  life  including  physical
    contact (at paragraph 46).

11. Ms Childs went on to say that it was facile to suggest that  the  level
    of family life that the family here was enjoying  could  be  maintained
    through modern means  of  communication  such  as  Skype  and  WhatsApp
    indefinitely because the Appellants had previously come to the UK on  a
    visitor's visa and had stayed for two months, before returning back  to
    their country, well within the duration of the visit  visa,  and  given
    this level of physical contact, it was simply not realistic to say that
    the nature of the relationship could now  be  maintained  just  through
    modern means of communication.

12. Moreover, a child of 2ï¿½ years cannot maintain contact through Skype  in
    any meaningful sense.

13. Furthermore, a second grandchild had now been born to Mr Harris  Awais.
    This was to say nothing of the fact that Mr Harris Awais'  wife,  being
    of Polish origin, had not been to Pakistan and  refused  to  go  there.
    The determination recorded that, "Mr Harris married in 2010 and  he  is
    not able to go as a family as his wife will not travel to Pakistan  and
    she will not allow  their  child  to  travel"  (paragraph  11)  due  to
    security concerns in  the  country.   The  judge  had  also  found  the
    Appellants to be credible witnesses who had given "their account  in  a
    frank manner and answered all questions put to them".  (Paragraph  34).



14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   The  judge  has
    clearly considered the reasons for his conclusion that there was a very
    close relationship.  He was right to say that the suggestion  that  the
    Sponsor and the Appellants could meet in another  country,  given  that
    the Sponsor's wife did not wish  to  go  to  Pakistan,  was  irrelevant
    because what he had before him was not  such  an  application,  but  an
    application to enter the UK on a visitor's visa.

15. The law in this country makes specific provision for visitors  to  come
    to this country.   Where  their  applications  are  rejected  there  is
    specific provision for an appeal in a limited sense on human rights and
    race relations grounds.  The judge was entitled (at  paragraph  44)  to
    consider this appeal specifically on this basis alone.

16. This was a case where the Appellants visited the Sponsor in July  2013.
    They then left  when  they  discovered  that  the  Sponsor's  wife  was
    pregnant.  They returned to apply for a visit visa when the  child  was
    born (at paragraph 10).  An important feature of this case, which  goes
    to disproportionality, is the fact that the  sponsor's  wife,  being  a
    lady from Poland, has not been to Pakistan, and  refuses  to  go  there
    because of security concerns that she has (paragraph 23).

17. As indicated by the Upper Tribunal in Abbasi, Article 8 can be  engaged
    in relation to short-term visits but each case will  turn  on  its  own
    merits.  The judge found the merits here to  be  fully  borne  out.   A
    challenge on grounds of "perversity" is  a  high  threshold  and  in  R
    (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982 it was made clear that perversity is "a very
    high hurdle" (paragraph 11).  That level has not been  reached  by  the
    Respondent's appeal.  The determination stands.

Notice of Decision

18. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

19. No anonymity order is made.
