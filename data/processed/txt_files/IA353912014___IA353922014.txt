Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. D Balroop of Counsel instructed by Maalik & Co



                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against a decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Symes  promulgated on 18th September 2015, in which  he  allowed  the
       appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  for  the  Home
       Department of 2nd September 2014, to refuse the application  made  by
       Mr Jinal Shah for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  Tier  1  (General)
       Migrant under the Points Based System. The  Judge  also  allowed  the
       appeal of Mrs Arpitaben Shah who is the wife of Mr Jinal Shah. It  is
       uncontroversial that the two appeals stand and fall together.


    2. Although First-tier Tribunal Judge Symes allowed the appeals  because
       the decisions of the respondent were not in accordance with the  law,
       the applications were effectively remitted back to the  Secretary  of
       State so that she could consider the discretion vested in  her  under
       paragraph 322(5) to refuse the application because of the conduct  of
       Mr Jinal Shah.  The Judge considered that Mr Shah  had  provided  raw
       data to his Accountant and was  under  a  duty  to  ensure  that  the
       subsequent figures prepared by the Accountant, are accurate when they
       are signed off, particularly when the figures were going to form  the
       basis for tax liability, and applications for leave to  remain.   The
       Judge considered that permitting figures to be held out by his former
       Accountants as representing the  true  level  of  his  earnings,  was
       conduct that falls to be considered by reference to paragraph  322(5)
       of the Immigration Rules, and the respondent may have overlooked  the
       discretion that is relevant to such a case.


    3. The appellant before me, is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department. However for ease of reference,  in  the  course  of  this
       decision I shall adopt the parties' status as it was before the First-
       tier Tribunal.  I shall in this decision, refer to Mr and Mrs Shah as
       the appellants, and the Secretary of State as the respondent.


    4. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Nicholson on 22nd February 2016.  In doing so, he noted that  in  the
       grounds of appeal, the respondent somewhat surprisingly contends that
       the judge erred in relying on paragraph 322(5) because the respondent
       never raised it.  He noted that if the respondent is right, then  the
       effect of the application as drafted, is that these appeals should be
       allowed outright, in line with the judge's decision at paragraph [8].




    5.  The  matter  comes  before  me  to  consider  whether  or  not   the
       determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge Symes involved the  making
       of a material error of law, and if so, to remake the decision.


Background


    6. The appellants are both citizens of  India.   The  first  appellant's
       immigration history is set out at paragraph [2] of  the  decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  He was granted leave to enter the  UK
       as a student from 15th January 2007 until 31st March 2009.  His leave
       was extended as a Tier 1 (Post study) Migrant until 26th January 2012
       and as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 5th March 2014.


    7. On 27th February 2014, the first appellant made  an  application  for
       leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant
       in accordance with the Points-Based System of the Immigration  Rules.
       The application was refused for the reasons set  out  in  a  decision
       letter dated 2nd September 2014.  The first appellant was not awarded
       any points for  'Previous  Earnings'  under  paragraph  245CA(c)  and
       Appendix A of the rules. In broad terms the  respondent  applied  the
       'Genuine Earnings Test' outlined in paragraph 19(i)  of  Appendix  A,
       but on the balance of probabilities she was not  satisfied  that  the
       earnings that the appellant had claimed from  self  employment,  were
       from genuine employment.  The respondent set out her reasons for that
       conclusion in her  decision,  and  I  do  not  repeat  them  in  this
       decision.


The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal


    8. On 1st September 2015, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Symes  heard  the
       appeals and allowed the appeals for the reasons set out in a decision
       promulgated on 18th September 2015.  Paragraph [2]  of  his  decision
       sets out the background  and  paragraph  [3]  sets  out  the  reasons
       provided in the respondent's decision  of  2nd  September  2014.   At
       paragraphs [4] and [5], the Judge records the  evidence  before  him.
       He states:


             "4.  In his witness statement the Appellant set  out  that  he
             was in business dealing with properties in Gujarat, India, his
             customer base comprising expatriate Gujaratis in this  country
             whom he helped to invest in property.  His  business  grew  by
             word of mouth. A downtown in the property market for the years
             2012/2013 had diminished his earnings though this did not mean
             the business was not genuine.  Having  seen  the  Home  Office
             criticism of his earnings he  had  now  investigated  previous
             years' tax returns which he now appreciated had been completed
             on  an  inaccurate  basis  but  his  former  accountants,   JP
             Consultants, had not been contactable and he had reported them
             to the ACCA. He worked very long  hours  overall  and  it  was
             wrong to presume he could not run  his  property  business  as
             well as working for 47 hours each week as an employee.


             5.   Supporting  documents  included  numerous  invoices  from
             March 2013 to February 2014  from  the  Appellant  to  various
             customers; a letter from  Shah  Consultancy,  Accountants,  of
             March 2015 saying that tax  returns  had  been  submitted  for
             previous years and one would be provided for the year ending 5
             April  2015  soon:  he  had  told  them  that   his   previous
             accountants  had  made  errors  in  the  submission   of   his
             documents; letters from JP Consultants to UKBA of  April  2011
             recording a net profit of ï¿½30,661;  a  complaint  to  ACGA  of
             March 2015 from the Appellant in relation to JP Consultants; a
             letter from Shree Hari Infrastructure of Anand,  India,  wrote
             that  the  Appellant  referred  them  customers  for  property
             investments but none of the deals were finalised in the  years
             2011-2013; and numerous plans of properties.


    9. At paragraph [7] of his decision, the Judge makes  reference  to  the
       matters set out in paragraph 19(i) of Appendix A of the rules and the
       factors that the respondent will take account of, that are identified
       at paragraphs  19(j)(i)  to  (ix)  of  Appendix  A.    The  essential
       findings and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Symes  are  to  be
       found at paragraph [8] of his decision:


             "8.  I accept, having reviewed the evidence in  the  documents
             and  the  witness   statements,   that   the   Appellant   has
             consistently been working in the United Kingdom including on a
             self-employed basis running his own business. He has  provided
             detailed evidence and numerous documents associated  with  the
             existence of an underlying business, including copy  invoices.
             His new accountants have now certified those corrected figures
             for past earnings as genuine. The question posed by  19(1)  is
             whether the earnings are from  genuine  employment  which  may
             include earnings from businesses operated by an  applicant.  I
             do not see that I can find that he  does  not  have  "genuine"
             earnings upon which to rely given my primary finding  that  he
             runs  business.  The  fact  he  may  have  under-declared  his
             earnings does not mean that this is  not  a  genuine  business
             enterprise."


   10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge does not  make  express
       reference to the documents that were before him and contained in  the
       respondent's bundle.  The respondent had provided the Tribunal with a
       copy of the first appellant's Tier 1 application and  the  supporting
       documents.   They  were;  The  first  appellant's  Indian   passport,
       Biometric Residence Permit card, payslips from EAT Ltd, payslips from
       Matalan  Ltd,  payslips  from  Vimas  LLP,  letter  from  Mac  &   Co
       Accountants,  and  HSBC  bank  statements.   Also  included  in   the
       respondent's bundle were HMRC documents  and  the  transcript  of  an
       interview completed on 7th April 2014.  The documents from  HMRC  are
       in fact a witness statement signed by HMRC Officer John  Richards  on
       18th  August  2014  providing  information  held  on   HMRC   systems
       concerning  the  first  appellant's  tax  affairs.    Plainly,   that
       statement and the transcript of interview do not  form  part  of  the
       documents submitted by the first appellant at the  time  of,  and  in
       support of his application, but arise from further enquiries made  by
       the respondent, when assessing the application.


The Grounds of appeal


   11. The respondent initially appealed on the sole ground that  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Symes had erred in allowing the appeal  and  remitting
       the matter back to the respondent because of the respondent's failure
       to consider the exercise of discretion under paragraph 322(5) of  the
       rules.  The respondent contended that  the  Tribunal  had  materially
       misdirected itself because paragraph 322(5) was not  referred  to  in
       the respondent's decision and it formed no part of her decision.


   12. At the outset of the hearing before me, Ms Broklesby-Weller  made  an
       application to amend the grounds of appeal to  raise  another  ground
       that is inextricably linked to  the  ground  already  advanced.   The
       respondent avers that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  reached  his
       decision to allow the appeal and to remit  the  matter  back  to  the
       respondent for her  to  consider  whether  she  should  exercise  her
       discretion under paragraph 322(5), by  reference  to  amended  profit
       figures provided by Shah Consultancy Accountants in March 2015.   The
       respondent avers that s85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
       Act 2002 operates such that the Tribunal should only have  considered
       the evidence produced by the first appellant that  was  submitted  in
       support of, and at the time of making the application  to  which  the
       immigration decision related. She  submits  that  s85A  of  the  2002
       operates such that documents that were not sent with, or  in  support
       of the application, cannot be relied upon  in  an  appeal  against  a
       decision from an  application  considered  under  the  'Points  Based
       System' save as set out in the Act.  The respondent  avers  that  the
       amended profit figures provided by Shah  Consultancy  Accountants  in
       March 2015 were not adduced to prove that a document  is  genuine  or
       valid under s85A(4)(c) of the 2002  Act,  but  was  were  adduced  as
       evidence of the first appellant's earnings.


   13. Mr Balroop objected to the amendment to the  grounds  of  appeal  and
       submitted that in  any  event,  the  documents  relied  upon  by  the
       appellant were documents that were used to prove that a  document  is
       genuine or valid and it was therefore  open  to  the  Judge  to  have
       regard to the letter from Shah Consultancy Accountants,  in  reaching
       his decision.  The hearing was adjourned for a short  time  to  allow
       the parties and me, to reflect upon the provisions  of  s85A  of  the
       2002 Act, and to ensure that we each  had  a  copy  of  the  relevant
       provisions before us.  When we returned, I drew the parties attention
       to the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Ahmed  &  Subedi  -v-  SSHD
       [2014] UKUT 00365 (IAC), that I considered may be of some relevance.


   14. I remind myself that once permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
       has been granted, the grounds upon which  such  permission  has  been
       granted may be amended with the  permission  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
       (rule 5(3)(c)) of the Upper  Tribunal  Rules).   Mr  Balroop  had  an
       opportunity of considering the provisions of s85A  and  was  able  to
       deal with the additional matter raised  by  the  respondent.   Having
       regard to the over-riding  objective  set  out  in  rule  2,  and  in
       particular the need  to  deal  with  cases  fairly  and  justly,  and
       avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility, I granted the
       respondent permission to amend the grounds.


The hearing before me


   15.  Ms  Broklesby-Weller  adopted  the  matters  are  set  out  in   the
       respondents application to amend the ground of appeal.   She  submits
       that the judge reached his decision by reference to new material that
       was not relied upon by  the  first  appellant  at  the  time  of  his
       application.   The respondent had set out in her  decision  that  the
       evidence relied upon by the first appellant as to his  earnings,  was
       not credible.   She submits that the assessment by the  judge  should
       have been confined to the evidence that was  before  the  respondent.
       The respondent did not contend in her decision that the  letter  from
       Mac & Co Accountants was not genuine.   The  respondent  refused  the
       application because enquiries made by the  respondent  revealed  that
       the earning figures previously relied upon  by  the  first  appellant
       were inconsistent with records held by HMRC, and so no  weight  could
       be attached to the earnings set out in  the  letter  from  Mac  &  Co
       Accountants.  She submits that the Judge based his decision  upon  an
       Accountants letter that plainly post-dates the application, and which
       seeks to correct matters.  She submits that that is not evidence that
       was adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid.


   16. In reply, Mr Balroop submits that the evidence that was  produced  by
       the appellants at the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
       simply  evidence  to  establish  that  the  letter  from  Mac  &   Co
       Accountants was genuine or valid.  He submits that the appellant  had
       established before the First-tier Tribunal that the first appellant's
       earnings are from genuine employment taking into account the  factors
       identified in Paragraph 19(j)(i) - (ix) of Appendix  A.   He  submits
       that in any event, under paragraph 19(k) of Appendix A, it  was  open
       to the respondent to request additional information  to  explain  any
       discrepancy, but the respondent had failed to give the appellants any
       opportunity to provide an explanation.


DISCUSSION


   17. Section 85(4) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  provides
       that on an appeal, the  Tribunal  may  consider  evidence  about  any
       matter which it thinks relevant to the  substance  of  the  decision,
       including evidence which concerns a matter arising after the date  of
       the decision, but that is  subject  to  the  exceptions  set  out  in
       section 85A. Of these, only  Exception  2  is  relevant  for  present
       purposes. It is contained in subsections (3) and (4),  which  provide
       as follows: ?


              "(3) Exception 2 applies to an appeal under section 82(1) if-


                        (b)    the   immigration   decision   concerned   an
                  application of a kind identified in immigration  rules  as
                  requiring to be considered under a "Points Based  System",
                  and ?


                  (c)   the  appeal  relies  wholly  or  partly  on  grounds
                  specified in section 84(1)(a), (e) or (f). ?


             (4) Where  Exception  2  applies  the  Tribunal  may  consider
             evidence adduced by the appellant only if it-


                       (a)  was submitted in support of, and at the time  of
                  making, the application to which the immigration  decision
                  related, ?


                  ....


                  (c)  is adduced to prove that a  document  is  genuine  or
                     valid, or


                  ...


   18. The first appellant made his application for leave to remain  in  the
       UK as Tier 1 (General) Migrant under the  'Points  Based  System"  on
       27th February 2014.  The Judge notes in his decision,  at  paragraphs
       [4] and [5], the evidence that was before  him.   Importantly  in  my
       judgment, the Judge records at paragraph [4]:


             "...Having seen the Home Office criticism of his  earnings  he
             had now investigated previous years' tax returns which he  now
             appreciated had been completed on an inaccurate basis but  his
             former accountants..."


     The Judge goes on to record at paragraph [5]:


             "Supporting documents included numerous  invoices  from  March
             2013 to February 2014 from the Appellant to various customers;
             a letter from Shah Consultancy,  Accountants,  of  March  2015
             saying that tax returns had been submitted for previous  years
             and one would be provided for the year  ending  5  April  2015
             soon: he had told them that his previous accountants had  made
             errors in the submission of his  documents;  letters  from  JP
             Consultants to UKBA of April 2011 recording a  net  profit  of
             ï¿½30,661; a complaint to ACGA of March 2015 from the  Appellant
             in relation to  JP  Consultants;  a  letter  from  Shree  Hari
             Infrastructure of  Anand,  India,  wrote  that  the  Appellant
             referred them customers for property investments but  none  of
             the deals were finalised in the years 2011-2013; and  numerous
             plans of properties.


   19. I have set out at paragraph [10] of this decision, the evidence  that
       was provided by the first appellant at the time of, and in support of
       his application.  The evidence that is referred to by  the  Judge  in
       paragraph [5] of his decision, is evidence that the  appellants'  had
       adduced at the hearing of the appeal.  It was not evidence  that  the
       appellants had provided at the time  of,  and  in  support  of  their
       applications to the respondent.  That applies not only to the  letter
       from Shah Consultancy Accountants, but also  to  the  other  evidence
       such as the invoices from March 2013 to February 2014 from the  first
       appellant to  various  customers  and  the  letter  from  Shree  Hari
       Infrastructure, Anand, India.


   20. The narrow issue in the appeal now before me is  whether  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to have regard to that new  material
       that was adduced before the First-tier Tribunal,  but  had  not  been
       provided by the appellants at the time of their application,  or  any
       time before the decision of the respondent.


   21. In my judgment, the clear policy underlying sections 85  and  85A  of
       the 2002 Act is that the Tribunal should be able to consider a  broad
       range of evidence in  relation  to  appeals  generally,  but  a  more
       limited range of evidence in relation to  appeals  against  decisions
       which have to be considered under the Points Based system.


   22. In Ahmed & Subedi -v- SSHD [2014] UKUT 00365 (IAC),the Upper Tribunal
       considered s85A(3) and (4) of the 2002 Act and held;


             "5.  The purpose of that provision is quite  clear.     It  is
             that where a Points Based application is made and refused, the
             assessment by the Judge is to be  of  the  material  that  was
             before the decision-maker rather than a new  consideration  of
             new material. In other words the appeal if it  is  successful,
             is on the basis that  the  decision-maker  with  the  material
             before him should have made a different decision, not  on  the
             basis that a different way of presenting the application would
             have produced a different decision."


   23. The appellants' bundle before the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained  a
       number of material documents.  Those documents were  not  before  the
       respondent at the  time  of  her  decision.   The  letter  from  Shah
       Consultancy Accountant's clearly post-dates the application  and  was
       obtained by the first appellant after he had seen the criticisms made
       by the respondent in her decision.  I reject the submission that  the
       letter from the Shah Consultancy Accountants  was  adduced  to  prove
       that a document is genuine or valid.  There was  no  question  before
       the First-tier Tribunal that the letter from  Mac  &  Co  Accountants
       previously relied upon by the first appellant, was genuine or  valid.
       The issue was the weight that could be attached to its content, given
       the outcome of enquiries made by the respondent  with  HMRC.   Having
       been alerted by the respondent in her decision that  the  information
       previously provided by the first appellant was inconsistent with  the
       records held by HMRC, the first appellant appears  to  have  accepted
       that the previous  years  tax  returns,  had  been  completed  on  an
       inaccurate basis.   The  correction  of  the  first  appellant's  tax
       affairs is a matter that has  occurred  since  the  decision  of  the
       respondent.  The appellant's tax affairs aside, the  Judge  also  had
       regard to supporting documents including numerous invoices from March
       2013 to February 2014 from the first appellant to various  customers,
       and a letter from Shree Hari Infrastructure  of  Anand,  India,  that
       again, were not before the respondent at the time of her decision.


   24. In my judgment, it is clear  from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge that in reaching his decision that the first appellant
       has consistently been working in the UK, including on a self-employed
       basis running  his  own  business,  and  that  the  earnings  of  the
       appellant from self-employment  were  from  genuine  employment,  the
       Judge took into account material other than that which was  submitted
       in support of the application and was before the decision maker.   In
       short,  the  Judge  reached  his  decision  based  upon  a  different
       presentation of the application.  That presentation being based  upon
       material that was not before  the  respondent  at  the  time  of  her
       decision, and had not been adduced  to  prove  that  a  document  was
       genuine or valid.


   25. I reject the submission made on behalf of the  first  appellant  that
       the respondent had failed to give the appellant's any opportunity  to
       provide an explanation for the  inconsistencies  in  the  information
       about the first appellant's earnings from self-employment.  Paragraph
       19(i) of Appendix A makes it plain that the Secretary of  State  must
       be satisfied that the earnings are from  genuine  employment.   Under
       the provisions of paragraph 19(k), to  support  the  assessment,  the
       respondent may request additional information and evidence.  The onus
       of satisfying the respondent that the requirements under  the  points
       based system are met rests upon an applicant.  There is no  mandatory
       requirement to request additional information  and  in  my  judgment,
       having obtained evidence from HMRC that established  that  the  first
       appellant had in previous years earned significantly less than he had
       previously claimed to, it was  open  to  the  respondent  to  make  a
       decision upon the application.


   26. It follows that in  my  judgment,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal discloses a material error of law and the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


The decision Remade


   27. Given the approach that is  mapped  above,  there  can  only  be  one
       decision.   Absent the new material  that  was  relied  upon  by  the
       appellants before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  decisions  of  the
       respondent of 2nd September 2014 are unassailable.  The decisions are
       therefore remade by dismissing the appeals.

   28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


   29. The decision is remade and  the  appeals  of  the  first  and  second
       appellants are dismissed.


   30. No anonymity direction is applied for and none is made.
