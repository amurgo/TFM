                             DECISION & REASONS
                   ______________________________________

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N. Nnamani,  counsel  instructed  by  Howe  &  Co,
                    solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D. Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


1. The Appellant is a national of Turkey, born on 11.6.97.  She  arrived  in
the United Kingdom on 4 February 2014 and  claimed  asylum  on  13  February
2014. Her asylum application was refused on 27 June 2015 and  the  Appellant
appealed against this decision. Since her arrival in the United Kingdom  she
has formed a relationship with MA,  a  British  citizen  of  Turkish/Kurdish
origin. They have two children: I, born on 20 December 2014 and B,  born  on
24 January 2016.

2. Her appeal came before the First tier Tribunal Judge for  hearing  on  21
April 2016. In a decision promulgated on 18 May 2016,  the  Judge  dismissed
the appeal on  asylum  grounds  but  allowed  it  on  human  rights  grounds
(Article 8 outside the Rules). The Respondent sought  permission  to  appeal
on 28 May 2016. The grounds in support of the application asserted that  the
Judge had misdirected himself in law and had given insufficient reasons  (i)
in adopting the wrong approach in assessing the  reasonableness  of  removal
and/or the best interests of the children under section 55; (ii) in  failing
to consider whether the Appellant's partner's withholding of consent to  the
children relocating to Turkey with their mother was reasonable  in  all  the
circumstances, given his finding at [78] that there  are  no  insurmountable
obstacles to the Appellant and the whole family relocating to Turkey.

5. Permission to appeal was granted on 10 June 2016 by First  tier  Tribunal
Judge Holmes on the basis that: "Arguably he failed  to  pose  the  question
whether the partner's stance was a reasonable  one.  Arguably  there  is  no
adequate analysis of s117A-D in the decision  and  the  public  interest  in
removal, or the relevant jurisprudence, so that the approach  taken  appears
to be that the nationality of the children is a trump card."

6. The error of law came before us  for  hearing  on  18  July  2016.  In  a
decision and reasons dated 24 July 2016 we found an error  of  law  for  the
following reasons:

6.1. the First tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  give  proper  or  adequate
reasons to substantiate his decision that: "it would not  be  reasonable  to
expect the child to leave the UK."

6.2. At [82] the Judge recorded the  evidence  of  the  Appellant's  partner
that he would not consent to the children leaving the UK and that  he  would
not return to  live  in  Turkey  with  the  Appellant  and  their  children.
However, there is no analysis  by  the  First  tier  Tribunal  Judge  as  to
whether or not the reasons provided - the obligation to  undertake  military
service, absent any objective evidence - rendered it  unreasonable  for  the
children to leave the UK [77]. This  is  a  particularly  striking  omission
given the clear finding at [78]  that  there  would  not  be  insurmountable
obstacles to the family unit living in Turkey, which the  Judge  did  reason
by reference to the Turkish origins of the Appellant's partner and the  fact
he speaks Turkish; the fact that he has  travelled  to  Turkey  since  being
granted asylum and stated that he would be safe in  the  city  and  that  he
would be able to find employment

6.3. At [83] he made a finding that: "in my opinion it is not enough to  say
that young children  might  readily  adapt  to  life  in  another  country."
However, we find that further reasons were required  in  this  respect  too.
There is  no  reference  to  the  ages  of  the  children  or  any  personal
circumstances  which  might  render  these  particular  children  unable  to
readily adapt to life in Turkey. The  Judge's  generalized  finding  is  not
sufficient;

6.4. Whilst at [84] the Judge makes a finding that it would not  be  in  the
best interests of the children  to  be  separated  from  their  mother,  and
father, given their ages and when considered  as  a  whole,  we  accept  the
submission that, given that the proportionality exercise was conducted  with
reference to section 117 of the NIAA 2002, it was incumbent upon  the  Judge
to consider the public interest factors at sections 117B(2)  and  (3)  which
he failed to do.

Hearing

7. The Appellant confirmed her statement  at  page  9  of  her  bundle.  She
stated that she lived at her home address with  her  partner  and  children,
who are now 10 months and 23 months of age. She stated that  she  took  both
children to play group once a week and on another day in the week she  takes
English language lessons and they accompany her and play there.  She  stated
that her partner works in a pizza shop.

8. On cross-examination, she did not know how much her partner earned  in  a
year. She confirmed that she and her partner share  responsibility  for  the
children. She confirmed that she met her partner in 2014 through her  cousin
M and that her partner  knew  that  she  did  not  have  immigration  status
because she had only recently  arrived  in  the  country.  She  stated  that
whilst she and her partner do not have  a  legal  marriage  they  have  been
married in a religious ceremony. She said that of course they would like  to
marry legally but were not in a position to at the moment because  they  had
been asked for her passport. The Appellant was  asked  whether  her  partner
visits Turkey and she responded that this was very rarely -  now  and  again
for a couple of  weeks.  He  last  visited  Turkey  in  February  2016.  She
confirmed that in his witness statement her  partner  refers  to  not  being
able to go to live in Turkey due to the  fact  that  he  has  not  completed
military service and that when her case was heard previously the  Judge  did
not accept this due to an absence of evidence.  She  said  that  she  speaks
both Turkish and Kurdish with her partner.

9. In terms of relatives in Turkey she said that she has her parents and no-
one else and that MA has his parents and three sisters. She said  that  they
had not discussed going to Turkey  and  making  an  application  from  there
because she is unable to go to Turkey: she has two children  in  the  United
Kingdom and MA will not let her go iwith their two children to  Turkey.  She
said that she cannot leave her children here and go  to  Turkey;  that  they
have set up their family here and MA has his life and routine set  up  here;
the children and MA have citizenship here and  without  his  permission  she
cannot take the children and go to  Turkey  and  make  an  application  from
there.

10. She said that MA will not allow her to  take  the  children  because  he
does not want them to go there. The Appellant reiterated that  her  daughter
is only ten months old and that she could not leave the  children  here  and
go; that no mother in her position would leave  her  children  and  go.  The
Appellant said that in February this year, MA took their eldest daughter  to
Turkey and his parents have only seen her. When asked why she could not  use
the opportunity of going to Turkey to make an application for  the  children
to spend time with their grandparents, the Appellant stated that  she  could
not go to Turkey and MA does not want to go to Turkey. She stated  that  she
came to the United Kingdom to seek asylum and that she has had two  children
here. There are reasons she does not want to go to Turkey  and  her  partner
does not want her to go. She said that if she took her children and went  to
Turkey she does not know how long it is going to take and MA has  a  job  in
the United Kingdom. If she goes to Turkey to make  an  application  then  MA
will end up going along with her too as he will not want to be  without  his
children. He would not be able to visit his children. She said that she  had
not investigated making an application from Turkey.

11. When asked why  MA  could  not  visit  her  there  whilst  she  made  an
application for entry clearance, she said this was because he could  explain
he has the problem with military service and he came to this country  having
been through a very difficult time and that when he last visited  Turkey  he
did not go on holiday but because he had  to,  he  was  forced  to  go.  The
Appellant stated that if she went to Turkey she would  have  to  go  to  the
city and could not stay in her village.  In  respect  of  her  partner,  the
Appellant said that it was different going to Turkey for two  weeks  but  if
she took the children and went he would have to constantly have one  leg  in
Turkey and he could face a lot of difficulty  over  there.  Owing  to  these
problems he does not want to go to Turkey.

12. Upon re-examination, the Appellant stated that MA had been forced to  go
to Turkey in February 2016 because his mother had to have an  operation  and
he wanted to be with his  mother.  In  terms  of  relatives  in  the  United
Kingdom, the Appellant stated that she  has  one  brother  here,  with  five
years leave and there is another brother but she did not know his status  or
where he is.

13. In response to questions from the panel, the Appellant stated  that  she
did not see MA between 2005 when he left  Turkey  and  her  arrival  in  the
United Kingdom in 2014 and that they had met  only  when  she  came  to  the
United Kingdom. She stated that she had arrived in this country in  February
2014 and at the time when she arrived she was staying at her auntie's  son's
house and when she was there MA visited there a few times and that  was  how
they met and a few months later they were together. When it was put  to  her
that the timeframe in respect of meeting and the  birth  of  her  child  was
rather tight the Appellant stated that she had arrived in February  and  her
daughter was born in December. She said that she got pregnant straight  away
and they had the religious ceremony and that they had actually  commenced  a
physical relationship at the end of February/beginning of March 2014.

14. In respect of her cousin M, with whom she stayed  when  she  arrived  in
the United Kingdom, the Appellant confirmed that he has  the  same  name  as
her husband and that he is the son of her mother's  sister.  In  respect  of
her partner, MA, she said that their  mothers  are  cousins.  The  Appellant
stated that she had been in touch with her cousin, M,  before  she  came  to
the United Kingdom when he visited Turkey.  She  stated  that  she  has  two
brothers in the United Kingdom and many cousins here, not only  M  and  that
when she came to this country he was the one who came to my mind and  that's
who she contacted. She agreed that he was also a cousin of her partner,  MA,
but she did not think of it at the time. She said that they did not  have  a
plan to have a relationship before she arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  and
that she and her partner had met at her cousin, M's house because  they  are
related. She said that it just happened that they fell in love and  she  got
pregnant.

15. The Appellant's  partner,  MA  then  gave  evidence  and  confirmed  the
contents of his statement. He is now 27 years of age and came to the  United
Kingdom in 2005 aged 15. He said that the reason he  came  is  that  he  had
political problems in Turkey and escaped  from  them.  In  terms  of  family
members in the United Kingdom he said he had a brother and cousins and  that
his brother had been granted asylum at the end of 2015 or January 2016.
The witness confirmed that he went to Turkey in February  2016  because  his
mother needed an operation and he felt like he needed to  be  there  and  he
went for 2 weeks. He has his parents and three sisters in  Turkey  and  they
are in Gaziantep city centre. He said he could not  go  to  live  in  Turkey
because he has a life here: he came when he was really young and  has  lived
here for 11 years now; he has two little  daughters  who  are  British;  his
partner has problems and if he tried to live there he is sure he  will  have
problems, because he had political problems before  and  his  family  always
has problems as well. The witness stated  that  Turkey  is  in  a  very  bad
situation now and the authorities were even arresting MPs.

16. In response to a question  from  the  panel,  as  to  his  own  family's
position he replied that when you are Kurdish in Turkey they treat you  like
you are a terrorist and he did not want to be like that. He  said  that  his
children do not have Turkish citizenship and that  he  would  be  unable  to
work as he does not have any qualifications. The  witness  was  asked  about
military service and he said that he would have to do this  if  he  went  to
Turkey to live and he did not want to do it because he was  afraid  for  his
life. He said that he had not worked  in  Turkey  and  that  in  the  United
Kingdom he worked as a chef in a pizza takeaway and had  had  this  job  for
about 3 years. He said that before that he  was  director  for  a  different
shop/takeaway and he had his own business before that as well.

17. In cross examination, he was asked about  his  work  and  said  that  he
earned approximately �10,000 a year before tax. The witness  made  reference
to his wage slips produced in the  bundle  and  which  show  that  he  earns
�774.13 or thereabouts monthly. The witness stated  that  if  the  Appellant
loses this appeal and has to return to Turkey the children would  stay  with
him. He confirmed that he visited Turkey with his daughter and that  he  had
also visited in 2011 and 2013 for a couple of weeks  on  each  occasion.  He
said that he had not had problems in Turkey when he visited. When  asked  if
he had discussed his partner making  an  entry  clearance  application  from
Turkey he said that he had asked his friends who told him that he needed  to
earn money and have a house [which we understood to mean that he  needed  to
fulfil the maintenance and accommodation  requirements  of  the  Immigration
Rules].  He said that there were no employment opportunities in  Turkey.  He
confirmed that he was aware of his partner's immigration  status  when  they
formed their relationship.

18. He said that the fact that he had not undertaken  military  service  had
not been a problem when he visited Turkey because this had not been  checked
at the airport but when he applied for a job they would see that he had  not
done it. It would not prevent him from  visiting  Turkey.  The  witness  was
asked why he had no evidence to support this assertion and he said  that  he
came to the United Kingdom very young  before  he  was  liable  to  military
service [20 years old] and he did not have any  papers  although  maybe  his
family has these. He said that he has never stayed for long  in  Turkey.  He
said that he worked 27 or 28 hours a week and accepted that he could take  a
second job to have more of  an  income  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
Immigration Rules. When asked why he could not do that  whilst  his  partner
goes to Turkey with the children  he  said  that  he  did  not  want  to  be
separated from his children and from his partner.  In  terms  of  visits  to
Turkey and problems he and the family might have he stated  that  he  stayed
in his sister's house in the city centre and his parents came  to  the  city
and met him there because it was not possible to go to his parents'  village
and his parents were not able to go out of the house.

19. In response to a question from the panel as to why this was the  witness
stated that there are problems between the Kurdish side and the  other  side
and the police have to control the situation. He  stated  that  his  partner
would not be able to stay with his sister in the  sister  and  that  he  had
asked her. The witness reiterated that  he  cannot  be  separated  from  his
children and that they do not have Turkish citizenship.

20. Upon re-examination, the witness confirmed that he would not  allow  his
partner to take the children outside the United Kingdom  because  he  cannot
be
separated from his children and  he  did  not  want  them  to  go  to  other
countries. He said he would not want to keep  the  children  in  the  United
Kingdom whilst she  returned  to  Turkey  because  the  children  cannot  be
without their mother.

21. In response to questions from the panel,  the  witness  was  asked  why,
since he had taken his oldest child to Turkey, his partner  could  not  take
the children to which he responded that his mother was having  an  operation
and he was not intending to go to Turkey again for a long time because  when
he is there he does not feel safe and he feels  afraid  all  the  time.  The
witness was asked about the basis of his asylum claim and he responded  that
he had a political problem and had been arrested and  that  his  family  had
problems. He was a supporter of the BDP political  organization,  which  was
always being closed down. He stated that he had visited in 2011 and 2013  in
order to see his family and he had stayed in Gaziantep city centre  and  had
stayed 3-4 weeks each time. He stated that his family had received  call  up
papers for him but that he had not attempted to defer his  military  service
via the Turkish Embassy in London. When asked how he had come  to  meet  his
partner in the United Kingdom he said that he has a cousin and  he  did  not
know his partner was going to be there when he visited him. When  asked  why
he only began cohabiting permanently with his partner in June 2015  he  said
that prior to that she was with her cousin and he was taking  responsibility
for her.

22. Mr Clarke then made submissions on behalf of the Home Office. He  handed
up copies of the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in  Jeunesse  v.
The Netherlands (App no. 12738/10) and  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and sought  to  rely  upon
the refusal decision of 27 August 2015. He submitted  that  there  were  two
possible routes under the Immigration Rules viz parent and partner  but  the
Appellant could not succeed under either pathway: in terms  of  the  partner
route GEN 1.2 (iv) provides  that  the  couple  have  to  have  been  living
together for 2 years prior to  the  application  but  they  have  only  been
living together since June 2015. In terms of the parent route, R-LTRPT  1.1.
requires the Appellant to meet some alternatives, either all of the  section
or LTRPT 2.2-.2.4 and EX1. The evidence today  was  that  the  couple  share
responsibility for the children and so the Appellant  cannot  qualify  as  a
parent under the Rules. Ms Nnamani accepted  the  Appellant  cannot  qualify
under the Rules because of those provisions.

23. In respect of whether there  were  compelling  circumstances  justifying
consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules, Mr Clarke  made  reference  to
Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) &  Ors  [2015]  EWCA
Civ 387 at 39 (i) and (iv) and submitted that the Appellant  has  a  choice.
He submitted that the Appellant had presented the  Respondent  with  a  fait
accompli and that the Appellant had  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  with  a
spurious claim cf. Jeunesse  v.  The  Netherlands  (App  no.  12738/10).  He
submitted that in light of the ages of the children and the time  period  it
is a weighty factor to be taken into account. The Appellant and her  partner
entered into the relationship in full knowledge of  her  immigration  status
and then had children. He submitted  that  the  Appellant  would  have  been
aware that her claim was a  sham  claim  and  it  was  a  clear  attempt  to
circumvent the Rules. He  relied  upon  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [44]  and  that  it  is
quite clear when considering a claim outside the Rules that it is  necessary
to look through the prism of the Rules. He submitted that the Appellant  was
precluded from relying on EX1 of the Rules for the reasons he had given  and
that the scales weigh against the Appellant.

24. We then heard submissions on behalf of the Appellant  from  Ms  Nnamani,
who reminded us that we were considering  a  case  involving  a  very  young
couple and two small children and it was necessary to consider their  rights
and interests carefully. She submitted that it was  not  in  the  children's
best interests to go to Turkey and that going back for a 2  week  period  is
very  different  from  relocating  to  that   country   and   living   there
permanently, bearing in mind their Kurdish ethnicity.   In  respect  of  the
proportionality, she submitted  that  there  was  the  practical  aspect  of
either the  Appellant  taking  the  children  to  make  an  entry  clearance
application or leaving the children with their father.  She  submitted  that
it was in the children's best interests to be with  both  parents  and  that
the children were used to seeing their father on a daily basis  and  growing
up with him. They would not succeed in an entry clearance  application.  Her
partner would have to get an additional job and keep  it  for  a  period  of
time and  it  may  not  be  a  straightforward  application  and  would  not
necessarily be dealt with quickly thus  there  would  be  a  lengthy  period
whilst the children would be stuck with their  mother  in  Turkey  for  more
than a 1 year. She accepted that the Appellant's partner  could  visit  them
but this would be limited given he would be trying to earn money to  support
the entry clearance application.

25.. Ms Nnamani submitted that  the  period  of  separation  would  have  an
impact on MA's family life with his children. Her  attention  was  drawn  to
Jeunesse v. The Netherlands at [114] and [108] and the fact that  the  well-
established caselaw shows the need to  show  exceptional  circumstances.  Ms
Nnamani drew the panel's attention to the fact that  the  Appellant  was  17
when she started the relationship and she had been na�ve in not taking  into
account the fact that she might not be  allowed  to  stay  in  the  UK.  She
invited the panel not to  place  weight  on  Jeunesse  v.  The  Netherlands.
Whilst the family were created at a time when the  Appellant  did  not  have
leave she and her partner were two people who were very young  and  did  not
understand the difficulties  in  the  future.  She  denied  that  there  was
anything nefarious in the Appellant's choice of cousin  with  whom  she  had
stayed because this cousin  had  visited  the  village  most  recently.  The
relationship with her partner then developed  very  quickly  to  the  extent
that they had their first child. She submitted that this did  not  undermine
family life and justify removal of the Appellant. In respect of section  117
of the Nationality,  Immigration  &  Asylum  Act  2002  she  submitted  that
section 117B(6) applied because the children were British and the  Appellant
had attempted to integrate into the community and learn English. In  respect
of financial independence this was not a  case  where  the  Appellant  would
become a burden and the public  interest  would  not  be  affected  by  this
particular family because the father was  financially  taking  care  of  the
family. She submitted that the appeal should be allowed.

Decision

26. Both  parties  agreed  that  the  Appellant  cannot  qualify  under  the
Immigration Rules either as a parent or  as  a  partner.  Consequently,  the
issue  is  whether   there   are   compelling   circumstances   to   justify
consideration of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules  cf.  Secretary  of
State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and  if
so, whether removal of the Appellant to Turkey  would  be  proportionate  in
all the circumstances.

27. There is no definition of compelling circumstances,  but  the  Court  of
Appeal per Lord Justice Richards held as follows:

      "40. ...However, it  remains  possible  to  imagine  cases  where  the
individual  interests at stake are of  a  particularly  pressing  nature  so
that a good claim for  LTE can be established  outside  the  Rules.  In  our
view, the appropriate general     formulation  for  this  category  is  that
such cases  will  arise  where  an  applicant      for  LTE  can  show  that
compelling circumstances exist (which are not       sufficiently  recognised
under the new Rules) to require the grant of such leave.

      41.     This formulation is aligned to that proposed in Nagre at  [29]
in relation      to the general position in respect of  the  new  Rules  for
LTR, which was adopted       in this court in Haleemudeen at [44]. It  is  a
fairly demanding test, reflecting       the reasonable relationship  between
the Rules themselves and the proper     outcome of application of Article  8
in the usual run of cases. But, contrary to  the submission of Mr Payne,  it
is  not  as  demanding  as  the  exceptionality  or        "very  compelling
circumstances" test applicable in the special  contexts    explained  in  MF
(Nigeria) (precariousness of  family  relationship  and      deportation  of
foreigners convicted of serious crime).

28.  We  find   that   there   are   compelling   circumstances   justifying
consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules and that is the fact  that  the
Appellant and her partner have two very  young  British  children,  aged  10
months  and  23  months.  Their  mother  is  unable  to  qualify  under  the
provisions of the Immigration Rules covering partners and parents  and  thus
the circumstances of the children are not sufficiently recognized under  the
Rules and clearly require  consideration,  given  that  we  need  to  decide
whether or not it would be proportionate for the children  to  be  separated
from their mother or whether it would be proportionate for the  children  to
be required to leave the United Kingdom.

29. We find that there is a genuine and subsisting relationship between  the
Appellant and her partner and that family life is established  between  them
and with their children. We accept that the starting point,  in  considering
the best interests of the children, is that it is in  their  best  interests
for them to be brought up by both parents: E-A (Article 8 -  best  interests
of child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 315 (IAC). Both children are British  and  the
starting point is that it is in  their  best  interests  to  remain  in  the
country of their birth.

30. We find that the children are too young to have formed their  own  links
with the United Kingdom or to be able to express a view as  to  where  their
best interests lie cf. ZH (Tanzania) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department [2011] UKSC 4 per Lady Hale, who also  made  clear  at  [31]-[32]
the intrinsic importance of citizenship. Consequently, it  is  necessary  to
focus upon the nature and extent of both the  Appellant  and  her  partner's
links in the UK and Turkey. The Appellant has only resided in the  UK  since
4 February 2014 and her  immigration  status  has  been  precarious  at  all
times. She has two brothers and some cousins in the United Kingdom  but  her
parents remain in Turkey and no evidence was  put  forward  as  to  why  she
would be unable to live with them if she returned to  Turkey.  She  and  her
partner communicate in Turkish and Kurdish and there are  no  linguistic  or
cultural barriers to her residing in Turkey and in light of the findings  by
the First tier  Tribunal  Judge  we  find  she  would  not  be  at  risk  of
persecution if returned to Turkey. The  Appellant's  partner,  however,  has
lived in the United Kingdom for over 11 years since the age of 15 and  is  a
British citizen.  Whilst  he  claimed  that  he  and  his  family  have  had
political problems which caused him to flee from Turkey, he  was  unable  to
give a clear account of his own political involvement,  albeit  at  a  young
age. Moreover, this has not prevented his parents from remaining  in  Turkey
and from the Appellant visiting them in 2011, 2013 and in February 2016.  In
light of that we do not find that he would be  at  risk  of  persecution  by
reason of his past political involvement nor that the fact  he  is  eligible
for compulsory military service is a barrier to  him  returning  to  Turkey.
Consequently, we find that, despite his British  nationality  and  his  long
residence in the United Kingdom, which is less than half his  life  that  he
could reasonably be expected to live in Turkey.

31. It is necessary to balance the best interests of  the  children  against
the public interest in maintaining immigration control. Section 117B of  the
Nationality Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 makes  provision  for  the  public
interest considerations applicable  in  all  Article  8  cases.  Whilst  the
Appellant gave evidence that she is attending English language classes  once
a week she gave evidence through an interpreter and  did  not  claim  to  be
fluent as yet. It is clear from the judgment in  Rhuppiah  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
803 at [61] that ability to speak English is in any event a neutral  factor.
It  is  further  clear  from  [63]  that  "financially  independent"   means
financially independent of others. The evidence before us, which we  accept,
is that the family are  supported  entirely  by  the  Appellant's  partner's
earnings of approximately �10,000 a year. This is beneath the  threshold  of
�18,600 required to sponsor a partner under the Immigration Rules,  however,
we take into account that the family reside in Poole, Dorset where the  cost
of living is cheaper than eg in London and that  the  Appellant's  partner's
income exceeds that of a family dependent upon income support and  that,  as
a British citizen, the Appellant's partner is entitled to claim  family  tax
credit and child benefit on behalf of the children.  Consequently,  we  find
that the requirement of financial independence at section 117B(3) is met.

32. However, little weight can be attached to the private life  between  the
Appellant  and  her  partner  pursuant  to  section  117B(5)   because   the
relationship was established at a  time  when  the  Appellant's  immigration
status was  precarious.  Both  children  are  British  and  thus  qualifying
children therefore section 117B(6)(a) applies given that the  Appellant  has
a genuine and subsisting maternal relationship with them.

33. In Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012]  UKUT
00048 (IAC)  the  UT  sought  clarification  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
position as  to  the  impact  of  Zambrano  on  consideration  of  the  best
interests of a British child in  the  Article  8  assessment.  The  question
posed (paragraph 93 of Sanade) was:
      "Does the respondent agree that in a case where a non-national  parent
           is being removed and claims it is a violation of  that  person's
           human rights to be separated from a child with whom he presently
           enjoys family life as an engaged parent, that a  consequence  of
           the CJEU's judgment is that it is not open to the respondent  to
           submit that  an  interference  can  be  avoided  because  it  is
           reasonable  to  expect  the  child  (and  presumably  any  other
           parent/carer who is not facing deportation/removal) to join  the
           appellant in the country of origin? If not why not?"

The reply from Mr Devereux, assistant director of UKBA and Head of European
Operations Policy, was (paragraph 94 of Sanade):

      "We do accept, however, that in a case where a third country national
           is unable to claim a right to reside on the basis set out above
           it will not logically be possible, when assessing the
           compatibility of their removal or deportation with the ECHR to
           argue that any interference with Article 8 rights could be
           avoided by the family unit moving to a country which is outside
           of the EU".

The UT, at paragraph 95, accepted and agreed with the concession:

      "95. We shall take  this  helpful  submission  into  account  when  we
consider the     application of Article  8  to  each  appellant's  case.  We
agree with it. This means    that where the child or  indeed  the  remaining
spouse is a British citizen  and    therefore  a  citizen  of  the  European
Union, it is not possible to require them to       relocate outside  of  the
European Union or to submit that it would be       reasonable  for  them  to
do so. The  case  serves  to  emphasise  the  importance  of     nationality
already  identified  in  the  decision  of   the   Supreme   Court   in   ZH
(Tanzania). If interference with the family life is to be justified, it  can
      only be on the basis that the conduct of  the  person  to  be  removed
gives rise to    considerations of such weight as to justify separation."

34. In Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  AQ  (Nigeria)  &  Ors
[2015] EWCA Civ  250  the  Court  of  Appeal,  per  Lord  Justice  Pitchford
reviewed  the  post  Zambrano  jurisprudence  in  the   context   of   three
deportation appeals and concluded:

      76.     It was a matter for the domestic court  to  determine  whether
the    mother's  deportation  would  constitute  a  breach   of   the   UK's
obligations      towards the child by  denying  him  the  substance  of  his
right as an EU   citizen (Dereci at paragraph 74 - see paragraph 58  above).
That  determination required an  examination  of  the  practical  effect  of
deportation (Harrison (Jamaica)  at  paragraph  63).  I  accept  Mr  Payne's
submission, which I did not  understand  Mr  Drabble  QC  to  contest,  that
this    question   requires   no   consideration   of   reasonableness    or
proportionality: AQ    bore the burden of establishing on  balance  that  in
practice her  son  would  be     compelled  to  leave  the  EU  if  she  was
deported.

      77.     I agree with Mr Drabble QC that the question  to  be  examined
by the      tribunal was a practical and  not  a  hypothetical  one.  In  my
judgment, this is      the effect of the decisions of the Court  of  Justice
in Dereci and the decision  of      this  court  in  Harrison  (Jamaica).  I
cannot accept the Secretary of State's  position that the tribunal was  only
required to consider the ability of others to      care  for  the  child  in
the UK and was bound to ignore questions such as   whether a  family  member
would be willing to provide  care  or  was  under  any   familial  or  other
responsibility to do so. As the Court of Justice said in  Dereci      it  is
for the domestic court to verify whether state action would deny  the  child
enjoyment of the substance of his rights as a EU citizen. I do not  consider
this  a question for the European Court  and  I  would  decline  to  make  a
reference. In    my view, the domestic tribunal is entitled to       examine
all the circumstances   provided  that  its  focus  is  upon  the  practical
consequences of deportation.

35. The evidence before us is that the Appellant's partner will  not  permit
the children to go to Turkey if the Appellant were to be removed because  he
does not want to be separated from them and he does not want them to  go  to
another country. He further stated that  he  would  not  want  to  keep  the
children in the United Kingdom  whilst  the  Appellant  returned  to  Turkey
because the children cannot be without their mother. He also added that  the
children do not have Turkish citizenship. The issue before us,  however,  is
not what the parties desire,  but  (i)  whether  removal  of  the  Appellant
would, in practical terms, deprive or deny the  children  enjoyment  of  the
substance of their rights as EU  citizens  and  (ii)  whether,  in  all  the
circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the children  to  leave  the
United Kingdom.

36. We find that the children, who are aged just 2 years  of  age  and  just
under one year old, are  too  young  to  be  separated  from  their  mother.
Therefore, they would have to accompany her to Turkey  if  she  were  to  be
removed. As British citizens, this would deprive them of  the  substance  of
their rights as EU citizens, albeit this may only be for  a  limited  period
of time pending the making of an entry clearance application.

37. We have further had regard to the fact that in the recent Supreme  Court
judgment in Hesham Ali (Iraq) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the  Home
Department (Respondent) [2016] UKSC 60 the Court per Lord  Reed,  with  whom
the majority agreed, held:

      34.     It is, however, necessary to bear in  mind  that  whether  the
continuation     of family life in  the  UK  is  uncertain  may  be  a  more
complex question than it     might  appear  at  first  sight.  For  example,
where a person was residing in the      UK unlawfully at the time  when  the
relationship was formed, but would have      been permitted to  reside  here
lawfully if an application were made from     outside  the  UK,  the  latter
point should be taken into  account.  That  example    illustrates  how  the
distinction between settled migrants  and  aliens  residing  in    the  host
country  unlawfully  may  be,  in  some  situations,  of  limited  practical
importance when translated into the context of UK immigration law (see,  for
      example, Chikwamba v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
[2008]      UKHL 40; [2008] 1 WLR 1420).

38. The decision in Chikwamba of course established per Lord Brown at [44]
that: "

      "I  am  far  from  suggesting  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should
routinely apply  this policy in all but exceptional cases. Rather  it  seems
to me that only  comparatively rarely, certainly in family  cases  involving
children, should an    article 8 appeal be dismissed on the  basis  that  it
would be proportionate and   more appropriate for  the  appellant  to  apply
for leave from abroad."

39. The issue of reasonableness was considered by the Court of Appeal in  MA
(Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705:

      "47.     Even where the child's best interests are  to  stay,  it  may
still be not     unreasonable to require  the  child  to  leave.  That  will
depend upon a careful  analysis of the nature and extent  of  the  links  in
the UK and in the country    where it is proposed he should return."

This was in the context of children who qualified under section  117D(b)  by
virtue of having resided in the United Kingdom  for  7  years,  rather  than
British children. However, it remains  necessary  for  us  to  consider  the
issue of reasonableness by virtue of  section  117B(6)(b)  albeit  from  the
perspective of British children.

40. We find in light of the principle established  at  [95]  in  Sanade  and
others (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT  00048  (IAC)
coupled with the judgment of the House of Lords in Chikwamba that  it  would
not be reasonable to  expect  the  children  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom
pursuant to section 117B(6)(b). Consequently, with regard to this  provision
the public interest does not require the Appellant's removal.

41. Mr Clarke sought to rely on the judgment of the  Grand  Chamber  of  the
ECtHR in Jeunesse v. The Netherlands (App no. 12738/10) and  the  fact  that
at [108] the Court held that when family life was  established  "at  a  time
when the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence  of
that family life within the host State would from the outset be  precarious,
it is the Court's well-established case-law that, where this  is  the  case,
it is likely only to be in exceptional circumstances  that  the  removal  of
the non-national family member will constitute a violation  of  Article  8."
However, on the facts the Court  went  on  to  find  that  there  were  such
exceptional circumstances  and  that  removal  of  the  Applicant  from  the
Netherlands would constitute a violation of Article 8 of ECHR.  Relevant  to
their  consideration  is  the  fact  that  all  the  family   members   were
Netherlands  nationals  other  than  the  Applicant  [115];  there  were  no
insurmountable obstacles to the family settling in Suriname although it  was
likely that the applicant and  her  family  would  experience  a  degree  of
hardship if they were forced to do so  and  it  is  necessary  to  take  due
account of the situation of all members of the  family,  as  this  provision
guarantees protection to the whole family [117]; the best interests  of  the
applicant's children must be taken into account in this  balancing  exercise
and whilst alone they cannot be decisive, such interests certainly  must  be
afforded significant  weight  [118]  ;  the  applicant  takes  care  of  the
children on a daily basis and it is obvious that their  interests  are  best
served by not disrupting their present circumstances by a forced  relocation
of their mother from the Netherlands to Suriname or by a rupturing of  their
relationship with her as a result of future separation [119].

42. Whilst the judgment in Jeunesse v. The Netherlands is not on  all  fours
with the  extant  case,  we  are  guided  by  the  factors  that  the  Court
considered relevant. The Appellant is the  primary  carer  of  her  children
given their young ages and the fact that her partner works for  28  hours  a
week. In light of the decision in Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -
Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 00048  (IAC)  that  it  is  not  possible  to
require the British children to relocate outside of the European  Union  and
the fact that we have found that the public  interest  set  out  in  section
117B(6) of the 2002 Act does not require the Appellant's  removal,  we  find
that it would be contrary to the best interests of the Appellant's  children
for the Appellant to be removed to Turkey.

43. The appeal is allowed on the basis that  to  require  the  Appellant  to
leave the United Kingdom would be a disproportionate interference  with  her
right to family life, protected by Article 8 of the ECHR.
