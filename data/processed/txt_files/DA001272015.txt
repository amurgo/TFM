For the Respondent:    Mr. T. Melvin (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) At the hearing in front of me on 23rd March 2017 the Appellant and  the
    Respondent agreed that if I were to conclude that the Appellant was not
    a person whose offending had caused "serious harm" within  the  meaning
    of Rule 398 (c) of the Immigration Rules then he would not be liable to
    deportation and the appeal would succeed. Having heard argument on 23rd
    March 2017 I informed the parties of my conclusion that  the  Appellant
    was not such a person  and  ordered  that  the  deportation  order  and
    liability for deportation notice affecting the Appellant  be  reversed.
    This judgment sets out my reasoning.

The Factual History.

 2) There is no dispute about the facts of this matter and I can  summarise
    the general background  very  briefly.  The  Appellant  is  a  Jamaican
    citizen. He was born on 4th December 1965. He has been  in  the  United
    Kingdom since 1st August 1998 but his presence after 30th December 1999
    appears to have been as an  unlawful  overstayer.  The  papers  contain
    material about the Appellant's family and domestic circumstances but in
    the light of my conclusion about the interpretation of Rule 398 (c)  it
    was not necessary for me to assess the proportionality  of  deportation
    and I need not recite that material here.

 3) The Appellant has been sentenced by Inner London  Crown  Court  on  two
    occasions.
    a)     On 20th December 2011 he received concurrent community orders of
         twenty-four  months   each   coupled   with   Drug   Rehabilitation
         Requirements for two offences committed on 21st April  2011.  Those
         were offences of possessing Class A drugs  (namely  crack  cocaine)
         with intent to supply and possession of cannabis. It  appears  that
         the Appellant was in possession of �1,930 in  cash;  crack  cocaine
         valued at �3,240; and three wraps of herbal cannabis.

 4) On 20th February 2014 the Appellant received  concurrent  sentences  of
    eight months and two months imprisonment for two offences committed  on
    14th August 2013. Those were respectively offences of simple possession
    of crack cocaine and simple possession of cannabis. It appears from the
    judge's sentencing remarks that the Appellant had been charged with the
    offence of possession with intent to supply. He had pleaded  guilty  to
    simple  possession  but  that  plea  had  not  been  accepted  by   the
    Prosecution. There had then been a trial  which  had  resulted  in  the
    Appellant's acquittal on the charges of possession with intent the jury
    having accepted the contention that the Appellant had possession of the
    drugs for his personal use. The Appellant had been remanded in  custody
    awaiting trial and in the light of that the effect of the  sentence  of
    eight months was that the Appellant was released immediately.

 5) On 18th June 2014 the Secretary of  State  served  the  Appellant  with
    notice of his Liability to Deportation. In that notice the Secretary of
    State set out her conclusion that the Appellant's offending had  caused
    serious harm within the meaning of Rule 398 (c).  A  deportation  order
    followed.

The Procedural History.

 6) The appeal against the deportation order has had  a  somewhat  involved
    history.

 7) After a hearing on 21st July 2015  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Oxlade
    dismissed the appeal. Permission to appeal was granted  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Simpson. On  7th  December  2015  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    O'Connor allowed the appeal and set aside the  decision  of  the  First
    Tier Tribunal. He did so having concluded that Judge Oxlade  had  erred
    in law in his  treatment  of  the  issue  of  whether  the  Appellant's
    offending had caused serious harm. The First Tier Tribunal decision was
    set  aside  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Connor  directed  that   the
    "consideration of the Article 8 grounds, and  in  particular  paragraph
    398 of the Immigration Rules"  be  undertaken  de  novo  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 8) That reconsideration took place  before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Mandalia at a hearing in February 2016 with the Deputy Judge's decision
    being promulgated on 12th July 2016. The  Deputy  Judge  dismissed  the
    appeal. Unfortunately, he fell into error because he failed to  address
    the  question  of  whether  the  Secretary  of  State  was  correct  in
    concluding that the Appellant's offending had caused  serious  harm  or
    rather he approached the case on the  footing  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's expression of her view was conclusive as to this aspect of  the
    case

 9) The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal with  the  permission  of
    the President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and  Asylum  Chamber).
    On 5th December 2016 with the consent  of  the  parties  the  Court  of
    Appeal allowed the appeal and directed that the matter be  reconsidered
    by the Upper Tribunal. The order of the Court  of  Appeal  recited  the
    parties' agreement that the appeal be remitted to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    for "a substantive determination of the appeal in relation to paragraph
    398 of the Immigration Rules and the Appellant's reliance on Article  8
    grounds." As a consequence the matter came  before  me  on  23rd  March
    2017.

The Applicable Test.

10) The starting point is the wording of paragraph 398 of  the  Immigration
    Rules. In particular the  question  to  be  addressed  is  whether  the
    Appellant falls within the scope of paragraph 398 (c)  on  the  footing
    that "in the view of the Secretary of State [his] offending has  caused
    serious harm". I have already explained that it was common ground  that
    if the Appellant did not fall within the scope of that paragraph he was
    not, in his particular circumstances, liable  to  deportation  and  his
    appeal must succeed. It was also common ground that  if  the  Appellant
    did fall within the scope of that paragraph consideration would need to
    be given to his assertion of family life and private life  rights  such
    that deportation would be a disproportionate  interference  with  those
    rights.

11) It was also common ground between the parties that the error into which
    Deputy Judge Mandalia had fallen was that of proceeding  on  the  basis
    that the Tribunal could not go behind the  Secretary  of  State's  view
    that the Appellant's offending had caused serious harm.

12) What I must do is consider what is  meant  by  "offending  [which]  has
    caused  serious  harm"  and  then  consider  whether  the   Appellant's
    offending could properly be found to have been such offending.

13) The term "offending [which] has caused serious harm" is not defined  in
    the Immigration Rules. Neither Mr. Seelhoff for the Appellant  nor  Mr.
    Melvin for the Secretary of State sought to put before me any authority
    addressing the meaning of these words.

14) Mr. Seelhoff for the Appellant relied on the contentions  made  in  his
    skeleton argument dated 28th January 2016. The passage relevant to  the
    meaning of "offending [which] has  caused  serious  harm"  is  that  at
    paragraph 17. There Mr. Seelhoff said that something more than  "simple
    harm" was needed. He said that the matter must be assessed in the round
    taking account of  the  circumstances  of  the  specific  offence;  the
    particular harm caused by the offence; the number and type of offences;
    the length of any custodial sentence or sentences; and  any  particular
    reason for a longer or shorter sentence than might have  been  expected
    having been imposed.

15) For the Secretary of State Mr. Melvin relied strongly on the  Secretary
    of State's published guidance to her staff. I was provided with a  copy
    of  the  guidance  published  on  22nd  February  2017  in  respect  of
    "Criminality: Article 8 ECHR cases".  Although  published  in  February
    2017 it is apparent that this is,  at  least  in  part  a  revision  of
    guidance published previously.

16) The relevant part of the guidance appears at page 7 which  recites  the
    definition  of  foreign  criminal  from  Section  117D   (2)   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act 2002 and which  then  purports
    to define serious harm saying:
         'It is at the discretion of the  Secretary  of  State  whether  she
         considers an offence to have caused serious harm.
         An offence that has caused "serious harm" means an offence that has
         caused serious physical  or  psychological  harm  to  a  victim  or
         victims or that has contributed to a widespread problem that causes
         serious harm to a community or to society in general.
         The foreign criminal does  not  have  to  have  been  convicted  in
         relation to any serious harm which followed from their offence. For
         example, they may fit within this provision if they  are  convicted
         of a lesser offence because it cannot be proved  beyond  reasonable
         doubt that they were guilty of a separate offence  in  relation  to
         the serious harm which resulted from their actions.
         Where a person has been convicted of one or more violent, drugs, or
         sex offences they will usually be considered to have been convicted
         of an offence that has caused serious harm.'

17) Mr. Melvin pressed me to regard this guidance as conclusive as  to  the
    meaning of the Rule. He contended that it set out a definition which  I
    should  assume  had  been  the  result   of   expert   assessment   and
    consideration.  Mr. Seelhoff was critical of the guidance.  He  pointed
    out that it had not been laid before Parliament and he  invited  me  to
    take account of the approach laid down by the Supreme Court in R (Alvi)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC  33  [2012]  1
    WLR 2208. Addressing an  earlier  iteration  of  the  guidance  in  his
    skeleton  argument  Mr.  Seelhoff  contended  that  the  guidance   was
    "fundamentally flawed and incompatible with the  law".  Before  me  Mr.
    Seelhoff's stance was that little, if any, weight should be attached to
    the guidance.

18) I have decided that I should  not  follow  either  of  these  radically
    opposed approaches to the guidance.  In  Alvi  the  Supreme  Court  was
    dealing with a rather different situation.  Their  lordships  expressly
    envisaged it being legitimate and  appropriate  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to issue guidance. What is not permissible is for there to be  an
    attempt to impose additional requirements over and above those provided
    for in the Immigration Rules without the same having been  laid  before
    Parliament. The guidance here sets out the view  of  the  Secretary  of
    State as to the interpretation of  Rule  398  (c).  It  is  a  reasoned
    document which gives every appearance  of  having  been  the  fruit  of
    careful consideration. In those circumstances it is not appropriate for
    me simply to disregard it as Mr. Seelhoff came close  to  suggesting  I
    should do. However, Mr. Melvin goes very substantially too far when  he
    invited me to regard it as conclusive. For me to do that  would  be  to
    fall into the same error as Deputy  Judge  Mandalia.  The  position  is
    governed by the Immigration Rules and I must consider  the  meaning  of
    the provision in the Rules. The view of the Secretary of  State  cannot
    be determinative of that meaning whether that view is expressed in  the
    form of general guidance or in the form of a decision in  a  particular
    case. Nonetheless, the guidance is relevant when  considering  what  is
    meant by "offending [which] has caused serious harm. This is  not  just
    because the guidance is the product of careful consideration  but  also
    because the Immigration Rules provide that it is the Secretary of State
    who is to be the  decision  maker  on  this  issue.  The  guidance  is,
    accordingly, the considered view on definition of  the  person  charged
    under the Rules with determining the application of that definition.

19) The effect of this is that I must  assess  the  meaning  of  "offending
    [which] has caused serious harm" as a matter of  principle  considering
    the language used and the context in which it is used together with the
    purpose of the provision. In doing  so  I  will  take  account  of  the
    Secretary of State's guidance as being the result of careful reflection
    and consideration by the  appropriate  decision  maker  and,  as  such,
    carrying   considerable   persuasive   weight   in   respect   of   the
    interpretation of this term but not as being conclusive in that regard.

20) In  considering  the  meaning  of  this  term  its  context  is  highly
    significant. The relevant part of the Immigration Rules is  considering
    the circumstances in which a foreign criminal  will  be  liable  to  be
    deported. The Rules provide separately for the deportation of those who
    have received sentences of imprisonment of more than four years and  of
    between one and four years. They  also  provide  separately  for  those
    persons who are "persistent" offenders showing "a particular  disregard
    for the law". The consequence is that those who fall to  be  considered
    as offenders whose offending has caused serious harm are those who  are
    not persistent offenders and who have not been sentenced  to  a  prison
    sentence of at least one year or more. The  Rules  envisage  that  such
    persons can nonetheless be offenders whose offending has caused serious
    harm. In considering the context it is important to remember  that  the
    provisions govern the deportation  of  those  lawfully  in  the  United
    Kingdom. In the current case the Appellant appears to  be  an  unlawful
    overstayer but there are other mechanisms in place  for  removing  such
    persons. The deportation provisions apply to those  lawfully  here  and
    are to be interpreted in that context.

21) In that context I have concluded that "serious harm" must  require  the
    presence of some harm over and above the fact that  a  crime  has  been
    committed. There must moreover be a level of seriousness such  that  it
    is prima facie appropriate as being conducive to the public good and in
    the public interest for a person lawfully here to be required to  leave
    the United Kingdom by reason of that offending. A level of  seriousness
    is  required  viewing  the  offending  objectively  but  it  is  to  be
    remembered that it is not necessary for the harm to be of  the  gravest
    type nor even very serious (an aspect which is apparent from  the  fact
    that this provision applies to those  who  will  have  received  prison
    sentences of less than one year and to those whose offending  will  not
    have resulted in a prison sentence).

22) If that is correct as a definition of what is  required  for  there  to
    have been serious harm then there will need to be consideration of  the
    particular offending and of the harm actually resulting  from  it.  The
    variety of offences and the differing degrees of harm which can  result
    from apparently similar offending mean that attention must be  paid  to
    the particular circumstances and consequences of the  actual  offending
    of the person whose case is being considered.

23) In  considering  whether  the  offending  of  a  particular  person  is
    "offending [which] has caused serious harm" the Secretary of State will
    need to consider:
      a) The offending as a whole. This will involve  consideration  of  the
         length of time over which the offending has occurred and the nature
         of the particular offences.
      b) The effect of the offending as a whole on  the  actual  victims  of
         that offending.
      c) The seriousness of the offences committed when compared with  other
         offences of the same kind. In this regard the sentence passed  will
         be  a  potent  indication  of  the  gravity  of  the   offence   as
         demonstrating  the  assessment  of  the  sentencing   judge.   That
         assessment will need to be accorded substantial weight but it  must
         be remembered that the Secretary of  State  will  ex  hypothesi  be
         considering those sentenced  to  less  than  one  year  in  prison.
         Moreover, there can be reasons other than gravity of  offending  or
         seriousness of harm which can result  in  a  lesser  sentence  than
         might otherwise have been expected being imposed.

24) The Secretary of State's guidance states  that  an  offence  "that  has
    contributed to a widespread problem  that  causes  serious  harm  to  a
    community or to society in general" is to be  regarded  as  an  offence
    that has caused serious harm. In my judgement considerable  caution  is
    needed in this  regard.  In  assessing  whether  offending  has  caused
    serious harm then it is appropriate to look to the impact not  just  on
    the immediate victims of a particular offence or offences but  also  to
    the harm caused to the wider community by the  offending  in  question.
    Thus a night-time street robber harms not just the person who  he  robs
    but also the wider community by contributing to  a  greater  or  lesser
    extent to causing others to be fearful of being on the streets at night-
    time. In addition it is appropriate for some account to be taken of the
    overall impact of offending of the type  committed  by  the  particular
    offender. However, this latter aspect  can  only  be  of  very  limited
    assistance in the application of Rule 398 (c). This is because what  is
    required is that the offending of the particular person  is  "offending
    [which] has caused serious harm". It  is  not  sufficient  that  it  be
    offending which has the potential to cause serious harm nor that it  is
    offending of a kind which as a whole causes serious harm unless it  can
    be seen as contributing in a real sense to that serious harm.

25) The third paragraph of the Secretary of State's  guidance  is  somewhat
    opaque. What is being said there may be of  relevance  in  relation  to
    some kinds of offence where the harm caused  is  not  confined  by  the
    wording of the provision defining the offence. Thus it would be open to
    the Secretary of State to conclude that an  offender  convicted  of  an
    assault  occasioning  actual  bodily  harm  had   in   the   particular
    circumstances caused serious harm even though there had  not  been  any
    conviction of causing grievous bodily harm. If all that is  being  said
    in the guidance is that reference must  be  made  to  the  actual  harm
    caused  by  the  actual  offending  without   that   assessment   being
    constrained by the labelling of the offence then that is  sensible  and
    appropriate. However, if it is being said that the person  in  question
    can be treated as having engaged in offending for which he has not been
    convicted then that cannot  be  appropriate.  In  the  context  of  the
    current case the Appellant was tried on the charges of possession  with
    intent to supply and was acquitted. The Secretary of  State  cannot  go
    behind that acquittal and she  must  proceed  on  the  basis  that  the
    offending in 2013 was limited to that of simple possession of the drugs
    in question.

26) I have said that the assessment of whether there is "offending  [which]
    has caused serious harm" must be focussed on the  particular  offending
    and the harm caused by that offending. I am reinforced in that view  by
    noting that the Secretary of State's guidance  states  that  those  who
    have been convicted of "one or more violent, drugs,  or  sex  offences"
    will "usually" be considered to have caused serious harm. This makes it
    clear that the Secretary of State does not regard it as  an  invariable
    consequence even of such offending that serious  harm  will  have  been
    caused.

The Application of the Test to the Circumstances of this Case.

27) There are a number of factors present  here  which  could  be  said  to
    support the view that the  Appellant's  offending  had  caused  serious
    harm.
      a) The Appellant engaged in offending on two separate occasions.
      b) The second instance of offending appears to have  been  at  a  time
         when he was still subject to a community order in  respect  of  the
         earlier offending albeit very much at the end of that period.
      c) The first offence was one of the possession of Class A  drugs  with
         the intent to supply. That is  a  serious  matter  because  of  the
         potential for Class A drugs to cause harm to the users of the drugs
         and to society more generally.
      d) The second instance of  offending  shows  that  there  was  renewed
         involvement with Class A drugs despite the  Appellant  having  been
         given the support of a Drug Rehabilitation Requirement.

28) There are also a number  of  factors  supporting  the  view  that  this
    offending had not caused serious harm.
      a) The most significant is the fact that the sentence imposed for  the
         offence of possession of Class A drugs with intention to supply was
         a community order. This must be taken to have been an indication by
         the sentencing judge of his or her  view  of  the  gravity  of  the
         offence. It is to be noted that the  community  order  was  coupled
         with a Drug Rehabilitation Requirement and so it appears  that  the
         Appellant was being given an opportunity to get  himself  clear  of
         drugs. The giving of such an opportunity might lead to  the  making
         of a community order where one would not  otherwise  be  warranted.
         Nonetheless, the fact that the sentence for possession of  Class  A
         drugs with intention to supply was a community order must be  taken
         as an indication that the sentencing judge regarded this  offending
         as very much at the lower end of the scale of seriousness for  such
         offences.
      b) The convictions in  February  2014  were  for  offences  of  simple
         possession and as explained above the Appellant is to be dealt with
         on the basis that this was the totality of the offending in  August
         2013. The Appellant is not to be regarded as having  engaged  again
         in possession with intent to supply when a jury had  acquitted  him
         of that charge.
      c) The sentence imposed in February 2014 is also significant. It was a
         prison sentence but it was imposed in the light of  the  fact  that
         the Appellant had spent time in custody on remand and it appears to
         have been calculated with a view to ensuring the immediate  release
         of the Appellant. In that regard I note that having stated the term
         of imprisonment the sentencing judge said to  the  Appellant  "that
         means you should not now be going back into custody  ...  you  have
         paid your debt for these offences effectively...".
      d) The overall position in respect of  the  Appellant's  offending  is
         that he has one conviction for possession of  Class  A  drugs  with
         intent to supply for which he received a community  order  together
         with convictions  for  the  possession  of  cannabis  and  for  the
         possession of cocaine in respect of which he received on the  first
         occasion  a  community  order  and  latterly  a   prison   sentence
         calibrated so as to ensure his immediate release.  Those  sentences
         must be seen as indicating the views of the judges dealing with the
         Appellant in respect of the seriousness of his offending.

29) I do not overlook the  inherent  seriousness  of  all  offending  which
    involves Class A drugs. Offending which involves repeated instances  of
    supply to others or repeated instances of  possession  with  intent  to
    supply is likely to be almost inevitably offending which causes serious
    harm because of the scope for real harm  to  multiple  victims  and  to
    society. Here there is only one instance of  such  possession  and,  as
    already explained, that is to be regarded as being  very  much  at  the
    lower end  of  the  scale  of  gravity  for  such  offences.  In  those
    circumstances I concluded that it could not properly be said  that  the
    Appellant's offending was  offending  which  had  caused  serious  harm
    within the meaning of Rule 398 (c). It followed that the Appellant  was
    not liable to deportation and for those reasons the appeal was allowed.
