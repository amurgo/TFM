Representation:
For the Appellant:     The Sponsor, Mr Malagouen appeared in person
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for leave  to  enter
    as the spouse of Mr Malagouen.  Her application was made on 6th January
    2017.  The refusal of entry clearance was dated 9th February 2017.  The
    reason  for  the  refusal  was  that  Mr  Malagouen  had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence in the specified form that he earned the  requisite
    income threshold of �18,600  in  the  six-month  period  prior  to  the
    application due to a lack of  payslips  and  bank  statements  in  that
    period.

 2. Her appeal against this was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Twydell  ("the  Judge")  following  a  hearing  on  5th   March   2018.
    Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Page on 3 September  2018  as
    Mr Malagouen said he did provide the specified evidence,  and  if  that
    was the case, there may have been a defect of a procedural nature.

The Judgement

 3. The Judge considered the documentation produced and records at [6] that
    "at the end of the hearing I directed  the  Appellant  produce,  within
    fourteen days, his P60 document for the  year  2015/2016".   The  Judge
    then continues by recording at [7] various documents had been  received
    from the Appellant.  It is noted that the Sponsor had not produced  the
    P60 as directed.

The hearing

 4. Mr Malagouen explained to me  that  he  had  been  made  redundant.  He
    identified the documents he had sent in.  Mr Lindsay submitted that the
    document from HMRC concerned the period 2016/17 and  not  2015/16,  and
    the letter relating to the annual tax summary for 2015/16 identifies  a
    total income of �14,694.22 which falls below the relevant threshold  of
    �18,600.  He submitted that  redundancy  money  does  not  fall  within
    Appendix FM and accordingly the Rules were not  established  as  having
    been met.

Discussion

 5. The specified evidence of financial requirements  is  set  out  in  the
    Immigration Rules in Appendix FM-SE and require the production of  bank
    statements, payslips  and  correspondence  from  employers.   The  full
    criteria are set out in the Judge's decision at [21]. A P60  is  not  a
    specified document.

 6. The Immigration Rules in Appendix FM E-ECP3.2 identify the sources that
    may be taken into account when establishing if the income threshold  is
    established. It  does  not  include  redundancy  payment  within  those
    criteria.


 7.  The  Judge  did  not  materially  err  at  [22]  when  the   financial
    documentation was assessed for the following reasons.   The  Judge  was
    correct to work out the  income  on  the  basis  of  the  documentation
    produced. Mr Malagouen does not have to produce the P60 from 2015/16 to
    identify that he exceeded the income threshold,  but  he  did  have  to
    produce specified evidence that he met  the  threshold.  The  documents
    produced did not establish that he did.  Contrary  to  that  which  was
    asserted in the application  for  permission  to  appeal,  he  had  not
    produced the required documentation.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
