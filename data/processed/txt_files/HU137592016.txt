                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms P Solanki, Counsel, instructed by Pickup Scott
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant  to  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Heatherington (the judge), promulgated on 12 July  2017,
    in which she dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's
    decision of 17 May 2016, refusing his human rights claim, which had  in
    turn been made on 21 April 2016.

 2. That human rights claim was essentially based on  two  matters:  first,
    the Appellant's  long  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  such  that
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of the Rules was satisfied; second,  that  the
    Appellant had a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    child in the United Kingdom.  In refusing the claim, the Respondent had
    not accepted that child was either in the United Kingdom,  or  if  they
    were, that the Appellant had a relationship with  them.   In  addition,
    the Appellant's continuous residence in this country since his  claimed
    entry in 1992 was rejected on the basis of insufficient evidence.

The judge's decision

 3. The judge's findings of fact are set out at [10.3] of her decision.  At
    [10.3(a)] the judge finds that the Appellant did not have a genuine and
    subsisting parental relationship with his daughter.  At  [10.3(b)]  she
    effectively finds that the evidence before her was enough to show  that
    the Appellant had lived continuously in the United Kingdom between 1992
    and 1997, and then from January 2002 until the present  day.   However,
    at [10.3(c)] the judge finds that the Appellant could not  account  for
    the four years between 1998 and 2001.  There was a lack of  documentary
    evidence covering this period and the judge observes that she had  some
    sort  of  particular  knowledge  arising  from  her  unidentified  work
    (presumably from outside of the Tribunal) that border controls in  this
    country are "ineffective" and that the Appellant might have  been  able
    to leave this country and re-enter at some point during this four  year
    period.  In [10.3(d)] a witness, Ms Mbiyu, is referred to.   The  judge
    says nothing about  any  adverse  view  of  her  credibility  but  then
    concludes that she was "not persuaded" by the witness's evidence.  Then
    at [10.3(e)] she states that: "I cannot rely on his  [the  Appellant's]
    evidence to  be  credible  or  trustworthy,  considering  the  lack  of
    documentary evidence and the evidence as a whole.  I am  not  satisfied
    that the Appellant has made out his claim".  The judge goes on to  look
    at other issues in the context of the Article 8 claim outside the scope
    of the relevant Rules.  She concludes that there was nothing compelling
    in the case.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 4. The succinct grounds essentially make three  points:  first,  that  the
    judge effectively required documentary evidence  about  residence,  and
    was wrong to have done so; second, the judge failed to give any reasons
    for rejecting the evidence of  Ms  Mbiyu;  third,  the  judge  entirely
    ignored the evidence of another witness, Mr Jefar.

 5. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier  Tribunal  but  then
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins on 25 January 2018.

The hearing before me

 6. Ms Solanki relied on the grounds of appeal with reference to  [10.3(c)]
    and [10.3(e)].  She submitted that the judge  had  effectively  treated
    the absence of documentary evidence covering the four-year period to be
    decisive or at least  to  carry  an  impermissible  degree  of  weight.
    Alternatively, there was an absence of adequate reasons as to  why  the
    lack of documentary evidence for this period was  deemed  so  important
    when there had been no reasons provided as to why the  Appellant's  own
    evidence was unreliable and/or that a gap in the  documentary  evidence
    between 2004 and 2005 had not resulted in an  adverse  finding  on  the
    continuity of residence.  In respect  of  the  witness's  evidence,  Ms
    Solanki reiterated what is said in the grounds.

 7. Mr Tufan did not seek to oppose  the  Appellant's  challenge  with  any
    vigour.  He recognised that the  judge  had  failed  to  deal  with  Mr
    Jefar's evidence at all and did not seek to argue that there  were  any
    reasons provided for rejecting the evidence of  Ms  Mbiyu  either.   He
    accepted that the evidence from both witnesses was potentially material
    to the core  issue  in  the  appeal,  namely  the  Appellant's  lengthy
    continuous residence in this country.

Decision on error of law

 8. As I announced to the parties at the hearing I conclude that there  are
    material errors of law in the judge's decision.

 9. In my view the judge erred in her approach to the issue of  documentary
    evidence.  It was clearly the case that she accepted the  existence  of
    documentary evidence covering a period both before and after  the  four
    year gap in question (see [10.3(b)]).  It is also the case that  a  gap
    in that evidence for 2004/2005 had not prevented  her  from  concluding
    the existence of continuous residence for that time.  In light of this,
    the fact that the Appellant had  not  been  lawfully  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom and the difficulties in obtaining formal documents as  a
    result (as acknowledged in case law  including  the  judgment  in  Khan
    cited in the grounds of  appeal),  the  judge  has  either  effectively
    required corroborative documentary evidence of  the  Appellant  or  has
    provided insufficient reasons as to why the absence  of  such  evidence
    was, if not fatal, of such significance in the Appellant's case.

10. Of more importance, is the judge's approach to the witness's  evidence.
    I conclude that the errors here are of themselves sufficient to  render
    the decision unsustainable.  Having read  the  witness's  evidence  for
    myself I am satisfied that  it  was  relevant  to  the  core  issue  of
    continuous residence, including the period in question.  With reference
    to [10.3(d)] there is no  suggestion,  at  least  no  adequate  reasons
    provided, as to why Ms Mbiyu's evidence was deemed to be untruthful  or
    unreliable in any way.  There is no adequate reason given as to why the
    judge was "not persuaded" by the witness's evidence.  In respect of  Mr
    Jefar, there is simply no reference to his evidence whatsoever.   There
    are no other findings which would, of  themselves,  have  rendered  his
    evidence immaterial to the core question in the appeal.

11. In light of these errors I set aside the judge's decision.

Re-making the decision

12. Both representatives were agreed that I should re-make the decision  on
    the evidence now before me.  That evidence includes the following:

      a) the bundle which was before the First-tier Tribunal;

      b) a supplementary  bundle,  which  was  also  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal, including the evidence of Ms Mbiyu and Mr Jefar;

      c) two Abbey National passbooks, admitted by me  and without objection
         under Rule 15(2A) of the Upper Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2008  in
         the name of the Appellant and showing numerous transactions between
         the period 21 July 1999 and 1 September 2001, and again between  18
         November 2004 and 28 November 2005 (copies of this evidence are now
         on file).

  13. Ms Solanki submitted that the appeal should be allowed  outright  with
      reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii).  The Appellant had  shown  more
      than twenty years' continuous residence in the United  Kingdom  as  at
      the date his human rights claim was made in April 2016.




  14. Mr Tufan had nothing to add.  He  confirmed  that  he  was  making  no
      challenge to the passbook evidence.

Findings of Fact

15. I make the core finding of fact: it is more likely than  not  that  the
    Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in 1992 and  has  resided  here
    continuously ever since.  I make this finding based upon the  following
    matters.

16. First, there is no reason whatsoever to  disturb  the  finding  of  the
    judge that the documentary evidence shows continuous residence  between
    1992 and 1997.  Having seen the evidence for myself this  includes  the
    making of an asylum claim  and  a  conviction  relating  to  a  driving
    offence in 1996.  For my  part  I  am  more  than  satisfied  that  the
    evidence  as  a  whole  supports  the  fact  of  continuous   residence
    throughout this period.

17. Second, there is also no reason to disturb the finding  by  the   judge
    that the Appellant   has  been  continuously  resident  in  the  United
    Kingdom from January 2002 to the present day.  This is fully  supported
    by documentary evidence originally before the First-tier  Tribunal  but
    also now by the  second  of  the  two  passbooks  which  clearly  shows
    numerous transactions (both deposits into the accounts and  withdrawals
    at ATMs) during the course of 2004  and  2005.   I  accept  that  these
    transactions were all undertaken by the Appellant himself.

18. Third, the gap of four years between 1998 and 2001 has,  I  find,  been
    satisfactorily  addressed.    The   first   passbook   shows   numerous
    transactions during the  period  1999  to  2001.   I  accept  that  the
    transactions were undertaken by the Appellant himself.  In addition, it
    is a fact that numerous  sources  of  documentary  evidence  have  been
    provided in respect of the previous period  and  a  subsequent  period.
    Given that  there  is  no  requirement  for  corroborative  documentary
    evidence, and taking everything into account, there is more than enough
    before me to draw a perfectly reasonable inference that  the  Appellant
    was  in  the  United  Kingdom  continuously  during  this  period.    I
    specifically reject the  suggestion  that  the  Appellant  had  somehow
    managed to leave the country and re-enter at any time.

19. Fourth, there is nothing in the Appellant's own evidence to  materially
    undermine any of the evidential sources before me.  Indeed, I  have  no
    reason to doubt the reliability of his evidence in any way.



Conclusions

20. I turn to paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of the Rules.  These Rules  are  put
    in place by the Respondent and show where she believes the fair balance
    to have been struck as between the important public interest on the one
    hand, and the  rights  of  individuals  on  the  other.   There  is  no
    suggestion by the Respondent in this case that the Appellant need  show
    anything more than the satisfaction of relevant provisions in order  to
    succeed in his Article 8 claim.

21. I have found that the Appellant was  residing  in  the  United  Kingdom
    continuously from 1992 to the present day.  That means, at the time  he
    made his human rights claim on 21 April 2016, he had  already  been  in
    this country for twenty-four years.  On that basis the provision  under
    the Rules is met.  The Appellant is entitled to succeed on  this  basis
    alone.

22. There is no need for me to go on  and  consider  the  wider  Article  8
    issues outside the context of the Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I  re-make  the  decision  by  allowing   the   Appellant's   appeal.    The
Respondent's refusal of the  Appellant's  human  rights  claim  is  unlawful
under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of �70.00. Although the Appellant has succeeded, the case required  an
appeal hearing and relevant evidence in the form of the passbooks  was  only
adduced late in the day.
