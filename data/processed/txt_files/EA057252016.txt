                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Oxlade, promulgated on 29th September 2017, following  a  hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 25th September  2017.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, save on the  grounds  that
    the Respondent Secretary of State must issue a residence  card  to  the
    Appellant under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 (hereafter "EEA Regulations").  Pursuant to the Appellant's appeal
    against the decision of IJ Oxlade, the matter now comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant, a national of Nigeria, was born on 22nd April 1974,  and
    is a female.  She was granted a residence card as evidence of her right
    to live in the UK as the spouse of  Mr  Rutson  Puriel,  an  EEA  Dutch
    national, from 20th October 2010 to 20th October 2015.  On 15th October
    2015, she made an application for a permanent residence card, and  this
    was refused on 3rd May 2016, thus leading  to  the  appeal  before  the
    Immigration Tribunals under Regulation 26 of the EEA Regulations 2006.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is  that,  following  her  divorce
    from her husband by a decree absolute granted on 10th  July  2015,  she
    was  able  to  demonstrate  that  her  EEA  national  spouse  had  been
    exercising treaty rights for a continuous period of five years by being
    in employment, and that  she  was  a  family  member  of  such  an  EEA
    national,  who  had  consequently  retained  rights  under   Regulation
    15(1)(f).  She relied upon the payslips  issued  to  her  EEA  national
    former spouse, which were issued by Pinpoint  World  Services  Limited.
    Accordingly, she had retained rights of residence  on  her  divorce  in
    accordance with Regulation 10(5) of the EEA Regulations.

 4. The Respondent Secretary of State disagreed that  this  was  the  case.
    The Appellant had only been  able  to  rely  upon  photocopies  of  the
    payslips.  The payslips were  not  in  the  original.   They  were  not
    verifiable.  The Respondent Secretary of State herself  had  sought  to
    establish Pinpoint World Services Limited's existence as a company from
    the internet.  However, the only available  telephone  number  was  not
    answered despite multiple attempts to contact them by  the  Respondent.
    Although the Appellant had provided HMRC documents, these were  not  in
    the originals either, and photocopies were not acceptable  evidence  in
    the same way.  The only documents  that  were  accepted  were  the  P60
    ending April 2012 and the P45 dated 29th September 2014 (see paragraphs
    5 to 7 of the determination).

 5. In her Notice of Appeal, which was dated 18th May 2016,  the  Appellant
    took issue with the points raised by the Respondent Secretary of State,
    maintaining that the photocopies should be  acceptable,  and  requiring
    disclosure of the multiple efforts made by the  Respondent  to  contact
    the EEA national's employer (paragraph 8 of the determination).

The Judge's Determination

 6. At the hearing before IJ Oxlade, the arguments were put  on  behalf  of
    the Appellant both in terms of  Regulation  15(1)(b),  which  had  been
    raised by the Appellant in an  application  (at  page  24);  and  under
    Regulation 15(1)(f).  The judge observed that in order to establish the
    EEA national's exercise of treaty rights, the Appellant would  have  to
    rely upon the HMRC letter dated 31st October 2013 (see the Respondent's
    bundle at page 1), to show employment with  Alpha  Response  from  26th
    September 2010 to 9th November 2012.  She would also need to rely  upon
    the HMRC letter (which appears at page 4 of the Appellant's bundle)  to
    show employment with AEJ Management from  1st  November  2012  to  20th
    November 2014.   The Appellant's former EEA national  spouse  had  also
    claimed to be self-employed for the tax year 2011 to 2012 to  at  least
    January 2014, and in this respect reliance would be placed  upon  other
    evidence in the Appellant's bundle (at page 16).  Also to be taken into
    account was a self-assessment tax calculation for the year 2014 to 2015
    (in the Appellant's bundle at page 18) which  showed  registration  for
    self-employment, and tax calculation (see page 17  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle) for the period 5th October 2014 to 11th April 2015.  The income
    form AEJ showed money paid into the EEA national's  bank  account  (see
    the Appellant's bundle at pages 21 to 24) from 20th December 2013  (and
    not from 2014) right through to 26th September 2014 (not 2015) was also
    referred to (see paragraph 12 of the determination of the judge).

 7. In terms of the oral evidence heard by the  judge,  the  Appellant  had
    confirmed that her meetings with her ex-partner every couple of months,
    had  led  to  his  being  quite  cooperative  in  furnishing  her  with
    information in the exercise of his treaty rights, and he  had  provided
    payslips (pages 6 to 11 for the period April  to  September  2015)  and
    these showed that he was working at the point of divorce.   There  were
    some irregularities as observed by the judge.  However, it was accepted
    that the Appellant herself continued to work for the  NHS  and  was  in
    receipt of a salary (determination at paragraph 15).

 8. On the basis of such evidence, the judge made the following findings of
    fact.  There was no dispute that the Appellant was married  to  an  EEA
    Dutch national from 10th April 2010 to 10th July  2015.   That  was  an
    excess of five years.  The couple had also  lived  together  for  least
    three years, one of which was whilst he was in the  UK  (see  paragraph
    22).  The issue really rested with the Dutch EEA national's exercise of
    treaty rights during the marriage to the point  of  divorce  (paragraph
    23).

 9. In this respect, the judge identified  a  gap  in  the  EEA  national's
    employment  from  20th  September  2014  to   5th   June   2015.    One
    misapprehension had  been  in  relation  to  the  EEA  national's  bank
    statement (at pages 21 to 24 of the Appellant's bundle), which had been
    thought to run from December  2014  to  1st  October  2015,  and  would
    therefore would have showed income from employment or  self-employment.
    In fact, the judge found that the bank statements were  actually  shown
    to cover the period from 30th November 2013 to 28th November 2015  (see
    the top of page 21 of the Appellant's bundle).

10. Consideration was given by the judge to  Counsel  for  the  Appellant's
    submissions that there was in fact no break in continuity of employment
    if regard was had to the EEA  national's  self-employment  period  from
    20th September 2014 to 5th June 2015.  The judge rejected this  on  the
    basis that,

         "There was no witness statement submitted by the EEA national as to
         his activities during that time, and no bank statements showing the
         receipt of income.  Further, there was no set of  profit  and  loss
         accounts which she may have submitted,  and  no  self-employed  tax
         calculations" (paragraph 26).

11. Such income  as  there  was  appeared  to  come  from  AEJ  Management,
    according to the HMRC letter dated 19th June 2017  (which  appeared  at
    page 4 of the Appellant's bundle), and which referred to his employment
    ending on 20th September 2014, and his income in the year  which  ended
    April 2015 (paragraph 26).

12. The judge went on to conclude that whilst it  was  the  case  that  the
    Appellant's EEA - Dutch national "was  registered  for  self-assessment
    with HMRC during this break in employment, there is no evidence that he
    was in fact working as a self-employed person, or that he  was  seeking
    to obtain work in that time".

13. Accordingly, the judge concluded that it would not be possible to  find
    that the EEA Dutch national would be regarded as  "self-employed",  and
    in those circumstances "absent proof of evidence that he  was  actively
    seeking to work", the appeal stood  to  be  dismissed  (paragraph  27).
    This was because there was a break in continuity  from  20th  September
    2014 to 5th June 2015 (paragraph 28).

14. On the other hand, the judge did find that at the date of the  divorce,
    the Dutch EEA national was working for Pinpoint.  This was because  the
    HMRC document does show payment of tax and national insurance.  He also
    found this employment was from 5th June 2015  to  30th  November  2015.
    The tax authorities had a start date of 5th June  2015  (see  paragraph
    30).  Therefore, the Dutch EEA national was exercising treaty rights at
    the date of divorce.  The Appellant would acquire a right of  residence
    under Regulation 10(5).   This  meant  that  the  Respondent  would  be
    required to issue a residence card to her in accordance with Regulation
    17(2).  The judge so concluded (at paragraph 31).   However,  this  was
    not the end of the matter.

15. The question, as the judge went on to state, was whether the  Appellant
    could acquire permanent rights of residence under Regulation  15(1)(f).
    Counsel for the Appellant argued  that  there  was  no  requirement  of
    continuity under Regulation 15(1)(f), because this provision refers  to
    a person "residing in the UK in accordance with these Regulations for a
    continuous period of five years" at the end of which the Appellant  has
    retained rights.  The judge held, however, that  under  the  applicable
    case law there was no dispensation  on  applications  for  a  permanent
    residence card from the requirement of five years' exercise  of  treaty
    rights.  The case of Secretary of State for  Work  &  Pensions  v  Dias
    (case C-325/09) CJEU (Third Chamber) did not help because there was  no
    evidence that the EEA national had made up the five  years  working  in
    some way or another.  Therefore, the judge could not be satisfied  that
    the Appellant  had  established  that  the  EEA  national  Sponsor  did
    exercise treaty rights for a total of five years.  As such she had  not
    established a right to  a  permanent  residence  (paragraph  33).   The
    Appellant was only entitled to a residence card under Regulation  17(2)
    but not to a permanent residence card.  The appeal was dismissed.



Grounds of Application

16. The grounds of application, which are clear and comprehensive, make the
    following points.  First, that, although the  Secretary  of  State  had
    taken issue with there being no originals of the  documents  submitted,
    and on that basis rejected the Appellant's claim, at the hearing before
    Judge Oxlade, the originals were  produced.   Second,  the  Appellant's
    date of marriage was 10th April 2010 and  right  until  20th  September
    2014, the judge had found the Appellant's Dutch EEA national spouse  to
    have been working.  There was then, according to the judge, a gap  from
    20th September 2014 to 5th June 2015 (at paragraph 28), on the basis of
    which the judge concluded that there had not been a continuous  working
    period of five years on the part of the Appellant's Dutch EEA  national
    Sponsor.  However, the judge had found that at the date of the  divorce
    the Appellant's ex-partner had been working (see paragraphs 30 to  31).
    Indeed, the date of resumption of the ex-partner's work  was  5th  June
    2015, right down to the date of the Home Office decision.  This  meant,
    that since Blake J had already  stated  (see  paragraph  53  of  Samsam
    [2011] UKUT 165) that "there is no need to have  resided  a  continuous
    period of five years in only one category, either  as  a  spouse  or  a
    former spouse", that this meant that  the  Appellant  could  show  five
    years of residence on the basis of her ex-partner's pre-divorce  period
    of work, and her own period of work post-divorce, because  the  refusal
    letter already accepted (see  page  2)  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    working for the NHS at St Thomas' Hospital for very many years.

17. On 27th October 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal
    on the basis that  the  judge  wrongly  discounted  evidence  that  the
    Appellant's former husband had been working as a self-employed  person,
    and had a continuous period of employment for five years.

18. On 5th December 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect that
    the First-tier Tribunal had directed herself appropriately and that  it
    was clear that the EEA national had not been working for  a  continuous
    period of five years.

The Hearing

19. At the hearing before me  on  26th  January  2018,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr E Yerokun, a legal representative, and the Respondent
    was represented by Ms  A  Everett,  a  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer.  Mr Yerokun made the following submissions.

20. He explained that the Appellant satisfied Regulation  15(1)(f)  of  the
    EEA Regulations because she was a person who had resided in the  United
    Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period of
    five years, and was at the end of that period a family member  who  had
    retained the right of residence.  The judge below  had  overlooked  the
    period  of  right  of  residence  of  the  Appellant's  ex-partner  EEA
    national, prior to the date of her divorce.  He drew  my  attention  to
    the Appellant's bundle.  A letter from HMRC, for the tax period 2015 to
    2016 (at page 15 of the Appellant's bundle) confirmed his "profit  from
    self-employment" as being �8,783.  A  self-assessment  statement  dated
    22nd October 2015, from the Appellant's EEA  national  ex-partner,  for
    the year 2011 to 2012 (see pages 16 to 17 of the bundle) confirmed that
    he  was  owing  �770.94,  to  the  HMRC.   His  self-employed  national
    insurance contributions, in a letter dated 1st October 2015, identified
    his due payment at the tune of �74.25, which was payable no later  than
    31st January 2016 (see page 17 of the Appellant's  bundle).   This  was
    for the period 5th October 2015 to 11th April 2015.

21. Mr Yerokun went on to say that the judge had failed to  deal  with  the
    fact that under Regulation 6(1) the Appellant's EEA national ex-partner
    was a "self-employed person" (see Regulation 6(1)(c)).  In stating,  as
    the judge did, that the Appellant's ex-partner had to  be  actively  in
    search of work as a self-employed  person  for  two  years  before  the
    relevant date of 20th September 2014 to 5th June 2015, the law had been
    misinterpreted.

22. The judge had stated that, "there is no evidence that he  was  in  fact
    working as a self-employed person, or that he  was  seeking  to  obtain
    work in that time" (paragraph 27).  The evidence from HMRC in a  letter
    dated 29th June 2017 to the Appellant's ex-partner referred to his  tax
    calculation for the year 2015 to 2016 "that you asked for" (see page 14
    of the Appellant's bundle).  The fact that he had confirmed income from
    self-employment, as demonstrated in the letter form HMRC of �8,783 (see
    page 15) fully demonstrated that he was  self-employed  in  the  manner
    stated.  The fact was  that  the  Appellant's  ex-partner  had  been  a
    jobseeker, as a self-employed person, notwithstanding a minor gap  from
    September 2014 to June 2015, during which  he  did  not  work.   Having
    acquired the status of a self-employed person, he retained that  status
    under Regulations 5 and 6, notwithstanding that he had  ceased  working
    for a short gap.

23. From April 2015 he was in any event self-employed (see page 16  of  the
    Appellant's bundle) because there was evidence of  his  self-assessment
    form, with respect to a statement  due  on  22nd  October  2015,  which
    showed that he owed an amount of �772.94.

24. If a person is self-employed as a worker (which the judge had accepted)
    he or she did not immediately cease to be an  unqualified  person  just
    because there had been gap in their  employment,  since  there  was  an
    allowable period of two months.

25. Finally, the case of Dias [2011] 3 CMLR 40 had confirmed that  a  break
    in dependency of less than six months  on  an  EEA  national,  did  not
    prevent a person from acquiring a permanent right  of  residence  under
    Regulation 15(1)(b).

26. For her part, Ms Everett submitted that being registered with the  HMRC
    was not adequate evidence of being registered for work and it  was  not
    clear that the judge had overlooked the evidence at all.  It was  being
    suggested that the Appellant had always been exercising treaty  rights,
    but the judge could not possibly have filled  in  all  the  outstanding
    gaps,  with  the  result  that  the  decision  reached   was   entirely
    sustainable.  The  findings  made  were  well-reasoned.   The  evidence
    produced fell far short of showing that the Appellant's ex-partner  EEA
    national had been working for the entire five years as maintained.

Error of Law

27. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

28. First, there is the witness  statement  of  the  Appellant  dated  11th
    September 2007 (see pages 1 to 3 of the bundle).  She explains that her
    ex-partner EEA national had been working for the five  years  of  their
    marriage from 10th April 2010 until 10th July 2015.  This is because he
    was self-employed as well as  being  employed.   In  his  self-employed
    work,  he  worked  as  a  general  handyman,  cleaning,  gardening  and
    painting.  She refers to the  evidence  from  the  HMRC  detailing  his
    employment history, and this is dated 31st October 2013.  She refers to
    the HMRC employment history dated  also  19th  June  2017.   There  are
    payslips form Pinpoint World  Services  for  April  to  September  2015
    (which covers the period of the divorce).  There are two P60s  for  the
    year ending April 2016.  There is the Companies  House  documents  that
    show Pinpoint Services as a registered  company.   There  is  the  HMRC
    letter of 29th June 2017, which shows her ex-partner's tax calculations
    for 2015 to 2016.  She rejects the contention that the Home Office  had
    difficulty in contacting Pinpoint World Services, who are a  registered
    company, incorporated since March 2013, and her ex-partner's employment
    history from HMRC shows that he started work  with  them  on  5th  June
    2015, and ended on 13th November 2015.  This covered the  date  of  the
    divorce, which was 10th July 2015.  The same record also shows that her
    ex-partner worked at Ashley Cleaning Services Limited on  1st  December
    2015.

29. Second, there is the documentation  itself.   What  is  stated  in  the
    Appellant's witness statement is corroborated in  these  documents.   A
    letter from HMRC dated 19th June  2017  confirms  that  her  ex-partner
    earned from AEJ Management Limited a sum of �8,260  from  1st  November
    2012 until 20th September 2014.  He paid tax of �651.20.  Payslips from
    Pinpoint World Services (pages 6 to 11) confirm  his  regular  earnings
    from them for the months  of  April  to  September  2015,  showing  net
    payments of �929.28 every month.  There is documentation that  Pinpoint
    World Services are on the register of companies (page  12).   A  letter
    from HMRC dated 29th June 2017 provides the Appellant's ex-partner with
    a "tax calculation for the year 2015 to 2016 that you asked for".   His
    "profit from self-employment" for the tax calculation period of 2015 to
    2016, arising from his earnings of �8,783  on  a  self-employed  basis,
    amount to �507 (see page 15).  His own  self-assessment  form  for  the
    HMRC shows that he is due to pay an amount of �772.94, in  a  statement
    dated 22nd October 2015.  His national insurance contributions  due  no
    later than 31st January 2016 amount to �74.25, in a  letter  dated  1st
    October 2015.  Importantly, for the period 30th November 2013  to  28th
    November 2014, the bank statement of the Appellant's EEA  national  ex-
    partner  shows  that  on  20th  December  2013  he  received  from  AEJ
    Management �150, and for 31st December 2013 he received �1,014.56  into
    his account.  For 2nd January 2014, he received �149.79  and  for  31st
    January he received �1,257.82 (see pages 21 to 22).   Further  payments
    are made also (at pages 23 to 24) in  the  same  way.   Each  of  these
    payments  are  identified  as  the  ex-partner's  "salary"   from   AEJ
    Management.

30. On the basis of the above, the judge was in error in stating  that,  "I
    find that whilst the Appellant was registered for self-assessment  with
    HMRC during this break in employment, there is no evidence that he  was
    in fact working as a self-employed person, or that he  was  seeking  to
    obtain work in that time" (paragraph 27).  The reference to  the  break
    in continuity was for the period 20th September 2014 to 5th June  2015.
    However, given that the judge had accepted  that  the  Appellant's  ex-
    partner had resumed work from 5th June 2015 to the  date  of  the  Home
    Office decision the judge had fallen into error in so stating.

31. The irony is that the judge did find the Appellant's ex-partner to have
    been in employment from 5th June 2015 to 30th November 2015, such  that
    at the date of the divorce the EEA national ex-partner was working  for
    Pinpoint (see paragraph 30).  The judge held  that  he  was  exercising
    treaty rights at the date of the divorce and therefore acquired a right
    of residence under Regulation 10(5) such that the  Secretary  of  State
    would be required to issue the  Appellant  with  a  residence  card  in
    accordance with Regulation 17(2).

32. However, it was the Appellant's right to a permanent right of residence
    under Regulation 15(1)(f), which the judge found not to have been  made
    out, but this was on the basis that this Regulation clearly referred to
    the person, "residing in the UK in accordance  with  these  Regulations
    for  a  continuous  period  of  five  years"  (paragraph  32   of   the
    determination).  The judge required, on the basis of the interpretation
    of this provision, from the Appellant, evidence that the  EEA  national
    in question was exercising treaty rights for a total of five years.

33. This had not taken into account the decision in Samsam [2011] UKUT  165
    which confirmed that, there is no need to  have  resided  a  continuous
    period of five years in only one category, either  as  a  spouse  or  a
    former spouse" (see Blake J at paragraph 53).  It  also  did  not  take
    into account the Court of Appeal judgment in Amos [2011] EWCA  Civ  552
    that it is not necessary for former spouses to show a continuous period
    of five years' work prior  to  their  applications  for  the  right  of
    permanent residence (at paragraph 25).

Re-Making the Decision

34. I re-made the decision on the basis of the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing the appeal for the reasons that I  have  set  out
    above.  This appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    allowed and the Appellant is entitled to  a  permanent  residence  card
    under Regulation 15(1)(f).

36. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I make a fee award of any fee which has been paid or may be payable.
