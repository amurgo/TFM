For the Respondent:    Ms H Aboni, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of India,  date  of  birth  15  August  1979,
    appealed against the ECO's decision, dated 29 October 2015,  to  refuse
    entry clearance by reference to paragraph 320(11)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules but also with reference to Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.
    The appeal first came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Parker who on  9
    May 2017 dismissed the appeal on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had
    failed to  show  that  he  had  not  used  deception  as  part  of  his
    application and the judge was not satisfied that the Appellant was in a
    genuine relationship with his wife.  Following permission to appeal  on
    25 May 2018, my decision was promulgated in  which  I  found  that  the
    original Tribunal's  decision  could  not  stand  in  relation  to  the
    considerations of paragraph 320(11) of the Rules and its  consequential
    effects upon the assessment of the claim.

2.   I concluded that the matter should be remade at a  further  hearing  in
    the Upper Tribunal.

3.   The Appellant applied for entry clearance as the husband of  a  British
    national settled in the UK, Mandeep Kaur Kalar (MKK) born  on  2  March
    1985.  The basis of the decision under paragraph 320(11) of  the  Rules
    was because the Appellant had come into the United Kingdom  unlawfully,
    remained here for some nine years unlawfully  before  leaving  to  seek
    entry clearance.  The ECO considered that  those  actions  called  into
    question the Appellant's intentions and  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    relationship with MKK was genuine or  subsisting  or  that  the  couple
    intended to live together permanently in the UK.  There was no  dispute
    that the Appellant met  the  financial  requirements  and  the  English
    language requirements of the Rules.

4.   The history of this matter is substantially set  out  in  a  wealth  of
    documents and the significant of bundles but I summarise the  facts  as
    follows.  The Appellant lived unlawfully in the  UK  between  2006  and
    2015.  Whatever his reasons for coming to the United Kingdom,  he  must
    have entered unlawfully or on a basis that left him unrecorded.  He met
    MKK in 2011 and  shortly  thereafter  disclosed  to  her  that  he  had
    uncertain  and  unsettled  immigration  status.   They  began  a  close
    relationship and decided to  get  married  in  2012  and  received  the
    blessings of MKK's family which is evidenced  within  the  bundle.   In
    September 2014 his own family  met  MKK,  after  MKK  and  her  parents
    visited his family in India.  The couple entered into a civil  marriage
    on 9 January 2015 and a Sikh wedding on 9 April 2015.   Those  marriage
    certificates are contained within the  Appellant's  bundle  before  the
    Immigration Judge.

5.   They began to live together after the religious ceremony.   There  was,
    after the civil marriage, some indication that further enquiries  would
    be made by the immigration  authorities  but  nothing  was  done.   The
    Appellant sought to regularise his immigration status in  2013  on  the
    basis of a lack of ties with India but  the  application  was  refused.
    The basis on which the Appellant was advised to apply appears  to  have
    been misconceived because the Appellant was invited not to mention  his
    relationship with MKK as a couple nor that they were then cohabiting.

6.   The information provided was incorrect in some respects but not by  the
    Appellant and after receiving advice and further legal proceedings  the
    Appellant was advised to leave the  UK  and  make  an  out  of  country
    application which he did.  He then applied to return as the  spouse  of
    the Sponsor, MKK.

7.   Evidence was adduced, which was not challenged, as to the frequency  of
    the visits that MKK had made to  India  after  the  occasion  when  she
    returned with her husband in 2015.  There  have  effectively  been  two
    trips, for no longer than the periods of time she could get leave  from
    work, each year to India.  In addition MKK and  the  Appellant  are  in
    regular contact on a daily basis by telephone and  using  social  media
    and the Appellant has maintained contact not only with MKK  but  others
    of her family members.

8.   The Appellant has been unable to  find  work  in  India  and  has  been
    supported by regular money payments by MKK, some of which have been  of
    significant size.  Again the evidence is fully set out in  the  bundles
    prepared for the Upper Tribunal hearing and I do  not  need  to  recite
    them because ultimately there was no challenge to  that  factual  basis
    advanced in the statements provided and by the witnesses  who  attended
    the hearing.

9.   MKK gave evidence and was completely consistent  and  clear  about  the
    nature of their relationship, her knowledge of  his  circumstances  and
    how they had decided he must return to India to make an out of  country
    application.  There was no challenge to MKK's evidence, to that of  her
    father and to her six sisters  and  others  including  brothers-in-law.
    Those are to be found in the Upper Tribunal bundle at pages 11-75.

10.  In addition  there  were  of  course,  as  I  took  into  account,  the
    Appellant's statements contained in the First-tier Tribunal bundle, the
    Upper Tribunal bundles and MKK's statements similarly in both  bundles.
    The statements of MKK's father and mother  are  contained  within  both
    bundles as well.

11.  In the  circumstances  I  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the  essentially
    uncontested evidence of the relationship, its durability and their wish
    to be united together, particularly as they have  now  been  apart  for
    about three years.  In that time it has plainly been stressful for  MKK
    and she has carried on working, doing two jobs and identifying what she
    can do to assist her husband.  The Upper Tribunal bundle, as indeed the
    First-tier Tribunal bundle, contains a wealth of evidence to  show  the
    journeys that MKK has made, the money transfers, the call logs and  the
    evidence of continuing contact between the two of them.

12.  I now turn to the basis  of  refusal.   It  is  clear  under  paragraph
    320(11) of the Immigration Rules that entry clearance  should  normally
    be refused, which of course demonstrates a measure of discretion

         "where the applicant has previously contrived in a significant  way
         to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:

         (i)  overstaying; or

         (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or

         (iii)    being an illegal entrant; or

         (iv) using deception in an application for entry clearance ...

         and there are other aggravating circumstances, such as  absconding,
         not meeting  temporary  admission/reporting  restrictions  or  bail
         conditions, using  an  assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,
         switching  nationality,  making  frivolous  applications   or   not
         complying with the re-documentation process."

13.  The case law, which is limited but deals with paragraph 320(11), is  PS
    India [2010] UKUT  440.   PS  India  indicates  that,  in  addition  to
    specifically the Rules' requirements, there is entry clearance guidance
    which lists in relation to the issue what are considered  although  not
    exhaustively to be aggravating circumstances.  It  is  clear  that  its
    objectives include not so much the mere failure to follow the Rules but
    a use of deliberate, schemed  or  planned  undermining  of  immigration
    controls or contrived to achieve that end and that a decision to refuse
    under paragraph 320(11) must lead  to  a  proportionate  outcome  under
    Article 8.   Any  other  outcome  would  frustrate  the  intentions  of
    Appendix FM to set out categories of cases where the Secretary of State
    accepts the public interest in exclusion is outweighed under Article  8
    by countervailing factors.   Further  mere  overstaying  and  breaching
    conditions is not sufficient to meet the threshold.  A  combination  of
    illegal entry and  overstaying  really  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be
    materially different in terms of the criticism so that illegal entry is
    one and overstaying another form of immigration misconduct.

14.  Rather it seems to me that they are different sides of the  same  coin.
    It is also clear that the  guidance  recites  a  number  of  issues  in
    relation to failing  to  comply  with  directions  or  restrictions  or
    abusing the benefit system, use of multiple identities, sham  marriages
    and  so  forth,  switching   nationality   and   vexatious,   frivolous
    applications and so  on  give  rise  to  concerns  and  may  constitute
    aggravating circumstances.

15.  None of the examples in paragraph 320(11)  guidance  seem  particularly
    pertinent nor are they asserted by the  Respondent  to  be  aggravating
    circumstances.  Remaining in the UK unlawfully does not, it seems to me
    in this case, amount to an aggravating circumstance.  In any event  the
    Appellant's conduct in terms of his immigration history was not spoiled
    by making false claims for asylum or protection or seeking to abuse the
    appellate system in order to avoid removal.

16.  It is in his favour that he left the UK voluntarily.   The  failure  to
    mention his wife in his 2013 application was not evidently done to  try
    and frustrate the intentions of the Rules.  At that  stage  the  couple
    were not yet married, were not cohabiting but had known each other  for
    some two years.   It  is  unlikely  it  seems  to  me  that  were  that
    relationship to have been relied upon it would not have  been  regarded
    as sufficiently significant or durable.  There is no need to  criticise
    the advice he received in not mentioning MKK at that stage  and  it  is
    quite understandable why immigration practitioners might not have  done
    so.

17.  It did not seem to me that the failure to mention MKK is  of  the  kind
    which is deliberately intent on securing an  advantage  in  immigration
    terms but rather it really hindered  the  Appellant  in  rendering  him
    susceptible at a later date to not having mentioned  it.   I  therefore
    conclude that as a matter of fact and degree there were no demonstrated
    aggravating circumstances raised by the Secretary of State nor  did  Ms
    Aboni seek to argue that there were.

18.  So far as the genuineness of the marriage is  concerned,  the  evidence
    is truly overwhelming and Ms Aboni, through a sensible decision not  to
    cross-examine, clearly recognised the weight and force of the  evidence
    and how difficult it would be, if not  preposterous,  to  suggest  that
    there was not that relationship.  The facts of the civil  ceremony  and
    the wedding, the involvement of the families  and  the  issues  arising
    under that  again  it  is  clear  and  sufficient  that  there  was  no
    suggestion that the  Appellant  was  not  genuine  entering  into  this
    relationship with MKK.

19.  There is it seems to me nothing  that  supports  a  consideration  that
    this was at the outset a sham marriage or that  it  is  a  marriage  of
    convenience but rather it is a marriage where unhappily the couple have
    been kept apart now from enjoying the fullness of married life for some
    three years.

20.  In these circumstances on the findings of fact  which  I  have  made  I
    conclude, having regard and applying Sections 117A and 117B, that there
    is nothing to indicate that the public interest  should  not  be  given
    significant weight in the assessment.  The  Appellant  plainly  has  an
    ability to work but he would not on coming to the UK at the outset be a
    burden upon the taxpayer and his ability to speak English would plainly
    with presence here return to the level it was at when he originally was
    in the United Kingdom for the number of years  he  was.   I  take  into
    account and give it little weight that  the  relationship  was  entered
    into in the full knowledge that his status in the  UK  was  precarious.
    Similarly I take into account  that  his  Sponsor  and  MKK  are  in  a
    position to support him in the UK  until  he  gets  settled  and  finds
    employment and there is nothing to indicate he would not do so.

21.  In these circumstances the public interest in  maintaining  immigration
    controls  and  proper  border  controls  is  an   entirely   legitimate
    objective.   I  conclude  that  the   Respondent's   decision   is   an
    interference in establishing family life and establishing it in the  UK
    where MKK has all her family, her roots, her employment  and  financial
    wherewithal.  She is a British national and taxpayer, she does not wish
    to make a life in India.  It seemed to me that the public  interest  in
    maintaining border controls, whilst very important is not in this  case
    of such importance as to justify  the  Respondent's  decision  and  the
    continued  interference  in  their  relationship.   I  find   therefore
    particularly in the light of the  fact  that  the  immigration  history
    ultimately led to him properly leaving the UK of his own  volition  and
    making an out of country  application  did  stand  to  his  credit  and
    diminished the extent to which the public interest might  be  concerned
    over the abuse of immigration controls.

22.  In the circumstances I find the continued separation of  the  Appellant
    and MKK is disproportionate.

DECISION

The appeal is allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

ANONYMITY ORDER

No anonymity order was sought nor is one required.

FEE AWARD

A fee of �140 was I understand paid and in the circumstances a fee award  in
