For the Appellant:     Mr Sharma (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Wilding (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge MacDonald which was promulgated on the 3rd June 2015.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri  Lanka  who  was  born  on  the  19th
    November 1981. On the 25th March 2013 the Appellant was  granted  leave
    to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur which was valid until  the
    25th March 2016. On the 17th November 2014 the Appellant returned  back
    to Heathrow, having been in Paris for 3 days on holiday. He was stopped
    by officers at the border and interviewed. As a result,  his  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom was cancelled under paragraph 321 A of the
    Immigration Rules. The Appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against that decision, and the appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge MacDonald at Taylor House on the 27th May 2015.

 3. In his decision, Judge MacDonald decided that he did not have power  to
    hear the appeal against the Immigration decision,  on  the  basis  that
    after the 20th October 2014, he found that there was no right to appeal
    against an Immigration decision under Section 82  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. However, he did consider that  he  had
    power to hear the appeal on human  rights  grounds  but  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds. It is that  decision  which
    the Appellant has now sought to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge White  on
    the 24th August 2015 on the ground that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    arguably made an error of law when finding that there was no  right  of
    appeal under the Immigration Rules and that it was arguable that  there
    had been a procedural  unfairness  in  that  the  Judge  did  not  seek
    submissions at the end of the hearing from the parties  concerning  the
    jurisdictional issue.

Submissions

 5. Mr Wilding on behalf of the Respondent  at  the  start  of  the  appeal
    clarified the  Respondent's  position,  in  that  although  it  is  now
    accepted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred in  finding  that
    he  did  not  have  jurisdiction  to  consider  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules, Mr Wilding argued that such error was not  material,
    on the basis  that  given  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings
    regarding the inadequate explanation for the money in  the  Appellant's
    bank account and the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  finding  that  the
    Appellant had manipulated the situation in order to obtain his  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur status, that even if the Judge had considered  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules, he would have also  dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

 6. Mr Sharma on behalf of the Appellant argued that the Judge had not made
    any findings that the Appellant had been fraudulent  in  obtaining  his
    initial  Leave  to  Remain,  nor  that  material  facts  had  not  been
    disclosed.  He  argued  that  the  findings  made  by  the  Judge  were
    insufficient to conclude that the Judge would have dismissed the appeal
    under the Immigration Rules, had he properly considered  it  under  the
    Rules. He further argued that it was perceived unfair  that  the  Judge
    had decided the jurisdictional point without seeking submissions on the
    issue. However, he conceded that submissions had been made  in  respect
    of the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  and  also  in  respect  of
    Article  8,  but  that  the  Judge  appears  to   have   decided   upon
    jurisdictional issue without seeking submissions, after the appeal  was
    heard. He asked  me  to  set  aside  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision.

 7. In his submissions on behalf of the Respondent Mr Wilding  argued  that
    the relevant rule was  paragraph  321  A  (2)  if  the  case  had  been
    considered  under  the  Immigration  Rules,   namely   whether   "false
    representations were made or false documents were submitted (whether or
    not material to the application, and whether or  not  to  the  holder's
    knowledge), or material facts were not disclosed  in  relation  to  the
    application for leave;  or  in  order  to  obtain  documents  from  the
    Secretary of  State  or  a  third-party  required  in  support  of  the
    application".

 8. Mr Wilding argued that the Appellant simply had not been a good witness
    and had not given a plausible explanation as to  why  �49,500  suddenly
    appeared by way of bank  transfers  from  Mobile-Channel  in  his  bank
    account, as was found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at [42] and that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the Appellant had not invested
    �25,000 as claimed at the Heathrow interview and that he did  not  have
    an office and appeared to have very  little  by  way  of  business.  Mr
    Wilding also relied upon  the  finding  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    MacDonald at [44] when he found that "looking at the evidence before me
    I have little doubt that the Appellant  manipulated  the  situation  in
    order to obtain his Tier 1 Entrepreneur status".

 9. Mr Wilding argued that in the second interview the Appellant had stated
    that the majority of the money had come from his parents,  his  sister,
    and friends and had accepted that most of the money from his father had
    gone back to him and that all of the money obtained  from  friends  had
    gone back to them after 8 or 9 months, as he "had to pay back to them"

10. In his reply Mr Sharma asked me to bear in mind that for  the  purposes
    of paragraph 321A, the burden would have  been  on  the  Respondent  to
    prove that false representations had  been  made  or  nondisclosure  of
    material facts. He argued that even if money had been taken out of  the
    Appellant's bank later, that did not in itself establish  that  it  was
    not  initially  genuinely  available.  He  argued  that  the  requisite
    elements for paragraph 321A could not be inferred through  the  Judge's
    findings.

My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

11. As was properly conceded by Mr Wilding on behalf of the Respondent, the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge did err in  finding  that  he  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to  consider  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Section 15 of the Immigration Act 2014 had come into force on the  20th
    October 2014 and had amended Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 so that an Appellant could appeal  only  where  the
    Respondent had refused  a  protection  claim,  human  rights  claim  or
    decided to revoke a protection status.  However, as  a  result  of  the
    Savings Provisions at Articles 9 to 11, of  the  Immigration  Act  2014
    (Commencement Number 3,  Transitional  and  Savings  Provisions)  Order
    2014, as at the date of the decision on the 18th November 2014, Section
    15 had only reduced  the  grounds  of  appeal  in  respect  of  foreign
    criminals as defined by Section 117D of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 in respect  of  decisions  on  or  after  the  20th
    October 2014 and their families if liable to deportation and in respect
    of students and their families who have made an application for Tier  4
    Leave on or after the 20th October  2014.  The  appeal  rights  of  the
    Appellant is a Tier 1 Entrepreneur, by that date had not been  altered,
    and the rights of appeal for Tier  1  Entrepreneurs  were  not  reduced
    until the 2nd March 2015. Therefore, as at the date  of  the  decision,
    the Appellant still did have a right to appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, and as was properly conceded by the Respondent, the Judge  erred
    in this regard.

12. It is also clear that the Judge erred in  deciding  the  jurisdictional
    issue, after the appeal had  already  concluded,  without  hearing  any
    submissions from the parties in respect of the same.  Given  that  this
    issue had clearly concerned the Judge after the hearing, he should have
    called the parties back for a further hearing or at the  least  invited
    written submissions in respect of the issue.  His  failure  to  do  so,
    clearly amounts to an error of law.

13. However, it is significant in this case that the procedural  unfairness
    in terms of not inviting further submissions on the jurisdiction point,
    which the Judge had not raised during the hearing, occurred  after  the
    appeal hearing had concluded. During the appeal hearing, the  Appellant
    had been given every opportunity to explain his  case  both  under  the
    Immigration Rules and in respect of Article 8. The jurisdictional issue
    had  not  arisen  until  after  the  appeal  hearing   had   concluded.
    Submissions were therefore made by and on behalf of  the  Appellant  at
    the original appeal hearing in respect  of  both  the  case  under  the
    Immigration Rules and the position in respect of Article 8.

14. Although it was argued by Mr Wilding on behalf of the  Respondent  that
    the error was not material,  I  disagree  with  that  submission.   The
    Judge's error in respect of jurisdiction clearly is material,  in  that
    if he had not made the error he would have considered the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules not simply in respect of Article 8.  I  therefore
    set aside the decision to the extent  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    MacDonald did not consider the application under the Immigration  Rules
    and remake the decision on that aspect of the case.

15. However, I preserve the findings of fact made  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge MacDonald, as these are not infected by the error and he had  the
    benefit  of  hearing  the  oral  evidence  of  the  appellant  and  the
    submissions made in respect of the case under the Immigration Rules.  I
    do not consider that the case needs to be remitted back  to  the  first
    tier  tribunal  for  rehearing,  given  the  findings  that  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge MacDonald made.  I preserve the findings  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge MacDonald at [42] that the bank account produced had not
    been adequately explained and that as at  the  3rd  November  2014  the
    Appellant's business only had �207.30 in the bank account.   I  further
    preserve his finding that there was "no plausible explanation as to why
    �49,500 suddenly appears by way of bank transfers  from  Mobile-Channel
    as shown on page 18" and found further the Appellant had  not  invested
    �25,000 as claimed at the Heathrow interview and that the appellant did
    not have an office and appeared to have very little by way of business.



16. I further preserve the finding at [44] that "looking  at  the  evidence
    before me I have  little  doubt  that  the  Appellant  manipulated  the
    situation in order to obtain his Tier 1 Entrepreneur status".

17. I further find that the Appellant's answer in his second interview that
    "yes had to pay back to them" at question 18 when asked whether or  not
    he had returned the money to his friends, established that in fact  the
    money was not properly under his control and should have been  declared
    as such. Nor am I satisfied on the evidence presented  that  the  money
    available from his father was genuinely available to him to be used for
    investment purposes, rather than  simply  being  used  as  a  means  of
    showing sufficient money in an attempt to satisfy the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules, given that the money from his  father  has  also
    been repaid to him.  Insufficient evidence has been  produced  to  show
    that that money was repaid simply as a result of a  subsequent  illness
    befalling the father.

18. Given these findings and the specific finding that  the  Appellant  had
    manipulated the situation in order to obtain his  Leave  to  Remain,  I
    dismiss the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules as it  stood
    to be refused under paragraph 321A (2) of the Immigration Rules on  the
    basis of false representations were made and material facts also  would
    not disclose, in that I do not accept the reasons set out  above,  that
    all the �50,000 said  to  have  been  available  to  him  was  in  fact
    available for the purposes of investment by him and that he made  false
    representations of such money was genuinely  available  and  failed  to
    disclose material facts that this money had been lent by  the  parties,
    which money, I find had to be repaid and that the intention was that it
    would be repaid after the appellant had obtained his visa, rather  than
    being used for investment purposes in his business.  His answer in  the
    second interview that he had to repay his friends, cannot realistically
    mean otherwise in respect of the money from them.  I therefore  dismiss
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge MacDonald does contain a  material
error of law, and is set aside to the extent that it did  not  consider  the
appeal under the Immigration Rules;

I remake the  decision,  dismissing  the  appellant  Mr  Vivekanantharajah's
appeal under the Immigration Rules;

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to  Rule  13  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Chamber)  Rules
2014 and no application for an anonymity order was made before me.  No  such
order is made.
