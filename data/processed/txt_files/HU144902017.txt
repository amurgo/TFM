For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas of the Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a Filipino born on 15 June 2000. On  19  October  2017
    his application of 7 July 2017 for entry clearance to settle  with  his
    mother,  a  naturalised  British  citizen,  was  refused  because   the
    Respondent did not consider she had had sole responsibility for him, as
    required by paragraph 297(i)(e) of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The Appellant appealed under s.82 Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 as amended and by a decision promulgated on  18  October  2018
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Peter-John White dismissed the appeal.

 3. On 12 November 2018  the  Appellant's  application  for  permission  to
    appeal was refused by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal. The Appellant
    renewed his application on the same basis and on 14 January 2019  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Kekic granted permission to appeal.

 4. On 19 February 2019 the Respondent lodged a response to the grounds  of
    appeal under Procedure Rules 24. The response did not  seek  to  oppose
    the Appellant's  appeal,  noting  that  no  reference  in  any  of  the
    pleadings or decision in the First-tier Tribunal  had  referred  to  or
    relied  on  the  jurisprudence  in  the  relevant  authority  on   sole
    responsibility, TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e); "sole  responsibility")  Yemen
    [2006] UKAIT 00049 and that consequently there was a material error  of
    law in the decision of Judge White because he had  not  considered  the
    relevant jurisprudence.

 5. At the hearing on 21 February which was  attended  by  the  Appellant's
    mother, his sponsor, the representatives for both parties  agreed  that
    the Judge's decision contained the material error of law identified  in
    the Respondent's Rule 24 response. Neither had  any  views  whether  it
    should be further considered in the Upper Tribunal  or  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. I am similarly persuaded.

 6. Having considered all the papers in the Tribunal file I  consider  that
    the Appellant might well be advised to seek to submit further  evidence
    in support of his appeal. With  this  in  mind  and  having  regard  to
    s.12(2)  Tribunal's  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007  and  Practice
    Statement 7.2.b, I consider it appropriate for the appeal to  be  heard
    afresh with no findings preserved in the First-tier Tribunal by a judge
    other than Judge White.

Anonymity

7.   There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal I find none is warranted.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside.
    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
    Anonymity direction not made.
