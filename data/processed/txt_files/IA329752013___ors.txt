Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Kosarenko
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are citizens of Ukraine born  in  1967,  1966  and  2008
    respectively.  They are wife, husband and son.

 2. The history appears to be  that  the  second  Appellant  Mr  Khibovskyy
    claimed to have entered the UK illegally in 2003, that his partner, the
    first Appellant, did so in 2004, also illegally.  Their son, the  third
    Appellant, was born in the UK.  In June 2001 they made  an  application
    for leave to  remain  on  human  rights  grounds.   The  basis  of  the
    application was their son's medical  condition.   The  application  was
    refused in September 2012 with no right of appeal.

 3. The current application made on 11 January 2013  was  for  a  residence
    card on the basis of family links to  Mr  Genadijs  Sklars,  a  Latvian
    national claiming to be exercising treaty rights in the UK.   The  link
    is that Mr Sklars' wife, Iuliia, is Mrs  Svintsitska's  daughter.   The
    Appellants are thus the EEA Sponsor's mother-in-law,  her  partner  and
    their child.  The Sponsor  married  Iuliia  Svintsitska  in  2011  with
    Iuliia being granted a residence permit valid until February 2017.

 4. On 19 July 2013 a decision was taken to  refuse  the  applications  for
    residence  cards  under  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006 on the basis that the Sponsor had  failed  to  provide
    sufficient evidence that he was exercising treaty rights in the UK.  In
    particular, that he was making national insurance contributions; paying
    the correct tax; HMRC documents  were  copies;  there  were  no  recent
    invoices   or   audited   accounts,   business   bank   statements   or
    advertisements.

 5. They appealed asking that the matter be  dealt  with  'on  papers'.   A
    bundle of documents dated 9 November 2013 was submitted.

 6. In a determination promulgated on 18 December 2013 Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Parkes dismissed the appeals under  the  EEA  Regulations
    and on human rights grounds. He appeared to find Mrs Svintsitska  be  a
    family member of the Sponsor and the other Appellants  to  be  extended
    family members (OFM).  Going on to consider the financial  evidence  he
    noted two Barclays statements but concluded that entries did not  tally
    with the Sponsor's earnings.   He  also  considered  evidence  from  an
    accountant, noting a letter  which  stated  Mr  Sklars'  monthly  gross
    income to be �2,381.  A P60 for the tax year to April 2013  showed  pay
    of only �7,020.

 7. The judge accepted that there was some evidence of  payments  from  the
    Sponsor to the Appellants but it was 'difficult to see where this money
    comes from given the low level of his taxable income, and it would have
    to be out of taxable income that the Appellants were  being  supported'
    [11].

 8. The judge then went on to say that the c �,7,000 the Sponsor earned had
    to support four adults and  two  children:-  'Economically  active  the
    Sponsor may be but his finances are clearly inadequate to  support  the
    numbers claimed' [12].  He  concluded  that  the  Appellants  were  not
    dependent.  Having noted there was no application under the Immigration
    Rules, either Appendix FM  or  paragraph  276  ADE,  he  dismissed  the
    appeals under the EEA Regulations and having considered  human  rights,
    under Articles 3 and 8.

 9. They sought permission to appeal which was granted on 6  January  2014.
    The grounds, reiterated at the error of law hearing  by  Mr  Kosarenko,
    were in essence, first, the decision to refuse was predicated  only  on
    the assertion that the Appellants had not  provided  adequate  evidence
    that their EEA national Sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights.   The
    issue of dependency was not raised in the refusal letter.  As a  matter
    of fairness this should have been put to the Appellants by  the  judge,
    at least by their being invited to make written submissions.

10. Second, while the judge correctly noted that the EEA national Sponsor's
    basic  annual  salary  was  fairly  low  (�7,000)  he  failed  to  give
    consideration to evidence from the accountant that  with  other  income
    from dividends it was nearer �30,000.  Such was relevant to  the  issue
    of dependency.

11. Mr Melvin's submission was that the judge was entitled on the  evidence
    before him to conclude that if the EEA national Sponsor was a qualified
    person there was insufficient evidence to show dependency  on  him,  in
    particular, there was little evidence of money transfers.

12. Mr Melvin noted that the Respondent did  not  raise  dependency  as  an
    issue.  The  decision  was  that  the  EEA  national  Sponsor  was  not
    economically active and thus not  a  qualified  person.   If  that  was
    correct any issue of dependency was irrelevant, so it was not  strictly
    necessary for the Respondent to consider that as a separate matter.

13. In considering this matter, as  indicated,  the  Appellants  opted  for
    their appeals to be determined without an oral hearing which they  were
    perfectly entitled to do.  I do not see that there was  any  obligation
    on the judge to invite written submissions on the issue of  dependency,
    such  being  an  issue  which  the  Appellants  must  have  been  aware
    (particularly as they have been represented throughout) required to  be
    considered by the judge were he to find, as he was urged to find,  that
    the EEA national was a qualified person, and notwithstanding this point
    not having been raised in the decision to refuse.

14.  The judge in my view did, however, err on another matter. He took  the
    view that the Sponsor's evidence of income was too low  such  that  the
    Appellants could not be shown  to  be  dependent  on  him.   He  failed
    however to have regard to evidence which was before  him  that  through
    sources in addition to his basic salary his  income  was  substantially
    greater.   Such  had  relevance  in   considering   dependency.    Also
    dependency is not just a matter of financial support.  It is a holistic
    assessment to include social and emotional support.  Although the judge
    claimed to have had  regard  to  Reyes  (EEA  Regulations:  dependency)
    [2013] UKUT 314  he made reference only  to  financial  dependency  and
    gave no consideration to other forms of  dependency  which  might  have
    been applicable.

15. I considered that in failing to have regard to  material  evidence  the
    judge erred.

16. I set aside  the  determination  in  respect  of  the  EEA  Regulations
    decisions and proceeded to remake them.

17. There was no oral evidence. In submissions  Mr  Melvin  maintained  the
    refusal.  The evidence that the EEA national is a qualified person  was
    unsatisfactory.  Even if he is, there was a lack of  evidence  to  show
    his support for the Appellants and over what time scale.    He  queried
    whether the limited evidence of money transfers had been purely for the
    application.  He noted that the Appellants had apparently been  in  the
    UK illegally.  Their history to the birth of their child  in  2008  and
    from them until the application was unclear.  Dependency was not shown.

18. Mr Kosarenko's submission was that the bank statements  showed  credits
    from the EEA national Sponsor.  The accountant's letter showed that the
    EEA national has a substantial income.  There was no assertion that the
    letter was false.  The bank statement of Mr Khibovskyy did not show any
    other cash entering his account. The dependency was not just financial.
     The third Appellant child who is seriously disabled is reliant on  the
    emotional support not only of his  parents  but  of  the  EEA  national
    Sponsor.

19. In considering this matter the only issue is whether the Appellants can
    succeed under the EEA Regulations.  No challenge was made to the First-
    tier Judge's decision to dismiss the appeals under Articles 3 and 8  of
    ECHR.

20. With regard to the Regulations,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  relevant
    paragraphs are 7 and 8.  Regulation 7 covers family members:

         '7.(1)   ... the following persons shall be treated as  the  family
               members of another person -

               (c)    dependent direct relatives in his ascending  line  or
                    that of his spouse ...'

21. It was not in dispute that the first Appellant  Mrs  Svinsitska,  being
    the mother of the EEA national's spouse was potentially a family member
    under that regulation being a direct relative in the ascending line  of
    the EEA national's spouse.

22. The case put before me by  Mr  Kosarenko  was  that  Mrs  Svintsitska's
    husband and child, the  first  and  third  Appellants,  could  not   be
    considered as family members under  Regulation  7  but  as  OFMs  under
    regulation 8.  I note that the First-tier Judge found them to  be  OFMs
    under regulation 8.

23. I agree  that  Mr  Viktor  Khibovsky,  the  second  Appellant,  who  is
    described in the statements as Mrs Svintsitska's 'partner,'  is  not  a
    direct relative in the ascending line of the spouse of the EEA national
    and thus cannot come within regulation 7.  Nor  was  it  suggested  can
    their child.





24. Regulation 8 - (1) states:

         'In these Regulations "extended family member" means a  person  who
         is not a family member of an EEA national under Regulation 7(1)(a),
         (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), [(3),
         (4) or (5)].

         (2)  A person satisfies the condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse ... and -

             (a)  the person is residing in a country other than the United
                  Kingdom in which the EEA  national  also  resides  and  is
                  dependent upon the EEA national or  is  a  member  of  his
                  household;

             ...




             (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a),  has
                  joined  the  EEA  national  in  the  United  Kingdom   and
                  continues to be dependent upon him or to be  a  member  of
                  his household.'

25. There being no evidence of any dependency  or  membership  of  the  EEA
    national's household in a country other than the UK (per 8  (2)(a))  it
    seemed to me that the second and third Appellants ( Mr  Khibovskyy  and
    the child, Pavlo) could not be OFMs and their cases could  not  succeed
    under the Regulations.  Mr Kosarenko agreed.

26. Thus the relevant Appellant is Mrs Svintsitska,  the  first  Appellant,
    under Regulation 7.  It is clear that she is the mother of  the  spouse
    of an EEA national.  The  EEA  national  Mr  Sklars  needs,  first,  to
    establish that he is a qualified person (per  regulation  6).   I  find
    that he.  There is a copy of a P60 tax form for year to 5  April  2013.
    It states his employer's name to be  PDS  Service  Ltd  and  his  gross
    salary to be �7,020.  I can see no reason why  I  cannot  rely  on  the
    contents of  that  document.   There  are  also  copies  of  pay  slips
    indicating monthly payments of �585 which indeed equates to  an  annual
    salary of �7,020.

27. I note a letter from Efficient Tax Accountants (8 November 2013)  which
    states that Mr Sklars is the  sole  director  and  shareholder  of  PDS
    Service Ltd.  On top of his basic salary he is eligible for  dividends.
    His monthly gross earnings amount to  an  average  of  �2,381  for  the
    previous twelve months.  A schedule (1 November 2012 - 31 October 2013)
    shows gross dividends of �21,466 in addition to his salary  of  �7,109.
    The problem I find with the evidence of a much larger  income  than  is
    stated in his P60 is that  it  is  not  reflected  in  any  income  tax
    documentation.

28. I noted an online income tax return (2012-13)  with  financial  details
    which included total income received of �28,551  which  after  personal
    allowance showed total income on which tax was  due  of  �20,446.   The
    problem is that the tax return is headed 'In progress - your tax return
    is  90%  complete'.   It  is  in  within  judicial  knowledge  that  on
    completion and submission of  an  online  tax  return  confirmation  of
    receipt is quickly given by HMRC by way  of  a  multi  digit  reference
    number.  Written documentation including tax  code  and  any  liability
    follows from HMRC.  There is simply no  documentation  whatsoever  from
    HMRC confirming that the tax return was submitted with  the  consequent
    income tax liabilities due to Mr Sklars.  He was in attendance  at  the
    hearing.   He  returned  after  the  hearing  and  sought  to  lodge  a
    handwritten note of a multi  digit  number  stating  that  it  was  the
    confirmation reference number of the submitted tax return.  The hearing
    having finished I declined to accept it.  In  any  event  it  does  not
    alter the position in respect of a lack of any documentation from HMRC.

29. I find, accordingly, that I cannot place reliance on  the  contents  of
    the letter from the accountants. I am not satisfied, on the balance  of
    probabilities, that Mr Sklars has income of more  than  �7,020  a  year
    gross.

30. The next issue having found that the EEA national is a qualified person
    is dependency.  It is the  dependency  of  Mrs  Svintsitska  the  first
    Appellant  as a family member on the EEA national Sponsor.  This  is  a
    question of fact.  In Maria Pedro v SSWP [2009] EWCA Civ 1358 which was
    lodged on behalf of the Appellants the Court of Appeal  confirmed  that
    dependency could be a choice and did not have to be of necessity.  Such
    was also confirmed in Lim (EEA - dependency) [2013]  UKUT  437.   Reyes
    (above) stated (at [19]), that 'questions of  dependency  must  not  be
    reduced to a bare calculation of financial  dependency  but  should  be
    construed broadly to involve a holistic  examination  of  a  number  of
    factors, including financial, physical and social conditions, so as  to
    establish whether there is dependence that is genuine'.

31. In this case the issue is dependency of  Mrs  Svintsitska  on  the  EEA
    national Mr Sklars.  I have found the evidence of Mr  Sklars'  finances
    to be very limited, around �7,000 which is  to  support  his  wife  and
    child as well as it is claimed, the Appellants.  There is  no  evidence
    of payments to  them  prior  to  February  2013  despite  their  having
    apparently been in the UK since 2003/2004. Such does  not  support  the
    claim of financial dependency. I agree with Mr Melvin that  the  timing
    suggests that they were made for the purpose of the application.  There
    is a Barclays account of the second Appellant Mr Khibovskyy  showing  a
    credit from Mr Sklars of �600 (1 February 2013), �400 (5 February 2013)
    and �400 (6 February 2013).  A further statement  shows  two  payments,
    one for �150 (26 April 2013) and �850 (1 May 2013).   In  addition  for
    the resumed hearing there are payments to Mr Khibovskyy's account  from
    PDS Services on 27 December 2013 (�375) and on 6 January  2014  (�375).
    I  cannot  see  how  with  his  very  limited  income  and  his  family
    responsibilities Mr Sklars can afford to meet such payments.  I do  not
    find that the payments genuinely reflect support  for  Mrs  Svintsitska
    and the other Appellants.   They  do  not  satisfy  me  that  they  are
    financially dependent on him. Nor is there any evidence  that  she,  an
    adult in apparently good health is dependent on Mr  Sklars  physically,
    socially, emotionally or on any other basis.

32. It was claimed that the  third  Appellant,  the  child  Pavlo,  who  is
    disabled, is emotionally dependent on the EEA  national  Sponsor.   The
    problem is that the child, as Mr  Kosarenko  accepted,  does  not  come
    within the Regulations (regulation 7 or 8).  So any dependency  on  his
    part is not relevant.  The same applies to Mr Khibovskyy.

33. There is simply no adequate evidence of dependency on the EEA  national
    Sponsor by the  first  Appellant.   Her  appeal  fails  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.  The appeals of the second and third Appellants also  fail
    under the Regulations for the reasons given.  As indicated no challenge
    was taken to the first-tier Tribunal decision  dismissing  the  appeals
    under ECHR.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error  of  law.
Its decision is set aside and remade as follows:

The appeals are dismissed under the EEA Regulations.

The appeals are dismissed on human rights grounds (ECHR)

No anonymity directions are made.
