Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms P Yong, instructed by City Legal Partnership
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Melisa Singh, date of birth 17.5.86,  is  a  citizen  of
    Guyana.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Dennis, promulgated 2.9.14, dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of  the  respondent,  dated  9.9.13,  to  refuse  her  further
    application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain   (ILR)   outside   the
    Immigration Rules on human rights grounds.  The Judge heard the  appeal
    on 17.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    17.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Dennis should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  briefly  summarised  as
    follows. The appellant first came to the UK as a minor student in 2003.
    With one break, that leave was subsequently  extended  to  28.2.10.  On
    18.4.11, after her leave to remain had long since expired, she  applied
    for ILR outside the Rules. The application and a  resubmission  of  the
    application were both rejected for non-payment of the  correct  fee.  A
    further application was submitted on 11.10.11, on the  basis  that  she
    had lived in the UK for 8 years and established a  private  and  family
    life with her aunt, Zabeena France. This too was refused, with no right
    of appeal on 26.11.11. Further submissions on the  same  basic  grounds
    were submitted on 11.1.13 and the further  refusal  of  9.9.13  is  the
    subject matter of this appeal.

 7. The appellant's claim is that having lived in the UK since 2003 she has
    established strong ties as part of her private life and close links  to
    her relatives in the UK as part  of  her  family  life.  She  expressed
    concerns about her future in Guyana,  where  employment  prospects  are
    poor.

 8. It is clear that the appellant could not meet the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain in the UK, either under paragraph
    276ADE or Appendix FM. Judge Dennis considered whether the  appellant's
    circumstances merited allowing the appeal under the article 8  ECHR  by
    applying the Razgar steps, but found that there was no protected family
    life with her aunt or other relatives and  no  such  dependency  as  to
    engage the principles of Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31.

 9. At �16 of the decision, Judge Dennis considered  whether  private  life
    should be considered outside the Rules, again referencing  Razgar.  The
    judge made an incorrect summary of the current case law when suggesting
    that "It will only be in an unusual case where the  traditional  Razgar
    approach outside these rules would be warranted." The judge went on  to
    observe that there is a "somewhat back  to  front  view",  noting  that
    whether Razgar should be considered depended on whether it would  reach
    a different conclusion.

10. Although the statement of the correct approach was somewhat muddled, it
    is clear from  �16  that  the  judge  did  consider  whether  a  Razgar
    analysis, i.e. article 8 ECHR private life  outside  the  Rules,  would
    have produced any different outcome, but concluded  that  it  would  be
    precisely the same. The reasons for that given  in  �16  are  that  the
    economic lack of opportunity or claimed lack of family in  Guyana  does
    not render the decisions of the Secretary of State, whether in 2011  or
    2013,  disproportionate.  There  were   no   unusual,   compelling   or
    compassionate circumstances. The judge noted  that  the  appellant  was
    simply unwilling to face the same  circumstances  her  fellow  citizens
    face in Guyana. The judge also  noted  the  appellant's  failure  as  a
    student and that she "appears to have invested no effort at all to  her
    own or her aunt's benefit" whilst  in  the  UK.  In  essence,  all  the
    appellant had done was to come to the UK as a student, fail to complete
    her studies and simply by inertia, remained living with  her  aunt  and
    taking advantage of life in the UK to which she was not entitled.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Hollingworth found  that  there
    was an arguable error of law in relation to  the  judge's  approach  to
    article 8. It is suggested that the judge failed  to  set  out  why  he
    would have reached  the  same  conclusion  if  article  8  were  to  be
    considered outside the Rules.

12. The Rule 24 response accepts that the judge's language  is  convoluted,
    but submitted that "it is clear when the determination  is  read  as  a
    whole what the judge found." Further, "the appellant  did  not  have  a
    family life with her aunt and was reliant  on  her  private  life.  The
    judge indicates that he is considering the  flow  of  authorities  that
    resulted from codification of the rules. The judge  notes  that  it  is
    only in an unusual case that an appellant will be successful. The judge
    concludes that there is no good arguable case  to  proceed  to  a  full
    Razgar style analysis. There after the judge considers  the  matter  in
    the alternative and concludes on the facts that the appellant's removal
    would not be disproportionate.  On  close  analysis  the  findings  are
    clear. Such a finding is fully open to him."

13.  With  respect  to  Judge  Hollingworth,  I  agree  with  the  Rule  24
    submissions and those of Mr Avery at the hearing before me that  whilst
    the decision could have been set  out  more  clearly,  it  covered  the
    essential grounds of the Rules and article 8  outside  the  Rules.  The
    judge was satisfied at �14 that the 2011 application had  been  decided
    and served on the appellant so that the further submissions of 2013 did
    not render  this  a  pre-July  2012  application.  The  respondent  was
    entitled to consider the application under  the  Rules  of  276ADE  and
    Appendix FM.

14. Article 8 first has to be considered under Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE.


15. Ms Yong submitted that the judge  did  not  consider  paragraph  276ADE
    properly and did not consider the issue of ties to Guyana. However,  it
    is clear from �14 that it was not contended at the First-tier  Tribunal
    that the appellant could meet any of the Rules; the case was put on the
    basis of article 8 outside the Rules. The appellant had been in the  UK
    over 10 years but had spent the previous 17 in Guyana,  where  she  was
    born and raised. The judge was doubtful of her evidence about  lack  of
    family in Guyana, noting at �8 that she at first  denied  even  knowing
    who her parents were but later was able to recall their names. Even  if
    the appellant did not have any immediate family in Guyana, it is  clear
    that she must have retained cultural ties, and had completed  her  high
    school education there. The judge reached the conclusion that in coming
    to the UK the appellant had no intention to return and in effect was an
    economic migrant. In the circumstances there was no material  error  of
    law in failing to consider paragraph  276ADE.  It  is  clear  that  the
    appellant does not meet the requirements of Appendix  FM.  Neither  can
    she meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE.


16. In relation to article 8, at paragraph 17  of  Razgar  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of  Cornhill
    stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


17. However, in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192,  the  Court  of
    Appeal held that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration
    Rules  are  a  complete  code  but  involve  the   application   of   a
    proportionality test. Whether that is done  within  the  new  rules  or
    outside the new rules  as  part  of  the  article  8  general  law  was
    described as a sterile question, as either way the result should be the
    same; what  matters  is  that  proportionality  balancing  exercise  is
    required to be carried out. In other words, a proportionality  test  is
    required whether under the new rules or article  8.  MF  (Nigeria)  was
    followed in Kabia (MF: para 398  -  "exceptional  circumstances")  2013
    UKUT 00569 (IAC).


18. More recently, Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
    [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) has set out, inter alia, that  on  the  current
    state of the authorities:


            (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on  the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);


19. Although case law continues to develop, the current position is perhaps
    best expressed in paragraph 135 of  R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."

20. Judges should also recall that the threshold to engage article 8(1)  is
    not particularly high (see VW (Uganda) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5).

21. Ms Yong also relied on Ganesabalan v SSHD  [2014]  EWHC  2712,  to  the
    effect that paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM are not  a  complete  code
    for article 8 compatability; there should always be a second  stage  of
    consideration of the exercise of discretion outside the Rule.

22. To that extent the  approach  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  was
    incorrect. However, on the facts of this case, I find that,  whilst  it
    could have been  expressed  more  clearly,  the  judge  has  in  effect
    considered the appellant's private and family life claims  outside  the
    Rules and that there is therefore no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

23. In relation to family life, Kugathas concerned an adult's  relationship
    with his mother and adult siblings, the Court of  Appeal  thought  that
    the following passage in S v United Kingdom [1984] 40 DR 196 was  still
    relevant:

         "... generally, the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
         involves cohabiting dependants, such as parents and their dependent
         minor children. Whether it extends to other  relationships  depends
         on the circumstances of the particular case. Relationships  between
         adults ... would not necessarily acquire the protection of  Article
         8 of  the  Convention  without  evidence  of  further  elements  of
         dependency, involving more than the normal emotional ties."

24. In Ghising (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) Nepal [2012] UKUT 160
    (IAC) it was held that:

         "1. A review of  the  jurisprudence  discloses  that  there  is  no
         general proposition that Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
         Human Rights can never be engaged when the family life it is sought
         to establish is between adult siblings living together. Rather than
         applying a blanket rule with regard to adult  children,  each  case
         should be analysed on its own  facts,  to  decide  whether  or  not
         family life exists, within the meaning of Article 8(1). Whilst some
         generalisations are possible, each case is fact-sensitive.

25. I find that it was open to the  judge  to  come  to  conclusion  on  an
    assessment of the appellant's circumstances that her  life  in  the  UK
    with her aunt and other family members did not amount to  family  life.
    The judge has considered the issue and given reasons for reaching  that
    conclusion. It cannot be said that the conclusion was perverse  or  one
    to which no other judge could come. In the circumstances, there  is  no
    material error of law  disclosed  in  the  finding  that  there  is  no
    protected family life that could engage article 8 ECHR.

26. The judge  also  considered  whether  a  Razgar  consideration  of  the
    appellant's private life rights under article 8 ECHR would produce  any
    different outcome to the consideration under paragraph 276ADE.  I  find
    that within the decision there are all the elements  and  consideration
    of the relevant factors as to private life. The  appellant's  entry  to
    the UK was as a student. She had no  legitimate  expectation  of  being
    able to remain in the UK except  in  accordance  with  the  Rules.  She
    failed to continue as a student and failed to leave. It is quite  clear
    that she came to the UK with the dishonest intention of settling  here,
    encouraged to do so by her  aunt.  Article  8  is  not  a  shortcut  to
    compliance with the  Rules.  She  does  not  meet  the  20  years  long
    residence requirement. Neither  can  she  meet  the  other  aspects  of
    paragraph 276ADE, even if she no longer has immediate family in Guyana.
    She is now some 28 years of age and one would expect a person  of  that
    age to be making his or  her  own  way  in  the  world.  There  are  no
    particularly compelling, compassionate or exceptional circumstances  in
    this case; the appellant simply does not want to return to  Guyana  and
    wants to continue living in the UK. As cases such as  Nasim  and  Patel
    have explained, temporary admission as a student does not give rise  to
    a right to remain on the basis of private life and the  return  of  the
    appellant to Guyana does not  interfere  with  her  moral  or  physical
    integrity.

27. Even if the judge of the First-tier Tribunal had given a more elaborate
    treatment of article 8 private and/or family life, I find  that  it  is
    inevitable that the appeal would have been dismissed. The appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal does no more than clutch at straws by seeking to exploit
    a certain lack of clarity or defect in the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. It is clear  to  me  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was one fully open to the judge on the evidence  and  frankly,
    properly directed, no other judge could  or  would  have  come  to  any
    different conclusion on the facts of this case.

28. Ms Yong sought to argue a new issue, that the  appellant  would  be  at
    risk on return as a young single female.  However,  the  appellant  has
    made no asylum or humanitarian protection claim and this  is  an  issue
    that has not been  raised  with  the  respondent  or  in  the  previous
    hearing.  If the appellant wishes to pursue this matter she should make
    the appropriate application. My task is to consider whether the  First-
    tier Tribunal made an error of law in the making of the  decision  such
    that it should  be  set  aside  and  remade.  This  is  not  a  further
    opportunity to reargue the case.

Conclusion & Decision

29. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
