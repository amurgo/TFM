                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal  who  allowed  the  appeal  of  Ms  Bademosi  ("the
    claimant").   The  claimant  had  appealed  against  the   respondent's
    decision of 20 April 2015 to  refuse  to  issue  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right of residence as  a  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national.

Background Facts

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 29  September  1979.   The
    claimant applied for a student visa which was granted on  21  May  2009
    and which was valid until 31 July 2009.  She  was  then  given  further
    student visas valid to 11 October 2014. The claimant married  Abdoulaye
    Bagate on 28 July 2014. On 29 September 2014 the claimant applied for a
    residence card which was refused by the  Secretary  of  State.   On  13
    November 2014 she applied again for a residence card.  The Secretary of
    State refused the application for the residence card  considering  that
    the claimant did not have a right to reside under Regulation  14(1)  of
    the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations   2006   (the
    'Regulations'). The Secretary of State had invited the claimant and the
    sponsor, on two occasions, to attend for interview to verify  that  the
    claimant's  right  to  residence  was  genuine.  The  respondent   also
    considered that the claimant had not provided  sufficient  evidence  to
    demonstrate that the sponsor was exercising treaty rights in the United
    Kingdom.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The claimant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a  decision
    promulgated on 15 September 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Dhaliwal
    allowed the claimant's appeal.  The Tribunal found that the sponsor was
    a qualified person under Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations  and  that
    the claimant fell within the definition of a spouse.  The Tribunal  was
    not satisfied that the  Secretary  of  State  had  set  out  sufficient
    grounds establishing a reasonable doubt which satisfied the  evidential
    burden upon her.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal


 4. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge erred in  law  in
    allowing the appeal, having found that the Secretary of State could not
    have had a reasonable doubt about the claimant's right to reside. On  2
    February 2016 First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted the Secretary
    of State permission to appeal.  The grant of permission sets  out  that
    as by the date of application the clamant  was  an  overstayed,  it  is
    arguable that the Secretary of State was entitled to have doubts  about
    the claimant's right to reside and that as the  claimant  was  applying
    for a document under Part 3 of the Regulations the Secretary  of  State
    was entitled to call her for an interview.

Summary of Submissions

The Secretary of State's Submissions

 5. It is asserted in the grounds of  appeal  that  conducting  a  marriage
    interview is part of the process in  order  to  verify  the  claimant's
    claim and that the Secretary of State was  entitled  to  request  this.
    The Secretary of State considered that, as the claimant was issued with
    multiple student visas from 2009 and applied for the residence card  on
    13  November  2014  after  her  student  visa  had  expired,  this  was
    sufficient to cause her to suspect that the claimant  did  not  have  a
    right to reside in the UK.  The Secretary  of  State  asserts  that  as
    there were two invitations to attend an interview made under Regulation
    20B(2)(b) and the  persons  invited  have  failed  to  attend  on  both
    occasions, then Regulation 20B(4) applies.  This sets out:

         "(4) If, without good reason, A or B fail to provide the additional
             information requested or, fail to attend an  interview  on  at
             least two occasions if so invited, the Secretary of State  may
             draw any factual inferences about A's entitlement to  a  right
             to reside as appear appropriate in the circumstances."

 6. The Secretary of State submits that the failure to attend two  marriage
    interviews without good reason is sufficient to allow her to  draw  any
    factual inferences about the  claimant's  entitlement  to  a  right  to
    reside and to find that the claimant does not have or ceased to have  a
    right to reside in the UK.  The Secretary of State refers to the First-
    tier Tribunal's decision at paragraph  4  submitting  that  the  judge,
    having found it unusual that two letters would  go  astray,  failed  to
    give any adequate reason  to  why  it  was  inappropriate  for  factual
    inferences to be drawn.  It is further  asserted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal wrongly considered that no  issue  had  been  taken  with  the
    sponsor's documentation and that she was a  qualified  person  for  the
    purposes of  the  Regulations  and  that  therefore  the  claimant  was
    entitled to a residence card.  The Secretary of State asserts that  she
    had not accepted that the EEA sponsor was a  qualified  person  because
    despite attempting to  verify  the  sponsor's  employment  on  multiple
    occasions she had been unable to do so.  It is asserted that the First-
    tier Tribunal failed to have any regard to this  in  assessing  whether
    the claimant's EEA sponsor was a qualified person.   The  Secretary  of
    State submits that  the  judge  erred  in  finding  that  she  had  not
    discharged the evidential burden.  It is asserted that the  failure  of
    the claimant and the sponsor to attend the interviews was sufficient to
    allow the Secretary of State to draw adverse inferences and as such the
    burden was discharged.  On that basis the Secretary  of  State  submits
    that it was therefore for the claimant and the sponsor  to  demonstrate
    at the appeal that the claimant was entitled to reside in the UK.

 7. Mr Tufan relied on the  grounds  of  appeal.   He  submitted  that  the
    striking feature of this case was that neither the Secretary  of  State
    nor the court have ever seen the claimant.  He submitted that  in  view
    of the immigration history, namely that the claimant was a student  who
    had made a number of applications, had applied  for  a  residence  card
    which was refused, the Secretary of State was  correct  to  invite  the
    claimant to attend an interview.  He submitted that the judge was wrong
    to consider that the Secretary of State cannot invite the  claimant  to
    an interview and that this finding was very perplexing.   He  submitted
    that with regard to the two invitations to  attend  interview,  neither
    the claimant nor the sponsor attended.  The whole reason for Regulation
    20B is to enable the Secretary of State to determine whether or not the
    marriage is valid.  If the claimant does not attend for  interview  the
    Secretary of State cannot reach a decision.  He submitted that  it  was
    within the domain of the Secretary of State to conclude whether or  not
    the marriage was genuine.  What the judge could at most do would be  to
    allow the appeal to the extent that the Secretary of State make  a  new
    decision.  He submitted that there is nothing in joint names within the
    documents and that a number of documents do not appear  to  be  in  the
    name of the sponsor.  He referred for example to the document at 17  in
    the bundle before the First-tier Tribunal to  the  letter  from  Thames
    Water which is addressed to Mr B Abdoulah.  He submitted that it is not
    clear who this document is addressed to.  With  reference  to  the  pay
    slips submitted from RCCG School of Disciples, the postal  address  was
    in Hertfordshire whereas the claimant lives in Kent.  The Secretary  of
    State had made efforts to confirm the employment with the employer  and
    had been unable to make contact.  With regard to the P60s  these  could
    have been written by anyone.  He submitted there were no  letters  from
    either of the employers.  He had tried to find out who the employer  AK
    & CA Onita were without success.  At page 35 of  the  bundle  were  pay
    slips belonging to a Michael Giraud also employed by AK & CA Onita.  It
    is not clear who Michael Giraud is and what  relevance  his  pay  slips
    have.  Although bank statements have been submitted they did not  match
    up with any of the pay slips and were not evidence of salary paid  into
    the bank account despite a  number  of  entries  being  highlighted  as
    salary paid in.  He submitted that the claimant  and  the  sponsor  had
    failed to attend two invitations for interviews.  They did  not  attend
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and they did not attend  the
    hearing today.  He submitted that the claimant had been sent directions
    by the Upper Tribunal indicating that if a material error  of  law  was
    found  the  matter  would  proceed  to  a  continuation  hearing.   The
    claimants were not here today to give evidence had it been required.

Oral Submissions for the Claimant

 8. Dr Omipede  submitted  that  the  claimant's  immigration  history  was
    perfectly normal, she had never been refused a student  visa,  she  had
    made her application before the expiration of the  student  visa.   Her
    initial application for an EEA residence card was rejected not refused.
    It was rejected  because  of  non-payment.   After  the  rejection  the
    claimant had reapplied for the residence card.  He submitted  that  the
    decision of the judge contained no material error  of  law.   The  test
    required was that the Secretary of State must have a  reasonable  doubt
    before the claimants were invited for  interview  for  the  purpose  of
    Regulation 20B.  The judge accepted that the claimant did  not  receive
    the two letters.  There was an issue with regard to the  address  which
    was pointed out by the claimant in her witness statement.  He submitted
    that the Secretary of State did not provide any documents regarding the
    letters inviting the claimant for interview.   He  submitted  that  the
    judge made a valid conclusion.  He  asserted  that  the  judge  had  to
    consider whether there was a valid marriage and whether the sponsor was
    exercising treaty rights.  He submitted that there was no evidence from
    the Home Office as to what calls were made to the  sponsor's  employer.
    He submitted that the bank statements  supported  payments  being  made
    into the bank account that represented the claimant's pay.  I indicated
    to Dr Omipede that I could find no link between the  amounts  shown  on
    the pay slips and the amounts that were credited to the  bank  account.
    He checked the accounts and the pay slips and accepted  that  that  was
    correct.  He submitted that the judge was entitled  to  find  that  the
    claimant and the sponsor were living together, there did not need to be
    letters in  joint  names,  both  claimant  and  sponsor  had  submitted
    official letters at the same address.  He  submitted  that  there  were
    often errors in names on  documents  and  that  the  claimant  and  the
    sponsor should not be prejudiced by others' mistakes.

Discussion

 9. I propose to deal firstly with the documents in support of the  sponsor
    exercising treaty rights as I find that there was a material  error  of
    law in the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision.   The  judge  sets  out  at
    paragraph 15 of the decision:

         "Furthermore, when I take note of the fact that included  with  the
         initial application were copies of the  marriage  certificate,  the
         French identity card and indeed the wage slips and  that  no  issue
         was taken with the authenticity of these documents, I take the view
         that I am able to accept them."

10. At paragraph 17 of the decision the judge found:

         "... On the basis of his wage slips which were  produced  with  his
         initial application and further wage  slips  contained  within  the
         appellant's bundle, he appears to have  two  jobs,  one  with  RCCG
         School of Disciples and another with AK & CA Onita, I am  satisfied
         that he falls within the definition of a  worker.   Indeed  he  has
         produced P60s for each of the two jobs, and on  that  basis,  I  am
         satisfied that he is a qualified person who  is  exercising  treaty
         rights."

11. This was an appeal  decided  on  the  papers  at  the  request  of  the
    appellant.  In the Reasons for Refusal Letter the  Secretary  of  State
    set out:

         "You have stated that your EEA family member is employed  and  have
         provided three wage slips dated 31  January,  28  February  and  30
         September 2014.  On 25 April 2015, multiple attempts were  made  to
         contact  your  sponsor's  employer  in  order  to   confirm   their
         employment.  On these occasions, we were  unable  to  contact  your
         sponsor's  employer  and  therefore   unable   to   confirm   their
         employment.

         Whilst every attempt has been made  by  the  UK  Border  Agency  to
         establish your EEA family member's employment the burden  of  proof
         rests with the applicant to provide  such  evidence  and  you  have
         failed to do so.

         It  is  therefore  concluded  that  you  have  failed  to   provide
         sufficient evidence to demonstrate that your EEA family  member  is
         currently a qualified person in the United Kingdom as a worker,  as
         detailed under Regulation 6 of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
         2006."

12. The judge has failed to engage at all with  the  Secretary  of  State's
    reason for not accepting that the sponsor was exercising treaty rights.
     The judge has not  considered  or  engaged  with  the  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State was unable to confirm the claimant's employment with
    RCCG School of Disciples.  It was incumbent upon the judge  to  provide
    adequate reasons as to  why  in  spite  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    inability to confirm the sponsor's employment with  his  employer,  she
    was prepared to  accept  the  evidence  that  the  sponsor  was  indeed
    employed by RCCG School of Disciples.  The judge  does  not  appear  to
    have questioned why pay  slips  from  AK  &  CA  Onita  for  a  totally
    unrelated person, Michael Giraud, were submitted by the  claimant.   As
    submitted by  Mr  Tufan,  P60s  are  not  necessarily  confirmative  of
    employment.  He also noted that  only  the  copies  of  documents  were
    submitted, no originals have been submitted.

13. I find the judge failed to consider at all  that  there  might  be  any
    doubt as to the sponsor's employment with RCCG School of Disciples. The
    judge has ignored the evidence set out  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    Reasons for Refusal Letter that despite several attempts the  sponsor's
    employer could not be contacted to confirm  the  sponsor's  employment.
    The judge has failed to  give  any  adequate  reasons  as  to  why  she
    accepted that the evidence  of  the  employment  with  RCCG  School  of
    Disciples was genuine. In the Reasons for Refusal Letter,  as  set  out
    above, the Secretary of State made it clear that the  burden  of  proof
    rested with the applicant to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate
    that the sponsor is currently a qualified person as a worker.

14. I have considered the documentation carefully and note  that  the  bank
    statements submitted in support of  the  claimant's  appeal,  which  Dr
    Omipede submitted clearly showed salary payments into the account, were
    not borne out by those bank statements and  in  fact,  despite  payment
    being made by way of BACS from AK & CA Onita, none  of  those  payments
    set out on the pay slips  have  been  paid  into  the  claimant's  bank
    account.  For example, on 30 December 2014 the claimant's net  pay  was
    �732.80, payment method being BACS.  There is no corresponding  deposit
    into the claimant's bank account either direct by the  employer  or  by
    way of a deposit.  The same applies to the payment purportedly by  BACS
    of �745.96 on 30 November 2014. The judge was clearly influenced by the
    P60s. She found:

         "...Indeed, he has produced P60s for each of the two jobs,  and  on
         that basis, I am satisfied that he is a  qualified  person  who  is
         exercising treaty rights."

15. P60s are documents issued by employers. If it  was  doubtful  that  the
    wage slips from RCCG School of Disciples were not genuine  then  a  P60
    would not take that evidence any further. I find  that  the  judge  has
    failed to critically analyse the evidence before her when  arriving  at
    her conclusions, has erroneously considered that  no  issue  was  taken
    with the payslips by the Secretary of State, has failed to engage  with
    the Secretary of State's assertions in the reasons for  refusal  letter
    and has failed in light of those assertions to  give  adequate  reasons
    for her findings.

16. I find that there are material errors of law in the Tribunal's decision
    on this ground of appeal.

17. With regard to the  first  ground  of  appeal  the  judge  set  out  at
    paragraph 11  of  the  decision  that  Regulation  20B(1)  of  the  EEA
    Regulations applies when the Secretary of State has a reasonable  doubt
    as to whether a person has a right to  reside.   At  paragraph  12  the
    judge sets out that the only grounds relied on were that  a  number  of
    student visas had been issued to the claimant, that she got married  on
    28 July 2014 and applied for a residence card on 13 November 2014.   In
    fact, the claimant applied for a residence card on  29  September  2014
    which was before her leave had expired.  This application as  clarified
    by Dr Omipede was rejected purely on the basis that  the  fee  had  not
    been submitted.  The application was not refused.  The judge  found  as
    set out at paragraph 13 that in the absence of anything more, she could
    not be satisfied that the respondent had a reasonable doubt to be  able
    to exercise her discretion to call  the  claimant  and  spouse  for  an
    interview.  I take it from that paragraph that the  judge  was  clearly
    referring to Regulation 20B and not a general discretion  available  to
    the Secretary of State who may invite a claimant and a sponsor  for  an
    interview.  The judge sets out at paragraph 13:

         "I accept that she may well have had a mere suspicion but that is a
         much lower standard than a reasonable doubt.  I therefore  conclude
         that the respondent did not  have  the  grounds  to  exercise  that
         discretion."

18. On the basis of the factual scenario in this case, that was  a  finding
    that the judge was entitled to reach.  It  was  a  finding  within  the
    provisions of Regulation 20B of the  EEA  Regulations  which  sets  out
    clearly that the Secretary of State has to have a reasonable  doubt  as
    to whether a person has the right  to  reside  for  Regulation  20B  to
    apply.  The judge was entitled to arrive at  the  conclusion  that  she
    came to.  As the judge states, a mere suspicion is not  sufficient  and
    there was nothing adverse in the claimant's immigration history, timing
    of marriage  or  application  for  a  residence  card  that  the  judge
    considered would be sufficient to give  rise  to  a  reasonable  doubt.
    Whilst I may have come to a different view, the finding  of  the  judge
    was open to the judge to make.

19. With regard to the judge's findings that the  marriage  is  valid,  the
    starting point is that the claimant had  submitted  her  passport,  her
    sponsor's French identity card and a  marriage  certificate.   Evidence
    from official sources indicates that they are both living at  the  same
    address albeit that there are no documents in joint names.  The judge's
    findings that the marriage was not a marriage contracted for  the  sole
    or decisive purpose of gaining admission or  remaining  in  the  United
    Kingdom was a finding that was open to the judge.

20. Although the grant of permission to appeal set that it is arguable that
    as the claimant was applying  for  a  document  under  Part  3  of  the
    Regulations this argument was  not  advanced  at  the  hearing  by  eth
    Secretary of State.

Re-Making the Decision

21. I have considered whether or not I can proceed to remake  the  decision
    on the exercise of treaty rights point.  This was an appeal  considered
    on the papers before the First-tier  Tribunal.   I  therefore  consider
    that I can remake the  decision  on  the  papers  before  me.   I  have
    considered carefully the documents submitted by the claimant in support
    of her appeal.  Despite the Secretary of State alerting the claimant to
    the fact that they could  not  obtain  confirmation  of  the  sponsor's
    employment with RCCG School of Disciples and that the burden  of  proof
    rested with the claimant to provide sufficient evidence to  demonstrate
    that the sponsor was working in the UK, the claimant submitted  only  a
    P60.  No other evidence  was  submitted  such  as  a  letter  from  the
    employer confirming the sponsor's employment with them.  A P60,  whilst
    being supportive evidence, is not in my view  sufficient  to  discharge
    the burden on the claimant in  the  circumstances  pertaining  in  this
    case, namely that the Secretary of State had attempted on a  number  of
    occasions to contact the claimant's  employer.   Mr  Tufan  provided  a
    geographical indication that the address of RCCG  School  of  Disciples
    was in Hertfordshire whilst the  sponsor  lives  in  Kent.  This  is  a
    considerable distance to travel for work. Neither the claimant nor  the
    sponsor  were  available  to  provide  any  explanation.   Whilst  that
    evidence was not admissible on the error of law decision  I  take  that
    into consideration in  re-making  the  decision  when  considering  the
    documents in relation to this employment and the reasons set out in the
    Reasons for Refusal Letter.  I also take into  consideration  that  the
    bank statements which were purportedly submitted in support of salaries
    being paid into the claimant's  bank  account  do  not  show  that  the
    claimant's pay from his employment with AK & CA Onita (or  RCCG  School
    of Disciples) were in fact made into his bank account.  The  pay  slips
    for AK & CA Onita indicate that the payment method is  BACS  but  there
    are no corresponding payments into the bank account by the employer for
    the relevant dates.  Further the amounts paid in by way  of  cheque  do
    not appear to match up with the pay slips provided in respect of  dates
    or amounts for either employment. In light of the fact that Mr  Omipede
    submitted that  the  bank  statements  were  included  as  evidence  of
    payments made into the bank accounts, with regard to the employment  by
    AK & CA Onita I am not satisfied that the claimant has  discharged  the
    burden of proving that the sponsor is employed.  Mr Tufan asserted that
    in preparation for the hearing he had attempted to  find  out  who  the
    employer AK & CA Onita was without success. I do not understand why pay
    slips from AK & CA  Onita  for  a  totally  unrelated  person,  Michael
    Giraud, were submitted by the claimant. Had the claimant  attended  the
    hearing an explanation might have been provided. In light of  the  fact
    that the claimant was  on  notice  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    concerns regarding the sponsor's employment and  therefore  whether  or
    not he was exercising treaty  rights,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    claimant has discharged the burden  of  proving  that  the  sponsor  is
    employed by AK & CA Onita or RCCG School of Disciples.   The  P60  that
    has been provided is supportive evidence but as a P60 is not a document
    provided by anyone other than the  employer,  and  given  that  I  have
    doubts with regards to the employment with AK & CA Onita based  on  the
    lack of any pay going into the sponsor's bank account for the  relevant
    period (where the payment  method  is  BACS),  it  does  not  take  the
    claimant any further.  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor  is  a
    qualified person in the UK exercising treaty  rights.   The  burden  is
    upon the claimant to  prove  that  the  sponsor  is  exercising  treaty
    rights.  The claimant has not discharged the burden of proof.

22. As I am not satisfied on the evidence that the sponsor is  a  qualified
    person  under  Regulation  6,  the  claimant's  appeal  fails  and  the
    Secretary of State's decision on the exercise of treaty rights  stands.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision contained material errors  of  law  as  set
out above.  I set aside that decision.  I remake the  decision.   I  dismiss
the claimant's appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decision  that  the
sponsor  was  not  a  qualified  person  under  Regulation  6  of  the   EEA
Regulations.

I  have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously.  Having
considered  all  the  circumstances  and  evidence  I  do  not  consider  it
necessary to make an anonymity direction.
