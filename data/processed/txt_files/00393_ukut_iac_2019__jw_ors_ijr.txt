R (on the application of JW and Others) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department (Tier 1 Investor; control; investments) [2019] UKUT 00393 (IAC)


                               Upper Tribunal
                       Immigration and Asylum Chamber


                       Judicial Review Decision Notice







            The Queen on the application of JW & GW and Jiaqi Wu
                                                                  Applicants
                                      v


                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



   Before Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington and Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson




   1. The meaning of 'control' in  paragraph  245ED(e)  and  in  Appendix  A
      (specifically in Table 8B and 9B) of the Immigration Rules  is  to  be
      interpreted in accordance  with  its  natural  and  ordinary  meaning,
      namely that a person has the authority to manage and/or direct the use
      of the money, asset or investment  (depending  on  the  context).   It
      includes not just a question of  legal  or  beneficial  ownership  but
      includes an element of choice of use.   The  money  must  be  under  a
      person's control at the point of investment.


   2. To determine whether  a  person  has  the  requisite  control,  it  is
      necessary to look at all of the facts and circumstances  of  the  case
      and with reference to the overriding requirement in paragraph 245ED(e)
      of the Immigration Rules (at least for the purposes of an  application
      for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant)  that  the
      "assets and investment he is claiming points for must be wholly  under
      his control".

   3. The terms listed in paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A to  the  Immigration
      Rules are not to be interpreted by reference to statutory  definitions
      outside of the Immigration Rules but in accordance with  the  ordinary
      rules of interpretation applicable to the Immigration Rules, the terms
      bearing their ordinary and natural meaning.
            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Ms A Weston QC, Mr R Toal and  Mr  R  D'Cruz  of
Counsel, instructed by Lu Oliphant Solicitors, on behalf of  the  Applicants
and Ms J Anderson and Mr Z Malik of Counsel, instructed  by  the  Government
Legal Department on behalf of the Respondent, at a hearing at  Field  House,
London on 17 and 20 May 2019.

Anonymity Direction

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order.  Unless the Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the Applicants  in
JR/2469/2018.  This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties.   Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings.


      Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

 1.  This  is  the  decision  of  Tribunal,  to  which  both  members  have
    contributed.


 2. The first application for Judicial Review is brought by JW  &  GW,  who
    are mother and  dependent  child;  both  of  whom  are  subject  to  an
    Anonymity Order.  In this decision they are identified as  A1  and  A2.
    A2's claim is entirely dependent on  the  outcome  of  the  substantive
    challenge in A1's  claim  and  there  is  no  distinct  or  substantive
    challenge to his refusal of leave to remain as a dependent of A1.   The
    second application for Judicial Review is brought by Jiaqi Wu, referred
    to as Ms Wu in this decision.  The two claims have been linked  due  to
    similarity of the facts and issues raised.

 3. A1 challenges the Respondent's decision of 20 December 2017  to  refuse
    her application for further leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Investor)
    Migrant, upheld on Administrative Review on 6  February  2018;  and  A2
    challenges the consequent decision of  the  Respondent  to  refuse  his
    application for leave to remain as a dependent of A1.  Ms Wu challenges
    the Respondent's decision of 22 December 2017 to refuse her application
    for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor)  Migrant,  upheld
    on Administrative Review on 6 February 2018.  Both A1  and  Ms  Wu  had
    previously been granted limited leave to remain as  Tier  1  (Investor)
    Migrants, respectively seeking an extension  of  leave  to  remain  and
    indefinite leave to remain in the same category.


Background facts

 4. A1 and Ms Wu were both sold  a  product,  by  Maxwell  Holding  Limited
    ("Maxwell Holding"), by  which  both  the  investment  and  immigration
    elements of the Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant route were to  be  satisfied.
    In both cases, the applicants obtained unsecured loans, in A1's case of
    �1 million and in Ms Wu's  case  of  �5  million,  from  Maxwell  Asset
    Management Ltd ("Maxwell") which they both invested in Eclectic Capital
    Limited ("Eclectic").  These  two  applicants  were  amongst  over  100
    individuals who similarly obtained loans of �1  million  or  over  from
    Maxwell, the funds from which were also invested in Eclectic.


 5. To understand the nature of  the  applications  for  leave  to  remain,
    reasons for refusal and grounds of challenge in these applications  for
    Judicial Review, it is necessary to set out in some detail  information
    about the companies involved, as well as the structure  and  agreements
    between them and the applicants.  Save for the existence of and  detail
    of the original Services Agreements between each applicant and  Maxwell
    Holding (which were only disclosed to  the  Respondent  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal during the course of the oral hearing before us), all  of  the
    information which follows was before the Respondent at the time of  the
    decisions under challenge, either from the applications  made  or  from
    information in the public domain.


Maxwell Holding Limited

 6. Maxwell Holding is a company registered  and  incorporated  in  Jersey,
    whose director is Mr Dmitry Petrovich Kirpichenko ("DPK").


 7. On 23 October 2013, A1 entered into what is described  as  a  "Services
    Agreement" with Maxwell Holding (referred to in the  agreement  as  the
    "Company") in  which  the  latter  was  to  provide  A1  with  services
    pertaining to her intention to obtain a UK visa as a Tier 1  (Investor)
    for a service fee of �200,000.  The specific  nature  of  the  services
    provided are set out in clause 2 of the Services Agreement[1], which so
    far as relevant are as follows:


    "2.2   Considering set out in Section 2.1 point of this Agreement,  the
    Company
           . will advise the Client on compliance with the requirements  of
             legislation of the United Kingdom to persons applying for  the
             UK Visa Tier 1 (Investor), as well as the  quantum  nature  of
             the investment activities of Clients required to obtain a Visa
             type Tier 1 (Investor) of the United Kingdom.
           . will inform the Client of the requirements of  United  Kingdom
             legislation regarding the credit obligations of the Client and
             their enforcement under law.
           . will assist the Client in the process of  opening  an  account
             with credit institutions, and will  also  provide  the  Client
             with information about loan products and fees on  services  at
             credit organizations.

      2.3   The Company also
           . will conduct negotiations about loan arrangements on behalf of
             the Client and on the terms agreed with the Client,  with  the
             Manager, as well as helping in  to  prepare  and  deliver  the
             required documents to the Manager.
           . will act as guarantor of the Client's loan repayments  to  the
             Manager.
           . will ensure timely execution of  the  Client's  loan  interest
             payment schedule by Client, without the involvement  of  extra
             cash.
           .  will  provide  other  services  within  its   competence   in
             accordance with the intentions of the Client  as  set  out  in
             Section 2.1 point of this Agreement."

 8. The 'Manager' is defined in section  1  of  the  agreement  as  meaning
    "Maxwell Asset Management Ltd., the company authorized by the Financial
    Conduct Authority UK, duly registered in the United Kingdom".


 9. Section 3 of the Services Agreement sets out  a  schedule  of  activity
    with obligations on both parties.  So far as is relevant to the  issues
    in the current proceedings, this included the following provisions  and
    obligations on the part of the Client:


    "3.3.3 Open (with  the  Company's  and  the  Manager's  assistance)  an
           investment  account  at  the  UK  Bank   under   the   Manager's
           management, in case if it is necessary in a Manager's opinion.


    3.3.4  Attend a face-to-face meeting with the Manager, in order to sign
           the original this Agreement and Loan Agreement, as  well  as  to
           provide the Manager with the  originals  of  all  the  documents
           legalized in accordance with  the  law  of  UK  as  required  by
           Section 3.1.1 point of this Agreement, if the documents were not
           provided before.


    3.4    The Client hereby agrees to grant the Company Power of Attorney,
           or other document which allows the Company to act on  behalf  of
           the Client or to represent its interests on  issues  related  to
           the provision of services under this Agreement.
    ...
    3.7    After executing the Client its obligations according to Sections
           3.3.1 - 3.3.4 of this Agreement, the Company shall:


    3.7.1  Ensure the provision of Loan  facility  to  the  Client  by  the
           Manager in amount of 1.0 million GBP
           a.    Loan term is 5 (five) years.
           b.    Loan will be granted on  the  investment  account  of  the
                Client, opened at the UK bank and managed by the Manager  or
                otherwise provided by Loan  agreement  and  defined  by  the
                Manager.
           c.    Loan will be granted in accordance to the requirements for
                Tier 1 Investor Visa no later than  three  months  from  the
                date of entry of the Client in UK.


    3.7.2  Ensure that the Manager invests the Clients  borrowed  funds  in
           the Authorised instruments within the required  period  of  time
           (three months from the date of entry of the Client in UK).


    3.7.3  Ensure the payment of interest on the loan in such  a  way  that
           the Client does not insure any additional costs to pay for  such
           expenses.


    3.7.4  To ensure monitoring of the Clients investment  in  such  a  way
           that during 5 years the value of  the  Clients  investment  into
           authorised instruments does not become less than  �1.0  million.
           The choice of specific instruments is at the discretion  of  the
           Manager."

10. A materially identical Services Agreement was entered  into  by  Ms  Wu
    with Maxwell Holding on 27 January 2014, save the loan  amount  was  �5
    million.


11. The existence of the Services Agreement between A1 and Maxwell Holding,
    and between Ms Wu and Maxwell Holding was not  expressly  disclosed  to
    the Respondent with either of their initial or subsequent  applications
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Investor).   Its
    existence and a copy of the agreements were only disclosed  during  the
    course of the  substantive  oral  hearing  of  these  applications  for
    Judicial Review further to  specific  questions  being  raised  by  the
    Tribunal.


12. There was  however  an  undated  letter  to  A1  from  Maxwell  Holding
    confirming receipt of payment  of  �200,000  on  19  November  2013  in
    accordance with the Services Agreement; an  addendum  to  the  Services
    Agreement between A1 and Maxwell Holding  dated  20  June  2014  and  a
    materially identical addendum to the Services Agreement between  Ms  Wu
    and Maxwell Holding also dated 20  June  2014.   The  addendum  amended
    section 3.7.3 of the original agreement to include an agreement by  the
    Company (Maxwell Holding) to pay interest on the Loan  Agreement  (that
    concluded between A1 and Maxwell dated 27 January 2014)  on  behalf  of
    the Client (A1).  It is unclear at what point or for what purpose these
    documents were provided to the Respondent, whether it  was  within  the
    original application, provided with the application for  Administrative
    Review or only as part of Judicial Review proceedings.  We do not  have
    a copy of any similar documents in relation to Ms Wu  or  her  Services
    Agreement with Maxwell Holding.

Maxwell Asset Management Ltd

13. Maxwell is a company which was incorporated on 21 May 2007, whose  sole
    director since incorporation has been DPK.  Between 17 July 2008 and 18
    June 2013, Maxwell  changed  its  name  to  Menostar  Asset  Management
    Limited, before reverting to  being  called  Maxwell  Asset  Management
    Limited.


14. As at 21 May 2008, Maxwell was a wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Menostar
    Holdings Ltd ("Menostar"), a company incorporated in Cyprus whose  sole
    director and owner is DPK.  According to the  annual  return  dated  23
    April 2013, Maxwell's  shares  were  owned  by  Menostar  (9,700),  DPK
    (740,000) and Ms Nika Kirpinchenko ("NK") (1,200,000).  NK is the  wife
    of DPK.  Maxwell's  Annual  Report  and  Financial  Statement  in  2017
    records the company as being a wholly owned subsidiary of Menostar  and
    the ultimate controlling party is its sole director, DPK.


15. In its Annual Report and Financial Statement in  2017,  Maxwell  states
    that:


      "During the years ended 30 September 2014 to 30 September 2016 Maxwell
      Asset Management Ltd ("Maxwell") engaged in the provision of loans  to
      high net worth individuals looking to invest in the UK.  ...   Maxwell
      was  originally  established  to  manage  overseas  investment   funds
      primarily investing in the Russian stock market, but the company never
      commenced to earn any trading income from this activity."


16. With regards to the loans  made  by  Maxwell,  the  Annual  Report  and
    Financial Statement for the year ended 30 September 2017 states:


      "During the year ended 30 September 2016, the company made a  loan  of
      �1,000,000 to an unconnected third party, which was invested  by  them
      in a company under the control of the wife of the director.  No  loans
      were made in the year ended 30 September 2017.  At 30 September  2017,
      the total amount of the loans to unconnected third parties, which were
      invested by them in a company under the control of  the  wife  of  the
      director  was  �112,000,000  (2016:  �112,000,000).   The  parent  has
      provided an irrevocable undertaking to the company that it would  bear
      the risk and full cost in the event that any of the third parties were
      to default on part or all of their indebtedness to the company".


17. A1 entered into a loan agreement  with  Maxwell  on  23  October  2013.
    Under this agreement, Maxwell would lend �1 million to A1, the  express
    purpose of which was to enable A1  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules as a Tier 1 (Investor).  The loan amount  was  to  be
    used for 'AID', defined in  the  agreement  as  "investments  in  share
    capital or loan capital in active and trading UK registered companies".
     The loan term was for a period  of  five  years,  to  be  granted,  in
    accordance with the requirements of A1's Tier 1 Investor visa, no later
    than three months from the date of entry of A1 into the United  Kingdom
    and the interest rate on the loan was 3% per annum.


18. Ms Wu entered into a loan agreement with Maxwell on  27  January  2014,
    which was materially identical to the  one  entered  into  by  A1  with
    Maxwell, save that the loan amount was �5 million.

Eclectic Capital Limited

19. Eclectic is a company which was incorporated  on  27  June  2013,  from
    which point NK has been its sole director and NK has consistently  held
    all 100 ordinary shares issued by the company.


20. On 12 June 2014, an amendment was made to the articles  of  association
    of Eclectic, which included  the  division  of  share  capital  of  the
    company into ordinary shares and preference shares.   Only  holders  of
    ordinary shares have the right to  vote  in  general  meetings  of  the
    company; holders of preference shares did not.  Preference shareholders
    involvement in Eclectic was limited to  a  deferred  entitlement  of  a
    dividend of 2% per annum on the nominal value of the shares, to be paid
    on the earlier of  the  redemption  of  the  shares  or  on  the  sixth
    anniversary of the date on which the share was  issued.   Eclectic  was
    entitled to redeem preference shares at any time in its discretion (for
    their nominal value or at a premium), but  the  holders  of  preference
    shares were entitled only to request redemption  six  years  after  the
    date of their issue and only at nominal value.  Preference shares could
    not be sold,  transferred,  assigned,  pledged,  charged  or  otherwise
    disposed of without the  consent  of  the  owner  of  the  majority  of
    ordinary shares, namely NK.


21. As at 27 June 2014, as shown in the annual return for  Eclectic,  there
    were 23 preference shareholders, comprised of  22  holders  each  of  1
    million preference shares at a value of �1 per  share  (which  included
    A1) and one holder of 5 million preference shares at a value of �1  per
    share, which was Ms Wu.


22. On 19 May 2015, a  further  amendment  was  made  to  the  articles  of
    association of Eclectic, to divide  the  share  capital  into  ordinary
    shares and two classes of preference shares, class A and class B,  with
    the same terms for ordinary shares and class A  preference  shares  (as
    the per the existing preference shares).  The new  class  B  preference
    shares were only entitled to a deferred dividend of 0.00001% per  annum
    on the nominal value of shares, to be paid after six years if the  same
    person had held the shares for a continuous six-year period.   As  with
    class A preference shares, Eclectic were entitled to redeem them at any
    time in their discretion, at the nominal value or at a premium; but the
    holders of class B preference shares  were  only  entitled  to  request
    redemption after holding the shares for a continuous six-year period at
    nominal value.


23. As at 27 June 2015, the annual return of Eclectic shows that it had 104
    preference shareholders, 103 of whom held 1 million  preference  shares
    for which they paid �1 per share and one  shareholder  with  5  million
    preference shares for which they paid �1 per share (Ms Wu).


24. On 22 February 2018, a further amendment was made to  the  articles  of
    association of Eclectic to create  a  further  class  C  of  preference
    shares with equivalent limited rights to the class B preference shares.
     At each stage of amendment to the  articles  of  association  set  out
    above, there were increases in the amount of share capital which  could
    be issued.


25. Sarmand Global, the  Chartered  Accountants  for  Eclectic  provided  a
    detailed breakdown of the investments made by Eclectic as  of  30  June
    2016.   These  investments  totalled  �111,127,038  and  save  for  one
    investment of �6,694,850 to a company in Jersey; all other  investments
    were in companies in Russia.  The letter went on to state that although
    at this  date  Eclectic's  principal  business  activity  was  security
    dealings, its focus had since moved  to  hospitality  (wine  bars)  and
    media activity in the UK.


26. The accounts for Eclectic to 30 June  2017  stated  that  Eclectic  has
    invested in subsidiary companies named Holborn Wine Bar  Ltd,  Eclectic
    Gallery Limited, Portobello Wine Ltd, AAT  Lab  Ltd  and  S.A.I.D  (UK)
    Limited.  The Respondent has  provided  documents  filed  at  Companies
    House (which are publicly available and relate to the same  or  similar
    time period as the Eclectic accounts) in  relation  to  each  of  these
    companies, showing that Holborn Wine Bar Ltd is a dormant company  with
    only �100 of assets; Eclectic Gallery Limited has assets of  �7934  and
    net liabilities of �2766; Portobello Wine Ltd is a dormant company with
    only �100 assets on its balance sheet; AAT  Lab  Ltd  has  net  current
    assets of some �200,000 and  net  liabilities  of  some  �233,000;  and
    S.A.I.D (UK) Limited has net assets of some �59,500 and net liabilities
    of some �466,000.  With the sole exception of Holborn Wine Bar,  NK  is
    the Director and/or a shareholder of all these companies.


27. A1 entered into a loan agreement with  Eclectic  on  20  January  2014,
    pursuant to which she would lend �1 million to Eclectic for a  term  of
    five years at an interest rate of 3.05% per annum.  Ms Wu entered  into
    a materially identical loan agreement  with  Eclectic  on  19  February
    2014, save that the amount to be lent  in  her  case  was  �5  million.
    Those sums were, on the written instructions of  A1  and  Ms  Wu,  paid
    directly from Maxwell  to  Eclectic  and  were  not  paid  out  to  the
    applicants to make the loan directly themselves.


28. On 20 June  2014,  there  was  an  additional  agreement  to  the  loan
    agreement between A1 and Eclectic and to the loan agreement between  Ms
    Wu and Eclectic, pursuant to which Eclectic converted the  loans  given
    by each of  them  into  1  million  and  5  million  preference  shares
    respectively,  with  a  nominal  value  of  �1  each.   The  additional
    agreement terminated the original loan agreement and specified that  no
    interest at all had been accrued on the loan for the entire period from
    the date of the loan agreement until its termination on 20 June 2014.


Legal Framework

29. Paragraph 245ED of the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements  for

    relevant to A1, provide as follows:


    "Requirements

       Table 7 of Appendix A to these Rules (where relevant); or
       (ii) any of the money specified in the application for the  purposes
       of meeting the requirements of Table 7 of Appendix A to these  Rules
       held by:
           1) the applicant; or
           2) where any of the specified money has been made  available  to
              the applicant by another party, that party, has been acquired
              by means of conduct which is unlawful in  the  UK,  or  would
              constitute unlawful conduct if it occurred in the UK; or
       (iii) where any of the money specified in the  application  for  the
       purposes of meeting the requirements of Table 7  of  Appendix  A  to
       these Rules has been made available by another party, the character,
       conduct or associations of that party are such that approval of  the
       application would not be conducive to the public good, and where the
       Secretary of State does have reasonable grounds to  believe  one  or
       more of the above applies, no points from Table 7  (where  relevant)
       will be awarded. ..."

30. Paragraph 245EF of the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements  for
    indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant, which so far
    as relevant to Ms Wu, provide as follows:

    "Requirements
    a) ...
    b) The applicant must not fall for refusal under  the  general  grounds
       for refusal, and must not be an illegal entrant ...
    c) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under  paragraphs  54
       to 65-SD of Appendix A. ..."

31. Paragraphs 55 to 58 of Appendix A refer to the Tables contained in  the
    Appendix setting out the points requirements for  different  categories
    of application according to whether the initial application  for  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant was made  before  or  after  6
    November 2014.  So far as relevant to  A1  and  Ms  Wu;  who  both  had
    previous grants of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant prior
    to 6 November 2014, these paragraphs provide that the available  points
    for further leave to remain for A1  are  those  in  Table  8B  and  for
    indefinite leave to remain for Ms Wu are those in Table 9B.  It  should
    be noted that in Table 9B the size of the investment required decreases
    as the length of investment holding extends.

A1's application for further leave to remain

40. A1's application was for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor)
    under paragraph 245ED of the Immigration Rules was  dated  20  February
    2017 (under cover of a  letter  dated  23  February  2017),  and  which
    included  an  application  for  A2  as  her  dependent.   The   claimed
    attributes were that (a) she has money of her own under her control  in
    the UK amounting to not less than �1 million, or, (b)(i) owns  personal
    assets which, taking into account any liabilities  to  which  they  are
    subject, have a value of not less than �2 million and  (ii)  has  money
    under her control and disposable in the UK amounting to not  less  than
    �1 million which has been loaned to her by  a  UK  regulated  financial
    institution.


41. Specifically, the Applicant stated that she made a loan of  �1  million
    to a UK registered company (Eclectic) which was converted to preference
    shares in the nominal value of �1 million  and  such  shareholding  has
    since been maintained at that level, with the value  of  shares  at  31
    December 2016 being �1,003,270.  Eclectic was said to  have  maintained
    active trading throughout the previous three years  and  an  investment
    portfolio and unaudited accounts were provided.  It was said  therefore
    that the applicant earned 30 points by meeting this requirement.


42. A1 was interviewed in relation to her application on 7 August 2017  and
    further documents/representations were provided in support of it by her
    representatives on 18 and 25 August 2017.  Extracts from the record  of
    interview with A1 appear at Annex A.


A1's Reasons for Refusal dated 22 December 2017

43. The Respondent set out in three boxes the  points  claimed  and  points
    awarded under Appendix A: Attributes in respect  of  A1's  application.
    The first box deals with the requirement that  the  applicant  has  not
    less than �1 million in the UK, which has been loaned by a UK regulated
    financial institution, as required in paragraph b(ii) of Row 1 of Table
    8B of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  The evidence relied upon by
    A1 is set out followed by the conclusion that the funds loaned to A1 by
    Maxwell were not under her control in the UK.  The reasons were set out
    as follows:

      "We are aware of a link between Maxwell and Eclectic.

      Dmitry Petrovich Kirpichenko is named as a Director and a person  with
      significant influence or control over Maxwell in the  company's  entry
      on the Companies House website.

      Nika Kirpichenko is named as the Director of Eclectic  in  the  Report
      and Unaudited Accounts provided for Eclectic Capital Limited,  and  in
      the company's entry on the Companies House website.

      Dmitry Petrovich Kirpichenko and  Nika  Kirpichenko  are  husband  and
      wife.  This raises concerns about the loan and investment arrangements
      you have entered into.

      You have provided a loan agreement between you (as the  Borrower)  and
      Maxwell (as the Lender).

      The terms of this agreement call into question the  level  of  control
      you have over the funds loaned to you by Maxwell.

      Paragraph 2 of the agreement states that the loan  will  be  used  for
      AID, that is, the  Authorised  Investment  Destination.   Paragraph  2
      further defines "AID Company" as "company for the  purposes  of  AID".
      Paragraph 6 states that you are obliged to, "To sign a loan  agreement
      or share purchase agreement with the AID Company."

      Furthermore, Paragraph 2 of the agreement states that the  purpose  of
      the loan "is to enable the Borrower to meet the  requirements  of  the
      UKBA Visa Tier 1 (Investor)."  Paragraph 11 of the  agreement  advises
      that the loan agreement will lose force if you are refused such a visa
      or if you do not sign the loan agreement or share  purchase  agreement
      with "the AID Company" referred to in paragraph 6.

      The inclusion  of  these  conditions  in  the  loan  agreement  raises
      concerns regarding your arrangement with Maxwell.   The  reference  to
      "the AID Company" leads us to conclude that the  loan  appears  to  be
      contingent on the funds being invested in a single  specific  company,
      namely Eclectic.  This, coupled with the  links  between  Maxwell  and
      Eclectic referred to above, leads us to conclude that, on the  balance
      of probabilities, the money that was lent to you  is  not  under  your
      control because it is evident that you are  not  able  to  invest  the
      money anywhere other than in Eclectic.

      You have provided a 5-year loan  agreement  dated  20th  January  2014
      between you (as the Lender) and Eclectic (as Borrower), paragraph 5 of
      which states that the interest rate that you will receive on the  loan
      is 3.05%.

      Paragraph 4 of the loan agreement states that "the  Borrower  has  the
      right to unilaterally decide about the conversion of the loan into the
      preferred shares of the Borrower".

      You have provided a letter from  Maxwell  Holdings  Ltd  showing  that
      although your investment in Eclectic was initially in the  form  of  a
      loan, it was subsequently converted to Preference shares.

      The Articles of Association adopted by Eclectic on 12  June  2014  and
      later on 2 June 2015 are available in  the  Companies  House  website.
      These articles show that the rate of return available  to  holders  of
      Preference Shares in Eclectic are poor and  are  unlikely  to  attract
      investors.

      "Share Capital and Rights" are  set  out  in  Paragraph  15  of  these
articles.

      The articles  state  that  fixed  dividends  of  2%  may  be  paid  to
      Preference  A  shareholders/0.0001%  may  be  paid  to  Preference   B
      shareholders.  The net returns would be even poorer  if  inflation  is
      taken into account and the 3% annual interest payable on your  5  year
      loan from Maxwell are taken into account.  This rate  of  interest  is
      set out in Paragraph 5 of the loan agreement mentioned above.


      Moreover your  funds  were  converted  from  a  loan  which  attracted
      interest of 3.05% into preference shares which attracted a lower  rate
      of  returns,  meaning  you  were  guaranteed  to  lose  money  on  the
      investment.  The fact that the loan agreement enabled Eclectic to make
      such a change unilaterally without your agreement suggests this is not
      a genuine investment under your control.


      Furthermore, the articles state that your Preference Shares need to be
      held for at least 6 years in order for any dividend to be paid.


      Any dividends awarded are payable:
      . to Preference A shareholders either on redemption of the shares  on
        the sixth anniversary of the share being issued
      . to Preference B shareholders once the shares have been held  for  a
        minimum of six years, no dividend being payable if the  shares  are
        redeemed beforehand

      This means that as a holder of preference shares you  must  keep  your
      funds in an uncompetitive investment for an extended period  in  order
      to obtain any return whatsoever.


      In addition to the low  rate  of  return,  your  loan  agreement  with
      Maxwell is for a term of five years, meaning you will be  required  to
      repay the loan you have used to invest in Eclectic before you are able
      to receive any return whatsoever from your investment.


      Moreover Paragraph 17 of the articles prohibits holders of  preference
      shares from disposing of their  shares  without  the  consent  of  the
      majority of the Ordinary shareholders meaning that investors who  wish
      to redeem their shares may not be allowed to release their funds.


      In contrast to the restrictive arrangements in  place  for  preference
      shareholders, the company is free to redeem its preference  shares  at
      any time, at their nominal value, a premium only being payable at  the
      discretion of the company's directors.


      The inflexibility and lack of returns outlined above are  advantageous
      to the company at the expense of preference shareholders  and  do  not
      afford any financial incentive to invest.   They  call  into  question
      whether you are genuinely investing funds under your own control in an
      arrangement that fixes those funds  in  place  for  5  years  with  no
      return.


      We also note that the  loan  agreements  you  have  signed  with  both
      Maxwell and Eclectic offer no ability  for  you  to  terminate  either
      agreement without the other party's consent.


      Both the loan agreements prohibit you  alone  from  transferring  your
      rights and obligations under the respective  agreement  without  prior
      written consent of the other party (i.e. paragraph 8  of  the  Maxwell
      agreement and paragraph 7 of the Eclectic  agreement).   This  coupled
      with the above restrictions on your shareholding in Eclectic,  clearly
      shows that you have no control over the funds either as a borrower  or
      as a lender/equity investor.  All of the above leads  us  to  conclude
      that this investment has not been under your control and that you  are
      unable to exercise a choice regarding the placement of your investment
      funds with Eclectic and what was done with the funds once the  company
      had possession of them."

44. The Respondent then quoted parts of the interview with A1 on  7  August
    2017 (extracts of which are at Annex A) and concluded that in light  of
    all of the above, A1 did not satisfy the criteria at paragraph b(ii) of
    Row 1 of Table 8B for the award of points claimed.


45. The  second  box  in  the  decision  letter  deals  with  the  specific
    investment of �750,000 for the  purposes  of  Row  2  of  Table  8B  of
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  The Respondent awarded no  points
    for this part of the application on the basis that it was not  accepted
    that  the  funds  invested  in  Eclectic  met  the  requirements  of  a
    qualifying investment set out in paragraph 65  of  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules, specifically being excluded by  paragraph  65(b)  of
    the same.  This is because the investment was made  prior  to  30  June
    2016 when Eclectic's principal business  was  to  use  funds  to  trade
    investments in companies, which is of a type that is excluded  for  the
    purposes of investment under Paragraph 65.


46. The third and final box deals with the criteria in Row 3 of Table 8B of
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, for which no points  were  awarded
    on the basis that the investment made, for the reasons  already  given,
    was not a qualifying investment.


47. A2's application for leave to remain as a child dependent of a  Tier  1
    Migrant was also refused on 22 December 2017 under  paragraph  319C  of
    the Immigration Rules on the basis of the refusal of A1's application.

A1's grounds for Administrative Review

48. A1 sought Administrative Review of the refusal of  her  application  on
    the following grounds:
      i) The Respondent mis-applied paragraph 245ED(g)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules which is only applicable to cases under Table 7 of Appendix A
         of the Immigration Rules, whereas the present application was under
         Table 8B.  The Respondent therefore had  no  power  to  refuse  the
         application on "reasonable grounds" to believe that the loan  funds
         and the investment in Eclectic were not under A1's control.
     ii) The loan agreement relied upon by A1 was the same one  relied  upon
         when leave to  remain  was  first  granted,  and  accepted  by  the
         Respondent at that time.
    iii) The Respondent's reasons for deciding that the loan funds were  not
         under the control of A1 are irrational and manifestly  speculative,
         given in  particular  that  there  is  no  condition  in  the  loan
         agreement for a specific  authorised  investment  destination;  the
         requirement for A1 to give notice to where funds were  to  be  paid
         and that A1 had selected Eclectic by choice.
     iv) The Respondent has misinterpreted the requirement for a  person  to
         have  money  under  his  control  by  equating  it  with  a  wholly
         unencumbered choice of action in relation to  the  investment  loan
         funds rather than simply having ultimate control over the money and
         about where and how it is invested; further by applying the  phrase
         after the investment of funds rather than control at the  point  of
         investment; and in failing to take into  account  the  Respondent's
         own policy as to the meaning of control.
      v) The Respondent's remaining reasoning as to why the loan funds  were
         not in A1's control were perverse and  speculative,  including  the
         marriage between directors which is irrelevant to the operation  of
         corporate  entities;  the  definition  of   authorised   investment
         destination and use of the term in the loan agreement, and that  A1
         voluntarily signed a loan agreement with  Eclectic  which  included
         the right to convert the loan  to  share  capital.   Various  other
         matters relied upon by the Respondent reflected  normal  commercial
         practice and would not be relevant to the issue of control.
     vi) The Respondent misdirected himself in law  as  to  the  meaning  of
         paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules  and  failed
         to give reasons as to  which  particular  type  of  investment  the
         Respondent considered this to be to fall within one of the  express
         exceptions to a qualifying investment.
    vii) The Respondent had accepted in a number of other cases, investments
         into Eclectic as satisfying the investment requirement in Table  8B
         of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules, such  as  to  constitute  a
         practice of doing the same.
   viii) The Respondent failed to apply her own published policy guidance in
         relation to the application made by A1.

A1's Administrative Review decision dated 6 February 2018

49. The Respondent accepted in the course of the Administrative Review that
    paragraph 245ED(g) of the Immigration Rules was not applicable to  A1's
    application as it related only to Table 7 and not Table 8B of  Appendix
    A to the Immigration  Rules.   However,  in  any  event  A1  was  still
    required under Table 8B to have money of her own under her own  control
    and disposable in the UK.  The Respondent decided that the  balance  of
    all the evidence available led to the conclusion that  A1  was  not  in
    control of the funds, on the basis that A1 did not in fact have freedom
    to choose where to invest the loan funds, or to withdraw the investment
    once made.  The Respondent maintained that relevant  considerations  in
    determining whether a person had control of the funds included the fact
    that money was transferred between two companies whose  directors  were
    married; the poor terms of the agreement and poor financial returns  of
    the investment.

50. In relation to the refusal under paragraph 65(b)  of  Appendix  A,  the
    Respondent stated that  Eclectic  has  attributes  akin  to  investment
    vehicles expressly excluded by paragraph  65(b)  and  for  the  reasons
    already given in the refusal letter,  it  was  not  accepted  that  the
    investment met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

51. Overall, the Respondent considered that  the  original  caseworker  had
    applied the  Immigration  Rules,  policy  and  guidance  correctly  and
    reached a conclusion on the evidence that the funds loaned to  A1  were
    not in her control in the UK; such that  the  decision  to  refuse  the
    application with reference to paragraph  245ED(b)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was maintained.  On this basis, the refusal of  A2's  application
    was also refused as he was not at the time the child of  a  parent  who
    has been granted leave to remain as a Points Based System Migrant.

Ms Wu's application for leave to remain

52. Ms Wu applied for indefinite leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Investor)
    under the accelerated three year route under cover of a letter dated 10
    January 2017, pursuant to paragraph 245EF  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The application was made on the basis that  Ms  Wu  (i)  owns  personal
    assets which, taking into account any liabilities  to  which  they  are
    subject, have a value of not less than �10 million; and (ii) has  money
    of her own under her control in the UK amounting to not  less  than  �5
    million which has been loaned  to  her  by  a  UK  regulated  financial
    institution.  Specifically, Ms Wu loaned  Eclectic  �5  million  on  12
    March 2014, which was  converted  to  Preference  Shares  of  the  same
    nominal value on 20 June 2014 with the value maintained continuously to
    the date of application.  The value of the shares  as  at  31  December
    2016 was �5,016,350.  Eclectic has maintained  active  trading  over  a
    three year period and their unaudited company accounts  and  investment
    portfolio report was submitted.


53. Ms Wu was interviewed in relation to her application on 16 August  2017
    and further documents/representations were made in support of it by her
    representatives in essentially the same terms as  were  made  for  A1's
    application.  Extracts from the record of interview with Ms  Wu  appear
    at Annex B.

Ms Wu's Reasons for Refusal dated 22 December 2017

54. The Respondent set out Ms Wu's immigration history and requirements for
    a grant of indefinite leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Investor)  under
    paragraph 245EF of the Immigration Rules and by reference to Appendix A
    of the same, specifically paragraphs  54  to  65-SD  and  Table  9B  of
    Appendix A.


55. In respect of paragraph b(ii) of Row 1 of Table 9B, the Respondent  did
    not award Ms Wu any points as she was  not  satisfied  that  the  funds
    loaned to her by Maxwell  were  under  her  control  in  the  UK.   The
    following reasons were given:


      "We are aware of a link between Maxwell and Eclectic.


      Dmitry Petrovich Kirpichenko is named as a Director and a person  with
      significant influence or control in Maxwell in the company's entry  on
      the Companies House website.


      Nika Kirpichenko is named as the Director of Eclectic  in  the  Report
      and Unaudited Accounts provided for Eclectic Capital  Limited  and  in
      the company's entry on the Companies House website.


      Dmitry Petrovich Kirpichenko and Nika  Kirpinchenko  are  husband  and
      wife.  This raises concerns about the loan and investment arrangements
      that you have entered into.


      You have provided a loan agreement between you (as the  Borrower)  and
      Maxwell (as the Lender).

      The terms of this agreement call into question the  level  of  control
      you have over the funds loaned to you by Maxwell.


      Paragraph 2 of the agreement states that the loan  will  be  used  for
      AID, that is, the  Authorised  Investment  Destination.   Paragraph  2
      further defines "AID Company" as "company for the  purposes  of  AID".
      Paragraph 6 states that you are obliged to, "To sign a loan  agreement
      or share purchase agreement with the AID Company."

      Furthermore, Paragraph 2 of the agreement states that the  purpose  of
      the loan "is to enable the Borrower to meet the  requirements  of  the
      UKBA Visa Tier 1 (Investor)."  Paragraph 11 of the  agreement  advises
      that the loan agreement will lose force if you are refused such a visa
      or if you do not sign the loan agreement or share  purchase  agreement
      with "the AID Company" referred to in paragraph 6.

      The inclusion  of  these  conditions  in  the  loan  agreement  raises
      concerns regarding your arrangement with Maxwell.   The  reference  to
      "the AID Company" leads us to conclude that the  loan  appears  to  be
      contingent on the funds being invested in a single  specific  company,
      namely Eclectic.  This, coupled with the  links  between  Maxwell  and
      Eclectic referred to above, leads us to conclude that, on the  balance
      of probabilities, the money that was lent to you  is  not  under  your
      control because it is evident that you are  not  able  to  invest  the
      money anywhere other than in Eclectic.


      You have provided a letter from Maxwell Asset Management showing  that
      although your investment in Eclectic was initially in the form of loan
      it was subsequently converted to Preference shares.


      The Articles of Association adopted by Eclectic on 12  June  2014  and
      later on 2 June 2015 are available on  the  Companies  House  website.
      These articles show that the rates of return available to  holders  of
      Preference Shares in Eclectic are poor and  are  unlikely  to  attract
      investors.


      The articles  state  that  fixed  dividends  of  2%  may  be  paid  to
      Preference  A  shareholders/0.0001%  may  be  paid  to  Preference   B
      shareholders.  The net returns would be even poorer  if  inflation  is
      taken into account and the 3% annual interest payable on your  5  year
      loan from Maxwell are taken into account.  This rate  of  interest  is
      set out in Paragraph 5 of the loan agreement mentioned above.


      In addition to the low  rate  of  return,  your  loan  agreement  with
      Maxwell is for a term of three years, meaning you will be required  to
      pay repay the loan you have used to invest in Eclectic before you  are
      able to receive any return whatsoever from your investment.


      Moreover Paragraph 17 of the articles prohibits holders of  preference
      shares from disposing of their  shares  without  the  consent  of  the
      majority of the Ordinary shareholders meaning that investors who  wish
      to redeem the shares may not be allowed to release the funds.


      In contrast to the restrictive arrangements in  place  for  preference
      shareholders, the company is free to redeem its preference  shares  at
      any time, at their nominal value, a premium only being payable at  the
      discretion of the company's directors.


      The inflexibility and lack of returns outlined above are  advantageous
      to the company at the expense of preference shareholders  and  do  not
      afford any financial incentive to invest.   They  call  into  question
      whether you are genuinely investing funds under your own control in an
      arrangement that fixes those funds  in  place  for  3  years  with  no
      return.


      We also note that the loan agreement  you  have  signed  with  Maxwell
      offers no ability for you to terminate the agreement without the other
      party's consent."


56. The Respondent then quoted parts of the interview with Ms Wu on  7  and
    16 August 2017 and concluded that  taking  everything  together,  there
    were reasonable grounds to believe that the loan funds  and  investment
    in Eclectic were not under Ms Wu's control.


57. In addition, the Respondent  had  not  been  provided  with  sufficient
    evidence from Ms Wu that she owned personal assets with a value of  not
    less than �10 million.  Her interview record stated that she  had  paid
    �3.5 million for her property  and  in  addition  that  she  had  shown
    Maxwell Asset Management a bank statement  showing  a  balance  of  �10
    million, but the latter was not provided to  the  Respondent  with  the
    application.  For this reason, the Respondent did not accept  that  the
    Appellant met the criteria in paragraph b(ii) of Row 1 of Table 9B.


58. In relation to Row 2, the Respondent did not award any  points  as  she
    was  not  satisfied  that  the  funds  invested  in  Eclectic  met  the
    requirement of a qualifying investment in paragraph 65 of Appendix A of
    the Immigration Rules because the report  and  unaudited  accounts  for
    Eclectic dated 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 did not give full  details
    of the applicant's investment as required in  paragraph  65-SD(vii)  of
    Appendix A and further, that the investment was excluded from  being  a
    qualifying investment under paragraph 65(b) of the same.


59. In relation to Rows 3 and 4,  the  Respondent  did  not  award  points,
    essentially for the reasons already given above.


Ms Wu's grounds for Administrative Review

60. Ms Wu sought Administrative Review of the refusal of her application on
    the following grounds:
      i) The Respondent mis-applied paragraph 245ED(g)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules which is only applicable to cases under Table 7 of Appendix A
         of the Immigration Rules, whereas the present application was under
         Table 9B.  The Respondent therefore had  no  power  to  refuse  the
         application on "reasonable grounds" to believe that the loan  funds
         and the investment in Eclectic were not under Ms Wu's control.
     ii) The loan agreement relied upon by Ms Wu was  the  same  one  relied
         upon when leave to remain was first granted, and  accepted  by  the
         Respondent at that time.
    iii) The Respondent's reasons for deciding that the loan funds were  not
         under  the  control  of  Ms  Wu  were  irrational  and   manifestly
         speculative, given in particular that there is no condition in  the
         loan agreement for a specific  authorised  investment  destination,
         the requirement for Ms Wu to give notice to where funds were to  be
         paid and that Ms Wu had expressly  compared  investments  available
         and selected Eclectic by choice.
     iv) The Respondent has misinterpreted the requirement for a  person  to
         have  money  under  his  control  by  equating  it  with  a  wholly
         unencumbered choice of action in relation to  the  investment  loan
         funds rather than simply having ultimate control over the money and
         about where and how it is invested; further by applying the  phrase
         after the investment of funds rather than control at the  point  of
         investment; and in failing to take into  account  the  Respondent's
         own policy as to the meaning of control.
      v) The Respondent's remaining reasoning as to why the loan funds  were
         not in Ms Wu's control were perverse and speculative, including the
         marriage between directors which is irrelevant to the operation  of
         corporate  entities;  the  definition  of   authorised   investment
         destination and use of the term in the loan agreement, and that  Ms
         Wu voluntarily signed a loan agreement with Eclectic which included
         the right to convert the loan  to  share  capital.   Various  other
         matters relied upon by the Respondent reflected  normal  commercial
         practice and would not be relevant to the issue of control.
     vi) Ms Wu had provided all of the specified evidence to  show  personal
         assets of not less than �10 million and if the Respondent  was  not
         satisfied  with  the  same,  further  evidence  should  have   been
         requested pursuant to paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.
    vii) The Respondent misdirected himself in law  as  to  the  meaning  of
         paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules  and  failed
         to give reasons as to  which  particular  type  of  investment  the
         Respondent considered this to be to fall within one of the  express
         exceptions to a qualifying investment.
   viii) In relation  to  paragraph  65-SD(a)(vii)  of  Appendix  A  to  the
         Immigration Rules, there is a detailed list of investments  in  the
         report from the accountants dated 22 December 2016 and in any event
         this paragraph should not have been applied at all because the loan
         had been converted into shares in the company  and  this  paragraph
         applies only to loan funds' investments.
     ix) The Respondent had accepted in a number of other cases, investments
         into Eclectic Limited as satisfying the investment  requirement  in
         Table 8B of Appendix  A  to  the  Immigration  Rules,  such  as  to
         constitute a practice of doing the same.
      x) The Respondent failed to apply her own published policy guidance in
         relation to the application made by Ms Wu.

Ms Wu's Administrative review decision dated 6 February 2018

61. The Respondent maintained the original refusal of Ms  Wu's  application
    in her administrative review decision dated 6 February 2018.   Although
    it was accepted that the application fell under Table 9B of Appendix  A
    to the Immigration Rules and not Table 7, the requirement is  the  same
    for an applicant to have money of their own under their own control and
    disposable in the UK, such that the Respondent must still be  satisfied
    that this is the case and  can  refuse  an  application  if  there  are
    reasonable grounds to consider that the requirement has not been met.


62. The Respondent did not accept that she  was  under  any  obligation  to
    compound any decisions which may have been incorrect  in  the  past  by
    making  further  incorrect  decisions  on   future   applications,   in
    particular in  relation  to  the  loan  agreement  submitted  with  the
    previous application for leave to remain  which  was  successful.   The
    Respondent considered  that  on  the  information  now  available,  the
    initial application should not have been granted.  A similar  statement
    was made about any other applications which relied on  investment  into
    Eclectic.


63. The reasons originally given as to why Ms Wu was not considered  to  be
    in control of money were maintained and it was emphasised that she  did
    not appear to have freedom to choose where to invest the  money  or  to
    withdraw her investment  once  made.   The  published  policy  guidance
    relied upon by Ms Wu gave illustrative but not exhaustive examples.


64. In relation to the exclusions to qualifying  investments  in  paragraph
    65(b) of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules, the Respondent stated  as
    follows:


      "You claim that the original caseworker unlawfully concluded that  the
      investment made in Eclectic is one excluded  by  paragraph  65(b)  but
      fails to state, which type of investment prohibited by paragraph 65(b)
      is being referred to.  The Secretary of State groups  the  investments
      listed in paragraph 65(b) together in  a  common  exclusion,  for  the
      reason that all these types of company could be used as a  vehicle  to
      channel the funds into other investments, which may not be active  and
      trading UK companies, and may therefore not meet the  requirements  of
      the Tier 1 (Investor) category.  The purpose of Tier 1  (Investor)  is
      to benefit the UK economy, not just through tax  paid  on  investments
      but also through the investments themselves.  That is why  we  require
      investments to be made in UK government bonds or active and trading UK
      companies.


      Namecos are referred to in the Policy  Guidance  (Annex  A,  paragraph
      A14).  It is clear that these are only given  as  one  example  of  an
      investment syndicate company.  They are not the only type  of  company
      which would fall within this group.  It is noted that the  submissions
      around pooled investment vehicles are incorrect,  as  it  appears  you
      have assumed the only reason for excluding this type of vehicle is  to
      ensure maximum UK tax revenue and this is incorrect.


      Although you maintain that Eclectic is not an investment  excluded  by
      paragraph 65(b) it does have some  attributes  akin  to  these,  this,
      alongside reasons highlighted in your refusal letter does not  satisfy
      the Secretary of State that on the balance of probabilities,  Eclectic
      and your investment meet the Immigration Rules."

Grounds for Judicial Review

65. The first four grounds of challenge are common to both A1 and  Ms  Wu's
    applications  for  Judicial  Review  and  are  set  out  in  materially
    identical terms.  The fifth and sixth grounds of challenge are specific
    to Ms Wu's application only.


66. The grounds of challenge are as follows:


    1) the Respondent applied the wrong test under  paragraph  245ED(g)  of
       the Immigration Rules;
    2) the Respondent misinterpreted the requirement for  an  applicant  to
       have money under his or her control;
    3) the Respondent's decision  was  irrational  and  took  into  account
       irrelevant factors;
    4)  the  Respondent  erred  in  relation  to  her  interpretation   and
       application of paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A;
    5) the Respondent erred in failing to accept the evidence  provided  by
       Ms Wu of personal assets, or in the alternative,  further  documents
       should have been  requested  pursuant  to  paragraph  245AA  of  the
       Immigration Rules or a limited period of leave granted  rather  than
       indefinite leave to remain; and
    6) the Respondent erred  in  failing  to  take  into  account  evidence
       relating to paragraph 65-SD(a)(vii) of Appendix A, and/or  erred  in
       finding that this paragraph applied at all.


Preliminary matters

67. The skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the applicants,  supported
    by opening oral submissions from Ms Weston, went into some considerable
    detail about basic principles  of  interpretation  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and the suggestion that the relevant Immigration Rules for Tier 1
    (Investors)  were  inherently  defective,  lacking   in   clarity   and
    contradictory both internally and with banking practice.   However,  it
    was expressly confirmed that there was no challenge to the legality  of
    the Immigration Rules for this route and in applications such as these,
    it was solely a matter for the Upper  Tribunal  to  properly  interpret
    them.  The global submission on behalf of the applicants that the rules
    and the Respondent's practice in the assessment of such applications is
    inherently unclear is therefore only considered to the extent that  the
    interpretation of specific parts of the relevant Immigration Rules have
    been expressly challenged within the pleaded grounds.


68.  There  is  no  real  dispute  as  to  the  correct  approach  to   the
    interpretation of the Immigration Rules, which has been clearly set out
    by the Supreme Court in Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16,
    with reference to Odelola v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2009] UKHL 25.  Lord Brown stated:


      "[10] There is really no dispute about  the  proper  approach  to  the
      construction of  the  Rules.   As  Lord  Hoffman  said  in  Odelola  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009]  1  WLR  1230,  1233
      (paragraph 4)


         "Like any other question of  construction,  this  [whether  a  rule
         change  applies  to  all  undetermined  applications  or  only   to
         subsequent applications] depends  on  the  language  of  the  rule,
         construed  against  the  relevant  background.   That  involves   a
         consideration of the immigration rules as a whole and the  function
         which they serve in the administration of immigration policy."


      ... Essentially it comes to this.  The Rules are not to  be  construed
      with all the strictness applicable to the construction of a statute or
      a statutory instrument but, instead, sensibly according to the natural
      and ordinary meaning of the words  used,  recognising  that  they  are
      statements of the Secretary of  State's  administrative  policy.   The
      respondent's counsel readily accepted  that  what  she  meant  in  her
      written case by the proposition 'the question of interpretation is ...
      what the Secretary of State intended his policy to be'  was  that  the
      court's task is to discover from the words used in the Rules what  the
      Secretary of State must be taken to have intended.  After  all,  under
      section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971, the Secretary of  State  has
      to lay the Rules before Parliament which then has the  opportunity  to
      disapprove them.  True, as I  observed  in  Odelola  (para  33):  'The
      question is what the Secretary of State intended.  The rules  are  her
      rules.'  But that intention is to be discerned  objectively  from  the
      language  used,  not  divined  by   reference   to   supposed   policy
      considerations.  Still less is the Secretary of State's  intention  to
      be discovered from [IDIs] issued intermittently to  guide  immigration
      officers in their application of the rules."

69. In relation to interpretation of the Immigration Rules specific to  the
    Points Based System, we also bear in mind the dicta of Holroyde LJ in R
    (on application of Sajjad) [2019] EWCA Civ 720.


      '31. ... It would be inconsistent with the nature and objective of the
      PBS to  interpret  the  phrase  [director's  loan]  as  carrying  some
      specialist meaning which would or might  in  particular  circumstances
      require a detailed analysis of finer points of contract law or company
      law....
      32...In  order  to  operate  the  PBS  fairly  and  efficiently,   the
      respondent must be able to ascertain  quickly,  from  the  information
      provided by an applicant, the precise nature and legal status  of  the
      investment made in order to confirm  that  it  attracts  an  award  of
      points under the terms of the scheme'

70. Separately, on 28 May 2019, after  the  substantive  oral  hearing,  an
    application was made on behalf of both applicants to make written  post
    hearing submissions in respect of matters identified  by  the  Tribunal
    during the course of the oral  hearing,  upon  which  Counsel  for  the
    applicants considered that she did not have an adequate opportunity  to
    respond during the course of the hearing.  The application was  opposed
    by the Respondent.


71. We refuse the application to put  in  further  written  submissions  on
    behalf of the applicants on the  basis  that  there  is  no  sufficient
    justification for further  written  submissions  to  be  made  and  the
    content of those proposed take the applicants' claims no further.  Much
    of the text reiterates submissions already made during  the  course  of
    the oral hearing by both parties and ultimately  the  majority  of  the
    submissions are not relevant to the issues raised  in  the  grounds  of
    challenge to be determined in these applications for  Judicial  Review.
    We have not therefore taken the post hearing submissions into account.

Ground 1 - application of the wrong test under  paragraph  245ED(g)  of  the
Immigration Rules.

72. The applicants assert that the reference in the  Respondent's  decision
    letters referring to the Secretary of State having "reasonable  grounds
    to believe that the loan funds and the investment in Eclectic  are  not
    under your control" show that the decision was erroneously taken  under
    paragraph 245ED(g) of the Immigration Rules  which  is  expressly  only
    relevant to cases where points are to  be  awarded  under  Table  7  of
    Appendix A, which is not the applicable provision for either A1  or  Ms
    Wu.


73. Although it is accepted  by  the  applicants  that  the  Administrative
    Review decision in respect  of  each  of  them  expressly  states  that
    paragraph 245ED(g) of the  Immigration  Rules  was  not  applicable  to
    either application, the Respondent said within those decisions that  in
    any event the requirements in Table 8B and Table 9B of Appendix A  mean
    that a person has to show money under their control and is therefore of
    the same effect.  The applicants submit that this is erroneous and  the
    only requirements to show that a person has money under  their  control
    are the evidential requirements set out in paragraphs 60, 61A and 61-SD
    of Appendix A; with no subjective judgement permitted.


74. However, the  submission  that  the  mere  provision  of  documents  in
    accordance with those specified in the relevant part of the Appendix is
    of itself sufficient, ignores the structure of  the  Immigration  Rules
    governing applications under the Points Based System.  The provision of
    specified documents is the required means by  which  an  applicant  can
    establish that the substantive requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    are met for a grant of leave to remain, however the  content  of  those
    documents must be examined to ensure the satisfaction of  the  relevant
    requirements of the rules.


75. In relation to A1, this included the requirement in paragraph  245ED(e)
    of the Immigration Rules that the "assets and investment he is claiming
    points for must be wholly under his control" and in Row 1 of  Table  8B
    of Appendix A that the applicant "(a) has money of his  own  under  his
    control ..." or "(b)(ii) has money under his control ...".  In relation
    to Ms Wu, this included the requirement in Row 1(b) of Table 9B to  (i)
    have "money of his own under his control ..."  or  "(ii)(2)  has  money
    under his control ...".


76. The specified documents in paragraphs 60 to  61-SD  of  Appendix  A  on
    their face only deal with two particular matters, namely the  exclusion
    of money that a loan has been secured against, and, that money  of  his
    own includes that of a spouse or partner subject to specific evidential
    requirements.  These are self-evidently distinct from  the  requirement
    for an applicant to be able to establish satisfaction of the underlying
    relevant Immigration Rules such  as  the  award  of  points  under  the
    relevant Table as they only deal with  evidential  requirements  for  a
    specific element of control and could not of themselves establish it.


77. The burden is on an applicant to satisfy the Respondent that the  money
    was under their control to meet the requirements of the  rules  and  in
    the Administrative Review letter, it was stated that the decision  that
    the funds were not under the  applicants'  control  was  taken  on  the
    "balance of all of the evidence", after considering  "all  factors  and
    evidence" and "on consideration of this evidence as a whole  ...  on  a
    balance of probabilities".


78. In these circumstances, we do not find that  the  Respondent  erred  in
    applying the wrong test or standard in refusing either  application  by
    the mere reference to "reasonable grounds to believe" in  the  original
    refusal letters.  As expressly confirmed in the  Administrative  Review
    decisions,  the  standard  which  was  applied  was  the   balance   of
    probabilities and this is borne out by the detailed assessment  of  the
    evidence before the Respondent at the date of decision  and  considered
    further below in relation to the second ground of challenge.

Ground 2 - requirement for an application to have "money under his  control"
& Ground 3 - whether the Respondent properly concluded that  the  applicants
did not have control at the required time

79. The first issue raised in the second ground of challenge turns  on  the
    interpretation of 'control' and the point in time at which a person has
    to have money under his control (either at  the  point  when  money  is
    invested or afterwards, being control over the investment itself at the
    date of decision, or both).  The second issue is then, as  set  out  in
    the  third  ground  of  challenge,  whether  the  Respondent   properly
    concluded that neither A1 nor Ms Wu had the requisite  control  at  the
    required time.  We consider these grounds together.


80. Neither party suggested a specific definition of what  'control'  means
    or how this  is  to  be  interpreted  in  the  relevant  parts  of  the
    Immigration Rules for  Tier  1  (Investor)  Migrants,  the  submissions
    instead focusing on elements of what it could include and what it could
    not include.  In relation to when 'control'  is  required,  submissions
    were made both ways by the parties but with an apparent common position
    that it is control at the point of investment, to be determined at  the
    date of decision.


81. In relation to the meaning of control  (the  relevant  requirements  in
    relation to which being set out above in paragraph 72 for each  of  the
    applicants), the applicants' case is that something less than  complete
    and unfettered control is required.  In any commercial situation,  some
    degree of control has to be relinquished by an investor, even if simply
    a deposit in a savings account which can be subject to  specific  terms
    and  conditions  for  withdrawal  and  that  control  cannot   possibly
    rationally be interpreted as meaning entirely  unrestricted  access  to
    and use of the money or investments  in  question.   Numerous  examples
    were given of the different meanings ascribed to the concept of control
    in commercial contexts and the different forms of control which  exist,
    in contrast to the lack of definition or specific type of control being
    specified within the Immigration Rules.


82. Ms Weston submitted that one can look to paragraph 61A of Appendix A to
    give an indication of the 'mischief' behind  the  requirement  to  have
    control over the money invested, specifically that money which is  used
    as security for a loan cannot be under  a  person's  control.   It  was
    submitted that this is an obvious  instance  of  a  situation  where  a
    person does not have control of the  money  or  investment  because  it
    would have been ceded to a third party - a creditor of the  investor  -
    and therefore could not be used by the investor to invest in the United
    Kingdom and would be vulnerable to forfeiture in the event  of  default
    under a loan agreement.  This, however, is contrasted  with  the  usual
    commercial situations in which some degree of control has to  be  ceded
    to be able to benefit the destination of an investment.


83. It was submitted on behalf of the  applicants  that  they  plainly  had
    effective and ultimate control over the Maxwell loans to them  and  had
    effective and ultimate control over the  investments  in  Eclectic,  in
    that (i) neither are (or  were)  subject  to  any  security;  (ii)  the
    applicants had the legal right under  their  respective  agreements  to
    require Maxwell to pay the loans directly to an AID  company  of  their
    choosing; and (iii) the applicants have a legal right to  redeem  their
    shares in Eclectic after six years.


84. The applicants'  case  is  that  none  of  the  reasons  given  by  the
    Respondent for finding that investments were not under the  applicants'
    control, namely the links between the companies involved; the view that
    the applicants were required to invest in Eclectic; the poor commercial
    returns  and  lack  of  rights  to  dispose  of  shares  or   terminate
    agreements;  were  relevant   or   valid   reasons,   individually   or
    cumulatively, for concluding that the applicants did not  have  control
    within the meaning of the Immigration Rules because (i)  none  involved
    ceding any control of  the  loans  or  investments  to  third  parties,
    whether as security or otherwise; and (ii)  each  benefited  (or  would
    have benefited) Eclectic.


85. The above is premised on control being required after  the  investment,
    even though Ms Weston submitted that this of itself would be irrational
    under the rules.  If in the alternative the money needed to be under an
    applicant's control at the point of investment,  the  applicants  state
    that on the facts they have demonstrated  this.   The  applicants  both
    rely on the terms of their respective  loan  agreements  with  Maxwell,
    which do not expressly define or require investment to be made  in  any
    particular company, only that it  has  to  be  made  in  an  AID.   The
    definition of AID in section 1.1(i) is "investments in share capital or
    loan capital in active trading UK  registered  companies"  and  section
    1.1(j) of the loan agreement defines AID Company as  "company  for  the
    purposes of AID".  The agreement does not refer to any specific company
    and within the agreement references to the singular include the  plural
    and vice versa, such that it cannot be interpreted either as  a  single
    AID company.  Further, the agreement does not mention Eclectic  at  all
    and it cannot be read into the agreement that  the  references  to  AID
    Company are to Eclectic and Eclectic alone.


86. The Respondent's primary position  is  not  that  the  applicants  lost
    control of their investments once made, but that they had no control of
    the money before it was invested.  In any event, it was submitted  that
    the provisions of the  Immigration  Rules  had  to  be  interpreted  in
    accordance with the normal rules set out in Mahad and not by  reference
    to commercial or banking practice and there was  no  clear  or  express
    intention within the rules to restrict the  meaning  of  control  to  a
    single criterion as is suggested by the reference to paragraph  61A  of
    Appendix A.


87. Returning to the first issue raised, as to what is meant  by  'control'
    in the relevant Immigration Rules, we do not consider it to be  helpful
    nor required to set out, beyond what  is  already  in  the  Immigration
    Rules, a definition of 'control'.  This word has to be interpreted,  in
    the usual way, in accordance with its  natural  and  ordinary  meaning,
    namely that a person has the authority to manage and/or direct the  use
    of the money, asset or investment (depending on the context).  This  is
    not just a question of legal or beneficial ownership of the  same,  but
    includes an element of choice and use.  To determine whether  a  person
    has the requisite control, it is necessary to look at all of the  facts
    and circumstances of the case and  with  reference  to  the  overriding
    requirement in paragraph 245ED(e) of the Immigration  Rules  (at  least
    for the purposes of an application for further leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant)  that  the  "assets  and  investment  he  is
    claiming points for must be wholly under his control".  The addition of
    the requirement of 'wholly' shows a higher level of  control  than  one
    may normally expect in some commercial situations, but that  is  to  be
    expected given that not every investment will satisfy the  requirements
    for a grant of leave to remain under this route (for example,  see  the
    restrictions on qualifying investments in paragraph 65A of Appendix A).


88. We agree with the parties who appeared to be largely in agreement  that
    for the purposes of Row 1 (b)(ii) of Table 8B  and  Row  1  (a)(ii)(2),
    (b)(ii)(2), and (c)(ii)(2) of Table 9B of  the  Immigration  Rules,  an
    applicant  must  establish  control  of  the  money  at  the  point  of
    investment, rather than after investment, to be satisfied at  the  date
    of decision.


89. In the circumstances of an application for extension of leave to remain
    or indefinite leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Investor)  Migrant  under
    either Table 8B or 9B, the money referred to in  in  Row  1  must  have
    already been invested in the UK, as necessitated  by  the  requirements
    which follow in Rows 2 and 3 that a person 'has invested' and  done  so
    within a specified timescale absent compelling reasons for  delay.   We
    find this supports the view that the date at which  an  applicant  must
    show that they had money under their control (either their own money or
    money loaned to them) must refer to the time period  before  investment
    as it is that same money which is then used for investment  to  satisfy
    the other requirements.  That view is supported by the construction  of
    the Immigration Rules which refers to a  sliding  scale  of  investment
    according to the length of  time  an  investor  has  spent  in  the  UK
    identifying that a 'specified continuous period must  have  been  spent
    with leave as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant'


90. Ms Anderson submitted that in all of the circumstances, it was  plainly
    rational for the Respondent to find, on the evidence as a  whole,  that
    neither applicant made  a  genuine  investment  of  money  under  their
    control; taking into account in particular that they were  required  to
    invest the funds in Eclectic (for the reasons set out in  the  decision
    letter by reference to the terms of  the  Loan  Agreements,  the  links
    between the companies and the terms of investment), the  limitation  on
    what they could do with their investments compared  to  the  unilateral
    power of Eclectic to control the investments and the  poor  returns  on
    them.  These reasons were all  expressly  set  out  in  the  respective
    decision letters.


91. The applicants challenged the Respondent's reference to the investments
    not being genuine, as not being founded in any of the  requirements  in
    the Immigration Rules for a grant of  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Investor) Migrant.  The Rules do not require  any  assessment  of  the
    commercial value and rationale of an investment and it is not necessary
    for any investment to be a good one.  The applicants' case is that  the
    only requirement under Table 8B or 9B is that the investment is  in  an
    active and trading UK registered company, as defined in  paragraph  65A
    of the Immigration Rules.


92. We pause here to note that on the evidence before  us,  the  applicants
    had not  submitted  documents  to  the  Respondent  to  show  that  the
    requirement in paragraph 65A(b)  of  Appendix  A  had  been  met,  that
    Eclectic was an active and trading UK registered company,  there  being
    no bank statements or similar document demonstrating a UK bank  account
    showing current business transactions.


93. At the oral hearing, Ms Weston  repeatedly  submitted  that  it  was  a
    rational choice for both A1 and Ms Wu to deal with  everything  in  one
    package as part of a scheme to meet the requirements of the Immigration
    Rules and the  administrative  convenience  of  doing  so  would  be  a
    legitimate benefit to both of them,  who  wished  to  relocate  to  the
    United  Kingdom  without  the  difficulty  of  withdrawing  money  from
    investments made in China.  It was suggested that  the  primary  motive
    for investment did not have to be good commercial returns (or  in  fact
    any commercial return), nor was that required by the Immigration  Rules
    for a grant of leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant.


94. The difficulty with this submission is that it was not founded  in  any
    evidence from the applicants themselves, nor was  that  their  position
    when interviewed by the Respondent.  For example, in her interview,  A1
    expressly stated that she invested in Eclectic, having become aware  of
    them from a recommendation from Maxwell which she trusted (questions 29
    and 31) and sought to invest in Eclectic because  their  projects  were
    attractive and potentially lucrative on  a  long-term  basis  (question
    30).  When asked how the investment in  Eclectic  compared  with  other
    investments she considered, A1 answered  that  "this  project  is  more
    retainable and can be lucrative on the long term"  (question  38).   A1
    was asked why she chose to invest in this way in Eclectic, to which she
    stated, "Its just I have confidence in the business projects  they  are
    engaged in with a wine or media industry have great confidence in these
    projects.  I am very experienced investor so I  do  evaluate  and  seek
    profit for myself" (question 53).


95. There is nothing within the interview  with  A1  or  elsewhere  in  the
    documents submitted to the Respondent which makes any  suggestion  that
    her motive for taking out a loan from Maxwell to invest in Eclectic was
    anything  other  than  commercial  and  profit  driven,  with  specific
    reference being made to A1's experience as an investor.   There  is  no
    hint of any consideration of administrative or other  convenience,  nor
    of any recognition of the very poor commercial  terms  upon  which  she
    invested in Eclectic.


96. In her interview, Ms Wu did state that she made  her  investment  using
    loan funds rather than her own money because it was a convenient way to
    invest without needing to transfer money from China  and  so  that  she
    could leave assets in China with high  returns.   In  response  to  the
    investment in  Eclectic,  Ms  Wu  stated  that  this  was  one  of  the
    suggestions made by Maxwell and that she compared these investments and
    made her choice, with the Eclectic projects compared to all the options
    bringing her a more lucrative  return  with  less  risk,  ensuring  the
    investment retained its value (question 29 and 30) and that she thought
    "the investment projects will give better return than other products in
    other companies" (question 32).


97. As with A1, there is nothing in the interview with Ms Wu  or  elsewhere
    in the documents submitted to the Respondent which makes any suggestion
    that her motive for taking  out  a  loan  from  Maxwell  to  invest  in
    Eclectic was anything other than a commercial and profit driven and  no
    suggestion that even part of the reason for this was administrative  or
    other convenience.  In answers given in interview, it was clear that Ms
    Wu was not aware of and did not understand the detail or nature of  the
    agreements signed, nor did she recognise or address the poor commercial
    return on her investment in Eclectic.


98. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out by the  Respondent  in
    the decision letter, the nature of the investment made cannot  possibly
    have been for good commercial reasons (there were none, the  applicants
    having both made payments of interest upfront at the outset of the loan
    which were greater than the dividend payment to be made to  them  after
    six years of shareholding), as claimed by both applicants, which itself
    raises the question of whether it was a freely made investment of  each
    applicant's own choosing.  We find that this, combined with  the  links
    between Maxwell and Eclectic and the  terms  of  the  loan  agreements,
    entitled the Respondent to draw a rational and lawful  conclusion  that
    in all the circumstances of the investment, the applicants did not have
    a free choice to invest in Eclectic, but that they were required to  do
    so.  As such, the applicants were lawfully and rationally found not  to
    have had money under their control for the purposes  of  the  award  of
    points under Row 1(b)(ii) of Table 8B for A1 or under  Row  1(b)(ii)(2)
    of Table 9B for Ms Wu.  Further, for the same reasons as identified  by
    the Respondent, neither had sufficient  control  of  their  investments
    once made either.


99. In any event, once the further documents disclosed  to  the  Respondent
    and the Tribunal during the course of the hearing, namely the  Services
    Agreements concluded between each applicant and Maxwell  Holdings,  are
    taken into account, there can be no doubt at all that neither applicant
    had control over the funds loaned to them or the destination  of  their
    investment.  That  control  was  expressly  ceded  under  the  Services
    Agreement to Maxwell, as set out in section 3.7.4 where the  choice  of
    investment in specific instruments is at the discretion of Maxwell.  In
    addition, the Services  Agreement  required  the  applicants  to  grant
    Maxwell Holdings a Power of Attorney or other document to allow Maxwell
    Holdings to act on the applicant's behalf or to represent its interests
    on issues related to the provision of services (section 3.4);  for  the
    Manager to manage the investment account in a UK bank (section  3.3.3);
    ensured that the Manager invested the Client's  borrowed  funds  in  an
    authorised instrument (section 3.7.2); all of which show  that  control
    was ceded to a third party.


100. We were not at all persuaded by Ms Weston's submissions in relation  to
    section 3.7.4 of  the  Services  Agreement  that  'choice  of  specific
    instruments' was  unhappily  drafted  but  meant  only  a  function  of
    monitoring the  nature  of  the  vehicle  invested  in  to  ensure  the
    maintenance of the value of investment so as not to put an applicant at
    risk of an investment falling below the required level for the purposes
    of the Immigration Rules.  The submission was  contrary  to  the  plain
    wording of the section, where  in  the  Manager's  choice  of  specific
    instruments for investment was the means by which the  requirements  of
    the rules and monitoring of  satisfaction  of  those  requirements  was
    achieved.


101. Further, Ms Weston submitted that section 3.7.4 did not  specify  where
    the money was to be invested, provided  it  was  within  an  authorised
    investment.  This takes the  applicants'  case  no  further  given  the
    express wording within  the  Services  Agreement  that  the  choice  of
    destination of investments was at the discretion of  Maxwell.   It  was
    the fact that Maxwell chose where to invest, managed the  bank  account
    and actually invested the funds that is relevant for  the  purposes  of
    the applicants' lack of control rather than any specification of  which
    company Maxwell chose for the investment to be made into.


102. In any event, it was submitted that the existence of the terms  of  the
    Services  Agreement  was  not  fatal  to  either  of  the   applicant's
    applications and that these documents  would  simply  be  part  of  the
    evidence to be addressed in any further  reconsideration  decision  (on
    the assumption that the applicants were successful on the  grounds  and
    evidence as it was before the Respondent).  However, as we have already
    concluded, it is beyond doubt that the overarching  Services  Agreement
    entered into between each applicant and Maxwell Holdings ceded  control
    of the loans and investments from the applicants  to  Maxwell  Holdings
    and/or Maxwell and as such the applicants could not establish that they
    had the requisite control of  funds  loaned  to  them  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of Table 8B or 9B of Appendix A. Section 31  (2A)  of  the
    Senior Courts Act 1981 dictates that permission should  be  refused  in
    claims where it is highly likely that the  outcome  for  the  applicant
    would not be significantly different if the conduct complained  of  had
    not taken place.  This is such a case where the applications were bound
    to fail on the basis  of  the  documents  belatedly  disclosed  to  the
    Respondent and the Upper Tribunal.


103. The application for Judicial Review  must  therefore  be  dismissed  on
    grounds two and three.   Where  there  is  an  independent  substantive
    reason for refusal of both applicants' applications for leave to remain
    as a  Tier  1  (Investor)  Migrant  which  has  been  upheld  in  these
    proceedings, the applications as a whole must fail as the relief sought
    to quash the decisions under challenge cannot be granted.  It is  clear
    that the applications would have failed and the  Administrative  Review
    decision correctly upheld the initial refusal is  in  both  cases.   In
    these circumstances we deal with the  remaining  grounds  of  challenge
    relatively briefly.

Ground 4 - refusal under paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A

104. The Respondent refused both applications on the basis  that  the  funds
    invested in Eclectic were not a qualifying investment  under  paragraph
    65(b) of the Immigration Rules, primarily because  the  investment  was
    made prior to 30 June 2016 when Eclectic's principal  business  was  to
    use funds to trade investments in other companies, which is said to  be
    of a type which falls within the exclusion.  This part of the  decision
    was reiterated and confirmed within both of the  Administrative  Review
    decisions, with the additional explanation that Eclectic has attributes
    akin to investment vehicles expressly excluded by  paragraph  65(b)  of
    Appendix A.


105. The applicants' case is that paragraph  65(b)  of  Appendix  A  to  the
    Immigration Rules provides an exhaustive list of investments which  are
    excluded,  some  of  which  are  defined  in  other  legislation,   the
    definitions for which are not satisfied in the case of Eclectic and  it
    is not sufficient for the Respondent to merely say  that  Eclectic  has
    attributes akin to these types of investment vehicle.


106. Specifically, an 'open-ended investment company' is defined in  section
    236 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and by Regulation  2
    of The Open-Ended Investment Companies Regulations 2001,  which,  inter
    alia, means a body incorporated by virtue of  regulation  3(1)  of  the
    latter,  authorised  as  such  by  the  Financial  Conduct   Authority.
    Eclectic has not been authorised under this provision.


107.  A  pooled  investment  vehicle,  otherwise  known  as   a   collective
    investment scheme is defined in section 235 of the  Financial  Services
    and Markets Act 2000 and said not to  apply  to  Eclectic  because  the
    original investment was  made  by  way  of  a  simple  loan  which  was
    subsequently converted into shares.


108. An  investment  trust  company  is  defined  in  section  1558  of  the
    Corporation Tax Act 2010, which includes the  requirement  that  shares
    are publicly traded on a regulated market.


109. The applicants have not  identified  any  statutory  definition  of  an
    investment syndicate company but referred to explanations of this  from
    other sources.  It is said that Eclectic is  not  an  investment  trust
    company because it is not publicly traded on the stock market and  that
    it is not an investment syndicate company  because  resources  are  not
    pooled for the purpose of investing in a specific business venture.


110. The Respondent points to the rationale for the Tier 1 (Investor)  route
    to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom, which is to  encourage
    capital investment in UK companies as well as generate tax revenue from
    the  same.   For  these  reasons,  certain  investments  are  excluded,
    including those in investment vehicles which essentially  reinvest  the
    money elsewhere but with no guarantee that the ultimate destination  of
    the further investment is in a UK trading company.  This is the  policy
    objective behind paragraph 65(b) of  Appendix  A  consistent  with  the
    guidance given for such applications as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant.


111. Ms Anderson submitted that the list in paragraph 65(b)  of  Appendix  A
    was not exhaustive and that the Respondent could  not  be  expected  to
    list each and every possible thing or scheme which would not  meet  the
    policy objective of ensuring  a  controlled  investment,  the  ultimate
    destination of which is within the United Kingdom.   It  was  submitted
    that  there  is  no  limitation  intended  by  specific   or   implicit
    incorporation of a technical meaning of the phrases listed in paragraph
    65(b) of Appendix A from any other definition used for  non-immigration
    purposes.  Given the purpose of the Immigration Rules and  their  self-
    contained nature aimed at a 'standalone' status enabling applicants  to
    know the position by reading the Rules, they would have  contained  any
    specific definitions to those terms if applicable.  In the  absence  of
    any prescribed definitions in the Immigration Rules, it  was  submitted
    that in line with the guidance in Mahad, the normal presumption must be
    that these  expressions  are  intended  to  have  their  plain  English
    meanings.


112. The Respondent highlights general meanings attributed to  each  of  the
    expressions outside of the legislation referred to and relied  upon  by
    the applicants.  On the basis that all of the types of investments  are
    grouped together within one paragraph, the Respondent says that on  the
    ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, it is not necessary to
    determine which of the four types or similar  type  of  vehicle  covers
    Eclectic.  It is sufficient that all of these types of investments have
    in common the feature that  they  involve  funds  from  many  different
    investors being aggregated into a single fund which is then invested in
    diverse investments, for which there is no guarantee  of  the  ultimate
    destination being within the UK.


113. The Respondent submits that the accounts for Eclectic show some 98%  of
    its value consisted of investments (104 different  people  having  each
    loaned at least �1 million to Eclectic who then subsequently  converted
    the loans into share capital) and that such  investments  were  not  in
    Eclectic itself as a company, but were in practice used to make further
    investment in separate companies, some of which  were  subsidiaries  of
    Eclectic with common ownership  by  NK,  including  dormant  companies.
    However, as at June 2016, all except one of  the  investments  were  in
    Russian companies, the remaining one being in a company incorporated in
    Jersey.  There is a lack of evidence of any substantial  investment  by
    Eclectic in active trading UK companies.


114. Of the four vehicles expressly listed in paragraph  65(b)  of  Appendix
    A, not all have statutory definitions, with one  described  in  various
    ways by different financial dictionaries and publications.   We  cannot
    at least for this one identify a consistent or agreed definition.


115. In the context of the Immigration Rules, there  are  numerous  examples
    of  specific  terms  being  identified  by   reference   to   statutory
    definitions or provisions, either in the common interpretation  section
    or generally throughout the rules.  The terms listed in paragraph 65(b)
    of the Immigration Rules are not so defined, either within that section
    or elsewhere within the Immigration Rules and there is no provision  of
    interpretation applicable generally across the rules that the  meanings
    given to terms in other legislation outside of the immigration  context
    are  to  be  applied  within   the   Immigration   Rules.    In   these
    circumstances, the ordinary rules of interpretation of the  Immigration
    Rules apply, that is that the terms bear  their  ordinary  and  natural
    meaning.


116. We do not find it necessary to set out  a  specific  interpretation  of
    each of the four terms listed because, having  considered  the  various
    descriptions and definitions put forward by  both  parties,  we  accept
    that there is a common theme to all four that funds are invested  by  a
    number of different people and used not for the benefit directly of the
    company invested in, but are at least to some extent pooled and used as
    capital  for  further  investments  in  other  companies,   the   final
    destination  of  which  is  not  necessarily  easily  identifiable   or
    determined and there is no guarantee that such investment  is  made  in
    other active trading companies within the UK.  Such investments  defeat
    the purpose and clarity of the Tier 1 (Investor) scheme and we find the
    Respondent was therefore  rationally  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
    investment in Eclectic by both applicants was  excluded  from  being  a
    qualifying investment because it shared  the  common  features  of  the
    vehicles listed in paragraph 65(b) of Appendix A.


 Ground 5 - Ms Wu's evidence of personal assets

117. This ground of challenge was not  pursued  orally  at  the  substantive
    hearing, with reliance placed by Ms Weston only on the initial  written
    grounds of challenge.


118. Ms Wu asserts that in relation to evidence of personal  assets  with  a
    value of no less than �10 million as required  in  Row  1(b)(ii)(1)  of
    Table 9B in Appendix A, all of the specified evidence required  by  the
    rules had been met.  This  included  a  letter  from  Maxwell  dated  7
    February 2014 confirming Ms Wu's net worth and the same being confirmed
    within the application form.  There was no further  specified  evidence
    required within the  Immigration  Rules  over  and  above  the  initial
    confirmation provided by an FCA regulated body in her first application
    for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor).


119. For similar reasons to those set out in relation to ground  one  above,
    the burden is on an  applicant  to  show  that  he  or  she  meets  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  In  the  Points  Based  System,
    these are substantive requirements set out in  the  main  body  of  the
    rules, with additional specific requirements for the  award  of  points
    set out, in this case in Appendix A, specifically Table 9B and  finally
    the specification of the relevant evidential requirements.


120. It is not the case  that  because  there  is  not  a  listed  specified
    document for each and every requirement, that it is not  necessary  for
    an applicant to provide any evidence at all to show satisfaction  of  a
    particular requirement.  Ms Wu's suggestion in  this  ground  that  the
    fact that a third party had, in early  2014  as  part  of  her  initial
    application for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Investor)  Migrant
    confirmed her net worth, was sufficient to show that as at the date  of
    application for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Investor)  or
    the date of decision thereon, that she had assets of not less than  �10
    million is wholly unsustainable.  On any  rational  view,  an  outdated
    third-party assertion of assets is woefully insufficient  to  meet  the
    express requirements for the award points set out in Row 1 of Table  9B
    in Appendix A.


121. In the alternative, Ms Wu claims that  the  Respondent  ought  to  have
    used the discretion available in paragraph  245AA  of  the  Immigration
    Rules to request further evidence of  her  assets.   However,  no  such
    discretion is available to the Respondent in the circumstances of  this
    application in accordance with the provisions in paragraph 245AA, which
    expressly only deal with required specified documents  where  specified
    evidence is missing from the documents; the document is  in  the  wrong
    format; or document does not contain all of the specified  information.
    That is not the situation here.  First, because the missing evidence to
    establish satisfaction of part of Table 9B was not specified  evidence;
    and secondly, what was missing could not on any view  fall  within  the
    categories outlined in paragraph  245AA(b)(i),  (ii)  or  (iv)  of  the
    Immigration  Rules.   In  any  event,  in  accordance  with   paragraph
    245AA(c), no request for documents would be made when an application is
    to be refused for other reasons, as it was in  this  case  under  other
    parts of the relevant Immigration Rules.  In any event, as accepted  by
    Ms Weston in submissions, this point  falls  away  if  Ms  Wu  has  not
    succeeded on her earlier grounds of challenge, which she has not.


122. Also in the alternative, Ms Wu claims that if the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied of the full value of her assets for  a  grant  of  indefinite
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Investor), she should have considered  the
    application as one for further leave to remain  under  Paragraph  245ED
    and Table 8B of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  For  the  reasons
    given above in relation to the other grounds of challenge, it is  clear
    that in any event Ms Wu could not satisfy  these  requirements  either,
    such that any  alternative  consideration  by  the  Respondent  of  the
    application for leave to remain was bound to fail.

Ground 6 - application of paragraph 65-SD(a)(vii) of Appendix A to  Ms  Wu's
application

123. Ms Wu's final ground of challenge is that the Respondent was  wrong  to
    say that the report and unaudited accounts of  Eclectic  did  not  give
    full details of her investments sufficient  to  satisfy  paragraph  65-
    SD(a)(vii) of Appendix A to  the  Immigration  Rules  in  circumstances
    where there was a compilation report from Sarmand Accountants dated  22
    December 2016 which gave full details of such investment.


124. In any event, Ms Wu claims that paragraph 65-SD(a)(vii) of  Appendix  A
    does not apply to her at all because as at her date of application  and
    the date of decision, all loaned funds to Eclectic had  been  converted
    to preference shares and this provision only  applies  to  loan  funds'
    investments.


125. This ground of challenge was not developed orally  at  the  substantive
    hearing.  The Respondent does not accept  this  interpretation  of  the
    Immigration Rules, but in any event submitted even  if  this  provision
    did not apply, this part of the decision could  not  materially  affect
    the outcome of Ms Wu's application which was bound to  fail  for  other
    substantive reasons.


126. For the reasons already set out above, this final ground  of  challenge
    is wholly immaterial to the outcome of these applications for  Judicial
    Review and we therefore make no detailed findings on the application of
    paragraph 65-SD(a)(vii) of Appendix A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    whether or not it applies only  to  investments  which  were  made  and
    continue  as  loans  to  companies,  or  whether  the  requirement   is
    restricted only to existing loan funds.


Order


We order, therefore, that the judicial review application be dismissed.


Costs

The  Applicants  shall  pay  the  Respondent's  reasonable  costs  of  these
applications, to be subject to detailed assessment if not agreed.


Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

The Applicants sought permission to appeal on the  generic  basis  that  the
Upper Tribunal  made  unreasonable  findings  of  fact,  misinterpreted  the
immigration rules and failed to apply them lawfully.   The  Applicants  have
not particularised the grounds of appeal at all and have not identified  the
specific  findings  or  immigration  rules  said  to  be   unreasonable   or
misinterpreted.  In any event, we refuse permission to appeal to  the  Court
of Appeal because there is no arguable error of law in the decision above.

|29. How did you originally become  |When I signed the loan agreement   |
|aware of Eclectic Capital?         |Maxwell he suggested some companies|
|                                   |and UK gilts and bonds as well as  |
|                                   |Eclectic.                          |
|                                   |I compared all these investments   |
|                                   |and made my choice.                |
|30. Why did you seek to invest in  |Eclectic projects compared to other|
|Eclectic Capital rather than any   |options I think will bring me a    |
|other company?                     |more lucrative return.             |
|                                   |The gilts was a less return.       |
|                                   |The shares involved too much risk. |
|                                   |I have to make sure the investment |
|                                   |retain its value.                  |
|31. What due diligence/checks did  |I have had a look at their profile |
|you do on Eclectic Capital before  |and companies house at the time it |
|decided to invest on them?         |was trading.                       |
|32. What made you choose this      |For the same reason I think the    |
|company?                           |investment projects will give      |
|                                   |better return than other products  |
|                                   |in other companies.                |
|36. What is your return from your  |I haven't received anything yet it |
|investment with Eclectic?          |will take 6 years for me to receive|
|                                   |any return.                        |
|37. Are you able to redeem your    |Yes                                |
|investment when you like?  Or can  |                                   |
|only Eclectic redeem it?           |                                   |
|38.  How does this compare with    |Its just that I like their projects|
|other investments you have         |better, I followed my mum's        |
|considered?                        |suggestion and advice              |
|(If haven't considered any         |                                   |
|investment, why not?)              |                                   |
|39. How much interest or dividends |None.                              |
|have you received from Eclectic in |I'm not sure, my focus is on my    |
|the past 2/3 years?  Are you       |carer                              |

|41. Are you able to sell the shares|No it is purely my decision.       |
|to third parties and invest        |                                   |
|elsewhere?                         |                                   |
|Or do you need the consent of      |                                   |
|Eclectic or Maxwell?               |                                   |
|53. Are you an investor who has    |I wouldn't say so because I am     |
|virtually no prospect of           |following my mum's suggestion and  |
|benefitting from the success of the|she is very successful             |
|company but stand losing capital if|businesswoman and friend has done  |
|the company is not successful?     |this and been successful.  Because |
|                                   |my parents are doing this for me I |
|                                   |have confidence in their decision. |
|                                   |So you receive dividends after 6   |
|                                   |years in your investment?          |
|                                   |That's right yes according to the  |
|                                   |investment agreement               |
|                                   |You said loan and then changed to  |
|                                   |investment so is the money an      |
|                                   |investment and not a loan from     |
|                                   |Maxwell?                           |
|                                   |It is a loan                       |
|                                   |What happens when you have to pay  |
|                                   |Maxwell back?                      |
|                                   |I haven't considered about the     |
|                                   |repayment yet but if the investment|
|                                   |is doing well then I will look at  |
|                                   |paying the loan by other means but |
|                                   |if the investment is not doing well|
|                                   |I will regain the investment and   |
|                                   |repay the loan.                    |
|                                   |If you repay Maxwell by withdrawing|
|                                   |your investment you will not       |
|                                   |receive dividends is this correct? |
|                                   |This is the case but I have no     |
|                                   |reason to withdraw, I don't have to|
|                                   |repay the loan after 5/6 years, I  |
|                                   |can extend the loan.               |
