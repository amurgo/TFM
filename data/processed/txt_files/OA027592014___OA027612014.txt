                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Miss Akinbolu, Counsel

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, on
    behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer, Moscow, against the decision  of
    a First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Emerton)  allowing  the  appeals  of  the
    Respondents against the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  of  28th
    January 2014 refusing them entry as the dependent spouse  and  daughter
    of a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant "the Sponsor"

 2. For the sake of clarity I shall refer throughout this decision  to  the
    Respondents as "the Appellants" and to the Entry Clearance  Officer  as
    "the Respondent" reflecting their respective positions before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. The Appellants are father and daughter.  The second Appellant's  appeal
    is dependent upon that of her father and consequently stands  or  falls
    in line with his appeal.  The First Appellant is the spouse  of  a  PBS
    Tier 1 Investor, Mrs Oxana Shtorm.  [DS] is their  daughter  and  is  5
    years of age.  Mr & Mrs Shtorm and [DS] are all citizens of Russia.

Background

 4. The sponsor was granted entry clearance as a Tier 1 (Investor)  Migrant
    valid until April 2016.  Her husband and daughter applied for entry  as
    her dependants.  The Entry Clearance Officer refused both  applications
    in accordance with paragraph 320(2)(b) of  the  Immigration  Rules,  on
    account of the First Appellant having received a conviction in  Russia,
    for an offence  for  which  he  had  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
    imprisonment of at least four years.

 5. Both Appellants appealed the Entry Clearance Officer's decision on  the
    grounds that he had  wrongly  applied  paragraph  320(2)(b).  This  was
    because the previously registered  conviction  had  gone  in  that  the
    Russian courts had effectively  declared  Mr  Shtorm  to  be  a  person
    without conviction.

First-tier Tribunal Hearing

 6. The  appeals  came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   That  Tribunal
    identified that the matter  under  consideration  revolved  around  the
    application of Section 320(2)(b) with a need for particular  regard  to
    the situation in Russian law.

 7. In reaching its assessment the FtT approached the matter  (incorrectly)
    on the footing that the burden lay upon the  Appellant  to  demonstrate
    that paragraph 320(2) did not apply.  She took into account two  expert
    reports, in particular one from a Robert Yuryevich,  a  member  of  the
    Moscow Bar  Association  who  gave  an  expert  opinion  outlining  the
    processes adopted by the Criminal Code in Russia.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal also took account of the  documentary  evidence
    produced, most importantly the documents showing Mr  Shtorm's  original
    conviction  and  the  "resolution"  document  expunging  the   original
    conviction.

 9. At [24] the FtT said this:

         "24.     I note (from the translation of the 'resolution') that the
             district court found that the first Appellant had  obeyed  the
             parole rules, and had evidence of good behaviour,  and  having
             taken into account 'the convict's personal characteristics and
             his behaviour after the release, the court deems  it  possible
             to withdraw the conviction of Mr  M  V  Shtorm,  such  as  his
             improvement is confirmed  by  his  behaviour'.   The  relevant
             parts of the Criminal Code are quoted, and the Court  resolved
             'To withdraw the conviction of  Mikhail  V  Shtorm  previously
             imposed by the  Nagatinsky  District  Court  of  the  City  of
             Moscow, and to treat the  said  person  as  a  person  without
             conviction'."

10. The FtT then  looked  at  the  two  expert  reports,  those  of  Robert
    Yuryevich and  the  legal  opinion  of  Patricia  Scotland  QC.  Having
    considered those, the FtT correctly cautioned itself at [27] saying  it
    was for the FtT to make up its own mind as to the merits of the appeal.
     Having considered all the evidence before  it,  the  FtT  allowed  the
    Appellants' appeals on the basis that  the  First  Appellant  is  under
    Russian  law  a  man  without  a  conviction  and  therefore  paragraph
    320(2)(b) does not apply to him.

Permission to Appeal

11. The Respondent sought permission to appeal  the  FtT's  decision.   The
    original  grounds  seeking  permission  asserted  that  the   FtT   had
    misdirected itself because:

       . The decision of the Russian court, contained  in  "the  resolution"
         was tantamount to showing the offence  as  being  spent  under  the
         Rehabilitation of  Offenders  Act  1974  and  therefore  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer was entitled to rely on information about a spent
         conviction when considering an application.

       . The judge adopted the wrong approach in  that  she  looked  at  the
         conviction through the lens of Russian law, when it  was  necessary
         to consider this case through the prism of UK legislation.

12. Permission was refused initially by the  FtT,  but  was  granted  on  a
    renewed application to the Upper Tribunal The  relevant  parts  of  the
    grant of permission are set out here:

         "3.  The Grounds contend that  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
             erred in his assessment of paragraph 320(2) of the immigration
             rules with respect to the 1st Appellant's previous  conviction
             on 01 August 2005 and the nature and effect of the  subsequent
             decision of a Russian Court  in  August  2009  to  cancel  his
             conviction and treat him as  'a  person  without  conviction'.
             The Respondent contends that  the  August  2009  decision  was
             essentially based on the 1st Appellant's good behaviour,  that
             his earlier conviction had been validly reached, and that  the
             effect of the August 2009 decision was similar to that of  the
             Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

           4. From [22] to [27] the Judge undertook a thorough assessment of
             the evidence and arguments advanced by the parties.   At  [25]
             the Judge specifically  considered  whether  the  August  2009
             decision was analogous to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act,
             and at [26] he considered two expert opinions  in  respect  of
             the effect of the August 2009 decision in Russian law and  the
             approach that English courts would take  in  respect  of  that
             decision.

           5. The Judge's decision  is  undeniably  well  reasoned.   It  is
             nevertheless arguable that the Judge may  have  erred  in  his
             legal assessment of the effect of the August 2009 decision vis-
             ï¿½-vis  the  requirements  of  paragraph  320(2).   The   Upper
             Tribunal  may  wish  to  consider,  inter  alia,  whether  the
             determination of whether a person 'has been  convicted  of  an
             offence' should be considered exclusively by reference to  the
             law of the Appellant's country or nationality in circumstances
             where the initial conviction was lawfully reached."

    Thus the matter comes before me to determine whether the FtT's decision
    contains such error that the decision must be set aside and re-made.

Error of Law Hearing

13. Before me Mr Walker appeared for the Respondent; Miss Akinbolu for  the
    Appellants.  Mr Walker's submissions  kept  to  the  lines  of  grounds
    seeking permission.  Miss Akinbolu prepared a Rule  24  response  which
    she relied upon.

Consideration

14. I am satisfied that the decision of the  FtT  is  sustainable  for  the
    following reasons.  Miss Akinbolu  argues,  quite  properly,  that  the
    Respondent bears the burden of proving that the First Appellant is  for
    the  purposes  of  the  Immigration  Rules  "a  person  who  has   been
    convicted".  The FtT in fact wrongly reversed the burden of proof,  but
    clearly  that  cannot  have  been  to  the  Respondent's  disadvantage,
    therefore no material error occurs there.

15. In reaching its decision the FtT placed reliance on the evidence of the
    two experts and gave full reasons why it concluded that the  effect  of
    the  "resolution"  document  of  August  2009  means  that  the   First
    Appellant's conviction is withdrawn.

16. The FtT was entitled to place reliance upon the experts' report,  since
    no other evidence was produced outlining the Russian criminal code  and
    processes. As the FtT found, Robert Yuryevich's report  notes  that  in
    accordance with Russian law, the resolution has  the  legal  effect  of
    cancelling "all legal  consequences  related  to  the  conviction"  for
    Russian law purposes.

17. Further I find that  the  FtT  expressly  considered  the  question  of
    whether the resolution should be treated as a  "spent  conviction"  but
    rejected that proposition and gave full reasons why it did so.

18. The original grounds seeking permission  put  forward  the  proposition
    that it is necessary to consider Section 320 through the "prism  of  UK
    law" since to look through the lens of Russian law would be conceivably
    perverse. This is because to adopt this approach suggests that  persons
    rehabilitated under Russian law would be in a more favourable  position
    that persons convicted in England and Wales.   This  seems  to  be  the
    point outlined  by  Judge  Blum  in  paragraph  [5]  of  his  grant  of
    permission.

19. However I find force in Miss Akinbolu's submission that it is not  open
    to the United Kingdom to unilaterally  reassess  a  decision  that  the
    Russian courts have reached. I heard nothing that would allow me to  do
    so.  In any event I find that the FtT dealt with that  point  fully  at
    [26] again giving full reasons why it was accepted that it was for  the
    Russian authorities to determine whether or not the  conviction  should
    be expunged in accordance with their legal systems.

20. Accordingly for the foregoing reasons I find that the decisions of  the
    FtT allowing the Appellants appeals contains no error of law  requiring
    it to be set aside.  The  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is  therefore
    dismissed.

Notice of Decision
