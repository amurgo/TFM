                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer  (ECO).  However,  for
    the purposes of this  decision,  I  shall  refer  to  the  ECO  as  the
    Respondent and Mrs Khan as the Appellant, reflecting their positions as
    they were in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  18th  December  1986.  She
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom to join  her  husband
    (the sponsor) who is a British citizen, under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. Her application  was  refused  on
    7th August 2014, on the grounds that she did  not  meet  the  financial
    eligibility requirement under the Rules. This was  on  account  of  the
    fact that she had not provided all of the specified documents  required
    under Appendix FM-SE.

 3. The Appellant appealed that decision and her  appeal  came  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal on 14th May 2015. In a decision promulgated on  2nd
    June 2015, the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  her  appeal  under  the
    Immigration rules but allowed it on human rights grounds, under Article
    8 ECHR private/family life. Judge Cox  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    sponsor, and considered the documentary evidence before him. He made  a
    finding  that  he  was  satisfied   that   the   documentary   evidence
    demonstrated that the sponsor had a  stable  income,  as  an  ice-cream
    vendor, of at least �12,000 per annum. The difficulty arose, he  noted,
    in respect of the specified evidence demonstrating an additional source
    of income to meet the shortfall from the sponsor's  self-employment  as
    an ice-cream vendor. The sponsor claimed in  evidence  that  he  had  a
    source of additional income, to his main income, from  rental  property
    receipts. This came to over �6,800 per annum. The Judge  found  however
    that he could not be satisfied that the documents produced  to  support
    this claim showed the additional income amounted to �6,800  per  annum.
    Accordingly he could not be satisfied that the Appellant  was  able  to
    show by way of specified evidence, that her husband had a gross  annual
    income of at least �18,600. The Judge found therefore that  the  appeal
    failed under the Immigration Rules.

 4. He then went on to consider Article 8 ECHR and  decided  to  allow  the
    appeal on private/family life basis.

 5. In his reasons for  do  so  the  Judge  went  through  the  eligibility
    requirements under the Rules and said the following;

         "However,  the  difficulty  for  the  Sponsor  is  that  his  self-
         employment  income  is  not  sufficient  to  meet   the   financial
         eligibility requirements of the rules and that  it  is  only  since
         March 2015 that his bank statements will  show  the  whole  of  his
         rental income being  deposited  into  his  account.  As  such,  the
         Appellant will have to wait a further year before she can re-apply.
         Accordingly, the effect of the Respondent's decision  is  that  the
         family unit will remain separated for the immediate future  and  at
         least for another year.

         The Sponsor is a British Citizen, who has strong ties to the UK. He
         has an established  business  and  owns  a  number  of  properties.
         Understandably, he wants to spend as much time as possible with the
         Appellant and since his marriage he has been back to Pakistan every
         year to be with the Appellant. He told  me  that  if  stays  for  3
         months between November and February, but pointed out that,  if  he
         remained in the UK, he would be able  to  earn  additional  income.
         These factors weigh in the Appellant and the Sponsor's favour.

         In my view a further factor that weighs in the Appellant's  favour,
         is the delay in making a decision. The Appellant paid a fee of over
         �1,000. This is not an insignificant sum of money  and,  I  believe
         she was entitled to expect that a decision will be  made  within  a
         reasonable period of time. However, the Respondent took over a year
         to make a final decision and I am satisfied that a  delay  of  this
         magnitude falls outside an acceptable standard of service.

         In any event, the most compelling features of this  case  are  that
         the Appellant miscarried in 2014 prior to the ECO's decision,  that
         she is now pregnant again and is  due  to  give  birth  in  August.
         Although she became pregnant during the Sponsor's most recent  trip
         to Pakistan, which post dates the ECO's decision, in my view  I  am
         entitled to take this factor into account,  as  it  was  reasonably
         foreseeable that she would become  pregnant  again.  Especially  as
         they are a young couple, who wish to have a family."

 6. The ECO sought permission to appeal the FtT's  decision  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. Permission was granted on the grounds that  it  was  arguable
    that the Judge had  engaged  in  an  erroneous  consideration  of  what
    amounted to exceptional circumstances; had misapplied [38]  of  SSHD  v
    SS(Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ  387  in  his  consideration;  had
    failed to make a finding on whether the Appellant and her sponsor could
    enjoy family life outside the UK.

Appeal Hearing and Submissions

 7. The appeal came before me on 6th October 2015. I heard submissions from
    Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the ECO and after explaining the  procedure  to
    the sponsor, who attended on behalf of the  Appellant,  I  heard  brief
    evidence and submissions from him.

 8. Mr Diwnycz submitted that in order to allow the appeal under Article 8,
    the Judge had to show that there existed not only  compelling  features
    in the Appellant's case, but compelling features not dealt  with  under
    the Rules. There was nothing in this appeal which could be described as
    compelling and everything had  been  considered  under  the  Rules.  He
    submitted that the Judge had fallen into material error.  The  decision
    was unsustainable and  should  be  remade  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal.

 9. The sponsor gave evidence that his wife has now given  birth  to  their
    child. (The pregnancy relating to this child was mentioned in  [37]  of
    Judge Cox's decision). The sponsor said that his baby girl was born  in
    August. He had not yet seen his  child  because  he  was  awaiting  the
    Tribunal hearing and because he had to work in the UK to  earn  income,
    so that he can bring his family over here. He said that the  strain  of
    living apart  from  his  wife  and  child  was  hard  to  bear.  He  is
    understandably anxious to see his new baby.

Consideration/Findings

10. I am satisfied that the FtT erred in  finding  that  firstly  delay  on
    behalf of the  Respondent  and  second  the  fact  that  the  Appellant
    miscarried, amounted to exceptional circumstances such  as  to  warrant
    straying outside the Immigration Rules. The Judge further erred in  not
    giving sufficient weight to  the  distinction  between  in-country  and
    overseas cases. These errors are material ones and  for  the  following
    reasons I find the decision must be set aside and remade.

11. The argument on behalf of the Appellant was that her  circumstances  at
    the date of decision were sufficiently exceptional and compelling  that
    it was open to the Tribunal to exercise discretion and allow her appeal
    on Article 8 grounds.The exceptional circumstances put forward amounted
    to;

       . Delay by the Respondent

       . Miscarriage plus new pregnancy.

12. The Judge said at [36],

         "In my view a further factor that weighs in the Appellant's favour,
         is the delay in making a decision. The Appellant paid a fee of over
         �1,000. This is not an insignificant sum of money  and,  I  believe
         she was entitled to expect that a decision will be  made  within  a
         reasonable period of time. However, the Respondent took over a year
         to make a final decision and I am satisfied that a  delay  of  this
         magnitude falls outside an acceptable standard of service."

    A delay of over a year  in  making  the  decision  whilst  regrettable,
    hardly constitutes sufficient reasons for concluding as the  Judge  did
    that it was a delay  of  'such  magnitude'  that  it  fell  outside  an
    acceptable standard of service. The Judge was no doubt  aware,  as  was
    the Appellant, along with many other applicants,  the  reason  for  the
    decision being delayed. There is correspondence contained in  the  file
    from the Respondent explaining the reason for the delay which was  that
    the law needed to be clarified on the Rules themselves. It is  hard  to
    see therefore the reasoning  process  by  which  the  Judge  draws  the
    conclusion that he does that the respondent has given  an  unacceptable
    standard of service by a delay of such magnitude.

13. It is equally hard to see how the Judge arrived at  the  conclusion  he
    did at [37], that the most compelling features of this  case  are  that
    the Appellant miscarried in 2014 but that she is now pregnant again and
    due to give birth in August. (2015)

14. Having acknowledged the fact that the Appellant's pregnancy  post-dated
    the ECO's decision the Judge says;

         "...  I  am  entitled  to  take  this  factor  into  account   (the
         pregnancy), as it was reasonably foreseeable that she would  become
         pregnant again."

15. I find no justification for that conclusion. The Judge  would  be  well
    aware that in entry clearance cases the relevant date for consideration
    of any matter is the date of decision which in this  appeal  is  August
    2014, AS (Somalia) and another v SSHD [2009] UK HL.

16. The Appellant by the date  of  hearing  before  the  FtT,  happily  was
    pregnant once more, but is it hard to see how the ECO, in August  2014,
    could reasonably foresee that the Appellant would be pregnant  at  some
    indeterminate date in the future.

17. In short there is nothing that I can see which  justifies  the  Judge's
    decision to stray outside  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  circumstances
    relating to this Appellant's application  were  all  matters  addressed
    within the Rules. Article 8 cannot simply be  used  to  circumvent  the
    Rules, nor to give relief in a near  miss  situation.  The  appropriate
    course of action and one which remains open to the Appellant is to make
    a fresh application for entry clearance. She will  of  course  have  to
    satisfy the Respondent that she is able to meet all the requirements of
    the Rules including the evidential and financial requirements  at  that
    time.

18. For these reasons I find that the Judge  erred  in  law  and  that  his
    decision has to be set aside and remade with the original appeal  being
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.

Decision

19. The making of the decision by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been  set  aside
    and to that extent the appeal made by the ECO is allowed. I remake  the
    decision and substitute  a  decision  dismissing  Mrs  Shaista  Parveen
    Khan's appeal on all grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
