Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr A Syed-Ali instructed by Immigration Aid
For the Respondent:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants are citizens of Nepal born on 29th  September  1984  and
    14th March  1980.  They  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Scobbie dismissing their appeals against the refusal  of
    leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants under the Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was sought on  the  grounds  that  the  Judge  had
    misinterpreted  paragraph  245DD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    accumulation of points under the points based system [PBS];  misapplied
    the evidential standard of proof; failed  to  consider  the  evidential
    flexibility policy under paragraph 245AA; and failed  to  consider  the
    Appellants intentions in considering Article 8.

3.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  McGeachy  on
    4th June 2015 on the  ground  that  having  found  that  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules were met at paragraph 29, there was a lack of
    clarity in  the  subsequent  paragraphs  in  relation  to  whether  the
    Appellants  genuinely  intended  and  were  able  to  establish   their
    business.

Submissions

4.   Mr Syed-Ali relied on his skeleton argument and  submitted  that  Ahmed
    (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365 (IAC) was wrongly decided.
    The prohibition under section 85A(4) of the Nationality Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 [NIA] in relation to new  evidence  that  goes  to  the
    scoring of points did not prohibit the Appellants from establishing the
    non-points scoring based facts.

5.   The Appellants had been invited for interview  after  submitting  their
    applications and therefore could not be expected to submit evidence  in
    relation to whether their applications were genuine at the time of  the
    application. To prevent the Appellants from submitting new evidence  on
    appeal was unfair and therefore  the  Judge  should  have  allowed  the
    appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.

6.   The Judge placed too much weight on  the  Appellants'  interviews.  Had
    the judge accepted the Appellants' evidence  he  would  have  concluded
    that their applications were genuine and  they  were  entitled  to  the
    points in relation to funds. The Judge erred  in  law  in  taking  into
    account the Appellants' post decision evidence following  Ahmed,  which
    prevented the Judge from making a finding in  the  Appellants'  favour.
    The decision was lacking in clarity and should be  set  aside  and  re-
    heard.

7.   Mr Clarke submitted that Ahmed was good law, although it  would  appear
    from the decision that the Judge was not made aware of it. This was not
    material because the Appellants were not entitled  to  points  if  they
    failed the genuineness test. It was clear from paragraph 245DD(j)  that
    the Respondent had discretion to consider further evidence.  The  Judge
    had taken into account the Appellants' interviews and their  subsequent
    evidence. The Appellants had been given an opportunity to  explain  the
    discrepancies in interview. Their accounts were  vague  and  they  were
    unable to give specific details when asked. Although  the  Judge  found
    that the funds were  available,  he  was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    Appellants did not genuinely  intend  to  invest  those  funds  on  the
    evidence before him. The market research had been copied and there were
    concerns over the required skills. The Judge had not applied the  wrong
    standard of proof.

8.    Mr  Clarke  submitted  that  paragraph  245AA  applied  to   specified
    documents and was not relevant in this  case.  The  Appellants  had  no
    legitimate expectation under Article 8.

9.   Mr Syed Ali submitted that he did not rely on Article  8  save  to  say
    that it added weight to the argument to admit the Appellants' evidence.
    In relation to  paragraph  245AA,  he  submitted  that  it  applied  to
    specified documents and therefore its scope was limited. The discretion
    under paragraph 245DD(j) was wider and therefore should not be strictly
    applied. In this case the Respondent should have asked the  Appellants,
    prior to interview, to submit evidence of their intentions and  ability
    to establish their business in order  to  deal  with  the  Respondent's
    concerns about whether the applications were genuine. The failure to do
    so made a non-points scoring aspect into a points scoring one.

10.  In summary, following Ahmed, the Judge had erred in law in taking  into
    account  further  evidence.  The  Judge  should  have  found  that  the
    Respondent's decision was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  because
    unfairness had taken place. The decision should be set  aside  and  re-
    heard on the basis that Ahmed was wrongly decided and evidence relating
    to non-points scoring aspects of the PBS was admissible on appeal.

Relevant law

11.  In Ahmed and Another  (PBS:  admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT  00365
    (IAC), the panel of the Upper Tribunal chaired by Mr Ockelton, the Vice
    President, held that:

        "1.  Where a provision of the Rules (such as that in para 245DD(k))
             provides that points will not be awarded if the  decision-maker
             is not satisfied as to another (non-points-scoring)  aspect  of
             the Rule, the non-points-scoring aspect and the requirement for
             points are inextricably linked.

        2.   As a result, the prohibition on new evidence in  s  85A(4)  of
             the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies to the
             non-points-scoring aspect of the rule: the  prohibition  is  in
             relation to new evidence that goes to the scoring of points".

12.  Section 85A of the NIA Act 2002 provides as follows:

        "85A Matters to be considered: new evidence: exceptions

        (1)  This section sets out  the  exceptions  mentioned  in  Section
             85(5).

        (2)  Exception 1 is that in relation to  an  appeal  under  Section
             82(1) against an immigration decision of a  kind  specified  in
             Section 82(2)(b) or (c) the  Tribunal  may  consider  only  the
             circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision.

        (3)  Exception 2 applies to an appeal under Section 82(1) if -

             (a)   the appeal is against an immigration decision of  a  kind
                 specified in Section 82(2)(a) or (d),

             (b)   the immigration decision concerned an  application  of  a
                 kind identified in Immigration Rules  as  requiring  to  be
                 considered under a "points-based system", and

             (c)   the appeal relies wholly or partly on  grounds  specified
                 in Section 84(1)(a), (e) or (f).

        (4)  Where Exception 2 applies the Tribunal may  consider  evidence
             adduced by the appellant only if it -

             (a)   was submitted in support of, and at the time  of  making,
                 the application to which the immigration decision related,

             (b)   related to the appeal insofar as  it  relies  on  grounds
                 other than those specified in sub-section 3(c),

             (c)   is adduced to prove  that  the  document  is  genuine  or
                 valid, or

             (d)   is adduced in connection with the  Secretary  of  State's
                 reliance  on  a  discretion  under  Immigration  Rules,  or
                 compliance with a  requirement  of  Immigration  Rules,  to
                 refuse  an  application  on  grounds  not  related  to  the
                 acquisition of "points" under the "points-based system"".

Discussion and conclusion

13.  Mr Syed-Ali makes a very unusual submission. He seeks to rely on  Ahmed
    to show that the Judge made an error of law and  then  having  got  the
    decision set aside on that basis he  seeks  to  argue  that  Ahmed  was
    wrongly decided. For the reasons given below I  do  not  find  that  he
    succeeds on either of his submissions.

14.  Applying Ahmed,  the  Appellants  were  not  prevented  from  rebutting
    allegations made  in  the  refusal  letter.  The  Appellants  can  give
    evidence and make comments as to  why  the  material  produced  to  the
    Respondent with the application should not have led the  Respondent  to
    find that the business was not genuine without offending  section  85A.
    They did  so  in  witness  statements  dated  9th  December  2014.  The
    Appellants have been able to  exercise  their  right  of  appeal,  even
    though it  only  allowed  consideration  of  the  material  before  the
    decision-maker and did not allow new material to be  considered.  There
    was no unfairness as alleged in the grounds of appeal.

15.  The Judge properly reviewed the Respondent's decision and concluded  at
    paragraph 29 that the Appellants had produced their bank statements  as
    required under the Immigration Rules which showed  that  they  had  the
    required  funds  of  �50,000.  The  Respondent  had  not  notified  the
    Appellants of any concerns over the provenance of funds  and  therefore
    the Respondent could not rely on the matters relied on in  the  refusal
    letter in that respect.

16.  The Judge then went on to consider  whether  the  Appellants  genuinely
    intended and were able to invest those funds in their business. He took
    into account the interviews and the Appellants comments on the  matters
    raised  in  the  refusal  letter.  He   concluded   that   there   were
    discrepancies in the interviews, which were not  adequately  explained,
    and the Appellants were unable to give specific details when asked. The
    Appellants were unable to name any of their potential clients whom they
    intended to target or to explain how they came to work out the specific
    figures in their business plan. The Judge concluded that the Respondent
    was justified in finding that the  Appellants'  applications  were  not
    genuine.

17.  I accept that the decision  could  have  been  expressed  with  greater
    clarity, but this did not amount  to  an  error  of  law.  The  Judge's
    decision was consistent with the principles  set  out  in  Ahmed,  even
    though he has not specifically referred to the decision. There  was  no
    error of law in the Judge's approach.  The  Judge's  finding  that  the
    Appellants had not shown that they genuinely intended and were able  to
    establish a business was open to him on the evidence  before  him.  The
    Judge gave adequate reasons for this finding and  applied  the  correct
    standard of proof.

18.  Mr Syed-Ali's oral submission was contrary to  his  skeleton  argument,
    at paragraph 27, in which he  stated  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to
    consider the explanatory evidence  of  apparent  discrepancies  at  the
    interview and therefore the Judge had erred in law  in  preventing  the
    Appellants from establishing a non-points  based  fact  which  was  not
    related to scoring points under the PBS (section 85A(4)(d)).

19.  There was no merit in this ground of appeal, which may  be  the  reason
    why Mr Syed-Ali did not rely on it in  oral  submissions,  because  the
    Judge clearly took the explanatory evidence into account at  paragraphs
    20 to 26 and referred to it in his findings at paragraphs 31 to 33.

20.  I agree with Mr Clarke that paragraph 245AA did not  apply.  It  was  a
    matter for the Respondent whether she required  additional  information
    under paragraph 245DD(j). Mr Syed-Ali did not seek to rely on Article 8
    outside the Immigration Rules.

21.  The Appellants were interviewed and submitted comments in  relation  to
    those  interviews  on  appeal.  The  Appellants  had  been   given   an
    opportunity to challenge the Respondent's decision, but had  failed  to
    show that their applications were genuine under the Immigration Rules.

22.  The Judge had properly applied paragraph 245DD (k)  which  states:  "If
    the Secretary of State is not satisfied with  the  genuineness  of  the
    application in relation to a points scoring requirement in  Appendix  A
    those points will not be awarded."

23.  Therefore, I find that there was no error of law  in  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal dated 21st December  2014  and  the  appeal  is
    dismissed.
