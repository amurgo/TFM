                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McGavin, dismissing his appeal against refusal of recognition  as
    a refugee from Sudan.

 2. The grounds, lightly edited, and correcting a numbering error,  run  as
    follows:

      The judge erred by adopting the wrong burden and  standard  of  proof,
      above that of the  "reasonable  degree  of  likelihood  test"  ...  as
      evidenced by:

      (i) focus of judge on whether or not the  appellant  was  asked  which
      rebel group he was accused of supporting (paragraphs 16 to 18  of  the
      determination) when the appellant's initial answer ... was  that  "...
      they belong to the militias of the Blue Nile" and this was enough,  if
      accepted, to establish imputed political opinion ... the judge  failed
      to give fair weight to the fact that the appellant  explained  in  his
      witness statement that the word recorded as malicis in the  record  of
      his interview in fact referred to militias.    The  appellant  further
      clarified (at paragraphs 11 and 32 of his witness statement)  that  he
      knew the rebel group he was "supposed to be supporting" i.e. perceived
      by the Sudanese authorities as supporting was the SPLM.  This  is  not
      inherently  or  materially  incredible  as  found  by  the  judge   at
      paragraphs 15 to 18 particularly in light of objective evidence  drawn
      to the judge's attention that the largest rebel group in the Blue Nile
      is the SPLM and the tribe (Funj) of which appellant was a  member  are
      closely aligned .... and therefore the perceived support of that group
      was reasonably likely.

      (ii) ... the judge failed to give appropriate weight to the submission
      on behalf of the appellant that the Home Office  reasons  for  refusal
      letter was materially flawed because it started from the premise  that
      the tribe of the appellant (Funj) did not exist (paragraph 36  of  the
      refusal letter) when it was obvious from the objective evidence lodged
      in behalf of the appellant that the Funj tribe  not  only  exists  but
      were first to join the SPLMA/A ... and  have  proved  to  be  reliable
      partners of the SPLM/A [the background evidence is referenced].

      (iii) The judge's dismissal of the medical  report  by  consultant  Dr
      Dignon (paragraphs 32 to 39) in all respects  with  exception  to  his
      findings in the cigarette burns  on  the  appellant  (to  level  B  of
      Istanbul protocol), "I can give no weight to the  doctor's  additional
      comments which are not in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the
      Istanbul protocol" (paragraph 30) is an error of law.  Conversely  ...
      the judge placed insufficient weight on the findings of the  qualified
      consultant who concluded that it "seems likely that his  (appellant's)
      description of blunt trauma while in detention is accurate" and "seems
      likely there was some degree of systematic infliction" ...  the  judge
      should have given the medical report significant  positive  weight  in
      the assessment of the appellant's  credibility  as  per  Hider  [2003]
      CSIH.

 3. On 9 August 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Clive  Lane  granted  permission,
    observing that it was arguable that the judge  erred  by  attaching  no
    weight at all to the "additional comments" of  the  medical  expert  as
    regards the likely "systematic infliction" of wounds solely because the
    expert had not in the opinion of the judge complied with  the  Istanbul
    protocol.

 4. The judge made no comment on the rest  of  the  grounds,  but  did  not
    restrict the grant of permission.

 5. Ms Loughran submitted that ground (iii) was key.  The  judge  erred  by
    treating the conclusions in the  medical  report  as  mere  "additional
    comments" which she could disregard. Dr Dignon had not failed to  state
    an overall conclusion in accordance with the Istanbul protocol. He  was
    an experienced author of such reports and had been instructed in  terms
    of the Istanbul protocol. At part 9 of his report,  under  the  heading
    "opinion", he referred four times to the Istanbul protocol. The  fourth
    reference states that the appellant "has a  multitude  of  linear  non-
    specific scars which appear to be secondary to previous lacerations. He
    described being beaten with sticks while in detention. These are mainly
    present on his arms, hands, lower limbs and feet. In isolation  any  of
    these would be non-specific i.e.  level  B  on  the  Istanbul  protocol
    however given their number, it seems likely there were some  degree  of
    systematic infliction". The judge misinterpreted that passage is  being
    a further specific finding, but it is the overall conclusion. Once this
    error was tied back to the other two grounds, it became material, so as
    to require a remit to the FtT.

 6. A written response by the SSHD to  the  grant  of  permission  runs  as
    follows. It was open to the judge  to  give  little  or  no  weight  to
    conclusions of the medical report  not  made  in  accordance  with  the
    Istanbul protocol, and to reject speculative conclusions of the medical
    expert on issues of PTSD. The judge considered the possibility  of  the
    appellant having received the injuries noted in the medical report, and
    reached a reasoned conclusion, based on the appellant's evidence,  that
    they could have occurred in Libya. The judge  properly  considered  the
    appellant's account in the round and  found  a  number  of  reasons  at
    paragraphs 16 to 31 not to accept it. Such findings were fully open  to
    her and the medical report was  of  little  or  no  assistance  to  the
    appellant in light of the rejection of his credibility: S  [2016]  EWCA
    CID  1153,  paragraph  29  onwards.  The  grounds  amounted   only   to
    disagreement with adequately reasoned findings.

 7. Mr Mullen submitted that those grounds which criticised the weight  the
    judge gave to aspects of the evidence amounted only to disagreement and
    did not disclose error of law.  The  respondent's  refusal  letter  had
    founded on there being no evidence for the existence of  the  tribe  to
    which the appellant claimed to belong.  The  respondent  had  not  been
    represented in the FtT. It was now accepted from evidence  produced  by
    the appellant that his tribe did exist, and that it  was  aligned  with
    the rebels. However, the judge had not reached her  conclusion  on  the
    basis of the appellant's ethnicity or  perceived  political  alignment.
    She had not disregarded the evidence the appellant produced.   She  had
    in effect discarded any point based on the non-existence of his  tribe.
    Grounds (i) and (ii) disclosed no error. Mr Mullen  accepted  that  the
    judge did appear to have misread  the  medical  report,  and  that  the
    fourth reference to the Istanbul protocol was an overall evaluation. He
    said that when the judge went on to give "no  weight  to  the  doctor's
    additional comments which are not in accordance with  the  requirements
    of the Istanbul protocol" that referred to his remarks in  relation  to
    PTSD. The doctor did not purport to and was not qualified to give  that
    diagnosis.  In that respect, the judge did not err. At best the medical
    report confirmed that the appellant had injuries likely  to  have  been
    systematically inflicted. The judge had not discarded that possibility.
     Despite her comments, she had in  effect  accepted  that  point.   The
    report could not assist on  whether  the  appellant  suffered  injuries
    under the circumstances he alleged or otherwise  and  elsewhere.    The
    judge was entitled  to  note  that  he  complained  of  extremely  hard
    experiences in Libya and that there  was  a  possibility  that  he  had
    sustained his lesions during the two years he spent there.   The  judge
    did not err other than by failing to read the medical report as stating
    an overall conclusion, and that error was immaterial.

 8.  Ms  Loughran  in  reply  submitted  that  the  judge's  reference   to
    "additional comments" by the doctor did not refer  to  his  remarks  on
    PTSD. She accepted that any issue of PTSD did not fall within the terms
    of the Istanbul protocol and was not the proper subject of this report,
    being the province of a psychologist or psychiatrist. That would  be  a
    separate matter, and not part of the judges "additional comments".  The
    error of approach or interpretation of the  medical  report  which  the
    respondent had now acknowledged was material, because it might have had
    a significant impact on the assessment of the  appellant's  credibility
    in the round. If the medical report were to be  disregarded  for  wrong
    reasons, that must go to the overall credibility findings. It was a key
    point that the appellant had shown  that  his  tribe  existed  and  its
    political alignment fitted with his account.

 9. I reserved my determination.

10. The first two references by Dr Dignon to the Istanbul protocol describe
    injuries at level B, consistent with the description but there are many
    other possible causes; the third refers to  other  scars  at  level  D,
    typical of the description, the  only  other  possibility  being  post-
    infective scarring; the fourth and final reference is to  "a  multitude
    of linear non-specific scars" and continues as quoted above.

11. Ideally that passage might have been more clearly separated and  headed
    as an overall conclusion.  It is easy to see why the  judge  fell  into
    the error she  did,  which  takes  quite  close  reading  to  identify.
    However, Mr Mullen's concession was correctly and fairly made.

12. Again it takes rather close reading, but I think Ms Loughran was  right
    in her submission that when the judge said she could give  "no  weight"
    to  the  "additional  comments"  she  was  referring   to   "systematic
    infliction", not to the doctor's remarks regarding PTSD.  Those remarks
    are disregarded in the next paragraph (which was  accepted  not  to  be
    erroneous).

13. Hider was placed before the FtT and is mentioned in the grounds, but  I
    was not taken to anything specific in the report.  The Court dealt with
    the approach to an expert medical report at paragraph 24:

      So far as the medical report is concerned, we note at the outset  that
      the adjudicator stated that, having seen and heard the appellant  give
      evidence, he was not impressed by him as a witness. The appellant  had
      alleged that he had been shot and had later  been  tortured  during  a
      period of three weeks when he  was  in  the  hands  of  the  PCO.  The
      adjudicator took the view that Dr. McGivern's  letter  of  8  February
      1999 was not useful or reliable and, in particular, that  she  had  no
      experience in the treatment of torture victims. That was a view  which
      the adjudicator was clearly entitled to take  in  view  of  the  brief
      nature of that letter. However, the medical report by Dr.  von  Kaehne
      was, in our opinion, in a quite different category. He was  stated  to
      have had extensive experience of examining  alleged  torture  victims.
      His qualifications and expertise were not apparently challenged by the
      respondent. He set out in detail the evidence  of  injuries  which  he
      found on examination of the appellant, injuries which were  consistent
      with the account which he had given and in  particular  with  that  of
      having been subjected to torture by electrical burning. Other  medical
      findings made by him were also consistent with the  history  given  by
      the appellant. While the Tribunal  narrated  the  findings  which  the
      adjudicator had made in relation to Dr. McGivern's report,  they  did
      not make any mention of Dr. von Kaehne's report  in  the  reasons  for
      their decision. They  made  no  attempt  to  evaluate  the  report  or
      consider what effect it might have on the appellant's credibility.  It
      is clearly  recognised  that  particular  care  has  to  be  taken  in
      assessing credibility (Daljit Singh v. Secretary of State for the Home
      Department 2000 S.C. 219). In the present case that was important  in
      view of the fact that the adjudicator had simply stated  that  he  was
      not impressed by the appellant as a witness, without  going  into  any
      significant detail as to why he had  taken  that  view.  Although  the
      adjudicator does not expressly say so, the implication of his decision
      is that he did not believe the appellant's account that  he  had  been
      tortured. In our opinion the report by Dr. von Kaehne was  capable  of
      having a significant bearing on  the  assessment  of  the  appellant's
      credibility, but the Tribunal failed to deal with,  or  evaluate,  the
      report  and  its  potential  significance.  In  that  respect  we  are
      satisfied that they erred in their approach to Dr. von Kaehne's report
      and its relationship to the evidence given by the appellant.

14. Thus the adjudicator did  not  believe  that  the  appellant  had  been
    tortured (a) overlooking an expert medical report capable of supporting
    that conclusion and (b) not otherwise giving much  explanation  of  why
    the appellant was not found to be a reliable  witness.   In  the  first
    respect this case is not entirely comparable, and in the second  it  is
    quite different.

15. Judge McGavin did not discount  that  the  appellant  might  have  been
    physically ill-treated.  Rather, she found his account of how  he  came
    by  his  lesions  not  credible.   At  paragraph  40  she  raised   the
    possibility, sensibly according to the  evidence,  that  those  lesions
    could have been sustained during the two years  he  said  he  spent  in
    Libya and where treatment he experienced was "extremely hard".

16. The judge's reasons for finding the appellant  not  to  be  a  credible
    witness are given in considerable detail, and include the following:

      the appellant claimed in his witness statement that he  had  not  been
      asked  the  name  of  the  rebel   group   he   allegedly   supported,
      untruthfully, because he been asked the question  twice  at  interview
      and was unable to answer it (paragraphs 16 and 17);

      not credible the appellant and his father would have been detained for
      10 days, tortured and accused of supporting an  anti-government  group
      yet he did not know which group (paragraph 17);

      inconsistent and incoherent explanation of why  the  appellant  should
      assume the government thought that he was supporting the  SPLM  rather
      than another rebel group (paragraph 18);

      the appellant's account at screening interview,  corrections  thereto,
      asylum interview, corrections thereto, and 1st witness  statement  was
      that he and his  father  were  supplying  foodstuffs;  no  mention  of
      supplying ammunition to the rebels until his updated witness statement
      for the hearing (paragraph 19);

      no credible explanation of these  discrepancies  in  evidence  at  the
      hearing, and an attempt to blame an interpreter for not reflecting the
      information provided, when no correction to interview  record  at  the
      time (paragraphs 20 and 21);

      not credible if the authorities knew that the appellant was  supplying
      ammunition to the rebels that they would have  released  him  and  his
      father on reporting conditions after  10  days,  and  paid  so  little
      attention to him thereafter that he was  able  to  leave  the  country
      undetected (paragraph 21);

      not credible the appellant was able to leave  the  country  undetected
      under suspicion of being an arms supplier to  the  rebels  if,  as  he
      claimed, the authorities were coming to his home and torturing him all
      the time in the period immediately prior to his  departure  (paragraph
      22);

      appellant's  account   of   continuing   torture   and   interrogation
      inconsistent with why he would have been released at all, and  allowed
      to visit his family, 2 � hours drive away; not credible  he  would  be
      allowed to leave because the police trusted him (paragraph 23);

      appellant claimed not to know the location of the prison where he  was
      held yet later at interview said that he  was  released  and  complied
      with an obligation to report there every Thursday over a period of  45
      days (paragraph 24);

      no explanation for belated emergence of allegations of  ill-treatment;
      incredible explanation of not being understood by an interpreter;  not
      credible his previous solicitors,  a  reputable  firm  of  immigration
      specialists, would not have allowed him to  give  proper  instructions
      about corrections to interview records (paragraphs 25 to 31);

      no credible evidence the authorities would still be interested in  the
      appellant 4 � years later (paragraphs 46); and

      appellant claimed to be in regular contact with  his  father,  but  no
      evidence of any attempt to obtain  evidence  from  him  regarding  his
      alleged similar treatment at the hands of the  authorities  (paragraph
      51).

17. The appellant's grounds are all set out  under  the  heading  of  legal
    error of adopting the wrong burden and standard of proof. However,  the
    judge correctly directed herself as  to  the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof. Neither in the grounds nor in the decision is  there  detectable
    what would be the extraordinary  error  for  an  experienced  judge  of
    applying "a higher burden and standard of proof".

18. Grounds (i) and (ii) do not amount to more than disagreement. They fail
    to disclose any error of law.

19. Grounds (i), (ii) and (iii) do not in sum amount to more than selective
    disagreement on the facts.  They do not subject the bulk of the judge's
    reasons for reaching her adverse credibility conclusion, as  summarised
    above, to any criticism.  They do not  show  that  the  decision,  read
    fairly and as a  whole,  is  anything  less  than  a  legally  adequate
    explanation to the appellant of why his claim has been  rejected.  Such
    error as has been shown  in  the  reading  of  the  medical  report  is
    immaterial to the outcome.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.

21. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
