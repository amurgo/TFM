                                  JUDGMENT

 1. The applicant, a citizen of Afghanistan,  claims  to  be  a  minor  and
    maintains that at the date of an age assessment decision provided on 14
    April 2015 he was 13 years' old.  The  respondent  maintains  that  the
    applicant was born on 9 October 1997, making him 17 � years' old at the
    date of the age  assessment  decision.  This  judicial  review  is  the
    applicant's challenge to the age assessment decision of 14 April  2015.







Adjournment Application


 2. On the  first  day  of  the  hearing,  the  applicant  applied  for  an
    adjournment. I assessed the merits of that application in  the  context
    of the history of this litigation which is as follows.


 3. The application  was  issued  in  the  High  Court  on  24  July  2015.
    Permission was granted by the High Court on 21 September 2015. The case
    was transferred to the Upper Tribunal on 15 October 2015 for a decision
    to be made on the dispute as to the applicant's age.


 4. A directions hearing took place before Upper Tribunal Judge Coker on 26
    April 2016.  Following the hearing, a direction was  issued  on  6  May
    2016 which stated, at paragraphs 4 and 5:


         "4.  The applicant must file and serve by 6 June 2016  a  statement
             and  any  supporting  document  and  any  supporting   witness
             statements or reports  upon  which  he  relies.   The  witness
             statements shall be drawn in sufficient  detail  to  stand  as
             evidence-in-chief such that there is no need for  any  further
             examination-in-chief  without  the  permission  of  the  trial
             judge.


         5.   In the event that the respondent  considers  it  necessary  to
             obtain  an  expert's  report  requiring  the  consent  of  the
             applicant, the respondent  shall  make  any  request  for  the
             applicant's consent by 4.00 p.m. on 9 May 2016.  The applicant
             shall respond to the request by 4.00 p.m. on 16 May  2016  and
             in the absence of a response the applicant shall be deemed  to
             have given his consent."


 5. The respondent did consider it necessary to obtain an expert report,  a
    dental age assessment.  As a result, there  was  a  further  directions
    hearing on 5 July 2016 before Upper Tribunal Judge Blum. Following that
    hearing a further direction dated 7 July 2016 stated:


         "2.  The applicant is to  serve  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
             respondent written confirmation of  his  decision  whether  to
             consent to the proposed dental age  assessment  including  but
             not limited to consenting to a dental x-ray to be carried  out
             by Professor Roberts on a date unless a venue to  be  notified
             to the applicant by  4.00  p.m.  on  26  July  2016.   If  the
             applicant chooses to withhold  his  consent  to  the  proposed
             dental age assessment or if he fails to serve his decision  on
             the Upper Tribunal by 4.00 p.m. on 26 July 2016 his claim will
             be struck out in accordance with Rules 8(1)(a) of the Tribunal
             Procedure Upper Tribunal Rules 2008.


         ...


         4.    If  the  applicant  consents  to  the  proposed  dental   age
             assessment Professor Roberts  shall  prepare  a  report  which
             shall be filed and served  on  the  applicant  and  the  Upper
             Tribunal by 4.00 p.m. on 2 September 2016.


         5.   The applicant shall serve any written response to  the  dental
             age assessment by 4.00 p.m. on 3 October 2016.


         6.   The applicant must file and serve by 4.00  p.m.  on  2  August
             2016  a  statement  and  any  supporting  document   and   any
             supporting witness statements on reports upon which he  relies
             other than any response to the  dental  age  assessment.   The
             witness statements shall be  drawn  in  sufficient  detail  to
             stand as evidence-in-chief such that there is no need for  any
             further examination-in-chief without  the  permission  of  the
             trial judge.


         7.   The respondent must file and serve by 4.00 p.m. on  23  August
             2016 all statements or reports or other evidence upon which it
             relies other than the  dental  age  assessment.   The  witness
             statements shall be drawn in sufficient  detail  to  stand  as
             evidence-in-chief such that there is no need for  any  further
             examination-in-chief  without  the  permission  of  the  trial
             judge.


         8.   Paragraphs 7 to 11 of the directions order made by Judge Coker
             on 26 April 2016 sealed  on  6  May  2016  shall  continue  to
             apply."


 6. The applicant did not comply with  paragraph  2  of  the  direction  by
    informing the Tribunal in writing  of  his  consent  to  a  dental  age
    assessment. He did consent, however, and a dental age  assessment  from
    Professor Roberts dated 3 August 2016 was served on 4 August 2016.  The
    applicant did  not  provide  a  written  response  to  the  dental  age
    assessment dated 3 August 2016, as provided for by paragraph 5 of Judge
    Blum's direction.


 7. The applicant did not comply with paragraph 6 of the direction to serve
    his materials by 2 August 2016.


 8. On 24 August 2016 the respondent  complied  with  paragraph  7  of  the
    direction of Judge Blum, serving witness statements and other documents
    relied upon.


 9. On 20 January 2017 the Tribunal issued hearing notices for a  three-day
    hearing on 20 to 22 February 2017.  It  appears  that  there  was  then
    correspondence  between  the  parties  concerning  documents  for   the
    hearing.


10. On 13 February  2017  the  respondent  served  an  amended  dental  age
    assessment report from Professor Roberts dated 6 February 2017.


11. On  15  February  2017  the  applicant  sent  an  email  attaching  the
    equivalent of two large  arch-lever  files  of  materials.   Hard  copy
    bundles were received by the Tribunal on 16 February 2017. There was no
    application for  an  extension  of  time  for  these  documents  to  be
    admitted. There was no explanation for the late service.


12. The applicant also made an adjournment application on 15 February  2017
    which was refused on 15 February 2017.


13. At the beginning of the hearing on 20 February 2017  Ms  Malik  renewed
    the application for an adjournment.   It  became  apparent  during  her
    submissions that before deciding whether to adjourn, the  Tribunal  had
    to decide whether to admit late documents put forward by both sides.


14. The applicant sought to admit an unsigned,  undated  witness  statement
    from his uncle, SJ, and the respondent objected to this. The respondent
    sought to admit the amended dental age assessment dated 6 February 2017
    and the applicant objected to this.


15. When deciding on whether to admit late documents and whether to adjourn
    I referred to the overriding  objective  in  Rule  2  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the  need  for  cases  to  be
    dealt with justly and fairly.  I  also  made  those  decisions  in  the
    context of the chronology set out above which shows the two-year  delay
    since the application was made. I also bore in mind the absence of  any
    substantive documents from the applicant until 15 February 2017, nearly
    a year after the first directions hearing, six  months  late  regarding
    the direction of Judge Blum and only two  working  days  prior  to  the
    hearing. As above,  there  was  no  application  for  those  very  late
    documents to be admitted  and  no  explanation  for  late  service  was
    provided at any time.


16. If the hearing was to proceed, there was little option but to admit the
    applicant's two arch-lever folders of documents served on  16  February
    2017. The respondent's counsel did not make a formal objection to their
    being admitted and appeared well-prepared to deal with them. I admitted
    the applicant's substantive evidence.


17. I also decided to admit the witness statement of the applicant's uncle.
    When doing so I took into account the very late  service  and  improper
    format of that document, it being unsigned, undated and the translation
    being unattested by an interpreter. During submissions it was  accepted
    that this statement had, in fact, been prepared in  April  2016.  There
    was no explanation as to why it appeared in the form it  did  only  two
    working days prior to the hearing. The witness statement of  the  uncle
    was not an extensive document and in my judgment the  respondent  would
    have sufficient time to deal with it in the course of the  hearing  and
    submissions.  I bore in mind that it seemed unlikely that  the  failure
    to  provide  it  earlier  and  in  proper  format  was   the   personal
    responsibility  of  the  applicant.  I  concluded  that  in   all   the
    circumstances the respondent would not be unfairly  prejudiced  if  the
    statement was admitted.


18. I also admitted the  amended  dental  age  assessment  report  dated  6
    February 2017.  I bore in mind that it was served relatively late, only
    four working days prior to the hearing. No  explanation  for  that  was
    provided. It was not  entirely  new  to  the  applicant,  however,  the
    previous version containing the results  but  with  different  comments
    having been served on 4 August  2016.  Correspondence  shows  that  the
    applicant's legal representatives were aware of the amended  report  at
    least by 6 February 2017, a week prior to service on 13 February 2017.


19. Also, the applicant's legal advisers acted for both  applicants  in  ZM
    and SK v the London Borough of Croydon  (Dental  age  assessment)  2016
    UKUT 00559.  They could be presumed to be aware of the implications  of
    that judgment and, in general terms, the change of approach that  would
    have to be reflected in future dental age assessment reports.   It  was
    suggested that the applicant was prejudiced as the respondent  gave  no
    indication of an  intention  to  continue  to  rely  on  a  dental  age
    assessment after ZM and SK was issued in December 2016. The  overriding
    objective requires both parties to assist the  Tribunal  to  deal  with
    cases  justly  and  fairly.  Given  the  involvement   of   the   legal
    representatives in ZM and SK, they were  particularly  well  placed  to
    liaise with the respondent as to whether the earlier version was to  be
    amended and to deal with the amended  version.   Further,  it  was  not
    disputed that ZM and  SK  presented  difficulties  for  the  respondent
    rather than the applicant regarding the use of  dental  age  assessment
    reports.


20. It was my conclusion that the amended age assessment should be admitted
    as, in the particular circumstances of this case, it could not be  said
    that this would lead to the applicant being deprived of a fair and just
    hearing.


21. Having made the decision on admission  of  documents,  I  proceeded  to
    consider the applicant's adjournment request. The application was  made
    on four grounds.  Firstly,  it  was  argued  that  an  adjournment  was
    required to obtain an expert report in response to the  amended  dental
    age assessment. Secondly, he sought time to adduce  a  report  from  an
    educational psychologist assessing cognitive  impairment.  Thirdly,  he
    sought an adjournment for his uncle, SJ, to attend the hearing to  give
    oral evidence. Fourthly, he sought an adjournment to obtain  a  witness
    statement from a cousin who lives in the UK.


22. As  indicated  above,  I  made  my  adjournment  decision  against  the
    background of a significant delay in the application  being  heard  and
    gross  non-compliance  with  directions  by  the   applicant.   Several
    additional factors led to me to find no merit  in  the  application  to
    adjourn for an expert response to the dental age assessment report. The
    contents of the report were not entirely new. The applicant  was  given
    the opportunity to provide a response the earlier version but  did  not
    do so. As above, these particular legal representatives were  aware  of
    the significant case law on such reports and it  cannot  be  said  that
    they were unaware of the possibility and nature of the amendments  that
    might be made. As above, the guidance in ZM and SK advises  a  cautious
    approach required towards dental age assessment reports  of  this  kind
    from Professor Roberts, in my view significantly reducing the need  for
    a response from the applicant. It was my  conclusion  that  the  appeal
    could proceed fairly and justly without adjourning for  a  response  to
    the dental age assessment report.


23. The basis for the application to adjourn for an educational  psychology
    report arises from the witness statement dated 2  October  2016  of  Mr
    Eoin Flavin, the applicant's educational  support  worker.   Mr  Flavin
    sets  out  his  concern  that  the  applicant  had  shown  "significant
    difficulties in processing information and understanding how  to  solve
    problems on his own as well  as  general  lack  of  confidence  in  his
    communication skills".  At paragraph 16 Mr Flavin  states  "I  will  be
    consulting with his teacher at college and an educational  psychologist
    associated with her organisation in order to work out  the  best  steps
    forwards in supporting [IN]."


24. There was no explanation as to why a psychology  report  had  not  been
    obtained in the four months since Mr Flavin provided  this  information
    to the applicant's legal representatives. There was no  explanation  as
    to why, when the potential need for such a report was  identified  four
    months ago, the application to adjourn was made so late. I was informed
    that it would take approximately six weeks to obtain such a report. The
    information provided by Mr Flavin was potentially concerning  but  that
    concern was moderated somewhat by no other professional  who  had  been
    involved with the applicant  identifying  any  similar  concerns.    Mr
    Flavin was present at the hearing to speak to  his  witness  statement.
    Again, I bore in mind that there has been a significant delay  in  this
    matter coming to hearing. It was my conclusion that a further delay  to
    obtain an educational psychology report would not be proportionate  and
    that in all the circumstances a fair and just hearing could take  place
    without one.


25. The adjournment application was also made for the appellant's uncle  to
    attend the hearing to give oral evidence. The information  provided  to
    me at the hearing was that the uncle travelled abroad approximately two
    months ago. There was no explanation as to why this was not raised with
    the Tribunal earlier if it was intended that he was to  give  evidence.
    As above, the notices of hearing went out on 20 January  2017  but  the
    issue was not raised until 15 February 2017. I was informed  only  that
    he would be returning "shortly".  That appeared to me to be  vague  and
    to mitigate against  an  adjournment.  I  did  not  find  that  it  was
    appropriate to adjourn for the appellant's uncle to be able  to  attend
    and found that the hearing could  proceed  fairly  and  justly  in  his
    absence.


26. The application to adjourn to allow for a witness  statement  from  the
    applicant's cousin had very little merit.  There was no explanation  as
    to why evidence from the cousin had  not  already  been  obtained.  The
    application is nearly two years old,  the  applicant  was  directed  to
    provide his evidence by 2 August 2016 and the dates of the hearing  had
    been known about since 20 January 2017. This aspect of the  adjournment
    request did not indicate that the cousin had  particular  knowledge  of
    the applicant's age.  It  was  my  conclusion  that  it  would  not  be
    appropriate to adjourn and that a fair and just decision could be  made
    without evidence from the cousin.


27. It was also my conclusion that even considered cumulatively the grounds
    for an adjournment did not have merit.


The Law


28. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in R (A v London Borough of
    Croydon [2009] UKSC 8 the Supreme Court held that the  Tribunal's  task
    here is to resolve the issue of the applicant's  age  as  a  matter  of
    fact.   In  carrying  out  this  exercise   the   Tribunal   takes   an
    inquisitorial role and decides on the balance of probabilities  whether
    the applicant was or was not a child at the time of the age assessment.
     There is no burden of proof  on  either  party  in  this  fact-finding
    exercise; see RCJ v Cardiff City Council [2011] EWCA Civ  1590.  It  is
    open to the Tribunal to reach a conclusion that is different from  both
    the claimed age and the assessed age.


29. Also relevant is the guidance set down in the case of R (B v LB  Merton
    [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin), the case commonly referred  to  as  "Merton".
    The minimum requirements for conduct of an age assessment  by  a  Local
    Authority are considered in detail there and are well summarised by the
    Court of Appeal in paragraph 3 of the case of R (FZ) v  London  Borough
    of Croydon [2011] EWCA Civ 59


         "3.  In R (B) v Merton London  Borough  Council  [2003]  EWHC  1689
         (Admin), [2003] 4 All ER 280 Stanley Burnton  J  gave  guidance  in
         judicial review proceedings on appropriate processes to be  adopted
         when a local  authority  is  assessing  a  young  person's  age  in
         borderline  cases.  The  assessment  does  not   require   anything
         approaching a trial and judicialisation of the  process  is  to  be
         avoided. The matter can  be  determined  informally  provided  that
         there are minimum standards of  inquiry  and  fairness.  Except  in
         clear cases, age cannot be determined solely from  appearance.  The
         decision-maker should explain to the young person  the  purpose  of
         the interview.  Questions  should  elicit  background,  family  and
         educational circumstances and  history,  and  ethnic  and  cultural
         matters may be relevant. The decision-maker may have to assess  the
         applicant's credibility. Questions of the burden of  proof  do  not
         apply. The local authority should make its  own  decision  and  not
         simply adopt a decision made, for instance, by the Home Office,  if
         there has been a referral. It is not necessary to obtain a  medical
         report, although paediatric expert evidence is  sometimes  provided
         in these cases, and there is some difference  of  view  as  to  its
         persuasiveness in borderline cases. If the decision-maker  forms  a
         view that the young person may be lying, he  should  be  given  the
         opportunity to address the matters that  may  lead  to  that  view.
         Adverse provisional conclusions should be put to him,  so  that  he
         may  have  the  opportunity  to  deal   with   them   and   rectify
         misunderstandings. The local authority is obliged to  give  reasons
         for its decision, although these need not  be  long  or  elaborate.
         This decision and its guidance have led to the development of  what
         is sometimes referred to  as  a  "Merton  compliant"  interview  or
         process."


30. In addition, the Upper Tribunal has given guidance in R (AM) v Solihull
    MBC AAJR [2012] UKUT 00118 as to how to approach  evidence  in  an  age
    assessment case, in particular in paragraph 15, as follows:


         "15. In the present case the  evidence  is  wide  ranging.  It  may
         therefore be appropriate to make some  general  observations  about
         the impact of evidence of various sorts and from various sources in
         this type of case. First, we think  that  almost  all  evidence  of
         physical characteristics is likely to be  of  very  limited  value.
         That is because, as pointed out by Kenneth Parker  J  in  R  (R)  v
         Croydon [2011] EWHC 1473 (Admin) there  is  no  clear  relationship
         between chronological age and physical maturity in respect of  most
         measurable aspects of such maturity."


     and in paragraphs 19 and 20:


         19.  Our  second  observation  relates  to  mental   maturity   and
         demeanour. So far as mental development is concerned,  it  is  very
         difficult indeed to see how any proper assessment can be made  from
         a  position  of  ignorance  as  to  the  individual's   age.   Most
         assessments of mental development are, in essence, an assessment of
         whether the individual is at average, or below  or  above  average,
         for his chronological age. Without knowing the age,  a  person  who
         appears to have a mental age of (say) 15 may be 15, or he may be  a
         bright 13 or 14 year old, or a dull 16 or 17  year  old.  There  is
         simply no way of telling. So far  as  demeanour  is  concerned,  it
         seems  to  us  that  there  may  be  value  to  be  obtained   from
         observations of demeanour and interaction with others made  over  a
         long period of time by those who have  opportunity  to  observe  an
         individual going about his ordinary life. But we find it  difficult
         to  see  that  any  useful  observations  of  demeanour  or  social
         interaction or maturity can be  made  in  the  course  of  a  short
         interview between an individual and a strange adult. There  may  of
         course be cultural difficulties in such an interview but there  are
         the ordinary social difficulties as well.



         20. The  asserted  expertise  of  a  social  worker  conducting  an
         interview is not in our judgement sufficient  to  counteract  those
         difficulties. A person such as a teacher or even a  family  member,
         who can point to consistent attitudes, and a number  of  supporting
         instances over a considerable period of time, is  likely  to  carry
         weight that observations made in the artificial surroundings of  an
         interview cannot carry.


31. Also relevant is the case of R (on the application  of  ZM  and  SK)  v
    London Borough of Croydon (Dental age assessments)  [2016]  UKUT  00559
    which addresses the approach the Tribunal should  take  to  dental  age
    assessments.  I have dealt with some aspects of this case in  paragraph
    19 above and consider it in more detail  below  when  setting  out  the
    weight to be attributed to the revised age assessment relied upon  here
    by the Local Authority.


The "Outcome of Age Assessment" Decision dated 14 April 2015


32. On 31 March 2015 the respondent conducted an age  assessment  interview
    with the applicant. Ms Ansell, a social worker, and Mr Hill,  a  social
    work assistant, conducted the interview. An independent  adult  and  an
    interpreter were also  present.  Based  on  that  interview  and  other
    materials, a document entitled "Outcome of Age Assessment" was drafted.


33. The respondent then arranged for a "minded-to"  interview  on  9  April
    2015 with Ms Ansell and Mr  Hill  again  present.  An  interpreter  was
    present. An independent adult was invited to the  meeting  on  9  April
    2015 but, for some reason, did not attend.  The meeting proceeded.  The
    applicant was asked about  issues  set  out  in  the  "Outcome  of  Age
    Assessment" which Ms Ansell and Mr Hill considered undermined his claim
    to be 13 years' old.  As there was no  independent  adult  on  9  April
    2015, the respondent decided that another meeting  should  be  arranged
    for the decision to be given formally to the applicant.


34. This further "minded-to" interview  was  held  on  14  April  2015.  An
    independent  adult  was  present  together  with  an  interpreter.  The
    applicant was given the decision dated 9  April  2015  which  had  been
    counter-signed by a social work manager. This document is at page 12 of
    Tab 9 of the bundle. The decision informed the applicant  that  he  had
    been found to have the date of birth of 9 October 1997 and so to be  17
    � years' old not 13 years' old.


35. The reasons for so finding are set out in Box 5 of the decision on page
    15 of Tab 9 of the bundle, as follows:


         "There is a consensus from all professionals involved  that  IN  is
         older than his claimed 13 years of age.  IN claims his mother  told
         him he was 13 years old 5 - 6 months ago but he  has  no  documents
         and has never seen this written down.  He told us  his  mother  was
         not educated but she just knew his age.


         IN's physical appearance suggests he is older than his  claimed  13
         years of age due to his shaving requirements,  physical  build  and
         physical features.  IN does not stand out as being younger than his
         peers but is able to fit in well with his peers claiming to  be  16
         and 17 years of age.


         He is able to be assertive and make his needs  well-known,  and  he
         has a mature and measured outlook and ability to hold attention and
         conversation at an adult level.  There was no  consistency  in  his
         answers and it appeared he developed his answers to  fit  questions
         but  could  not  remember  what  he  had  previously   told   other
         professionals so he would contradict his own story.


         There are a  lot  of  inconsistencies  in  his  story  particularly
         regarding his journey.  For example how long it took him to  travel
         across different countries; and then missing countries and doubling
         back on themselves rather than taking a more direct route.


         Then with his timeline he was not able to  provide  a  sufficiently
         consistent academic timeline, changing how long he was studying  at
         the Madrasa from one year to two years to five years.  The big  gap
         after he left when he was doing nothing; the fact that he  did  not
         help his family with any role commensurate with his age and gender,
         which culturally would be  outside  of  the  normal  culture.   For
         example collecting wood and water for his mother.  The timeline did
         not match his stated age and he appeared to have a  very  selective
         memory on what things he could remember and account for.


         The assessors felt IN could  be  an  adult  over  the  age  of  18.
         However, taking into consideration other professional  observations
         reflecting the possibility IN may be  under  the  age  of  18,  the
         assessors have provided IN with the benefit of doubt, the assessors
         conclude that IN is likely to be over 17  years  of  age  and  have
         given him a date of birth of 9.10.1997."


36. The decision also states on the same page in Box 6:


         "At the end of the minded interview IN was  given  verbal  feedback
         through the interpreter.  He was informed of the outcome of the age
         assessment and all the reasons for this were given to him.  He  was
         given the opportunity to dispute all of these  and  to  provide  us
         with further information in which he feels would be relevant.


         He was also informed of his right to challenge the  age  assessment
         through his solicitor if he was unhappy with the decision made."


Children and Family Assessment


37. Following the meeting  on  14  April  2015,  Ms  Ansell  finalised  the
    applicant's Children and Family Assessment (CFA) and this was faxed  to
    him on 13 May 2015. This document is at Tab  21  of  the  bundle.  When
    addressing the applicant's age, this document follows the same line  of
    reasoning as the decision dated 9 April 2015 but  includes  details  of
    the sources relied upon when the age assessment decision was  made  and
    gives other reasons for that decision. For  the  sake  of  clarity,  it
    should be pointed out that the references on page 2  to  a  "minded-to"
    interview conducted on 9 March 2015 and a further  "minded-to"  meeting
    on 14 March 2015 are incorrect as these interviews occurred on 9  April
    2015 and 14 April 2015, as above.


38. Certain aspects of the CFA were particularly relevant to  my  decision.
    On page 3 of Tab 21 the CFA refers to an assessment  by  Ms  Lamb  from
    Virtual School Kent (VSK) on 7 April 2015. She concluded that "IN would
    seem most appropriately placed in Key Stage 4  (14-16  years)."  It  is
    also recorded at the bottom of page 3 that the applicant told  Ms  Lamb
    that he attended a Madrasa "from the age of 4 or  5  and  continued  to
    attend until he was 9 or 10".   This  entry  also  indicates  that  the
    applicant told the educational assessor that his father  was  a  barber
    for the Taliban.


39. Pages 5 and 7 of the CFA set out the views  of  three  Local  Authority
    staff working with the applicant while he was resident at the  Millbank
    Centre in 2015.  All of them gave a view that he was older than 13  and
    was appropriately placed with peers aged 16-18, two of them considering
    him to be in the 17 to 18 year old age group.


40. Under the heading "Physical and Social Presentation" on pages 6 and  7,
    the CFA records details of the  applicant's  appearance  and  demeanour
    that had been relied  upon  in  the  age  assessment  decision.  It  is
    recorded that his facial hair suggested that he was someone who  needed
    to  shave.   He  had  an  Adam's  apple  "that  is  obvious   but   not
    significantly visible".  His voice was found to  suggest  that  he  had
    entered and passed through puberty as did his physical  physique.   His
    "mature  and  measured  outlook  and  ability  to  hold  attention  and
    conversation at an adult level" were found  to  indicate  that  he  was
    older than claimed.  The respondent's view on the applicant's  maturity
    in refusing to participate in cooking activities is set out on page  7.




41. The CFA records on page 8 the  view  of  Ms  Ansell  that  it  was  not
    consistent with cultural norms for the applicant to have  done  nothing
    to assist his family after leaving the Madrasa.


42. The CFA also sets out on page 9 details of the respondent's  view  that
    the applicant's evidence about his journey from Afghanistan to the  UK,
    in particular, stating:


         "IN stated that they stayed for eight nights in a  park  in  Paris,
         the food was provided  by  the  agent  there.   IN  thinks  it  was
         summertime when travelling as not too cold to be  sleeping  in  the
         open, but he was not sure when he left Afghanistan".


The Applicant's Evidence


43. The applicant relied on a witness statement dated 8 February 2017.   He
    explained that he grew up in a rural  area  of  Afghanistan,  going  to
    study the Quran at a Madrasa when he was approximately  8  or  9  years
    old.  He attended the Madrasa for approximately 3  �  years.  When  his
    father ceased working for the Taliban he told the applicant not  to  go
    to the Madrasa and he stopped attending.  This was approximately a week
    before he left Afghanistan.


44. The applicant sets out in paragraph 8 of his statement that he had been
    made aware by his solicitors that the records of  his  interviews  with
    the respondent showed that he had given different details about when he
    started and finished the  Madrasa  and  how  long  he  was  there.  The
    applicant's comment on this in the witness statement was that "I am not
    entirely sure why this is so but maybe I didn't understand and panicked
    and made a mistake."


45. The applicant went on  to  state  that  his  family  decided  to  leave
    Afghanistan because his father was at risk from the  Taliban  and  from
    the  government.   The  family  travelled  together  to  Iran.  On  the
    Iranian/Turkish border the applicant was put into a different car  from
    his family and he had not seen them since.  The applicant described his
    journey from Turkey to the UK stating that he went through Bulgaria and
    Hungary but was not sure where he went to after that.


46. At paragraph 18 of his statement the applicant maintained that:


         "I know I am 15 because when I left Afghanistan my mum told me that
         I was 13 years old.  Since I have been here for nearly two years  I
         must be 15 years old now".


47. Paragraphs 20 to 21 of the witness statement set  out  the  applicant's
    concerns that the age  assessment  process  conducted  by  Kent  County
    Council was not "Merton" compliant.  There  was  no  independent  adult
    present during his interview on 9 April 2015. There  was  no  procedure
    during that meeting or the meeting on 14 April 2015 when the respondent
    considered his responses to the preliminary conclusions before making a
    final decision.


48. In his oral evidence the applicant stated  that  approximately  two  or
    three weeks before he left Afghanistan his mother told him that he  was
    13 years' old. He stated that he did not know how old his parents were.
     It was put to him that in a  witness  statement  dated  2  April  2015
    prepared in support of his asylum claim he stated at paragraphs 6 and 7
    that his father was 60 years old and his mother was 48 years old.  When
    asked how he had known these things in April 2015 but had not been able
    to identify them in his oral evidence, the applicant  stated  "my  mind
    wasn't helping me, it was just from my mind". Later  in  his  evidence,
    the applicant suggested that  he  had  just  guessed  when  giving  the
    information about his parents' ages in April 2015.


49. The applicant was asked about when he left the Madrasa.  He stated that
    it was approximately two to three weeks before he left Afghanistan.  He
    then stated that his father had left the Taliban approximately one week
    before he left Afghanistan. It was put to him that this order of events
    was not consistent with his witness statement which stated he left  the
    Madrasa after his father left the Taliban, not before, and that he left
    the Madrasa a week before leaving Afghanistan. The  applicant  was  not
    able to clarify this aspect of the chronology.


50. The applicant was also taken to the Local Authority case  notes  for  7
    March 2015 at page 2 of Tab 20. They are  the  respondent's  record  of
    what happened when the applicant arrived in the UK on that  date.  They
    were written by an out of hours' social worker, Paul Humphries, who was
    contacted by Immigration Officers at Dover. The case notes state that:


         "[IN] had told Immigration Officers that he was  16  -  however  he
         told that his mother told him he was 13 six months ago".


     The case note also records that:


         "[IN] told Paul that he had travelled to the UK  of  his  own  free
         will with his friend Hanif".


     and goes on to indicate that:


        "Paul spoke with Immigration Officers who felt that [IN] is 16 as he
        originally stated to them.  Paul feels that [IN] is at least 16.


        Discussed with OOH Team  Manager  Ann  Redman  the  fact  that  [IN]
        subsequently said that his mother had told  him  that  he  is  13  6
        months ago.


        We agreed that at this time we will treat  IN  as  16,  pending  age
        assessment ... "


51. When asked about this case  note,  the  applicant  maintained  that  on
    arrival he told Immigration Officers and the social worker that he  was
    13 years' old. He maintained that he could only have said  this  as  it
    was what his mother had told him. He denied having said that he was  16
    when he arrived in Dover.


52. The applicant was then asked in cross-examination, "Who is Hanif?"  and
    stated without any hesitation "He is from my village".  He then went on
    to say:


        "He was arrested together with us - in Dover - just as  we  got  off
        the lorry then with him together we went to  the  camp.   I  haven't
        seen him from Afghanistan".


    The applicant was  then  asked  if  Hanif  came  from  his  village  in
    Afghanistan and he said "No" and that  he  first  met  him  inside  the
    lorry. He denied that  Hanif  was  a  friend  of  his.   The  applicant
    maintained that what was written down by the social  worker  must  have
    been because he was so tired and that "I may have  said  this  to  Paul
    just to answer him".


53. The applicant was then asked about evidence he gave about  the  age  at
    which he started studying at the Madrasa and how long he studied there.
    At the hearing the applicant maintained that he had attended at the age
    of 8 or 9 and had done so for approximately 3 � years.  When it was put
    to him that he had given different information in interview  he  stated
    "When I crossed over into this country I had to  answer  them  just  to
    relieve myself". It was put to him that the interview was not conducted
    immediately on arrival but stated "Whenever it was it was the same team
    my mind may not have worked". He denied that he would have said that he
    started the Madrasa at 6 to 7 years old or stated that he only attended
    there for 1 to 2 years.


Evidence of Mr Flavin


54. Mr Flavin is a Programme Officer for the Specialist Educational Support
    Programme  at  the  Refugee  Support  Network,  a  charity   supporting
    refugees. Mr Flavin has  previous  experience  working  for  a  charity
    involved with young refugees and a housing association supporting young
    refugees and asylum  seekers.   He  also  has  experience  of  teaching
    children aged between 10 and 16.


55. Mr Flavin has worked with the applicant  since  November  2016  as  his
    education support worker.  He sees him twice a week and also  keeps  in
    contact with him through phone calls and texts.  Mr Flavin stated  this
    at paragraph 6 of his witness statement:


         "In our sessions IN displays significant difficulties in processing
         information and understanding how to solve problems on his  own  as
         well as a general lack of confidence in his  communication  skills.
         He is friendly and agreeable, but can on occasion become  impatient
         or bored when we focus on more complex subjects such  as  legal  or
         support issues  for  extended  periods.   He  can  come  across  as
         immature at such points, lacking even a basic understanding of  the
         situation or an awareness  of  the  significance  of  what  we  are
         discussing".


56. At paragraph 8 Mr Flavin stated:


        "8.    I believe him to be roughly between 16-18 years  old,  and  I
          believe also that he is a vulnerable young person requiring a high
          level of support.


        9.    I believe he is under the age of 18 on the basis of the  level
          of maturity he displays, his high support needs,  his  ability  to
          problem solve, his demeanour, and the fact that he is friends with
          young people of  a  similar  age  on  his  college  course.   This
          includes one other Afghan young  person  named  Mohammed  (claimed
          age: 16.5/age given by HO: 18)  who  was  also  supported  on  our
          Specialist Educational Support Programme.  Mohammed  and  IN  hang
          out with each other both in and outside of college".


57. Mr Flavin went on in his  report  to  detail  his  concerns  about  the
    applicant's cognitive difficulties:


        "14.  In my meetings with IN I have  observed  that  he  experiences
             exceptional  difficulty  in   communication   and   processing
             information.


        15.   IN will often agree with statements directed towards him by me
             however it is often clear  that  he  has  not  understood  the
             statement and that he is  very  prone  to  responding  to  any
             prompts in questioning.  In  my  view  he  is  experiencing  a
             significant level of  difficulty  in  communicating  verbally,
             completely separate to his English language  ability.   He  is
             often  unable  to   process   quite   basic   information   or
             instructions that I convey to him, and I find I  have  to  use
             visual cues and  repetition  to  gain  information  about  his
             situation and support needs.  This has  included  difficulties
             in trying to understand his  current  housing  situation;  his
             emotional state: and his past and current support from  social
             services.


        16.   I have also observed that  he  has  required  assistance  with
             relatively basic tasks such as updating the college with a new
             address and navigating the tube  to  an  appointment.   In  my
             experience IN's  ability  to  problem  solve  is  particularly
             limited.  I will be consulting with his teacher at college and
             an educational psychologist associated with their organisation
             in order to work out the best steps forward in  supporting  IN
             with both his education and externally".


58. In his oral evidence Mr Flavin confirmed that he had  found  that  when
    taking information from the applicant on a variety  of  topics  it  was
    "abnormally difficult".  He had developed techniques such as repetition
    or writing out visual clues in order to assist in obtaining information
    from the applicant.  He had found this "striking" and had not had  this
    problem working with other  young  Afghans  with  a  similar  level  of
    educational background as the applicant.


59. Mr Flavin  indicated  in  his  oral  evidence  that  he  estimated  the
    applicant's age as between 16-18  based  on  his  experience  of  other
    unaccompanied asylum seekers many of whom were Afghans, the applicant's
    support needs, for example  needing  help  to  update  his  address  or
    navigating the tube and with quite straightforward things  that  others
    did not have difficulty with.  In his experience  this  indicated  that
    the applicant  was  under  18.   Mr  Flavin  also  confirmed  that  the
    applicant had formed friendships with other Afghan boys around the  age
    of 16.


60. In cross-examination Mr Flavin confirmed that he had reached  his  view
    about the applicant's age independently and not after having been  told
    by the applicant how old he maintained that he was.  He confirmed  that
    it was his view that there was an upper limit of 18. His personal  view
    was also that the applicant was at the latter end of the 16-18 spectrum
    but he accepted that because of the difficulties in assessing  age  the
    applicant could be between 15 and 19.


61. Mr Flavin identified that even on the day of the hearing the  applicant
    had given evidence which he found troubling as regards the  applicant's
    cognition.  In order to assess whether  the  applicant  and  the  court
    interpreter understood each other  correctly  the  applicant  had  been
    asked about his journey to the Tribunal building.  He had  stated  that
    the journey had taken 30 minutes when  Mr  Flavin  had  been  with  him
    throughout and knew that it took over an hour.  There was no reason for
    the applicant to have given this incorrect description and it confirmed
    Mr Flavin in  his  view  that  there  were  concerns  whether  they  be
    cognitive or otherwise to be identified, and therefore that this had to
    be taken into account when assessing the applicant's statements.


    Witness Statement of SJ


62. The applicant also sought to rely on a witness statement of  an  uncle,
    SJ, with whom he has been living in the UK.  This document is at Tab  8
    of the bundle.  The witness maintains that the applicant  contacted  SJ
    after arriving in the UK through somebody that he met in Dover.   After
    background checks were carried out the applicant was authorised by  the
    Local Authority to go to live with SJ  and  his  family.   The  witness
    statement states as follows at paragraphs 10 to 11:


         "10. I believe IN is a child and is 14 because I know his  date  of
         birth.  His date of birth is 5 May 2002.  I  know  this  because  I
         received a phone call from his father on the day he was born.


         11.  The reason that I remember this is  because  when  I  got  the
         phone call it was at night and in Afghanistan it would be the early
         hours of the morning.  When I got the call I panicked as it was  an
         odd time for me to receive a call from  my  family  back  home.   I
         assumed the worst and thought that perhaps  my  mother  had  died".




63. I did not find that I could place any weight on this document.  It  was
    unsigned and undated.  It put the applicant's age at the  time  of  the
    age assessment as 12.  The applicant's case is that he  was  13  years'
    old at that time. It is difficult to see how the applicant's uncle  who
    was living in the UK at the time would have a better knowledge  of  the
    applicant's year of birth than the applicant's mother. The  applicant's
    evidence was also that  he  was  not  aware  of  there  having  been  a
    telephone in his home or village.  Further, I did not find it  credible
    that the applicant's father's cousin would  remember  a  specific  date
    given to him in a telephone call some fourteen years earlier.


Evidence for the Respondent


   Evidence of Ms Ansell


64. Ms Ansell's evidence was contained in an undated witness statement.  Ms
    Ansell is a social worker who has 25 years of experience in  the  field
    of social care and this has  included  working  with  and  safeguarding
    children  and  young  people  and  as  an  OFSTED  inspector  assessing
    children's services.  She has worked within  mental  health  and  youth
    offending teams.  She set out in her statement her formal meetings with
    the applicant beginning with her meeting with  him  on  7  March  2015.
    This meeting was to prepare IN's Children  and  Family  Assessment.  Ms
    Ansell set out that prior  to  the  interview  on  31  March  2015  she
    reviewed the information gathered  by  professionals  working  with  IN
    which included the support workers at his residential accommodation  at
    Millbank, the out of hours' worker Paul Humphries and  the  Independent
    Reviewing Officer.  She considered that all the  information  from  the
    staff working with IN indicated that he was older than his claimed  age
    of 13.


65. Ms Ansell indicated at paragraph 35 of her witness statement  that  the
    applicant did not appear to be younger than his peers at  Millbank  who
    were 16 to 18 years' old and that he "is able to fit in well  with  his
    peers who are claiming to be 16 and 17 years of age". It  was  also  Ms
    Ansell's view that the applicant's manner  was  assertive,  making  his
    needs known and that this indicated a mature and  measured  outlook  as
    did his ability to hold attention and conversation at an  adult  level.
    She referred in paragraph  19  of  her  statement  to  the  Independent
    Reviewing Officer (IRO) commenting after a meeting with  the  applicant
    on 7 April 2015 that he was "very assertive in his manner".


66. Ms Ansell indicated in her witness statement that she did not find  the
    applicant's clam to be 13 years' old at the date of the age  assessment
    decision to be credible.  Firstly, he had no documents.  His  claim  as
    to how he knew his age was based only on being told this by his mother,
    someone he accepted was not educated.  Ms Ansell indicated at paragraph
    33 of her statement that she considered that "IN's physical  appearance
    suggests he is older than his claimed  13  years  of  age  due  to  his
    shaving requirements, physical build  of  broad  shoulders  and  muscle
    definition from post-puberty, and mature physical  features  of  facial
    definition."  She goes on to maintain that the  applicant  appeared  to
    have beard and upper lip hair growth and  that  he  had  either  shaved
    recently or had needed to do so.  She referred  to  his  appearance  on
    arrival, documented by a photo taken at that  time,  which  showed  the
    applicant with hair growth on his upper lip and chin  and  lower  neck.
    She also maintained as set out in paragraph 34 of her witness statement
    that the applicant had "evidence of an Adam's apple that is obvious but
    not significantly visible".  She went on to find that his tone of voice
    which appeared to have broken entirely indicated that he had  completed
    puberty.


67. Ms Ansell also considered that the  discrepancies  in  the  applicant's
    evidence occurred because he  could  not  remember  what  he  had  said
    previously. Ms Ansell found that inconsistencies about his journey  and
    how long it took him to  travel  across  different  countries  was  not
    credible. At paragraph 38 of her statement she refers to the  applicant
    claiming "to have been travelling in Paris in the summer".


68. Ms Ansell also set out her concerns that the applicant had mentioned in
    his interviews on 12 March 2015 going to school at the age of  6  or  7
    but also stated in his interview on 31 March 2015 that he had  gone  to
    the Madrasa at that age but also at the age of 8 or 9.  She  considered
    that the applicant's academic time line  as  to  when  he  started  the
    Madrasa and how long he attended for was not credible where it left him
    with several years of doing nothing but play. She did not  consider  it
    to be culturally appropriate and or credible that  he  would  not  have
    done anything such as collecting wood or water for the  household.   At
    paragraph 40 Ms Ansell indicates that it was her view and that  of  her
    colleague that the  applicant  was  was  over  17  and  that  this  was
    supported by the "other professional observations".  Her view was  that
    his date of birth was 9 October 1997.


69. In cross-examination Ms Ansell clarified that this assessment  was  the
    first that she conducted having  been  seconded  to  the  unaccompanied
    asylum seekers' team for a  6-month  period.   She  accepted  that  the
    applicant had a limited education. She confirmed  that  she  knew  that
    there should have been an independent adult present at the meeting on 9
    April 2015.  It was put to Ms Ansell that she had already  decided  not
    to treat the applicant as a minor and so was prepared to  proceed  with
    the interview without an independent adult  present  but  she  did  not
    accept that  that  was  the  case.   I  can  indicate  here  that  this
    suggestion does not appear to be well-made out where the decision shows
    that Ms Ansell's view by 9 April 2015 was that the applicant was  still
    a minor, albeit 17 � years' old not 13 years' old.


70. Ms Ansell  also  indicated  that  the  applicant  had  been  given  the
    opportunity on 14 April 2015 to comment on the team's initial  view  of
    his age but was not able to identify where the record showed  that  his
    views had been considered prior to a final decision. She maintained her
    view that the applicant's appearance when she met him, his facial hair,
    need to shave and physical build suggested that  he  was  post-puberty.
    She then accepted that a 13-year-old can  have  muscle  definition  and
    facial hair and  that  it  was  not  merely  the  applicant's  physical
    appearance that had led her to reach the conclusion that she did.   She
    also accepted that the appearance of the applicant's  Adam's  apple  at
    the time of the interviews was  not  inconsistent  with  his  being  13
    years' old and the same applied to her references to the way  that  the
    appellant  spoke.   Ms  Ansell  still  maintained,  however,  that  the
    applicant appeared to be more mature than 13 and to be  appropriate  in
    his behaviour towards boys at Millbank who were in the 16  to  18-year-
    old age group.  She confirmed that her opinion  was  also  informed  by
    that of the other staff working with the applicant.  She accepted  that
    it had been found in a Pathway meeting on 29 February 2016 contained at
    page 293 of Tab 20 of the  applicant's  bundle  that  IN  "still  needs
    assistance in making and attending medical appointments"  but  did  not
    accept that this necessarily indicated that he was the age  he  claimed
    as older children might need this assistance also.


71. Ms Ansell was asked about the record of the meeting on  12  March  2015
    which is contained at page 65 of Tab 20  of  the  bundle.   The  record
    indicates the following exchange


         "Q. When did you start school? At what age? Year?


         6/7 is the normal age.  He went to Madrasa  religious  studies  and
         learnt from the imran (sic) at the mosque.  I learned to  read  the
         Quran, for one year to two years".


    In cross-examination it was put to Ms Ansell that this meant  that  the
    applicant was merely identifying the age of 6 or 7 as the normal age to
    attend school and she accepted that this was possible.


The Evidence of Alan Hill


72. Mr Hill's evidence  is  contained  in  his  undated  witness  statement
    contained at Tab 12 of the applicant's bundle.  The  witness  statement
    sets out that Mr Hill served in the police for 27 years which  included
    a significant amount of work  with  families  and  children.   Mr  Hill
    confirmed in his oral evidence that he has  worked  as  a  social  work
    assistant for approximately six years and had a significant  amount  of
    experience in age assessment including with Afghan nationals.  Mr  Hill
    confirmed that prior to the interview on 31 March 2015 he reviewed  the
    information provided by other professionals working with IN.   Mr  Hill
    confirmed that he took notes at the meeting on 31 March 2015.  Mr  Hill
    confirmed that the assessment of age should  be  holistic,  considering
    all aspects of a young person's life.  Mr Hill indicated  that  it  was
    his view that the applicant had been given every opportunity to explain
    himself and any discrepancies in the age assessment process.


73. Mr Hill accepted in oral evidence  that  he  could  not  be  completely
    confident what the applicant meant when he referred on  12  March  2015
    and 31 March 2015 to the normal age of attendance being 6 or 7 as  this
    could mean the normal age in general or that he went to the Madrasa  at
    the normal age.  Mr Hill indicated that he did not feel that the  Local
    Authority could accept the applicants claimed age of  13  as  this  was
    based only on a relatively unreliable source, his mother telling him on
    only one occasion, his mother not being educated  and  there  being  no
    registration of the birth from what the applicant had  said.   Mr  Hill
    also remained of the view that the applicant had not given a consistent
    or credible explanation of the period after the time he  said  he  left
    the Madrasa.


74. Mr Hill accepted that he was  not  able  to  identify  in  any  of  the
    interview records that the applicant had said that he had been in Paris
    in the summer. Mr Hill maintained his view that the applicant had given
    different versions of how he came through Europe and that  his  account
    was not a credible one.


75. Mr Hill initially indicated in his oral evidence that he did not  think
    it was common for boys aged 14 to 16 to start  shaving.   He  indicated
    that in his view signs of puberty  were  starting  to  shave,  becoming
    stronger, developing a physical frame and the Apple's apple displaying.
     He accepted that he had not referred to any specific guidance  on  how
    to assess puberty.  He maintained his  view  that  the  fact  that  the
    applicant had an Adam's apple albeit not a  significant  one  and  that
    this indicated that puberty was advanced.  Mr Hill was of the view that
    "I could see he was a regular shaver" but accepted that  the  applicant
    had not been asked about shaving.  He also maintained his view that the
    applicant's tone of voice indicated that his voice had broken.  Mr Hill
    accepted that he did not have expert  knowledge  of  how  Afghan  males
    develop and therefore  could  not  specifically  identify  whether  the
    applicant's physical state indicated  what  stage  of  puberty  he  had
    reached.


76. It was put to Mr Hill that his statements  and  conclusions  about  the
    applicant were not supported by evidence and that he had made a mistake
    in his assessment.  Mr Hill did not accept this  to  be  so  indicating
    that the applicant had been given a lot of  time  and  respect  and  an
    opportunity to change his evidence during the process, for example, the
    second "minded-to" meeting being arranged.


    Dental Age Assessment


77. The respondent also sought to rely on a dental age assessment  prepared
    by Professor Roberts dated 6 February 2017.  It is  uncontentious  that
    this was the second version of the report and that it had been  amended
    following the comments of the Upper Tribunal in the case of R  (on  the
    application of ZM and SK)  v  London  Borough  of  Croydon  dental  age
    assessment  [2016]  UKUT  00559.  The  conclusion  of  the  dental  age
    assessment was that:


        "The data available indicates that IN is very highly  likely  to  be
        over 18 years old with an age of approximately 22 years."


78. I can deal with the dental age assessment relatively briefly. The  case
    of ZM and SK comments at paragraph 73:


         "In relation to each of the four age assessment methods, there  was
         reliance on unreliable data, or  failure  to  mention  difficulties
         about use of the data, or both.  In the circumstances I have,  with
         the greatest regret reached the conclusion that  an  assessment  in
         this form (or anything like it) by Professor Roberts should be read
         with the greatest of caution and should be acted on only  if  there
         has been a  proper  explanation  of  the  basis  for  the  opinions
         expressed".


79. At paragraph 77 the Tribunal reaches its final conclusion:

         "I draw the following general conclusions about dental  development
         as an aid to age assessment.


         (1)  The  description  of  dental  maturity  by  reference  to  the
             Demirjian stages appears to be widely-used and useful.   It  is
             of very limited use for age assessment when all or very  nearly
             all teeth have reached stage H and the fact that all teeth have
             reached stage H is not of itself sufficient to be  a  guide  to
             whether a person is or is not over the age of 18.


         (2)  None of the three Mandibular  Maturity  Markers  described  in
             this judgment has yet been sufficiently examined to  enable  it
             safely to be said that it is diagnostic of age.   Further  work
             is needed on the  comparability  of  the  data  from  different
             studies and the causes of the presentation of the  markers  and
             their independence one of another, as well as a wider range  of
             acceptance in the relevant scientific community.


         (3)  Dental wear may in some circumstances help  to  establish  age
             but only if data for a population with similar diet and chewing
             habits are available.


         (4)  The relevance of ethnic background to the progress  of  dental
             maturity is not yet clear".


    and then sets out what was decided as the head note  for  the  case  at
    paragraph 79:

         "79. I therefore offer the following guidance

          1) Evidence obtained  by  x-ray  dental  tomography  may  well  be
             relevant to age assessment.

          2) Generally speaking, the danger to an  individual  arising  from
             exposure  to  x-rays  in  the  tomography  process  is   wholly
             outweighed by the intended benefit of  a  contribution  to  the
             evidence  used  in  age  assessment.   It  is  likely   to   be
             unreasonable for a young person whose age is disputed to refuse
             to undergo the process, or for a refusal to be entered  on  his
             behalf.  The earlier a tomograph is taken, the more  likely  it
             is to offer useful information.

          3)  Judges  should  beware  of  being  misled  into   over-valuing
             statistical evidence in the context of a fact-finding exercise.
              They should bear in mind the risks of error and consider in an
             individual case whether that risk is tolerable. They should  be
             prepared  to  question  the  assumptions   behind   statistical
             calculations and ensure that the reference data  set  is  valid
             and that all factors capable of affecting the calculations have
             been taken into account.

          4) Judges should  be  prepared  also  to  question  the  basis  of
             opinions expressed in a report or  opinion.   Opinions  sharing
             major features with that examined in the present  judgment  are
             unlikely to be worthy of reliance, and judges should be wary of
             accepting age assessments that appear to  rely  extensively  on
             the  reputation  of  the  author  rather   than   the   detail,
             consistency and currency of the data".


80. In the revised report Professor Roberts acknowledges  the  reliance  on
    the indicators used in dental age assessment  reports  should  be  read
    cautiously following ZM and SK and, in the absence  of  reference  data
    for Afghan nationals, the  same  should  apply  to  reliance  on  other
    biological maturity markers.


81. Given these matters,  Mr  Swirsky,  quite  sensibly  in  my  judgement,
    indicated in his skeleton argument and at the hearing that:


        "It  is  accepted  that  the  dental  age   assessment   cannot   be
        determinative and that it has to be read  cautiously  following  the
        judgment of Judge Ockelton".


82. In light of these matters, it is my conclusion that little  weight  can
    be given to the dental age  assessment.  When  considered  against  the
    evidence as a whole, in which no  source  other  than  the  dental  age
    assessment  placed  the  appellant  as  over  20  years'  old  or  even
    approaching 20 years'  old,  the  dental  age  assessment  was  not  of
    material assistance in determining the appellant's age.


Discussion


83. The applicant maintains that he was 13 years' old at the  date  of  the
    decision but I did not find his evidence on this to be reliable  for  a
    number of reasons.


84. Firstly, his claim is that he knew his age because his mother told  him
    on one occasion before he left Afghanistan. He accepts that she did not
    know this from any written record of his birth  and  that  she  was  an
    uneducated person. Also, his evidence about his mother telling  him  of
    his age is notably inconsistent. The record of his evidence on  arrival
    states that he told the out of hours' social worker that his mother had
    told him of his age "6 months ago". In his witness  statement  dated  8
    February 2017 for this application and his oral evidence he stated that
    she told him of his age a few weeks before he left Afghanistan. He  had
    no reason to give a definite time when he was told his age on  arrival.
    He could just have said that he was not sure or did not remember  after
    his difficult journey. He gave a very specific indication  of  when  he
    found out, however, and it is a very different time from that he relies
    on in his more recent evidence.


85. Secondly, as set out in paragraphs 50 to 52 above, the case notes  from
    the day of his arrival record that the applicant had  told  Immigration
    Officers that he was 16 years' old and that he told the  social  worker
    that he had come with "his friend Hanif".  In  his  oral  evidence  the
    applicant at first denied that he said either of these things.  I  then
    observed his response to the question "Who  is  Hanif".  His  response,
    that Hanif was from his village, appeared to me be entirely spontaneous
    and straightforward. It was consistent with what  is  recorded  in  the
    case notes from his arrival. His ensuing statements that Hanif did  not
    come from his village and he only met him in the lorry on  the  way  to
    the UK appeared to me to be attempting to  distance  himself  from  the
    earlier, spontaneous remark. When the  distinct  contradiction  in  his
    statements was put to him he did not continue to maintain that  he  had
    never said that Hanif was his friend but conceded that "I may have said
    this" just to give an answer to a question.  My  conclusion  from  this
    part of the evidence was that he  was  giving  reliable  and  unguarded
    evidence when stating that Hanif was his friend and  from  his  village
    and that it was likely that his statement immediately on  arrival  that
    he was 16 years' old, was also a reliable one. That was additionally so
    where his statement that he was 16 on arrival is  generally  consistent
    with the estimates of his age provided by those who have seen him  over
    a period of time in settings more appropriate for estimating  his  age,
    of which more below.


86. Thirdly, the applicant's evidence about the ages of his parents was not
    reliable. He gave details of their  approximate  ages  in  a  statement
    dated 2 April 2015 to his own solicitor. His statement at  the  hearing
    that he did not know their ages was very inconsistent with the level of
    detail given in the asylum statement.


87. Fourthly, I also found the applicant's  evidence  about  attending  the
    Madrasa to be unreliable. It is  possible  that  his  statement  to  Ms
    Ansell on 12 March 2015 about school starting at the age of 6 or 7  was
    a general comment on that being the starting  age  in  Afghanistan.  Ms
    Ansell and Mr Hill accepted that this might be so. Setting that dispute
    aside, therefore, together with any questioning that  relied  upon  it,
    the applicant's evidence was still very unreliable,  in  my  judgement.
    His current account is that he started attending when he  was  8  or  9
    years' old and attended for around 3 � years, leaving shortly before he
    left Afghanistan. It remains the case that on 12  March  2015  he  also
    stated at least three times at different parts of the interview that he
    attended for "one year to two years". In the interview on 31 March 2015
    he stated that he attended the Madrasa for  a  year.  He  was  asked  a
    number of questions about what he did for the years after he  left  the
    Madrasa, if that was so. His responses were consistent with his  having
    attended for a year or so from the age  or  8  or  9.  Nothing  in  his
    evidence in that interview suggested that he had attended for 3 � years
    and left the Madrasa a matter of weeks before leaving  Afghanistan,  as
    he now maintains.


88. Fifthly, the applicant's evidence concerning the order of events in the
    weeks before he left Afghanistan was also  not  reliable.  His  witness
    statement at paragraph 7 maintained at that he left the  Madrasa  after
    his father left the Taliban and that he had left  the  Madrasa  a  week
    prior to leaving Afghanistan. In his oral evidence he  stated  that  he
    left the Madrasa approximately  two  to  three  weeks  before  he  left
    Afghanistan and that he did so before  his  father  left  the  Taliban.
    There is a further inconsistency in his evidence in the interview of 31
    March 2015 (page 16 of Tab 12) where he refers to  his  father  leaving
    the Taliban "a long time" after the applicant left the Madrasa.


89. The applicant's explanation for his discrepant evidence is that he just
    said these things because he was tired, or just in order  to  answer  a
    question or was confused. His discrepant statements were not  all  made
    on arrival, however, and were, in part, in statements prepared by those
    assisting him, not those responsible  for  his  asylum  status  or  age
    assessment. I did not accept that he was under pressure in an interview
    with his own representatives to give ages for  his  parents  and  would
    have given the information he did if  he  did  not  know.   He  had  an
    independent adult with him at  the  interview  on  31  March  2015  and
    nothing was  raised  about  the  questioning  on  that  occasion  being
    inappropriate.


90. The respondent submitted that the applicant's evidence was additionally
    unreliable because of the lack of clarity in  his  description  of  his
    journey across Turkey and Europe. In my view this was not an aspect  of
    his evidence that indicated that he  was  not  a  credible  witness  or
    otherwise undermined his claimed age. It does not appear to be disputed
    that the applicant travelled alone, certainly from Turkey onwards, that
    he was a minor at that time in the hands of agents. I also did not find
    it implausible that the applicant would have been  separated  from  his
    family in the manner he describes on a journey managed by  agents.  Any
    anomalies or inconsistencies in his  account  of  crossing  Turkey  and
    Europe do not appear to me to be excessive or outwith the account to be
    expected from a young person in these very difficult circumstances.


91. The applicant also relied upon the evidence of Mr Flavin.  I  concluded
    that  some  weight  attracted  to  the  evidence  of  Mr  Flavin.   His
    involvement with the applicant has been for a period of around 5 months
    and he has observed him regularly when they have been talking  together
    and when the applicant was amongst other young people in the 16 to  18-
    year-old age range. Mr Flavin was not dogmatic in  his  statements  and
    indicated that he was aware of the difficulties in assessing age.


92. Mr Flavin's view, however, was that the applicant was between the  ages
    of 16 to 18 and at the upper end of  that  age  range,  albeit  not  18
    years' old. His evidence is not, therefore, that the applicant  was  13
    or even 14 years' old at the date of the decision  but,  approximately,
    around 15 years' old. It is of note that this was Mr  Flavin's  opinion
    notwithstanding  his   concerns   about   the   applicant's   cognitive
    difficulties.


93. Mr Flavin's evidence on  the  applicant's  cognitive  difficulties  was
    potentially concerning and required careful  consideration  as  it  was
    potentially capable of going  a  long  way  towards  the  discrepancies
    identified above in the applicant's evidence. I  noted,  however,  that
    the materials before me did not indicate that cognitive difficulties of
    the kind and degree that Mr Flavin describes had been observed  by  any
    of the other professionals who have worked with the applicant,  by  the
    applicant's legal advisers in this matter or his asylum claim or by his
    relatives in the UK, including his uncle with whom he has been  living.
    In addition, although Mr Flavin has experience of  working  with  young
    people and in education, it was not suggested that he has  professional
    expertise or qualifications in  diagnosing  cognitive  problems.  After
    considering this  part  of  the  evidence  carefully  and  against  the
    evidence as a whole, it was my conclusion that the matters raised by Mr
    Flavin were  not  sufficient  to  explain  the  applicant's  discrepant
    evidence or could made a material difference in my  final  decision  on
    the applicant's age.


94. There were also a number of aspects of the respondent's evidence that I
    did  not  find  reliable.  It  was  conceded  in  submissions  for  the
    respondent that the age assessment process was not Merton compliant. An
    independent adult should have been present during the  interview  on  9
    April 2015. It was not  appropriate  to  proceed  where  that  was  so.
    Obtaining the applicant's consent to proceed did not remedy the absence
    of an independent adult. This is not a merely a technical  matter.  The
    interview might have proceeded differently if the applicant had had the
    support of an independent adult and the outcome of the  age  assessment
    been different. The interview,  in  part,  underpins  the  respondent's
    assessment of the applicant's age which, to that extent, is  made  less
    reliable.


95. Further, albeit the respondent did  arrange  for  another  "minded  to"
    interview, I was not taken to anything in the records that  shows  that
    the applicant's comments on the preliminary concerns about his claim to
    be 13 years' old were taken into account before a  final  decision  was
    made. Nothing shows that his comments on 9 April 2015 were  taken  away
    for consideration and I have not been provided with a  record  of  what
    took place on 14 April 2015. That is also a material shortcoming in the
    procedure followed by the respondent which undermines the decision.


96. In addition, the questioning of the applicant in  the  interview  on  9
    April 2015 did not appear to me to be at all times  well  characterised
    as intended merely to clarify the applicant's claim  but  took  on  the
    flavour of cross-examination.  One example of this is in the  interview
    record from 9 April 2015 at page 1 of Tab 23. The applicant  was  asked
    about his father and stated that  his  father  sometimes  worked  as  a
    barber.  The questioning and responses are on  page  1  of  Tab  23  as
    follows:


         "Why did you not mention it in our last meeting?  I mentioned it in
         every meeting.


         No you can recall can you not that  notes  were  recorded  in  each
         meeting as they were said?  Yes


         There is no mention of your father being a  barber?   I  must  have
         forgotten"


97. There was  no  specific  questioning  about  the  applicant's  father's
    profession in the interview on 31 March 2015,  however.  There  was  no
    reason why the applicant should have mentioned it,  therefore,  and  it
    was not appropriate to approach this issue in the 9 April 2015 as if he
    should have done so,  the  questioning  pressing  this  point.  It  was
    additionally inappropriate as, recorded at page 4 of  Tab  21,  in  the
    educational assessment from 7 April 2015, only two  days  earlier,  the
    applicant stated that his father was a barber. That interview was  part
    of the material that the respondent could be expected to refer to  when
    questioning the applicant and deciding if he had mentioned  the  matter
    previously or not. Further, page 2 of Tab 17 contains the first  asylum
    statement dated 2 April 2015, prepared only a week prior to the  second
    interview with Ms Ansell and Mr  Hill,  in  which  the  applicant  also
    states that his father was  a  barber.  It  appeared  to  me  that  the
    applicant was entitled to  be  surprised  at  being  told  he  had  not
    mentioned his father's profession previously and protest  that  he  had
    mentioned it as he had done so at least twice in the week prior to this
    interview, albeit not in his previous meeting with  Ms  Ansell  and  Mr
    Hill.


98. The respondent's age assessment was also stated to have been based,  in
    part, on the views of others  working  with  the  applicant.  There  is
    nothing  in  the  decision  which  indicates  that  the  view  of   the
    educational assessor that the applicant was in the 14 to16 year old age
    group was taken into account, however, rather than only  those  showing
    him to be at least 16 t0 18 years old.


99. Also, Ms Ansell and Mr Hill's assessment of the applicant's age  relied
    on their conclusion that he had been inconsistent  about  his  journey,
    maintaining that he stated that he had been in  Paris  in  the  summer.
    They were unable to take me  to  any  records  which  showed  that  the
    applicant had stated which season he was in Paris and there is  only  a
    comment that it was  sufficiently  warm  not  to  be  difficult  to  be
    sleeping outside in Paris.  It was not my view that this could be taken
    as a clear indication that he was there in summer  it  being  a  rather
    subjective matter as to whether it is too cold to be sleeping  outside.




100. A further important reason  for  reducing  the  weight  that  could  be
    placed on the respondent's decision was that the views of Ms Ansell and
    Mr  Hill  relied  a  great  deal  on  the  applicant's  appearance  and
    demeanour. The case law summarised above specifies the  limitations  on
    conclusions that can be drawn from someone's appearance and  demeanour.
    That is additionally so where their observations of the applicant were,
    in the main, within  the  constraints  of  the  formal  age  assessment
    process and they were not involved with him on a day to day  basis.  In
    her oral evidence Ms Ansell accepted that  the  applicant's  appearance
    and voice were not sufficiently reliable indicators of whether  or  not
    he was 13 years' old as he claimed. Mr Hill was less flexible but could
    not provide an objective  basis  for  his  view  that  the  applicant's
    appearance showed him to be post-puberty and at least 17 �.  The  clear
    guidance on the unreliability of  aspects  of  appearance  such  as  an
    Adam's apple, needing to  shave  and  body  shape  meant  that  I  also
    approached the photograph of the applicant taken very shortly after  he
    arrived with some caution  and  did  not  find  that  it  could  assist
    materially in establishing if the applicant was 13 years' old or  17  �
    years' old at the date of the decision.


101. The respondent's decision was on firmer ground where it  was  based  on
    the views of the staff working with the applicant  in  his  residential
    accommodation at the time of the decision. They consistently  refer  to
    the applicant being at ease in the 16 to 18-year-old age group. Two  of
    the staff considered that the applicant was at the upper  end  of  that
    age range and therefore that he was 17 to 18 years old at that time. In
    my view, those staff, like Mr Flavin were best placed to give a view on
    the applicant's age as they observed him relatively often over a period
    of time and in appropriate settings, including with his peers.


Conclusion


102. Having set out my view of what was reliable and what  was  not  in  the
    evidence relied upon by both sides, I found  that  only  the  following
    factors were matters on which I could place some weight in  identifying
    the applicant's age.


103. The only statement of the applicant on his age on  which  I  can  place
    any weight is that given on arrival to Immigration Officers that he was
    16 years' old at that time. The applicant's witness, Mr  Flavin,  found
    him to be at the upper end of the 17 to 18-year-old age group now which
    is more or less consistent with the applicant's statement  on  arrival.
    Those working for the respondent who spent time with  him  in  settings
    other than the formal age assessment process considered him  to  be  in
    the 16 to 18 years old age group at the time of the age assessment, two
    of them being of the view that he was in the  upper  end  of  that  age
    range. The educational assessor considered him to be in the 14  to  16-
    year-old age group at the date of the decision. No-one who  has  worked
    with the applicant attributed an age that would have shown him to be 13
    years' old at the date of the decision.


104. Putting these factors together, it is  my  final  conclusion  that  the
    best estimate I can make of the applicant's  age  is  that  he  was  16
    years' old at the date of the age assessment. This is  consistent  with
    the evidence of Mr Flavin, generally consistent with  the  respondent's
    staff who spent more time with him outside of the formal assessment and
    consistent with this applicant's statement of his  age  to  Immigration
    Officers on arrival.


105. Given the extent of the unreliability of the applicant's  evidence  and
    limitations in the materials relied upon by  the  respondent  there  is
    little to assist with a specific date of birth.  Mr  Flavin's  evidence
    suggests that the applicant was approximately 15 at  the  date  of  the
    decision. The respondent's staff, on  balance,  considered  him  to  be
    around 17 years' old as of the date of the decision. The only  reliable
    statement from the applicant is that on arrival in March 2015 he was 16
    years' old. I find that the applicant was more likely than not to  have
    been born on 9 October 1998.


Costs


106. When making my decision on costs,  I  took  into  account  the  written
    costs submissions provided by both parties which were provided after  a
    preliminary indication that the order would be for no costs.


107.  Neither  party  has  achieved  the  outcome  sought.   The   applicant
    maintained that he was 13 years' old at the date of the decision but he
    has been found to be 16 � years' old at that date, some 3 � years older
    than claimed. The respondent maintained that he was 17 � years' old  as
    of the date of the decision but he has been found to have been  a  year
    younger at the material time.


108. Neither party has been successful in the sense that its case  has  been
    wholly accepted. If there is an argument as to who has gained more,  it
    would go in favour of the respondent whose assessment was significantly
    more accurate than the claim put forward by the applicant. A  re-making
    of the age assessment because it was not Merton  compliant  would  not,
    given the age now allocated to the applicant, have led to a  materially
    different outcome for him.


109. I make no order for costs.


110. I also direct that a copy of this decision is sent  to  the  Legal  Aid
    Agency regarding the non-compliance of the applicant's  legal  advisers
    set out at paragraphs 4 to 17 above as they are potentially relevant to
    the assessment of legally aided costs.





Appeal to Court of Appeal


111. There was no appearance by either party at the hand down hearing on  15
    May 2017. Following  Rule  44(4B)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 I considered whether to give or refuse  permission
    to appeal. I refused permission where the reasoning set  out  above  is
    not in error.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
