Representation:

For the Appellants:          Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:                Mr Gajjar, Counsel instructed by direct
access

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondents are all nationals of India.  They  are  respectively  a
    father (the principal appellant before the  First-tier  Tribunal),  his
    dependent wife and child. By its decision of the 29th October 2018  the
    First-tier Tribunal  allowed  their  linked  appeals  on  human  rights
    grounds.  The Secretary of State now has permission to  challenge  that
    decision on a point of law before this Tribunal.
 2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    Secretary of State was correct to have refused  to  grant  this  family
    settlement in the United Kingdom. It was  the  Respondents'  contention
    that having accrued  ten  years  continuous  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom with lawful leave to remain they were each entitled to a  grant
    of indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Secretary of State had refused to grant such leave for  one
    reason.


 3. The Secretary of State had identified three discrepancies in  the  past
    financial declarations of the principal Respondent. In  April  2011  he
    had told the Home Office that he had earned  a  total  �52,344  in  the
    preceding year, thus proving himself eligible for a  further  grant  of
    leave as a Tier 1 Migrant;  for the same period he had declared to HMRC
    earnings of only �26, 985. In June 2013 he had  told  the  Home  Office
    that in that year he had earned a total of �50,  585;  HMRC  were  only
    told of �41,595. Finally in 2013-14 he had initially told HMRC that  he
    had earned from self-employment �4103 but this  had  subsequently  been
    amended to �7948. Although the Secretary of State accepted that the tax
    returns had subsequently been amended to  reflect  the  higher  figures
    claimed, the Secretary  of  State  was  satisfied  that  the  principal
    Respondent had misrepresented his earnings to either the HMRC  or  UKVI
    or both.  As a result the Secretary of State found that  the  principal
    Respondent's application fell for refusal under one  of  the  'general'
    provisions at Part 9 of the Rules, namely paragraph 322(5):


    Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of  leave  to  enter  or
    remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused:

         (5) the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain
         in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C), character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security;


 4. The applications of the second and third Respondents fell to be refused
    in line.




    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


 5. The First-tier  Tribunal  directed  itself  that  where  dishonesty  is
    alleged the burden falls to the Secretary of State,  and  recorded  the
    agreement of the parties that should the Secretary  of  State  fail  to
    discharge that burden, the appeal would have to be allowed.


 6. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the principal Respondent, whom it
    found to be an "honest and  reliable  witness"  [�19].    It  then  had
    regard to the fact that in respect of the most significant discrepancy,
    that pertaining to the year 2010-11, the Respondent had a "lot  on  his
    mind". His wife was pregnant and had been  diagnosed  with  gestational
    diabetes. When his son was born, in December 2011, he had jaundice  and
    then pneumonia. In the years that followed the child was diagnosed with
    severe autism and ADHD.  The Tribunal further weighed  in  the  balance
    the fact that HMRC had imposed no penalty upon the  Appellant  but  had
    attributed the error to his "failure to take reasonable care" with  his
    tax affairs.  The Tribunal accepted the evidence that  the  errors  had
    only come to light  when  the  Respondent  had  come  to  fill  out  an
    application for a mortgage in 2016. Having weighed all of those factors
    in the balance the Tribunal concluded that the Secretary of  State  had
    not discharged the burden of proof and allowed the appeal.



    Discussion and Findings

 7. The Secretary of  State  challenges  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the ground that there has been material misdirection in the
    Tribunal placing significant, if not sole, emphasis on  the  fact  that
    HMRC applied no penalty: reliance is placed on the decisions in R  (oao
    Samant) v Secretary of State for the Home Department JR/6546/16  and  R
    (oao Abbasi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department JR/13807/16.


 8. There is nothing in that ground for three reasons. First, the decisions
    cited are both judicial reviews in which the function of  the  Tribunal
    is quite different. In Samant and Abbasi the 'no penalty' point was not
    sufficient to demonstrate the decision of the Secretary of State to  be
    irrational. That does not prevent the  First-tier  Tribunal  taking  it
    into account in a rounded assessment of the  evidence  in  a  statutory
    appeal. Second, the evidence was not simply that the HMRC  had  decided
    to impose no penalty: they had expressly indicated that  they  ascribed
    the under-declaring to a lack of care.  Third,  and  more  importantly,
    this was not, as the grounds assert, the sole or  even  primary  reason
    why the decision is as it is. The Tribunal  gave  several  reasons  for
    finding that  the  burden  was  not  discharged,  and  in  its  rounded
    assessment the innocent explanation of the Respondent was credible  and
    reasonable.

 9. Before me Mr Bramble sought  to  expand  the  grounds  to  submit  that
    properly analysed the determination may be unimpeachable in respect  of
    the 2010-11 discrepancy, but that it failed to make clear  whether  its
    findings also covered the later discrepancies. Although this point  was
    not argued in the grounds I am prepared to deal with it.   The Tribunal
    makes clear, at its paragraph 46, that it did not consider it necessary
    to set out all of  the  figures  etc  in  greater  detail  because  the
    evidence presented by the Respondent was  woefully  inadequate:  "there
    was, in essence, no evidence at all put forward by  the  Respondent  to
    show any dishonesty  on  Mr  Billapati's  part".    Further  the  later
    discrepancies were not, as Mr Gajjar rightly submits, in themselves  so
    significant that the Secretary of State could even rely  upon  them  to
    discharge the evidential burden: for the year  2012-13  the  difference
    eventually paid in tax  was  �123.25;  for  the  year  2013-14  it  was
    �786.17.

10. In the circumstances I find no error of law and uphold the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.



    Decisions


11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law and it
    is upheld.


12. There is no direction for anonymity.
