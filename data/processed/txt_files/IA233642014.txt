                            DECISION AND REASONS

  History of Appeal

    1. The Respondent, who was born on 1 February 1985,  is  a  national  of
       Afghanistan. He arrived in the United Kingdom on  30  December  1998,
       when he was 13 years old, and applied for asylum. His application was
       refused on 10 January 2001 but he was granted limited leave to remain
       until 8 August 2005.

    2. He was refused further  leave  to  remain  on  12  January  2010  and
       appealed against this decision. His appeal was allowed on 8  February
       2011 and on 18 March 2011 he was  granted  limited  leave  to  remain
       until 7 February 2014.

    3. On 6 February 2014 he applied for indefinite leave to remain but  his
       application was refused on 14 May 2014.   He  appealed  against  this
       decision on 23 May 2014 and his  appeal  was  allowed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Khan on 8 July 2015.

    4. The Appellant appealed on 21 July 2015 and permission to  appeal  was
       granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox on 19 October 2015

  Error of Law Hearing

    5. At the error of law hearing counsel for the Respondent confirmed that
       he was not seeking to cross-appeal against the finding  in  paragraph
       39 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Khan's decision that  the  Respondent
       was not entitled to an automatic grant of indefinite leave to remain.



    6. In her first ground of appeal the Appellant submitted that First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Khan had not stated the basis on which he had  allowed
       the Respondent's appeal.  I have noted that in paragraph  45  of  his
       decision, he simply  stated  that  he  had  allowed  the  appeal.  In
       addition, the rest of the decision does not clarify the precise basis
       upon which the appeal was allowed. This, in itself, gave  rise  to  a
       material error of law based on a lack of adequate reasoning.

    7. Paragraphs 10 of the decision suggests that the Judge was considering
       the Respondent's appeal under paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
       Rules and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

    8. At paragraph 40 of the decision the Judge found that  the  Respondent
       had lost all ties with Afghanistan and I find that this is a  finding
       which was open to him on the evidence before him.  However, this  was
       the previous test for granting leave under paragraph  276ADE  of  the
       Immigration Rules and the Judge should have considered whether  there
       were very significant obstacles to him integrating if he returned  to
       Afghanistan, which he did not do. (This test applied in appeals after
       28 July 2014.) This amounts to another material error of law.

    9. In paragraph 42 of his decision the Judge also found that it would be
       a disproportionate breach of Article 8 of  the  ECHR  to  remove  the
       Respondent to Afghanistan, as his girlfriend would not be able to  go
       there with him. However, he did not  consider  the  requirements  for
       leave under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules before  starting  to
       consider Article 8 of the ECHR outside the Rules, as required to  do.
       He also fails to consider whether there were the necessary compelling
       circumstances to justify considering the case outside the Rules.

   10. Counsel for the Respondent noted that the Judge  had  relied  on  the
       test in the case of Razgar but this was not sufficient on its own  in
       the light of R (on the application of Nagre) v Secretary of State for
       the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and subsequent case law.

   11. I accept that  the  Judge  did  quote  section  117A  and  B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in paragraph 43  of  his
       decision. However, in paragraph 44 he failed to  note  that  for  the
       purposes  of  sub-section  117B(1)  the  maintenance   of   effective
       immigration  controls  are  in  the  public  interest  and  that  the
       Respondent was not entitled to leave within the Immigration Rules. He
       also failed to direct himself to  sub-section  117B(4)  which  states
       that little weight should be given to a relationship with  a  British
       citizen when an applicant's immigration status is precarious, that is
       he only had limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  This also
       amounts to a material error of law in his approach to  Article  8  of
       the ECHR.

   12. For all of these reasons I am  satisfied  that  there  were  material
       errors of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  and
       findings and that it should be set aside.

  Conclusions:

       1. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's determination did include material
           errors of law.

        2. The decision should be set aside and remitted to the  First-tier
           Tribunal for a de novo  hearing  before  a  First-tier  Tribunal
           Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge M. A. Khan.
