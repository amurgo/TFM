 For the Respondent:   Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ KSH  Miller,  promulgated
     on 10 November 2014, in which  he  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
     against a decision to refuse to  revoke  the  deportation  order  made
     against him.



                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015




     Background


  2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in August 2003 and applied
     for asylum a month later.  That  claim  was  refused  and  his  appeal
     against that decision dismissed in a determination  promulgated  on  9
     February 2004 by Adjudicator Nicholas  Paul.  On  26  June  2007,  the
     appellant pleaded guilty to producing cannabis  and  was  subsequently
     sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.  The  appellant  made  a  belated
     attempt to appeal the respondent's decision to  deport  him  in  2008,
     however a FTTJ Astle refused to extend time for appealing.  In  August
     2011, the appellant entered into a relationship with  Van,  a  British
     citizen and the couple has two children born in  2012  and  2013.  Van
     also has two children from a previous relationship. On  2  April  2012
     the appellant was convicted of drink driving. On 2  August  2012,  the
     respondent refused to revoke the appellant's  deportation  order.  The
     appellant's appeal against that decision was dismissed by FTTJ  Warren
     L Grant on 27 November 2012. That decision was  set  aside  by  Deputy
     Upper Tribunal Judge J C Macdonald  and  remitted  to  the  First-tier
     Tribunal for the decision to be remade.

     The hearing before the FTTJ


  3. The appellant, his partner and Ms Diane Jackson, an independent social
     worker, gave evidence before FTTJ Miller, who heard the appeal  on  15
     October 2014. The FTTJ found that the appellant could not benefit from
     paragraph 399 of the Rules because there were other family members  to
     care  for  the  appellant's  children.  He  also  concluded  that  the
     appellant could not satisfy paragraph 399a of the  Rules  because  the
     appellant had not lived in the United Kingdom  with  valid  leave  for
     fifteen years.



      Error of law


    4. Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman granted permission solely on  the  basis
       of the FTTJ's treatment of the children  of  the  appellant  and  his
       partner.


    5. The Secretary of State's response of 26 June 2015 indicated that  the
       respondent opposed the  appellant's  application  for  permission  to
       appeal on the basis that the  FTTJ  directed  himself  appropriately,
       that the appellant's children were very young and heavily focused  on
       their mother and the decision followed the reasoning in  Lee  v  SSHD
       [2011] EWCA Civ 348.


 The hearing


  6. Mr Sayeed commenced his submissions by reference to the second  ground
     of appeal, that is  the  FTTJ  made  no  freestanding  best  interests
     consideration of  the  four  children  affected  by  the  respondent's
     decision. He drew my attention to specific extracts from the report of
     an independent social worker, which set  out  the  background  to  the
     family unit and each member's concerns regarding  the  deportation  of
     the appellant. He indicated that he still relied on the other  grounds
     and could address me accordingly if necessary.






  7. For his part Mr Tarlow submitted that Mr Sayeed was seeking to reargue
     the matter before me, with reference to the evidence. He  argued  that
     it could not be said that the FTTJ was unaware of the evidence in  the
     social worker's report,  which  was  mentioned  in  the  decision  and
     reasons. He asked me to note that the FTTJ had grasped  at  [29]  that
     the key issue was whether the decision to  deport  the  appellant  was
     unduly harsh on the children; that the FTTJ noted that this was a very
     serious offence [30], that positive findings were made  regarding  the
     appellant and the children [32] and that after  careful  consideration
     [34] the FTTJ was entitled to reach the  conclusions  he  did  on  the
     evidence [33].

  8. In reply, Mr Sayeed asked me to  note  that  Mr  Tarlow  had  made  no
     reference in his submissions to a best interest analysis  having  been
     carried out by the FTTJ and that it could not be said that the  FTTJ's
     decision would have been the same had such an analysis taken place. In
     response to my question as to the materiality of  any  error  of  law,
     owing to the phrase " The only arguable point is  as  to  the  judge's
     treatment of those of their children D and A, both under 3,"  employed
     by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman in his grant of permission, Mr  Sayeed
     submitted that the appellant's natural children are  British  citizens
     and therefore on the same footing as those non-British  children  with
     longer residence and accordingly their age was irrelevant.

Error of Law


  9. The FTTJ made a material error of law in concluding that the effect of
     the  appellant's  deportation  would  not  be  unduly  harsh  on   the
     appellant's children without having made any express reference  to  or
     consideration of their best interests. The only mention of the concept
     of best interest in the FTTJ's decision and reasons is at  [2] when he
     recites the history of the appeal in the following  terms;  "Judge  JG
     MacDonald held that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved
     the making of an error on a point of law on the ground that the  Panel
     did not give  proper  consideration  to  the  best  interests  of  the
     Appellant's own child and the two others in the household in which  he
     was living." Regrettably, the FTTJ fell into the same error.


 10. I have considered the relevant legal principles paraphrased in Zoumbas
     v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 at [10];

     "(4) While different judges might approach the question  of  the  best
     interests of a child in different ways; it is important to ask oneself
     the right questions in an orderly manner in order to  avoid  the  risk
     that the best interests of a child might  be  undervalued  when  other
     important consideration were in play;


     (5) It is important to have a clear idea of  a  child's  circumstances
     and of what is in a child's best interests  before  one  asks  oneself
     whether  those  interests  are  outweighed  by  the  force  of   other
     considerations."

 11. Lee V SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 348 at [27] makes a similar point as to the
     need for a "properly structured appraisal of the evidence, informed by
     a correct understanding of the legal  importance  of  a  child's  best
     interests."






 12. I am also persuaded by  Mr  Sayeed's  submission  that  the  standards
     expected of the respondent in complying with its duty under section 55
     of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 apply with  equal
     force to the First-tier Tribunal. In MK(section 55 - Tribunal options)
     Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223 (IAC) at [8], the following was said;

      "The substance of the primary duty must be properly acknowledged,  the
      relevant children must be identified and  their  best  interests  must
      then  be  considered,  to  be  followed  by  a  considered   balancing
      exercise." And;


      "Being adequately informed and conducting a  scrupulous  analysis  are
      elementary pre-requisites to the inter-related  tasks  of  identifying
      the child's best interests and then balancing them with other material
      considerations. This balancing exercise  is  the  central  feature  of
      cases of the present type. It cannot be realistically or  sensibly  be
      undertaken unless and until the scales are properly prepared."

 13. There was no structured approach by the FTTJ  to  the  best  interests
     principle and no appraisal of the evidence relating to the children in
     the his decision.


 14. The  vast  majority  of  the  information  regarding  the  appellant's
     children was contained in an extensive report of an independent social
     worker who visited the family unit on three occasions and  spent  five
     and a half hours with them  in  total.  There  is  no  record  of  any
     challenge to the social worker's observations and conclusions  by  the
     presenting officer who appeared before the FTTJ. The said  report  set
     out,  over  30  pages,  the  complex  relationship  history   of   the
     appellant's wife, the abandonment of the appellant's  stepchildren  by
     their  natural  father  and  the  individual  effect  the  appellant's
     deportation would  have  on  each  of  the  four  children.  The  sole
     reference to the social worker's evidence is at  [19]  of  the  FTTJ's
     decision when he recites her oral evidence regarding the likely effect
     of the appellant's deportation on his  wife.  There  is  no  reference
     anywhere in the decision to the detailed information contained in  the
     report  regarding  the  children  of  the  family,  particularly   the
     appellant's natural children.


 15. There is no mention of the  phrase  "best  interests"  in  the  FTTJ's
     decision where he records his findings,  from  [21]  onwards.  Nor  is
     there any recognition of the primary importance  of  ascertaining  the
     best interests of the children or a need to  conduct  a  free-standing
     assessment. While the FTTJ correctly recognised that the appeal turned
     on the issue of whether the  appellant's  deportation  would  have  an
     unduly harsh effect on his children, that issue was addressed  without
     any identification of the children's best interests. Furthermore, what
     consideration  there  was  of   the   children's   circumstances   was
     inadequate, in that the FTTJ stated at [33] that "the  impact  on  the
     children will be significant" but does not provide any reasoning which
     might indicate that there was any consideration of the evidence before
     him or of the children's best interests.

 16. In these circumstances I am satisfied that there  are  errors  of  law
     such that the decision be set aside to be remade. None of the findings
     of the FTTJ are to stand.

 17. The best  interests  of  the  appellant's  children  have  yet  to  be
     considered at the First-tier Tribunal and accordingly I decided,  with
     the agreement of the parties, that the matter ought to be remitted  to
     the First-tier rather than retained in the Upper Tribunal.

 18. Further directions are set out below.

 19.  No anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and I see  no  reason  to
     make one now.




Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the
     making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be re-made.



Directions





   . This appeal is remitted to be heard de novo by any First-tier Tribunal
     Judge except FTTJ Miller, Astle or Paul
   . The appeal should be listed for a hearing at Taylor House
   . A Vietnamese interpreter is required.
   . Time estimate is 4 hours
   . The FTT is to give consideration to an early listing of this appeal.
