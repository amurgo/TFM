Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representative


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect  the  anonymity  of  the  appellant's  children.   This   order
    prohibits the disclosure  directly  or  indirectly  (including  by  the
    parties) of the  identity  of  the  appellant  or  her  children.   Any
    disclosure and breach of this order may amount to a contempt of  court.
    This order shall remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal
    or court.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judges Whitcombe and Page)  allowing  NS's  appeal
    against a decision of the Secretary of State taken on 10 September 2014
    refusing to issue her with a derivative residence card under reg 15A of
    the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  (SI  2006/1003  as  amended)
    (hereafter "the EEA Regulations").

 3. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 4. The appellant is a citizen of Japan who was born on [ ] 1972.   She  is
    married to a British citizen, "MP" who was born on [ ] 1958.  They  met
    in Japan in 2000 and married  on  24  December  2004.   They  have  two
    children, "A" born on [ ] 2007 and "F" born on [ ] 2010.  Both children
    are British citizens.

 5. The family lived in Japan until 29 January 2014 when they came to  live
    in the UK.  They live together with MP's parents in  [  ]  Devon.   His
    mother has significant health problems and possible signs  of  dementia
    and his father, who is aged 79, is in good health.  MP has siblings and
    extended family members  in  the  UK  but,  as  I  understand  it,  the
    appellant has none.  MP is in full-time employment working for the [  ]
    Council as a workshop technician or mechanic maintaining the  council's
    fleet of vehicles.  The appellant does  not  work  but  undertakes  the
    majority of the childcare responsibilities and domestic  responsibility
    for the family.  Both children are now in school.

The Appellant's Application

 6. On 25 June 2014, the appellant applied for a derivative residence  card
    under the EEA Regulations.  The basis of her claim was under regulation
    15A(4A) as the "primary carer" of her British citizen children who  are
    residing in the UK and  that,  if  she  were  required  to  leave,  her
    children "would be unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA State".



 7. On 10 September 2014, the Secretary of State  refused  the  appellant's
    application.  The Secretary of State was not satisfied, first that  the
    appellant was the "primary carer" of the two  children;  and  secondly,
    that they would be unable to reside in the UK or another EEA  State  if
    the appellant left  the  UK  because  there  was  no  reason  that  the
    appellant's husband could not continue to care for them in her absence.

The Appeal

 8. The appellant appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal  was  satisfied  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that   the
    requirements of reg 15A(4A) were met.  In particular, the Tribunal  was
    satisfied that  the  appellant  was  the  "primary  carer  of  her  two
    children" as she was the person with "primary responsibility for  their
    care".   Further,  the  Tribunal  was  satisfied  on   a   balance   of
    probabilities that the children would not be able to reside in  the  UK
    (or another EEA State) if the appellant were required to leave the UK.

 9. As a result, the First-tier Tribunal  allowed  the  appellant's  appeal
    under reg 15A of the EEA Regs.

10. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal had  been  wrong  in
    law first, to find that the  appellant  was  the  "primary  carer"  and
    secondly, to find that the children would be unable to reside in the UK
    if the appellant left; despite any  difficulties  for  the  appellant's
    husband and his working arrangements, he would  be  able  to  care  for
    them.

11. On 2 July 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge M  Davies)  granted  the
    Secretary of State on both grounds.

The Submissions

12. The appellant was not represented at the  hearing  before  me  but  her
    husband,  MP,  spoke  on  her  behalf.   The  Secretary  of  State  was
    represented by Mr Richards.

13. Mr Richards relied upon the Secretary of State's grounds.

14. First, he submitted that the First-tier Tribunal could not properly and
    lawfully find that the appellant had "primary responsibility"  for  the
    children and that therefore she was a "primary carer" for the  purposes
    of reg 15A(4A) of the  EEA  Regulations.   He  submitted  that  on  the
    evidence it was  clear  that  responsibility  was  shared  between  the
    appellant and their father (her husband) as they lived  together  as  a
    family.

15. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that the First-tier Tribunal was  wrong
    in law to find that the children would be unable to live in the  UK  if
    the appellant left.  Mr Richards submitted that  it  was  only  if  the
    children would be compelled to leave the  UK  (and  the  EU)  that  the
    requirements of reg 15A(4A)  were  met.   It  was  not  sufficient,  he
    submitted, as the First-tier Tribunal had concluded to find that  there
    were practical  difficulties  for  their  continued  residence  in  the
    absence of the appellant, in particular concerning the ability of their
    father to work as he currently did in the absence of the appellant.  Mr
    Richards accepted, as had the First-tier  Tribunal,  that  it  was  not
    realistic that MP's parents could undertake any significant  amount  of
    childcare.  Mr Richards relied upon the Court of Appeal's  decision  in
    Harrison v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1736 to the  effect  that  it  was  not
    sufficient for the  appellant  to  demonstrate  practical  difficulties
    affecting the quality or standard of life which might  be  affected  by
    her departure from the UK.  In this regard  he  also  relied  upon  the
    Upper Tribunal's decision in MA and SM (Zambrano: EU  children  outside
    EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 00380 (IAC)) set out in para 8 of the grounds  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

16. Mr Richards submitted that on the evidence  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision could not stand as a matter of law and  the  correct  decision
    was to dismiss the appeal on the basis that  the  appellant  could  not
    meet the requirements of reg 15A of the EEA Regulations.

17. MP, speaking for his wife, submitted that his wife was their children's
    "primary carer" on the basis that he was at work for a  minimum  of  37
    hours a week.  She dealt with  the  school  and  the  children's  needs
    generally.  He accepted, however, that he  helped  with  the  children,
    including their homework and showers in the evening.

18. MP further submitted that if the appellant left the UK  it  would  cost
    around �200 per week for childcare which he would be unable  to  afford
    on his basic salary of �17,714.  He submitted that he and the  children
    would not be able to remain in  the  UK  if  the  appellant  left.   He
    submitted that he would not be able to look after them if she left.

Regulation 15A

19. The relevant  regulation  in  the  EEA  Regulations  dealing  with  the
    appellant's application for a derivative residence card  based  upon  a
    derivative right of residence is reg 15A(4A).

20. Regulation 15A(1) provides as follows:

         "(1) A person ("P") who is not an exempt person and  who  satisfies
             the criteria in paragraph  (2),  (3),  (4A)  or  (5)  of  this
             regulation is entitled to a derivative right to reside in  the
             United Kingdom  for  as  long  as  P  satisfies  the  relevant
             criteria."

21. The relevant criteria are found in reg 15A(4A) as follows:

         "(4A)    P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

                (a)    P is the primary carer of  a  British  citizen  ("the
                    relevant British citizen");

                (b)    the relevant  British  citizen  is  residing  in  the
                    United Kingdom; and

                (c)    the relevant  British  citizen  would  be  unable  to
                    reside in the UK or in  another  EEA  State  if  P  were
                    required to leave."

22. The term "primary carer" is defined in reg 15A(7) as follows:

         "(7) P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if

             (a)  P is a direct  relative  or  a  legal  guardian  of  that
                  person; and

             (b)  P-

                  (i)  is the person who has primary responsibility for that
                      person's care; or

                  (ii) shares equally the responsibility for  that  person's
                      care with one other  person  who  is  not  an  exempt
                      person."

23. Finally, relevant for these purposes is reg 15A(8)  which  provides  as
    follows

         "(8) P will not be regarded as having responsibility for a person's
             care for the purpose of paragraph (7) on the sole basis  of  a
             financial contribution towards that person's care."

24. In this appeal, the appellant can only succeed in showing that she is a
    "primary carer" by virtue  of  reg  15A(7)(b)(i)  as  the  person  with
    "primary responsibility" for the  care  of  the  children.   Regulation
    15A(7)(b)(ii) cannot apply to the appellant - if she shares equally the
    responsibility for the children with her husband - because  he  is  an
    "exempt person" as defined in reg 15A(6)(c) because  he  is  a  British
    citizen.

25. As will be clear from these provisions, the disputed issues arise under
    reg 15A(4A)(a) and (c); it not being in question that the children  are
    British citizens residing in the UK.

Discussion

26. The first issue is whether the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  correct  to
    conclude that the appellant was the "primary carer" of the children for
    the purposes of reg 15A(4A)(b).  That in turn required by virtue of reg
    15A(7)(b)(i) that she had "primary responsibility for [their] care".

27. The First-tier Tribunal found at para 24 of its determination that  she
    was the "primary carer  of  her  two  children".   The  basis  of  that
    conclusion is derived from the Tribunal findings of fact at paras 15-22
    of its determination based upon the evidence:

         "15. There was actually very little factual dispute at the hearing.
             Having heard the evidence and the parties' submissions we made
             the  following  findings   of   fact   on   the   balance   of
             probabilities.

         16.  The Appellant first met the  Sponsor  in  Japan  in  2003  and
             shortly afterwards they  entered  into  a  relationship.  They
             married in Japan on 24th December 2004. The dates of birth  of
             their children are set out in the  first  paragraph  of  these
             Reasons. The children are both British citizens.

         17.  The family continued to live in Japan until 29th January  2014
             when they travelled to the UK. A factor in their  decision  to
             relocate was the aftermath  of  the  Fukishima  nuclear  power
             plant accident. It was  becoming  increasingly  difficult  for
             them to buy fresh food that  had  not  originated  from  areas
             contaminated by radiation  from  Fukishima.  The  family  have
             lived in the UK since 29th January 2014 and wish to  make  the
             UK their permanent home.

         18.  The Appellant, the Sponsor and their children  currently  live
             with the  Sponsor's  parents  in  [  ]  Devon.  The  Sponsor's
             siblings and extended family  members  are  also  present  and
             settled in the UK. The Sponsor is in full time employment with
             [ ] Council as a Workshop Technician or mechanic,  maintaining
             the Council's fleet of vehicles. He works over 40 hours a week
             and the family finances are secure. As the Sponsor put it, "we
             do fine and manage to save a little".  The  Sponsor's  witness
             statement put his gross annual earnings at  �17,758.52  (based
             on 37 hours a week), but we also accept his oral evidence that
             he has recently been able  to  work  extra  hours  which  have
             resulted in an increase in take home pay of about  �1,500  per
             annum. It therefore appears likely that the  Sponsor's  income
             now exceeds the �18,600 income threshold  were  the  Appellant
             now to apply for entry clearance as the spouse of the Sponsor.
             The Appellant was formerly a dental nurse while in  Japan  but
             is not currently working in the UK. She  hopes  to  return  to
             dental nursing in the future if possible.

         19.  The Sponsor's parents are of advanced years and the  Sponsor's
             mother  has  recently  suffered  significant  health  problems
             necessitating a 3 week stay in intensive care and a further  3
             weeks in a different hospital. Possible signs of dementia  are
             under investigation at the moment. The Sponsor's father is  in
             good health and is aged 79.   We  accept  that  the  Sponsor's
             parents are not realistically in a position to  undertake  any
             significant amount of childcare.

         20.  The Sponsor generally works from 8am to 5pm  from  Mondays  to
             Fridays. He also works some Saturdays. We do  not  accept  the
             Respondent's submission that this  more  or  less  equates  to
             school hours. Even if no allowance is  made  for  the  journey
             time from the Sponsor's workplace to his childrens' school  (a
             matter on which we heard no evidence), it is clear that  there
             would be several hours each day during which  childcare  would
             be required. While the Sponsor  is  clearly  a  concerned  and
             committed father, his working pattern means that he is  unable
             to provide a great deal of the necessary childcare.  For  that
             the  children  rely  on  their  mother,  the  Appellant.   The
             Appellant  undertakes  the  vast  majority  of  the  childcare
             responsibilities, by which we mean not only cooking, cleaning,
             clothing and  washing,  but  also  the  general  provision  of
             emotional and physical support to the children. The  Appellant
             also undertakes about 75% of the housework in the family home.



         21.  The children are now at school. Their English is improving and
             there is a corresponding deterioration in their Japanese. They
             feel settled in their current home and school. We did not hear
             any evidence to suggest that the school has,  for  example,  a
             "breakfast club" or "after school club", effectively providing
             childcare at either end of the school day in order  to  assist
             working parents.

         22.  The Sponsor  has  considered  the  cost  and  availability  of
             professional childcare. He has concluded that it is more  than
             he could reasonably afford. We  accept  his  estimate  of  the
             costs, which he put at �20-25 per child per  day  with  meals.
             That estimate was not challenged by  the  Respondent  and  the
             Respondent called no evidence of its own  regarding  childcare
             costs in North Devon. We also proceed on the  basis  that  the
             cost is almost certain to be higher if childcare  is  required
             during the  school  holidays.   When  those  figures  are  set
             against the current level of family income it  is  clear  that
             professional childcare would be  totally  unaffordable.   Miss
             Davies did not suggest otherwise."

28. The EEA Regulations offer no definition of "primary responsibility" for
    the care of a child in reg 15A(7)(b)(i) albeit that  reg  15A(8)  makes
    plain  that  financial  contribution  alone  will  not  amount  to   an
    individual taking "responsibility" for the child's care.

29. Clearly where there is one parent who has both the legal responsibility
    and practical day-to-day responsibility for the care of a  child,  that
    individual will have "primary responsibility" for that child's care and
    will as a consequence be the child's "primary carer".  Where,  however,
    there are two parents who have legal  responsibility  for  the  child's
    care and both, in practice, care for  the  child  albeit  at  different
    times of the day or week according to their family arrangements, it  is
    in my judgment impossible  to  say  that  either  parent  has  "primary
    responsibility" for that child's care.  The responsibility is, in fact,
    'shared' albeit that the  responsibility  is  discharged  at  different
    times.  Here, there is no doubt that both the  appellant  and  MP  have
    joint legal  responsibility  for  their  children.   They  retain  that
    responsibility at all times - jointly.   They  share  day-to-day  care
    according to the arrangements of their lives.  The fact that  MP  works
    during the week (and even on Saturdays) whilst the appellant  does  not
    have employment and looks after the children during the day or when  MP
    is at work does not mean that  she  has  "primary  responsibility"  for
    their care.

30.  As  the  EEA  Regulations  make  clear  in  reg  15A(7)(b)(ii)   where
    responsibility is "shared" then despite the fact  that  neither  person
    has  "primary  responsibility"  for  the  child's   care,   they   will
    nevertheless only  be  a  "primary  carer"  if  the  person  with  whom
    responsibility is shared is themselves not an "exempt person", i.e. not
    someone who has a right  to  reside  in  the  UK  as  set  out  in  reg
    15A(6)(c).

31. As I have already indicated, MP is  an  "exempt  person"  as  he  is  a
    British citizen and therefore has a right of abode in the  UK.   Whilst
    the term "primary responsibility" should not be seen in a narrow  legal
    sense,  it  remains  relevant  whether  more  than   one   person   has
    responsibility to care for the British citizen child through  whom  the
    derived right of residence is claimed.  A  joint  legal  responsibility
    linked to a shared practical discharge of that  responsibility  by  two
    parents  who  live  together  with  the  child  is,  in  my   judgment,
    inconsistent  with  either  parent  being   said   to   have   "primary
    responsibility" and therefore to be the "primary carer".

32. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  in  concluding
    that the appellant was the children's "primary carer" and  so  met  the
    requirement in reg 15A(4A)(a).

33. Further, in any event, the Tribunal's finding that the children  "would
    be unable to reside in the UK" if the appellant were required to  leave
    and so she met the  requirement  in  reg  15A(4A)(c)  is  also  legally
    flawed.

34.  The  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  is  at  paras  25-29  of   its
    determination as follows:

         "25. We therefore turn to the test in  regulation  15A(4A)(c),  and
             the question whether the Appellant's children would be  unable
             to reside in the UK or another EEA State if the Appellant were
             required to leave.

         26.  We have concluded that the Appellant has also  proved  on  the
             balance of probabilities that her children would not  be  able
             to reside in the UK (still less another EEA State) if she were
             required to leave.

         27.  The Sponsor's working pattern means that he will be unable  to
             provide effective childcare without either reducing his  hours
             or engaging professional childcare.  We  have  not  heard  any
             evidence regarding the willingness of  the  Sponsor's  current
             employers to contemplate a reduction in his basic  hours,  but
             on the assumption that they would, the financial  consequences
             for the Sponsor and the  remaining  family  would  clearly  be
             grave. The family finances are currently sound  but  it  seems
             unlikely that they would remain secure if there were to  be  a
             significant reduction in the Sponsor's hours.  It  is  equally
             clear  that  the  cost  of  professional  childcare  would  be
             prohibitive given the current  level  of  family  income.  The
             Sponsor's parents are  not  realistically  in  a  position  to
             supply any significant amount of free childcare.

         28.  In submissions,  Miss  Davies  did  not  suggest  either  that
             professional childcare was affordable for this family or  that
             the Sponsor's parents would be able to provide some or all  of
             it.  Miss Davies' submission was confined  to  the  suggestion
             that the Sponsor  would  be  able  to  provide  the  necessary
             childcare in the evenings and at weekends. We  are  unable  to
             accept that submission. It does not sufficiently recognise the
             need for childcare at each end of the  school  day  (when  the
             Sponsor would be at work) or the impact of school holidays.

         29.  While it would be  possible  in  theory  for  the  Sponsor  to
             combine the roles of sole earner and sole  career  we  do  not
             think  that  would  be   at   all   realistic   in   practice.
             Realistically, if the Appellant were to leave the UK then  her
             children would have to leave too. It would deprive them of  an
             effective right of residence. The family arrangements function
             well at the moment because the Appellant is able to contribute
             significant amounts of free  childcare.  There  is  simply  no
             alternative source of affordable, let alone free,  childcare."



35. The approach of the First-tier Tribunal is, in my judgment, contrary to
    the approach of the Court of  Appeal  in  Harrison  and  as  stated  by
    Hickinbottom J in R (Sanneh) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
    [2013] EWHC 793 (Admin) at [19].  It amounts, in effect, to  a  finding
    that the position of the children in the UK without their mother  would
    be untenable because MP would be unable to look after and support them.



36. In Sanneh, Hickinbottom J summarised the position as follows at [19]:

         "i)  All nationals of all member states are EU citizens. It is  for
             each member state to determine how nationality of  that  state
             may be acquired, but, once it is acquired  by  an  individual,
             that individual has the right to enjoy the  substance  of  the
             rights that attach to the status of EU citizen, including  the
             right to reside in the territory  of  the  EU.   That  applies
             equally to minors, irrespective of the  nationality  of  their
             parents, and irrespective of whether one or both parents  have
             EU citizenship.

         ii)  An EU citizen must have the freedom  to  enjoy  the  right  to
             reside in the EU, genuinely and in practice. For a minor, that
             freedom may be jeopardised if, although  legally  entitled  to
             reside in the EU,  he  is  compelled  to  leave  EU  territory
             because an ascendant relative upon whom  he  is  dependent  is
             compelled to leave. That relative may be compelled to leave by
             dint of direct state action (e.g. he  is  the  subject  of  an
             order for removal) or by virtue of being driven to  leave  and
             reside in a non-EU country  by  force  of  economic  necessity
             (e.g. by having insufficient resources to provide for  his  EU
             child/ren) because the state refuses him a work  permit).  The
             rights of an EU child will not  be  infringed  if  he  is  not
             compelled to leave. Therefore, even where a  non-EU  ascendant
             relative is compelled to leave EU territory,  the  article  20
             rights of an EU child  will  not  be  infringed  if  there  is
             another ascendant relative who has the right of  residence  in
             the EU, and who can and will in practice care for the child.

         iii) It is for the national courts to determine, as a  question  of
             fact on the evidence before it, whether an EU citizen would be
             compelled to leave the EU to follow  a  non-EU  national  upon
             whom he is dependent.

         iv)  Nothing less than such compulsion will engage articles 20  and
             21 of the TFEU. In particular, EU  law  will  not  be  engaged
             where the EU citizen is not compelled to leave the EU, even if
             the  quality  or  standard  of  life  of  the  EU  citizen  is
             diminished as a result of the non-EU national upon whom he  is
             dependent is (for example) removed or prevented from  working;
             although (a) diminution in the quality of life might engage EU
             law if (and only if) it is sufficient in  practice  to  compel
             the a relevant ascendant relative, and hence the EU  dependent
             citizen,  to  leave,  and  (b)  such  actions  as  removal  or
             prevention or work may result in  an  interference  with  some
             other right, such as the right  to  respect  for  family  life
             under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

         v)   Although such article 8 rights are similar in scope to the  EU
             rights conferred by article 7 of the  Charter  of  Fundamental
             Rights of the European Union, the provisions  of  the  Charter
             are addressed to member states only when they are implementing
             EU law.  If EU law is not engaged, then  the  domestic  courts
             have to undertake the examination of the right to family  life
             under article 8; but that is  an  entirely  distinct  area  of
             protection.

         vi)  The overriding of the general national right to refuse a  non-
             EU  national  a  right  of  residence,  by  reference  to  the
             effective enjoyment of the right to reside of a  dependent  EU
             citizen, is  described  in  both  Dereci  (paragraph  67)  and
             Harrison  (paragraph  66)  as   "exceptional",   meaning   (as
             explained in the latter), as  a  principle,  it  will  not  be
             regularly engaged."

37. The derivative right is not established unless the individual would  be
    forced or compelled to leave the UK.  In Harrison, Elias LJ (giving the
    judgment of the court), and referring to the CJEU case law  upon  which
    reg 15A(4A) is based, said this at [63]:

         "... [There] is really no basis for asserting that it  is  arguable
         in the light of the authorities that the Zambrano principle extends
         to cover anything short of a situation  where  the  EU  citizen  is
         forced to leave the territory of the EU.  If the EU citizen, be  it
         the child or wife, would not in practice be compelled to leave  the
         country if the non-EU family member were to be refused the right of
         residence, there is in my view  nothing  in  these  authorities  to
         suggest that EU law is engaged."

38. At [67], Elias LJ stated that:

         "The right of residence is a right to reside in  the  territory  of
         the EU.  It is not a right to any particular quality of life or  to
         any particular  standard  of  living.   Accordingly,  there  is  no
         impediment to exercising the right to reside if  residence  remains
         possible as a matter of substance, albeit that the quality of  life
         is diminished.  Of course,  to  the  extent  that  the  quality  or
         standard of life will be seriously impaired by excluding the non-EU
         national, that is likely in  practice  to  infringe  the  right  of
         residence itself because it will effectively compel the EU  citizen
         to give up residence and travel with the non-EU national."

39. In my judgment, it was simply not open to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    find that the appellant's children would be compelled to leave  the  EU
    because MP would, in effect, be compelled to leave the  UK  because  he
    could not care for his children and work at the same time.

40. It is irrational to find that MP (in the absence of his wife) would  be
    unwilling and unable to care for his children.  Many people live  their
    lives as single parents caring for and  providing  for  their  children
    through work or, possibly, supplemented by State  support.   Both  MP's
    children are in school.  They require "hands on"  care  only  for  non-
    school times.  There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal as  to
    the cost of childcare which MP also told me was about  �200  per  week.
    It is not clear whether this was the cost of professional childcare  on
    a more or less full-time basis or not.  MP's evidence was only that  he
    would be  presented  with  difficulties  in  carrying  on  his  current
    employment if he had to look after his children  full-time.   The  fact
    that he may not be able to be as economically active as he would  wish,
    or work a pattern that he now does because of his care responsibilities
    to his children, is not sufficient to support a finding that  A  and  F
    would be denied the genuine enjoyment of their  EU  citizenship  rights
    (see, e.g. MA and SM at [56] also doubting whether that  would  be  the
    case even if a father had to stop working altogether).

41. It may be MF's choice to leave the UK with A and F but, in my judgment,
    the First-tier Tribunal could not rationally  come  to  the  conclusion
    that he (and therefore A and F) would be forced or compelled  to  leave
    the UK.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was not  such,  in
    my judgment, that a finding could rationally be sustained that a single
    man in employment (whether his current employment or other  employment)
    would be unable to care for his children who are in full-time education
    and who live with their father in his  parents'  home.   Even  if  MP's
    parents were unable to undertake any significant amount  of  childcare,
    nothing in the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  suggested  that
    his father (in particular) could not provide some support and there was
    no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that MP would not be able to
    obtain State support if the family's circumstances required it.

42. In my judgment, the only rational conclusion on the evidence was  that,
    whilst there may be a diminution in the quality of life of the children
    if their mother left the UK and possibly a lower standard of living  if
    their father's income was reduced, the  substance  of  their  right  to
    reside  was  not  infringed  in  that  their  circumstances  could  not
    possibly, on the evidence, be such that their father would be unable to
    care for them in the UK.

43. For those reasons, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in finding that
    the requirement in reg 15A(4A)(c), that the children would be unable to
    reside in the UK (or another EEA State) if the appellant were  required
    to leave, was met.  The only proper conclusion on the evidence was that
    the requirement was not met.

Decision

44. For these reasons, the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal under reg 15A(4A) involved the making of an error of
    law.  That decision is set aside.

45. I remake the decision dismissing the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant has failed to establish that she meets  the  requirements  of
    reg 15A(4A), in particular paras (a) and (c).

46. Accordingly, the  appellant's  appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations  is
    dismissed.
