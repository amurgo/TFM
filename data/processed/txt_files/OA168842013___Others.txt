Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr P Scott, Pickup Scott Solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this appeal concerns the welfare of children it raises nothing
    of a particularly personal nature. I see no need for, and do not  make,
    any order restraining publication.

 2. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal by the  three  respondents,
    herein after "the claimants", against a decision of the Entry Clearance
    Officer refusing them permission to join a family member in the  United
    Kingdom.

 3. The grounds criticising  the  decision  complain  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge made no findings about  their  ability  to  satisfy  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements of the Rules.   That,  as  a
    statement of fact, is correct but it overlooks that  their  ability  to
    satisfy those parts of the Rules was never put in issue  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and neither was there anything in their circumstances
    to suggest that it ought to have been in issue. Mr Wilding, fairly  and
    properly, drew my attention to the evidence that at the  material  time
    the appellants could point to a  sponsor  with  savings  in  excess  of
    ï¿½17,000.

 4. I do not know exactly what has happened here but I rather suspect  that
    the grounds have been settled by someone not entirely apprised  of  the
    case and probably inadequately instructed.  No doubt the grounds  would
    not have been put in their present form if the officer responsible  had
    a better grasp of the case.  Mr Wilding could do no more than  formally
    rely on grounds which he has not developed in any way.

 5. I am satisfied that there is no material error of law here.  It is  not
    an  obligation  on  the  Tribunal  to  take  points  that  are  not  in
    contention.

 6. I dismiss the Entry Clearance Officer's appeals. The  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeals of the claimants shall stand.
