For the Appellant: Not represented
For the Respondent: Ms A. Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 20 March 1984. On 10
       March 2012 he applied for a residence  card  as  confirmation  of  a
       right  of  residence  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA  national.   That
       application was refused in a  decision  dated  1  August  2012.  The
       appellant's appeal against that decision was dismissed by First-tier
       Tribunal  Judge  Oakley  after  a  hearing  on  16   October   2012.
       Permission to appeal having been granted, the appeal came before me.



    2. The application was refused by the Secretary of State on  the  basis
       that the appellant's marriage was one of convenience. The First-tier
       judge  concluded  that  the  marriage  was  indeed  a  marriage   of
       convenience and dismissed the appeal under the Immigration (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA  Regulations")  and  under
       Article 8 ECHR. Neither the appellant's wife nor the  witnesses  who
       made statements appeared at the hearing before Judge Oakley.

    3. At the hearing before me I asked the appellant if his  wife  was  at
       the hearing. He said that she was not. He said that he did not  know
       where she was and that they had had some arguments  on  19  December
       2012 and that she had left his home.

    4. Ms Holmes submitted to me that there  was  no  indication  that  the
       First-tier judge applied too high a standard of proof.  Even  if  he
       had, the facts were such that it could have made  no  difference  to
       the outcome of the appeal. The appellant's spouse did not appear  at
       the hearing and neither did the witnesses.  Weak  reasons  had  been
       given for his wife's non-attendance.

    5. The appellant told me that his wife is  no  longer  with  him  as  a
       result of arguments which are the fault of the UKBA. In  the  appeal
       before the First-tier Tribunal his wife  had  signed  the  statement
       dated 3 September 2012 that he presented. He had told the judge that
       she had a fever, cough and cold, as well as period  pains,  although
       he had no evidence to support this. You would not go to  the  doctor
       for a cough and cold. The judge had referred to him as  a  chemistry
       researcher rather than a physics researcher which is what he is.  He
       is not sure that the judge looked at his documents correctly.

    6. The UKBA had said that they had visited him at their  previous  home
       on 15 March but they had left that home on 1 March (2011). They  did
       not visit his next home. On 4 November 2012  his  wife  invited  his
       parents to the UK and she sent documents to  them.  When  they  came
       here the UKBA stopped them at the airport for the whole night over 8
       hours. They said that "he" had TB and he spent  ï¿½500  on  tests  but
       they were still sent back.

    7. After that the UKBA contacted his wife over and  over  again  asking
       embarrassing questions. She asked him why they were asking questions
       about their living together and if she had sex  with  him.  She  was
       crying. They were living very happily and he did not know  why  UKBA
       kept refusing. As a result of this they separated.  She  blamed  him
       and his parents. He is still trying to speak to her.

    8. I asked the appellant why his wife was unable to attend what was  an
       important hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. He  said  that  it
       was very cold that day. He stopped her from coming and told her that
       she should stay at home. He does not have knowledge of the  law  and
       the hearing was in his name only.

    9. Ms Holmes questioned whether the letter dated 3 September  2012  was
       before Judge Oakley. She again pointed out that  his  wife  did  not
       appear and there was no satisfactory explanation for her failure  to
       do so. The judge was entitled to find as he did. The  appellant  had
       not appealed the previous refusals.

   10. The appellant replied that he had not previously appealed because he
       did not have a representative and he thought that there was  nothing
       in his case that could be arranged before a court.

My assessment

   11. In this case, in order to qualify for a residence card the appellant
       must establish that he is the  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
       exercising Treaty rights. A family  member  includes  a  spouse  but
       according to Regulation 2 of the EEA Regulations, a spouse does  not
       include a party to a marriage of convenience. That is what  is,  and
       was, in issue in these proceedings.

   12. There is no burden of proof on the appellant in the  first  instance
       to establish that his is not a  marriage  of  convenience.  However,
       once there is evidence justifying a reasonable  suspicion  that  the
       marriage is one of convenience, there is an evidential burden on the
       appellant to address  that  evidence  (see  Papajorgi  (EEA  spouse-
       marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC)).

   13. Judge Oakley accepted at [19] that there are  documents  which  show
       the appellant and his wife at their then address.  It  appears  from
       the determination that he also accepted that there  was  documentary
       evidence  in  their  names  at  a  previous  address  (Cecil   Road,
       Plaistow).

   14. However, he stated in his determination at [20] and [23] that  there
       is no statement from the appellant's partner. The appellant referred
       me to a letter dated 3 September 2012  which  his  wife  signed.  Ms
       Holmes wondered  whether  that  letter  was  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. I am satisfied that it was. It is  on  the  Tribunal  file
       attached with a staple to two letters from witnesses which the judge
       referred to at [14]; a Mr Hassan and a Miss Farroukh. The letter  of
       3 September 2012 appears to be written by  the  appellant  but  also
       bears a signature in the name  of  Mrs  Toma  Traupyte.  The  letter
       refers to the genuineness of their marriage.

   15. I am satisfied that the judge was  therefore  wrong  to  state  that
       there was no written statement from the appellant's wife. There was.
       It was a joint statement.

   16. However, the letter dated 25 October 2012 bearing a signature in the
       name of the appellant's wife post-dates the hearing before the First-
       tier Tribunal. In the circumstances of this appeal, it could not  be
       said to have been an error of law for the judge to fail to take into
       account evidence that was not before him.

   17. Notwithstanding that the judge was wrong to find that there  was  no
       written evidence from the appellant's wife, he was entitled to  take
       into account the fact that she did not attend the  hearing.  He  was
       similarly entitled to conclude that a satisfactory  explanation  had
       not been given for why she did not attend, the appellant having said
       that she had a cough and cold. This was plainly an important hearing
       and  set  against  the  background  of  the  previous  refusals   of
       applications for a residence card, including on the basis  that  the
       relationship was not genuine, as was asserted by  the  Secretary  of
       State in connection with this application, the First-tier judge made
       no error in taking into account her failure to attend. It is also to
       be  recognised  that  the  appellant  is  an  intelligent,  educated
       individual whom it is reasonable to conclude would have  appreciated
       the significance of his wife attending.

   18. Similarly, although there were two letters supporting the suggestion
       that the marriage was not one of convenience, neither of the authors
       of the letters attended. Again, this was a matter that the judge was
       entitled to take into account.

   19. It is worth  noting  that  in  the  letter  dated  25  October  2012
       supporting the appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  the  appellant's  wife
       stated that she feels "depression and stress in appearing in  courts
       related matters and can cause serious impacts on my personal  life."
       She did not mention that she did not attend the first  tier  hearing
       for the reasons the appellant gave to Judge  Oakley.  Before  me  an
       additional reason for her non-attendance was given by the appellant,
       namely that she had period pains.

   20. Judge Oakley did not make any explicit reference to  the  burden  or
       standard of proof. At [21] he stated that "this may well be merely a
       marriage of convenience." At  [26]  he  gave  a  firmer  conclusion,
       stating that he agreed with the respondent that it was a marriage of
       convenience  "without  further  evidence  to  the   contrary",   and
       referring to Regulation 2 which he stated "has not been met".

   21. Whilst the judge's exposition of the legal framework in this respect
       lacks clarity, he sufficiently identifies the  fact  that  once  the
       issue of  the  marriage  being  one  of  convenience  is  raised  by
       evidence, it is for the appellant to address  that  evidence.  There
       was evidence in the Secretary of State's reasons for refusal  letter
       to raise the issue.

   22. There is what appears to be an aberration in  the  determination  at
       [27] where the judge stated that  he  found  that  the  respondent's
       decision is not in accordance  with  the  law  "and  the  applicable
       immigration rules". That is plainly an  error,  resulting  no  doubt
       from a less than thorough proof-reading  process  but  it  does  not
       affect the overall integrity of the determination.

   23. Although the appellant told me that he and his wife  are  no  longer
       living together, I  do  not  consider  that  relevant,  one  way  or
       another, to whether there is any error of law in the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal on the marriage of  convenience  issue,  or  any
       that requires the decision to be set aside.

   24. I am not satisfied that there is an error of law in the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal in relation to the  EEA  Regulations  or  in
       relation to Article 8 ECHR.

Decision

   25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making
       of an error on a point  of  law.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal to dismiss the appeal therefore stands.
