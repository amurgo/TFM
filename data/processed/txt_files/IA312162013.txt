                     Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup
                                   Between

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                              Jayasree Surabhi
                    Kanditha Naga Vaishnavi Ajit Surabhi
                        [No anonymity direction made]
                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the claimants:     No attendance
For the appellant:     Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Jayasree Surabhi, date of birth  28.8.79,  and  Kanditha
    Naga Vaishnavi Ajit Surabhi, date of  birth  10.1.09,  are  mother  and
    daughter citizens of India.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clapham,  who  allowed  the  claimants'
    appeals against the decision  of  the  respondent,  dated  20.8.13,  to
    refuse the claimants' applications made on 28.4.13 for leave to  remain
    as the dependants of the partner and father Ajit Surabhi, and to remove
    them from the UK by way of directions under Section 47  of  the  Asylum
    Immigration and Nationality Act 2006.

 3.  The Judge heard the appeal  on  21.2.14  (although  the  determination
    claims it was heard in 2013).

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole granted permission  to  appeal
    on 11.4.14.

 5. Thus the matter came before me on 11.6.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Clapham should be set aside.

 7. The applications were refused by the Secretary  of  State  because  the
    partner and father Ajit Surabhi's application for leave to remain as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student under the Points Based System (PBS)  had  been
    refused. The appeals of the partner and child claimants stood  or  fell
    with that of Mr Surabhi.

 8. Judge Clapham allowed the appeals because it appeared to  him  that  Mr
    Surabhi's visa had been extended and was valid from 5.8.13 to 5.4.14.

 9. However, the judge may not have been aware that following  the  lodging
    of the appeals to the First-tier Tribunal on 29.8.13,  the  mother  and
    first-named claimant indicated that she wished to voluntarily leave the
    UK and requested flight assistance for three individuals. The claimants
    left the UK on 21.10.13.

10. Section 104(4) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  At  2002
    provides that an appeal brought by a person while he is in the UK shall
    be treated as abandoned if the appellant leave the  UK.  There  was  no
    valid appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  no  jurisdiction  to
    determine the appeal as it should have been treated as abandoned.  This
    amounts to an error of law requiring the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be set aside and remade.

Conclusion & Decision:

11. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    The appeals are to be  treated  as  abandoned  and  thus
                    there  are  no  valid  or  extant  appeals  before   the
                    Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There are no valid appeals before the tribunal
