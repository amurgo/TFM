                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

      1. The appellant is a national of Serbia, born on 15 May 1994. He
         arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of 7. His mother and
         siblings were also here and his mother claimed protection.
         Ultimately she and the appellant's siblings were granted leave but
         he was not because of pending criminal charges.

      2. On 8 February 2013 the appellant applied for leave to remain on the
         basis of his article 8 rights. This was refused by the respondent
         on 3 July 2017. It was considered under the immigration rules in
         relation to private life, paragraph 276 ADE, as well as outside the
         rules. In particular, the respondent referred to paragraph 276
         ADE(1)(iv) which relates to someone aged between 18 and 25 as the
         appellant was and had spent half their life living continuously
         here.

      3. The respondent refused his claim on the basis of the suitability
         requirements because of his various criminal convictions. Regard
         was also had to paragraph 276 ADE 1 (iv). The respondent did not
         see significant obstacles to his integration into his home country.
         He was able to speak English and Serbian and it was felt he could
         adapt to life there. He would have retained some knowledge of the
         life language and culture.

The First tier Tribunal

      4. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge E Young-Harry at
         Birmingham on 31 January 2018. In a decision promulgated on 8 March
         2018 it was dismissed.

      5. The appellant and the respondent were represented. The appellant
         gave evidence as did his mother. The judge records that the
         application was considered under appendix FM initially. The judge
         correctly notes that the appeal is now restricted to freestanding
         article 8 grounds. In this regard the judge considered whether
         family life existed between his mother and adult siblings. The
         appellant had claimed he was dependent upon his mother. The judge
         rejected this and did not find emotional ties established over and
         above the norm.

      6. The judge did accept the appellant had an established private life.
         At paragraph 15 the judge correctly considered matters through the
         prism of the immigration rules and concluded the appellant failed
         on suitability grounds due to his persistent offending.

      7. The judge then considered other factors in the proportionality
         exercise. The judge had regard to the length of time the appellant
         had been in the United Kingdom and accepted he had been here since
         the age of 7. The judge also noted he did volunteer working in the
         last 6 months and participated in a Thinking Skills programme. The
         judge referred to the probation report suggesting there was little
         risk of reoffending. Against this, the appellant had not disclosed
         all of his convictions in the application. The judge also had
         regard to his claim relationship with his nephews and nieces and
         section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.
         The judge concluded those relationship could be maintained by
         alternative means to direct contact. The judge considered the delay
         on the part of the respondent in deciding on his original
         application.

      8. The judge accepted he had not lived in Serbia since childhood and
         that the country would be unfamiliar to him. The judge thought it
         likely family members could assist.

      9. The judge had regard to the factors in section 117B, noting that
         the appellant's private life was established when he had no leave
         but limited the weight attached to this in the circumstance. The
         judge referred to the fact he speaks English and had not been a
         drain on the public purse. Against this, his history of criminality
         was not in the public interest.

The Upper Tribunal

     10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought of number
         grounds. It was suggested the judge failed to take into account the
         fact all but one of the convictions occurred when he was a minor.
         The judge's comment about not him declaring all his convictions was
         questioned given that the form said the records would be verified
         by the respondent. Other arguments were advanced, with the final
         being there was no evidence to justify a finding of family members
         in Serbia who could assist.

     11. Permission was granted in relation to the finding there were family
         members in Serbia who can assist or that his family here could
         support him.

     12. Before the hearing I received a letter from the appellant's
         representatives indicating he was now the father of a British child
         born last month. The child's birth certificate is provided and the
         appellant occupation is as a car salesman. It was suggested that
         the respondent might wish to withdraw the decision in light of
         this. The writer also indicated that they had been unable to
         contact the appellant. No application for an adjournment was made

     13. Notification of today's hearing was sent to the appellant and his
         representatives on 27 February 2019. Neither have appeared.

     14. Mr Melvin indicated that the respondent was opposing the appeal. He
         relied upon his rule 24 response. If the appellant's circumstances
         have changed it was open to him to make a new application. He
         contended that there was no material error of law in the decision.
         He believes the reference to family members in Serbia being able to
         support the appellant was taken from the refusal letter.in any
         event, he suggested this issue was not material to the outcome of
         the appeal.

     15. I am satisfied that the appellant and his representatives were
         properly notified of today's hearing and that the matter could
         proceed. I am in agreement with the points made by the presenting
         officer.

     16. In the 2013 application the appellant indicated he received �100
         per month from relatives. He said he was not working nor was he
         receiving public funds. He indicated there were no housing costs
         but he lived without charge with his family.

     17. 6.2 of the application form requires him to identify each criminal
         conviction starting with the most recent. He only indicated one
         offence back in 2011and at 6.13 of the form refers to 2 arrests.
         The application points out that if an applicant fails to answer the
         questions early and accurately application may be refused and false
         information could result in prosecution. Whilst the form indicates
         the respondent carries out checks this does not absolve an
         applicant from failing to declare.

     18. The refusal letter states that the appellant has provided no
         evidence that his family and friends in Serbia would not be able to
         assist him on return. This would appear to be a general assumption
         that he has friends and family there. I cannot see any other
         reference in the papers.

     19. The appellant's statement refers to his brother Didi who had been
         granted discretionary leave. He indicated brother is married and
         has children and has moved out of the family home. He claims not to
         know their whereabouts. He refers to his mother giving him between
         �10 and �20 per week. He states he has no family in Serbia.

     20. I have checked the file and cannot see any reference to family in
         Serbia in either the correspondence or the appellant's bundle or in
         the record of proceedings. It would appear that the judge took this
         from the refusal letter which appears to have been based upon an
         assumption.

     21. I have considered the decision in the round. The judge has
         evaluated the points for and against the appellant. The decision
         indicates the judge appreciates the appeal is limited to free
         standing human rights consideration although article 8 is first
         considered through the prism of the immigration rules. The
         principal difficulty the appellant faced was his suitability as
         reflected in his numerous convictions. The reference to family
         support in Serbia was only one of a number of factors referred to.
         It would appear to be a general comment and I do not find it
         fundamental to the decision outcome. Regard was had to the factors
         in section 117 B again with pluses and minus factors noted. I find
         this is a structured and well-balanced decision. It is my
         conclusion therefore that no material error of law has been
         established.



Decision.

No material error of law has been demonstrated in the decision of First-
tier Tribunal Judge E Young-Harry. Consequently, that decision, dismissing
the appeal shall stand.
