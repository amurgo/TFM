Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr M Ume-E-Ezeoke, instructed by Nathan Aaron
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Bukola Rukayat Adeyemo, date  of  birth  25.2.89,  is  a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Russell promulgated 17.12.14, dismissing his appeal  against  the
    decisions of the Secretary of State to refuse his  application  for  an
    EEA Residence Card as confirmation of a right  to  reside  in  the  UK,
    pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 17.12.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davies  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.2.15, noting  that  as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  mistakenly
    referred to Ghana throughout the decision  it  was  arguable  that  the
    judge had not applied his mind to the issues in the appeal.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 17.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find that there was no error of law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Russell should be set aside.

 6. It is true that Judge Russell mistakenly referred to the  appellant  as
    being a citizen of Ghana, when she is Nigerian. However, I am satisfied
    that there is no error of substance in the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which would require it to be set aside and remade. The grounds
    make great play of the mistaken replacement of Nigeria  with  Ghana  in
    the decision, but do not demonstrate that the  decision  was  wrong  in
    principle. The outcome of the appeal would be the same  if  Ghana  were
    replaced by Nigeria.

 7. The refusal decision explained why the customary marriage did not  meet
    the requirements of Nigerian law. The grounds in this regard are merely
    a disagreement with that view, adopted and applied  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.

 8. Even if the marriage is valid in Nigeria,  pursuant  to  Kareem  (Proxy
    marriages - EU law) [2014] UKUT  00024  (IAC),  the  appellant  has  to
    demonstrate that such a marriage is valid by the law of  Portugal,  the
    country  of  the  EEA  sponsor's  citizenship.  No  such  evidence  was
    produced. This issue  is  not  addressed  at  all  in  the  grounds  of
    application  for  permission  to  appeal.  In  the  circumstances,  the
    application could not succeed  under  regulations  7  and  17,  as  the
    appellant failed to demonstrate that she is  a  family  member  of  the
    sponsor, having failed to demonstrate that the marriage of  7.10.13  is
    valid. The appellant's representative accepted that the appellant could
    not meet the evidential requirement to prove the marriage is  valid  in
    Portugal.

 9. The refusal decision and the First-tier Tribunal  also  considered  the
    alternative qualification under regulation 8(5), on the  basis  of  the
    appellant being the an extended family members as the unmarried partner
    of an EEA citizen exercising Treaty rights in the UK. This requires the
    appellant to demonstrate that she is in a durable relationship with the
    EEA national sponsor. As the refusal decision made clear, the Secretary
    of State would expect the appellant to demonstrate that they  had  been
    living together for at least two years. As Judge Russell noted at �9 of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, there  was  remarkably  little
    evidence that the appellant is in such a durable relationship.  At  �10
    the judge  noted  that  the  witness  statements  say  nothing  of  the
    substance or length of the relation. I accept  that  they  both  insist
    that they live together and that the marriage is  subsisting  but  that
    self-serving evidence carries little probative weight in the absence of
    supporting evidence. At �11 the judge found  no  other  evidence  of  a
    relationship, and at  �12  found  an  absence  of  cogent  evidence  of
    cohabitation. I was referred to the Lloyds Bank statement,  which  does
    not show the appellant's name. Apparently the appellant sent  into  the
    Tribunal late a photocopy of a tenancy agreement showing both names  at
    the address they claim to live at. This was not  received  until  after
    the hearing at which the judge refused to admit  any  further  evidence
    from either side. The tenancy agreement, even if  accepted  had  to  be
    considered  in  the  round  with  the  remarkable  lack  of  supporting
    evidence. The appellant asked for the  appeal  to  be  decided  on  the
    papers and thus there  was  no  oral  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on these  issues.  Frankly,  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    evidence  of  a  durable  relationship  is  unassailable  and  entirely
    justified by cogent reasons.

10. The judge did not address article 8, which was raised in the grounds of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, but given the findings already  made
    that the appellant had both  failed  to  prove  that  she  was  validly
    married and that she  was  in  a  durable  relationship  with  the  EEA
    sponsor, it is inevitable that any article 8 proportionality assessment
    would have found the decision entirely proportionate. The appellant has
    not been asked to leave the UK and the refusal decision explained  that
    if she wanted to make a family life or private life claim she should do
    so on the specified form and for which a separate fee is payable. It is
    entirely open to the appellant to make a  further  application,  taking
    care  to  address  the  legal  and  evidential  requirements.  In   the
    circumstances, even if the First-tier Tribunal had considered article 8
    either under the Rule or outside them, it is inevitable that the appeal
    would still have been dismissed on all grounds.

11. In the circumstances, I find no error of law  in  the  finding  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal that the appellant failed

Conclusions:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
