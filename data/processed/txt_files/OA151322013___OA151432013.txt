For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Rastogi in which she dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellants,
    citizens of Nepal, against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant
    leave to enter as the dependent spouse and child of the  Sponsor  Sijan
    Amatya.

 2. The applications under appeal were made on 10 April 2013 and refused by
    reference to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  (HC395)  on  1  July
    2013.  The Appellants exercised their right of appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal.  This is the appeal which came  before  Judge  Rastogi  on  5
    September 2014 and was dismissed. The Appellants applied for permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  The application was refused by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Chambers on 6 January 2015 but on  renewal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Archer on  11
    May 2015 in the following terms

         "The judge stated at paragraphs 39-41  of  the  decision  that  the
         respondent gave no substantive consideration to the documents which
         were provided. I find that it is arguable that those findings  were
         sufficient to allow the appeals. That is an arguable material error
         of law. The judge  embarked  upon  an  analysis  of  the  financial
         documents at paragraphs 42-53 and concluded that the earnings  were
         insufficient to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.  I  find  it
         arguable that the judge miscalculated the relevant  gross  earnings
         of the sponsor and therefore there is a further  arguable  material
         error of law.

         The Article 8 findings at  paragraphs  59-62  are  both  brief  and
         wholly  contingent  upon  the  previous  findings  in  relation  to
         earnings."

Background

 3. The background  to  the  appeal  is  detailed  above.  The  facts,  not
    challenged,  are  that  the  Appellants  are  Nepalese  nationals  born
    respectively on 22 September 1977 and 4 May 1996. They are the wife and
    daughter of the Sponsor. Their application to join him  in  the  United
    Kingdom  was  refused  on  relationship,  English  language  test   and
    maintenance grounds. The First-tier Tribunal found  in  favour  of  the
    Appellants in respect of the first two grounds and so the  only  matter
    that concerns this appeal is maintenance. In this  respect  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge found (at paragraph 53 of her decision) that during
    the relevant period the Sponsor earned a  gross  income  of  �14,238.35
    substantially below the sum of �22,400.00 required  and  dismissed  the
    appeal.

Submissions

 4. At the hearing before me Mr Richards represented the Respondent and  Ms
    Hassan  represented  the  Appellants.  Neither  submitted  a   skeleton
    argument or any further documents. The Respondent submitted a  rule  24
    response opposing the appeal.

 5. Before hearing submissions I asked both representatives for  assistance
    in  reconciling  the  figures  contained  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination. I will refer to these figures further below. Neither was
    able to begin to explain how the figures could be reconciled.

 6. I said that the very fact that  neither  I  nor  either  representative
    could understand how the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  had  been
    reached must of itself demonstrate that it contained a clear  error  of
    law and that the decision must be set aside and remade. I  reserved  my
    written reasons.

Error of law

 7. The only live issue in this appeal is whether  the  Appellants  can  be
    maintained in the United Kingdom in accordance with the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules. The maintenance  requirement  is  an  income  of
    �22,400 per annum. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  shows
    that the Judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor  and  considered  a
    quantity of  documentary  evidence  including  that  contained  in  the
    Respondent's bundle,  the  Appellant's  bundle  and  further  documents
    handed in on the Appellant's behalf at the hearing (see paragraph  16).
    The Judge heard submissions from both parties' representatives.

 8. The Judge's finding of fact concerning the financial requirement  start
    at paragraph 32. The Judge finds that the Sponsor  has  had  employment
    with three businesses during the relevant  period  (paragraph  42)  and
    records his earnings from those employments at paragraphs  47,  48  and
    52. However in combining those earnings there are confusing and  indeed
    irreconcilable findings. At paragraph 49 the  Judge  says  that  he  is
    satisfied that, at the date of the application, the Sponsor was earning
    �23,647 per annum. At paragraph 53 the Judge finds that  combining  the
    total sums  earned  from  the  three  employments  the  Sponsor  earned
    �14,238.35 in the twelve month prior to the date of application.  There
    is no breakdown of how  either  figure  is  calculated  or  indeed  any
    explanation  for  these  two  apparently  contradictory  findings.  The
    situation becomes even more confused as  when  the  earnings  from  the
    three employments (recorded at paragraphs 47, 48 and 52 and  which  the
    Judge  did  not  total)  are  added  together  the  total  reached   is
    �25,338.35.

 9. It is a fundamental requirement for the parties to an appeal to be able
    to understand why the appeal was won or  lost.  In  this  case  neither
    representative was able to shed any light upon how the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal was reached. As I have said above  that  of  itself
    demonstrates a manifest error of law. The error  is  an  inadequacy  of
    reasoning.

10. Both representatives agreed that in  accordance  with  the  President's
    direction the only satisfactory course with an error of law of  such  a
    fundamental nature being found and where the evidence of the  Sponsor's
    income at the time of the decision would need to be assessed afresh was
    to remit for hearing de novo by the First-tier Tribunal.

Summary

11. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law. I allow the Appellant's appeal and I  set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

12. In accordance with the President's direction this appeal is remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo.
