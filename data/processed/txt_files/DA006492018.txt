                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.   The appellant is a citizen of Slovakia born in 1979. He arrived in
       the UK in March 1996 with his parents and siblings, and was included
       as a dependent on his father's asylum claim. This asylum  claim  did
       not succeed,  but  his  mother's  claim  (on  which  he  was  not  a
       dependent) was successful and his father remained  as  his  mother's
       dependent. In March 2001 he applied  to  remain  as  a  spouse,  the
       application was rejected but  the  application  was  resubmitted  in
       February 2002 and  he  was  granted  exceptional  leave  to  remain.
       Slovakia joined the EU on 1st May 2004. In 2004 he  and  his  family
       were refused indefinite leave to remain under the family  indefinite
       leave to remain exercise.

    2.   In May 2016 the appellant was convicted  in  the  Crown  Court  of
       conspiracy to traffic persons into the UK for exploitation.  He  was
       sentenced to 6 years imprisonment and given a 10  year  slavery  and
       trafficking prevention order. On 8th July 2016 he  was  served  with
       notice of intention to deport.  He  appeals  under  the  Immigration
       (EEA) regulations 2016 against a  decision  to  make  a  deportation
       order. His appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Bart-
       Stewart in a determination promulgated on the 8th October 2019.

    3.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Smith  on
       27th November 2019 on the basis that it was arguable that the First-
       tier judge had erred in law in failing to recognise the  high  level
       of risk which applies to  meet  the  imperative  grounds  threshold,
       although she observed that it is possible that this  threshold  does
       not apply and that the error is therefore not material.

    4.   As a preliminary issue we asked Mr Chakmakjain to explain  why  an
       anonymity order had been made by the First-tier Tribunal as  it  did
       not  appear  that  there  was  any  risk  of  serious  harm  if  the
       appellant's name appeared on our  decision  in  the  usual  way.  Mr
       Chakmakjain did not argue that such an order was needed, although he
       pointed out that it was possible that the original  order  was  made
       because the appellant has children and/or  because  his  mother  was
       granted asylum  with  his  father  (but  not  the  appellant)  as  a
       dependent in 2002 prior to Slovakia being admitted to  the  European
       Union. There was no evidence before us of any family  member  having
       an on-going well founded fear  of  persecution.  The  names  of  the
       appellant's family members are all anonymised in this  decision  and
       there are no details of their historic asylum claims. The  appellant
       does not live with his youngest child who remains a minor  but  only
       with his current partner and oldest child who is now  an  adult.  No
       reasons were given why  anonymity  was  required  to  protect  these
       children. We conclude, applying the  principles  set  out  in  Smith
       (appealable decisions;  PTA  requirements;  anonymity)  [2019]  UKUT
       00216 (IAC) that  in  the  interests  of  open  justice  it  is  not
       appropriate to anonymise the appellant particularly given this is  a
       deportation  appeal  resulting   from   the   appellant's   criminal
       conviction.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5.   In summary the appellant argues as follows.  Firstly,  the  First-
       tier Tribunal found that the appellant could only be  expelled  from
       the UK on imperative grounds of public security, paragraph 72 of the
       decision, the  Secretary  of  State  having  conceded  that  he  had
       permanent  residence.  The  test  for  imperative  grounds  requires
       evidence of a compelling risk to public security, with a threat of a
       particularly high degree of seriousness. It is  argued  that  whilst
       there are adverse findings in the decision regarding the appellant's
       offending there is no proper explanation as to how this test is met.
        Secondly it is argued that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
       is not lawful as it fails to show that the decision is justified  on
       the basis of the  personal  conduct  of  the  appellant  showing  he
       represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to  a
       fundamental interest of society; and thirdly it is argued  that  the
       deportation of  the  appellant  is  disproportionate  and  therefore
       unlawful. With respect to the examination of proportionality  it  is
       said that there is a wholesale and wrong application of the domestic
       deportation framework at Part 5A of the 2002 Act and  a  failure  to
       consider material evidence going to discrimination and harassment of
       Roma in Slovakia; the findings of the criminal  court;  and  medical
       evidence relating  to  the  appellant.  Within  the  proportionality
       consideration it is also argued that there was a failure to consider
       the best interests of the children as a primary consideration.

    6.   In summary the respondent  argues  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       fully appreciated the high threshold set by the  imperative  grounds
       test and found that  this  was  met  by  the  circumstances  of  the
       appellant's  offending.  Mr  Bramble  argued  that  the   First-tier
       Tribunal had directed itself properly by setting out the  test  from
       VP (Italy) v SSHD [2010]  EWCA  Civ  806  at  paragraph  96  of  the
       decision. At paragraph 97 the First-tier Tribunal found  that  there
       was serial and targeted trafficking criminality  over  a  period  of
       time, which put the Slovakian community in the UK at risk.

    7.   Secondly, the risk the appellant poses for the future is submitted
       to be properly reasoned with reference to the sentencing remarks and
       the content of the OASys report: the  appellant  had  been  involved
       with people trafficking; had  failed  to  accept  his  guilt,  lacks
       insight into his offending and expressed no remorse to his  victims;
       he behaved in a threatening way in prison  and  after  his  release.
       There are  argued  therefore  to  be  full  and  sufficient  reasons
       supporting the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  poses  a  genuine,
       present and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of
       society as set out at paragraphs 74 to 98 of the  decision,  despite
       the ultimate conclusion of the OASys report that the appellant posed
       a low risk of reoffending.

    8.   It is also said by the respondent that it  is  not  arguable  that
       proportionality was not dealt with properly, particularly as Part 5A
       of the 2002 Act was  simply  used  as  a  guide  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge. It was not arguable that material evidence  was  not
       taken into account as the appellant's fear of  discrimination  as  a
       member of the Roma community is dealt with at paragraph 100  of  the
       decision. There are also findings with respect  to  the  appellant's
       children and their mothers being able to care  for  them  and  their
       best interests at paragraph 110. Further there is reference  to  the
       sentencing remarks and consideration  of  the  medical  evidence  at
       paragraph 101 of the decision.

    9.   Mr Bramble confirmed that it was not challenged by the  respondent
       that the appellant was entitled to imperative grounds protection.

   10. At the end of the submissions we informed the parties that we  found
       that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law on all three  grounds.
       We did not give an oral judgement but indicated that we  found  that
       the decision did not properly apply the relevant legal tests and was
       not sufficiently clearly reasoned on these key issues.  We  set  out
       our reasoning for our decision that the First-tier Tribunal erred in
       law in writing below.

   11. We then moved on to ask for submissions on remaking the  appeal.  Mr
       Bramble indicated that he had no further  submissions  to  make  and
       simply relied upon the skeleton argument submitted for the Secretary
       of State and his submissions with respect to the error  of  law.  We
       heard submissions from Mr Chakmakjain, and reserved our decision  on
       remaking at the end of those submissions.

Submissions - Remaking

   12. Mr  Chakmakjain  submitted  that  the  appellant's  offence,  whilst
       obviously serious, did not reach the high threshold  for  showing  a
       compelling risk to public security, with a threat of a  particularly
       high degree of seriousness.

   13. Mr Chakmakjain argued that the OASys conclusion that  the  appellant
       posed only a low risk of reoffending was  correct.  This  conclusion
       was  based  on  the  appellant's  relative  (in   the   context   of
       criminality) old age; his lack of any previous convictions or issues
       with the police; and also reflected the fact that a number  of  risk
       factors for reoffending considered by the report  such  as  problems
       with accommodation, drugs and alcohol did not apply to him. This was
       the appellant's only criminal conviction and he has resided  in  the
       UK for 23 years; and he had now been in the  community  again  since
       June 2019 and had not been charged with or convicted of any  further
       offences. The public is further protected as the appellant would not
       be able to commit further trafficking offences due  to  the  slavery
       and trafficking prevention order as this would  not  permit  him  to
       hold documents  which  might  enable  him  to  exploit  others.  The
       appellant would also be deterred from  committing  further  offences
       due to the powerful adverse effects  of  imprisonment  on  him,  his
       partner and his son. It was of particular  note  that  his  time  in
       prison led him to commit an act of self-harm, which  indicates  that
       he would be very significantly deterred from  doing  anything  which
       might lead to his being imprisoned again as clearly  the  experience
       had been intolerable. Mr Chakmakjain concluded that the Secretary of
       State could not show that there was therefore a genuine, present and
       sufficiently serious threat to a  fundamental  interest  of  society
       posed by the appellant.

   14.  Finally  Mr  Chakmakjain  argued  that   the   decision   was   not
       proportionate for the following  reasons:  that  the  appellant  had
       lived in the UK for 23 years without returning  to  Slovakia  having
       arrived as a 16 year old child; he arrived in the UK as a  dependent
       on his father's asylum claim and although the application and appeal
       did not succeed it was found by the First-tier Tribunal that he  had
       difficulties connected with this Roma ethnicity  in  Slovakia;  that
       the appellant has no ties with Slovakia; the  European  Roma  Rights
       Report of 2017 outlines that there continues to be discrimination in
       Slovakia against Roma  people  by  the  police,  housing,  education
       departments and in relation to access to drinking water so it  would
       be very  difficult  for  the  appellant  to  reintegrate  into  that
       society; his 18 year old son J is a British citizen and  lives  with
       the appellant and the appellant's partner, and  should  be  seen  as
       continuing to be seen a  child  of  his  family  and  could  not  be
       expected to accompany the appellant as he  has  close  relationships
       with his younger brother, K (who is a minor),  and  his  mother  who
       live together in the UK  with  her  new  partner;  and  the  medical
       evidence from Medway Talking Therapies indicates that the  appellant
       has severe depression and anxiety and is waiting  for  further  help
       for these conditions, as well as having a number of physical  health
       conditions as detailed in the GP notes.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   15. The test for whether  an  appellant  may  lawfully  be  deported  on
       imperative grounds of public policy or security was commented on  by
       the Court of Appeal in Staszewski v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1245  at
       paragraphs 22 and 23 as follows: "Ms Chan  did,  however,  draw  our
       attention to the decision  in  I  v  Oberb�rgermeisterin  der  Stadt
       Remscheid, in which the claimant  had  been  convicted  of  multiple
       offences of sexual abuse, sexual coercion and rape of a 14 year  old
       girl in respect  of  which  he  had  been  sentenced  to  7�  years'
       imprisonment. The CJEU was asked to decide  whether  the  expression
       "imperative grounds of public security"  referred  only  to  conduct
       which threatened the security of the state  itself,  its  population
       and the survival of its institutions or was  broader  in  scope.  In
       giving its judgment the court emphasised that member  states  retain
       the freedom to determine  the  requirements  of  public  policy  and
       public security in accordance with their national  needs,  but  that
       the  requirements  of  the  Directive  must  still  be   interpreted
       strictly. Criminal offences which constitute a particularly  serious
       threat to one of the fundamental interests of society or which  pose
       a direct threat to the calm and physical security of the  population
       may fall  within  the  concept  of  "imperative  grounds  of  public
       security", as long  as  the  manner  in  which  such  offences  were
       committed discloses "particularly serious characteristics".

   16.  The  European  Court  of  Justice  held  in  Tsakouridis  (European
       Citizenship) [2010] EUECJ C-145/09 [2011] 2 C.M.L.R. 11  [2013]  All
       E.R. at paragraph 41: "The concept of 'imperative grounds of  public
       security' presupposes not only the existence of a threat  to  public
       security, but also that such a threat  is  of  a  particularly  high
       degree of seriousness, as is reflected  by  the  use  of  the  words
       'imperative reasons." At paragraphs 43 -45 it is observed  that  the
       Court also found  that   public  security  includes  both  a  Member
       State's  internal  and  its  external  security;  a  threat  to  the
       functioning of the institutions and essential  public  services  and
       the survival of the population, as well as the  risk  of  a  serious
       disturbance to foreign  relations  or  to  peaceful  coexistence  of
       nations, or a risk to military interests; and  possibly  "the  fight
       against crime in connection with dealing in narcotics as part of  an
       organised group" particularly as "trafficking in narcotics  as  part
       of an organised group could reach a level of  intensity  that  might
       directly threaten the calm and physical security of  the  population
       as a whole or a large part of it". It is clear however that simply a
       long prison sentence would not suffice to  show  imperative  grounds
       were made out.

   17. In the decision in VP (Italy) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 806 the   Court
       of Appeal endorsed what was said in the Court of Appeal case  of  LG
       (Italy)  as follows: "we cannot accept the elevation of offences  to
       'imperative grounds' purely on the basis of a custodial sentence  of
       five years or more being imposed. As it was said by Carnwath  LJ  in
       LG ... there is no indication why the severity  of  the  offence  in
       itself is enough to make the removal 'imperative' in  the  interests
       of public security. Such an offence may be the  starting  point  for
       consideration, but there must be something more, in scale  or  kind,
       to justify the conclusion that the individual poses 'a  particularly
       serious risk to the safety  of  the  public  or  a  section  of  the
       public'. Terrorism offences or  threats  to  national  security  are
       obvious examples, but not exclusive. Serial or targeted  criminality
       of a sufficiently serious kind may  also  meet  the  test.  However,
       there needs to be some threat to the public or a  definable  section
       of the public sufficiently serious to  make  expulsion  'imperative'
       and not merely desirable as a matter of policy, in order  to  ensure
       the necessary differentiation from the second level."

   18. We do not find that this test has been  applied  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal despite citing LG (Italy) at paragraph 96 of the  decision.
       A long custodial sentence of six years was imposed on this appellant
       but there is a failure to identify in paragraph 97 of the  decision,
       the only paragraph that addresses this issue with reference  to  the
       facts of this case, how the appellant's criminality had particularly
       serious characteristics . There is no reasoning  with  reference  to
       the facts of this case why it is found that the criminality here was
       serial,  targeted  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  There  are
       references to the OASys report which indicates  that  the  appellant
       could pose a threat to vulnerable members of the Slovakian community
       and that he had threatened prison staff, but this does  not  address
       the key issue of how the test is  met,  and  must  be  seen  in  the
       context of that report concluding that the risk of reoffending  from
       this appellant is low. We find that there is ultimately a failure to
       reason how the human trafficking in this case could  meet  the  test
       outlined in Tsakouridis  in relation to  drugs  trafficking  because
       there is no explanation as to how this appellant's  criminality  was
       part of "an organised group" and was of "a level of  intensity  that
       might threat the calm and security of the population as a whole or a
       large part of it".

   19. As we find that the First-tier Tribunal had not lawfully shown  that
       there were imperative grounds of public  security  engaged  in  this
       case, it is clear that the decision must be set aside and remade.

   20. We note also however that we find the  reasoning  insufficient  with
       respect to whether  the  appellant  poses  a  genuine,  present  and
       sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental  interest  of  society,
       given, as Tsakouridis notes, the "concept of 'imperative grounds  of
       public security' presupposes not only the existence of a  threat  to
       public security, but also that such a threat is  of  a  particularly
       high degree of seriousness". There was a failure to reason why, even
       if the appellant had little insight into his  offending  or  empathy
       with his victims and had on occasion behaved badly  in  prison  this
       would mean there was this level of risk he  would  reoffend  with  a
       high  degree  of  seriousness  given  his  age,  lack  of   previous
       convictions, access to accommodation, lack of alcohol and  substance
       abuse, the evidence about the salutary affect of imprisonment on him
       and his family, and particularly given the assessment of OASys  that
       he was a statistically low risk of reoffending.

   21. We also find that despite acknowledging  at  paragraph  107  of  the
       decision that Part 5A of the 2002 Act  does  not  apply  in  an  EEA
       deportation appeal, that the analysis in the  subsequent  paragraphs
       relies upon the framework of those provisions to such an extent that
       it is not sufficiently clear that it has not been actually  employed
       in determining the  appeal  contrary  to  the  decision  in   Badewa
       (ss.117A-D and EEA Regulations)  [2015]  UKUT  00329.  Further  when
       considering the proportionality of the appellant's removal there  is
       a failure to consider material evidence as there is no reference  to
       the current country of  origin  materials  regarding  discrimination
       against those of Roma ethnicity, although it is  accepted  that  the
       appellant is part of this ethnic group.

Conclusions - Remaking

   22. The first issue is of course whether interpreting imperative grounds
       strictly, as we must do, the appellant's offending has  particularly
       serious characteristics so as to  qualify  as  a  threat  to  public
       security alongside threats to the security of the state itself,  its
       population and the survival of its institutions. As indicated  above
       in our analysis of the  errors  of  law  we  find  the  guidance  in
       Tsakouridis  with  respect  to  drug  trafficking  most  helpful  in
       indicating that we are looking for something at least on a par  with
       "an organised group" that  "could reach a level  of  intensity  that
       might directly threaten  the  calm  and  physical  security  of  the
       population as a whole or a large part of it". It is  clear  from  LG
       (Italy) that the severity of  the  offence  itself  alone  will  not
       suffice, and there needs to be a threat to the public at large.

   23. The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to traffic persons  within
       the UK for exploitation with his brother as  an  equal  participant,
       but was found not guilty of conspiracy to trafficking  persons  into
       the UK. As set out in the sentencing remarks of  Judge  Statman  the
       appellant received financial gain by preying  on  vulnerable  fellow
       adult members of the Slovakian community who were newly  arrived  in
       the UK through sophisticated, planned exploitation. The victims were
       housed in  miserable  conditions,  made  to  work  long  hours,  not
       properly paid for their work, and subject  to  social  control,  and
       keep in this situation by threats of homelessness  and  unemployment
       if they left and an assertion  that  he,  the  appellant,  was  "the
       boss". Two victims gave evidence in the trial,  but  the  Judge  was
       satisfied that one of these was part of a group of  12  people,  the
       other victim gave evidence that there were up to 70 others under the
       control of the appellant and his  brother  but  the  Judge  was  not
       satisfied this  was  the  case  although  he  did  accept  that  the
       criminality  definitely  extended  beyond  the  two  victims.   From
       material in the OASys report it would appear that  the  exploitation
       of at least one of the victims spanned a period of seven years.

   24. There is no doubt that  the  offending  is  repugnant  and  serious,
       involving the deliberate degrading of fellow human beings via forced
       labour. The offending can also properly be described as serial as it
       went on for a period of about seven years and  in  addition  it  was
       targeted as it was aimed at newly arrived vulnerable adult Slovakian
       citizens. The seriousness of the offending is  reflected  in  the  6
       year sentences that the appellant and his brother received. However,
       on consideration of all of  the  facts,  we  do  not  find  that  is
       sufficiently serious to qualify  as  a  threat  to  public  security
       alongside threats to the state, its institutions and the population.
       We do not find that the operation the appellant and his brother  ran
       was sufficiently expansive to be seen as a threat to  the  calm  and
       physical security of a significant part of the population.  As  such
       we find that the respondent  has  failed  to  show  that  there  are
       imperative  grounds  of  public   security   for   the   appellant's
       deportation, and the appeal must therefore be allowed.

   25. For completeness, and in case we  are  wrong  in  making  the  above
       finding, we go on to consider whether the appellant poses a genuine,
       present and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of
       society. We place reliance on the OASys report and the statements of
       the appellant and his family in considering this issue.

   26. Factors in favour of a finding that the appellant poses  a  risk  of
       future sufficiently serious offending are the  following:  he  lacks
       insight and remorse in relation to  his  offending;  that  he  might
       again be motivated by financial gain; that he might be motivated  by
       the relationship with his brother (although he is currently  working
       in  Germany);  that  he  has  some  problems  with  aggressive   and
       controlling behaviour; and that if he did reoffend there is a medium
       risk of serious harm in the community.

   27. Against such a finding is: that statistically based on his  age  and
       previous convictions/ interactions with the police he is at low risk
       of reoffending of all types; that he has much to lose by reoffending
       as he has a partner and son with whom he lives  and  who  were  both
       detrimentally affected by his previous imprisonment;  the  appellant
       found it very difficult  to  cope  with  imprisonment  and  took  an
       overdose so it was a salutary experience for him;  the appellant has
       no  accommodation  problems  in  the  community;  he  has  a  strong
       commitment to his extensive wider family, including his younger  son
       who lives with his ex-wife, who all live in the UK; he has  no  drug
       or alcohol problems which might drive him to offend;  his  education
       and employment is not linked with a risk of reoffending and  he  has
       acquired  English  qualifications  whilst  in  prison;  he  has   no
       emotional wellbeing or mental health issues linked to his offending;
       and he will be subject to a Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Order
       which will mean  that  he  cannot  possess  a  number  of  documents
       relating to others which would inhibit his ability to  commit  again
       the type of crime of which he has been convicted.

   28. We  conclude  that,  taking  all  the  evidence  into  account,  the
       respondent is not able to show that the appellant poses  a  genuine,
       present and sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of
       society. Whilst the appellant's  lack  of  insight  and  remorse  is
       disturbing he  has  many  factors,  as  listed  above,  which  would
       militate against him reoffending, particularly his close  supportive
       relationships with family and  the  fact  that  he  and  his  family
       suffered greatly from the separation whilst he was in prison,  which
       lead us to conclude that the experience of  prison  will  provide  a
       significant deterrent to him reoffending.  We  ultimately  therefore
       agree with the assessment of the OASys report that he  poses  a  low
       risk of reoffending.

   29. In light of these conclusions we do not need to consider whether the
       appellant's deportation would be proportionate.



          Decision:

   1.     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of
      errors of law.

   2.     We hereby set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3.     We re-make the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  under  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.
