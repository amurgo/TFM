                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M B Hussain, promulgated  on  18th  December  2015,  following  a
    hearing at Richmond on 3rd September 2015.  In the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of Mrs Gurpreet [C], whereupon  the  Secretary
    of State applied for, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of India, and she was born on 15th
    October 1992.  She appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 7th January 2014, refusing her application to come  to  join  her
    British citizen settled spouse, on grounds that she did  not  meet  the
    requirements of E-LTRP1.7.  The appeal had been  listed  for  Wednesday
    25th June 2014.  However, the decision of 7th  January  2014  was  then
    withdrawn at the hearing by  the  Respondent's  legal  representatives.
    Thereafter, however, the same decision was re-served on  the  Appellant
    in effect, by a decision  dated  28th  August  2014.   This  appeal  is
    against the decision of 28th August 2014.

The Secretary of State's Refusal Decision

 3. In the refusal letter of 28th  August  2014,  it  is  stated  that  the
    Appellant was interviewed together with her sponsoring spouse, [RG], in
    Liverpool and that, "there were many discrepancies between your account
    and [RG]'s account" such that, "the Secretary of State is not satisfied
    that your marriage is genuine and subsisting and  that  you  intend  to
    live together permanently as husband and wife".

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge  heard  evidence  that  the  parties  had  met  at  a  Diwali
    celebration, and the Appellant formed the impression that  her  husband
    did not work, but worked with  a  family  on  a  part-time  basis  (see
    paragraph 6).  The Appellant had given evidence that  her  relationship
    initially with her husband was good but it had subsequently got  worse,
    because he started drinking because the Home Office would  not  make  a
    decision to allow the Appellant's application, but the husband had  now
    given up drinking and  the  relationship  was  now  much  better.   Her
    husband also had suffered from a stroke and that, because his hand  was
    weak, she did his ironing,  washing  and  reminding  him  to  take  his
    medicine.  There had been domestic violence in the family  between  the
    couple and the Appellant was asked how the domestic violence issue  had
    been resolved and  she  had  said  that  her  husband's  brother-in-law
    mediated and solved the problem (paragraph 13).

 5. The judge went on to conclude that, despite the Appellant's application
    having been refused twice, and despite it coming before the Tribunal on
    two  occasions,  the  Respondent's  refusal  letter  appeared   to   be
    incomplete.  The judge held that, "the issue seems to  be  whether  the
    Appellant is in a genuine and  subsisting  marriage."   The  Respondent
    expresses doubt as to its genuineness based on what  was  said  by  the
    Appellant and her husband at the interview (paragraph 27).   The  judge
    noted how at the hearing on 25th June 2014 the refusal was withdrawn to
    reconsider the Appellant's application but that, "what  is  unclear  is
    what issues the  Respondent  reconsidered  and  why  she  withdrew  the
    earlier decision" (paragraph 28).  The judge heard  argument  that  the
    refusal letter currently before  the  Tribunal  "is  identical  to  the
    refusal letter previously" but the Tribunal was not in any position  to
    verify this (paragraph 29).  There had been a  short  determination  by
    Judge Davey of the First-tier Tribunal  dated  9th  June  2014  and  at
    paragraph 2 the judge had noted that the refusal was based on  outcomes
    of interviews between  the  Appellant  and  her  husband  and  that  at
    paragraph 3 it was noted that despite requests to produce the interview
    records none had been produced.  Judge Davey then asked the  Presenting
    Officer whether an adjournment may assist in the interview notes  being
    produced and that, "having taken instructions, the  Presenting  Officer
    then withdrew the Respondent's decision" (paragraph  31).   Yet,  Judge
    Hussain expressed exasperation at the hearing by  noting  that  despite
    the Appellant's application having been refused a second time, "I  note
    that the Respondent has not  served  those  interview  notes  in  full"
    (paragraph 32).  The judge concluded that, "it is wholly unsatisfactory
    and unfair to the Appellant to rely on parts of the interview when  the
    other parts are missing.  Without all of the questions and answers,  it
    is not proper to form a view as to the nature of  the  questions  asked
    and the answers  given"  (paragraph  33).   The  judge  took  the  firm
    position that if the Respondent could not be diligent enough to produce
    full interview notes or a full refusal letter, "then she has to contend
    with what the Tribunal has. What the Tribunal has, as  stated  earlier,
    are incomplete interview notes" (paragraph 34).  The judge went  on  to
    exclude the interview notes  produced  for  consideration.   (Paragraph
    35).

 6. The judge did, nevertheless, hold that the burden of proof rested  upon
    the Appellant to show that she was in a genuine and subsisting marriage
    with [RG] (paragraph 36).  In the  circumstances,  the  judge  observed
    that given that the Tribunal had the benefit of the Appellant's bundle,
    "which does contain documentary  evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband sharing a  single  accommodation"  and  that  given  that  "the
    Tribunal also had the opportunity of  hearing  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband give evidence," the position was that, "they  appear  to  agree
    overwhelmingly in relation to issues concerning  their  personal  life"
    (paragraph 37).  The judge observed that there was documentary evidence
    to suggest that the Appellant had in the  beginning  of  2015  received
    support in respect of the domestic violence meted upon her and  in  the
    witness statement, the Appellant has said that, "any difficulties  with
    her husband have now been overcome."  She did not elaborate on  whether
    the domestic violence in question "was actual violence" (paragraph 38).
     In the circumstances, the judge had no difficulty in concluding  that,
    "they appear to be together as a couple" (paragraph 39).  He  concluded
    that, "the Appellant and her husband  are  in  a  genuine  relationship
    which is subsisting" (paragraph 40).

 7. The appeal is allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge had erred  in  law  for
    two essential reasons.  First, that he had failed to adequately  reason
    his decision to allow the appeal.  Second, that he was mistakenly under
    the impression that the only issue was whether or not the  relationship
    between the Sponsor and the Appellant was a genuine and subsisting one.
     This was not so because the Respondent had in the refusal  letter  had
    clearly raised the  failure  to  meet  the  financial  requirements  in
    Appendix FM-FMSE and the question of "insurmountable  obstacles"  under
    EX.1 was also one to be considered.  On 19th May 2016,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal refused the application for permission to appeal on the  basis
    that what was now being alleged  in  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  "is  not
    arguable" because the Respondent's decision letter  dated  28th  August
    2014, "did not specifically raise this  issue".   The  reason  for  the
    Respondent's refusal was that the Respondent was not satisfied that the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting and  that  they  intended  to  live
    together permanently as husband and wife.  The judge decided the issues
    raised in the refusal decision" (see paragraph 2).   However,  on  13th
    June 2016, the Upper Tribunal gave permission to appeal  on  the  basis
    that both Judge Hussain, and the judge refusing permission below in the
    First-tier Tribunal, had regard only to the incomplete decision  letter
    that appears in the Tribunal bundle where (at page 4) it deals with the
    issue of maintenance, which is missing.  However, the full letter is on
    the Tribunal file  and  clearly  does  refer  to  the  failure  of  the
    Appellant to meet the maintenance requirements of E-LTRP.3.1, where the
    Sponsor had a gross income of only �5,880.  Arguably,  therefore  there
    was an error which impacted on the eventual outcome of the  appeal  and
    so permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 15th July 2016, Mr  Whitwell,  appeared  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State.   He  submitted  that  the
    issue of the Appellant being unable to  meet  the  financial  threshold
    requirement of the  Rules  had  been  a  live  issue  throughout  these
    proceedings.

10. First, if one looks at the application made on 19th August 2013,  there
    is a question as  to  whether  the  person  in  question  is  receiving
    disability allowance.  The answer given is that he is not.  Given  this
    was the case, the Appellant had to show  that  her  sponsoring  husband
    could show earnings of �18,600.

11. Second, in the second refusal letter it is made quite clear that, "your
    application also falls to be refused under the Rules because you do not
    meet the income threshold requirement  under  Appendix  FM  and/or  the
    related evidential requirement under Appendix FM-SE" (see page 4 of 7).
     It is then explained how the Appellant had submitted a signed  tenancy
    agreement for the rental property showing  a  gross  annual  income  of
    �5,880.  What was required was a gross annual income  of  �18,600.   It
    was accepted that in his witness  statement  (at  pages  5  to  6)  the
    Sponsor had said that he was in receipt of disability allowance and  so
    did not have to satisfy the financial requirements.

12. Third, the full refusal letter of 28th August was in the possession  of
    the Upper Tribunal when it granted permission and this makes  it  quite
    clear that the financial threshold requirement was a live issue  before
    the judge.

13. Fourth, if this Tribunal could  accordingly  conclude  that  the  judge
    below had erred in law, it should not in the instant  case  proceed  to
    remake the decision without calling further  evidence.   What  must  be
    done is that the proceedings must be adjourned to have further evidence
    filed.  This is because paragraph 12 of Appendix FM-SE makes  it  clear
    that letter  from  the  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  should  be
    considered and the Appellant should be able to demonstrate that  monies
    being provided by the state actually go into the bank  account  of  the
    Sponsor.  It does not stop there.  This is because it is  necessary  to
    know what the Appellant's housing costs are and what the outgoings  are
    before it can be decided that one will not be charging public funds.

14. For his part, Mr Tabori submitted that this appeal raised a very  short
    and narrow point and that so considered, there simply was no  error  in
    the judge's determination.  A prima facie failure to make a finding  on
    an issue before the Tribunal, did not make the decision of the Tribunal
    materially flawed for that reason alone.  The question is  whether  the
    finding would have made a difference.  There  has  to  be  a  realistic
    possibility of this.  In this respect Mr Tabori relied upon  the  Court
    of Appeal decision in Amid A v  Kirklees  Metropolitan  Council  [2001]
    EWCA Civ 582.

15. Second, the reason why no material difference would have been  made  to
    the eventual outcome is that [RG], the Sponsor, had in this  case  been
    receiving disability allowance since 2010.  That was a long  time  ago.
    The provisions make it quite clear at E-ECT.3.3 that  the  requirements
    in  relation  to  financial  earnings  did  not  apply  to  someone  on
    disability allowance.

16. Third, there was evidence to this effect before Judge  Hussain  and  it
    was attached at page 29 of the bundle where the statement at  paragraph
    5 made it quite clear that the Sponsor held himself not to be bound  by
    the financial threshold requirement of �18,600  because  of  his  long-
    standing disability.  For good measure, the  Sponsor  also  added  that
    although he did not have to meet the  requirement  of  �18,600  he  had
    always been able to satisfy it.

17. Fourth, a letter of 3rd July 2015  from  the  Department  of  Work  and
    Pensions to [RG] referred to the "evidence of entitlement to disability
    living allowance".

18. Finally, even now E-ECT.3.1 stipulated  an  additional  requirement  of
    "specified evidence".  The Sponsor in this case was exempt from such  a
    requirement.   There  was  therefore  "not  even  a  scintilla   of   a
    possibility that if this case were to be remitted back  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal there would be a different result" submitted Mr Tabori.

19. Mr Tabori went on to say that it did not end there  because  looked  at
    from other perspectives the Appellant would still have succeeded.

20. First, even now the Sponsor was in receipt of  disability  benefit  the
    fact was that he was able  to  earn  and  meet  the  �18,600  financial
    threshold and this evidence was before the judge.  At page  77  of  the
    Appellant's bundle there was detail of the net pay of the  Sponsor  and
    this showed him earning �1,550 per month which was above the threshold.



21. Second, the judge did not expressly refer to this because there was  an
    incomplete refusal letter before him.  He did not  have  the  financial
    requirement issue raised or flagged up in  the  proper  manner.   Since
    there was no Home Office Presenting Officer to point out the issues  at
    stake, the judge naturally proceeded to determine the issues as he  saw
    them arise before him.  Materiality was essential  to  public  law  and
    here it would have made no difference in any event, even if the  issues
    had been flagged up by a Home Office Presenting Officer in  attendance,
    because the judge had the evidence there  before  him  and  the  result
    would not have been any different.  It would now be a complete waste of
    time and resources to refer the matter back to the First-tier  Tribunal
    for a decision on something which was going to simply end up confirming
    a decision in the Appellant's favour in any event.

22. Finally, and for the sake of completion, although  this  had  not  been
    raised by Mr Whitwell at this hearing, the grounds by the Secretary  of
    State do refer to there being  no  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  the
    Appellant's return back to India.  However, this  could  not  be  right
    because if the judge had found there to be  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship between the Appellant  and  her  husband,  [RG],  then  of
    necessity there had to be in existence "insurmountable obstacles to the
    Appellant leaving her  disabled  husband  behind  and  going  to  India
    herself".  Once  again,  the  issue  was  not  one  that  went  to  the
    materiality of the judge's decision.

23. In reply, Mr Whitwell emphasised that it was not a fact that there  was
    an incomplete  refusal  letter  before  the  judge  because  the  Upper
    Tribunal had a complete version and there had been  a  failure  by  the
    judge to deal with the  issues  arising  in  the  refusal  letter.   Mr
    Whitwell said that he would urge caution in accepting  the  Appellant's
    version at face value.

Decision on Error of Law

24. The Upper Tribunal may (but need not) set aside  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (see Section 12(2)(a)).  I conclude  that  this  is
    the situation that appertains here.

25. First, it is the case that Judge Hussain found the Respondent's refusal
    letter to  be  incomplete,  "despite  this  matter  coming  before  the
    Tribunal on two occasions" (paragraph 27).

26. Second, it is also the case that both Judge  Hussain  and  Judge  Davey
    found there to be a failure to disclose the full interview  notes  upon
    which the refusal was based.

27. Third, the Respondent did not field a Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    and therefore the position was as it presented itself before the judge,
    with an incomplete refusal letter and incomplete interview notes.

28. Fourth and most importantly, however, insofar as there was an issue  in
    relation to the financial  circumstances  of  the  Sponsor,  there  was
    evidence before the judge, which was uncontested given the  absence  of
    the Presenting Officer, and difficult to challenge given the format  in
    which it was  presented.   This  included  the  Sponsor's  own  witness
    statement where he  states  that,  "I  am  not  required  to  meet  the
    financial requirements because I am in  receipt  of  disability  living
    allowance.  I exhibit herewith letter from DWP in confirmation  of  the
    same [RG -1].  I  also  attach  herewith  my  bank  statements  showing
    receipt of funds from DWP [RG - 2]" which appears at paragraph 5 of the
    witness statement.  It is clear from this that insofar as  the  refusal
    letter does refer to a requirement that the Appellant had to satisfy in
    relation to the Sponsor's financial situation, the Sponsor  was  exempt
    from this because he was in receipt  of  disability  living  allowance.
    This was therefore, a non-issue.  If it would have been raised it could
    only have gone one way, and  that  was  in  favour  of  the  Appellant.
    However, to make the matter even more clear-cut, the Sponsor states  at
    paragraph 6 of his witness  statement  that,  "even  though  I  am  not
    required to meet the financial requirements,  but  I  always  meet  the
    requirement of �18,600" (sic).   There  is  also  at  page  32  of  the
    Appellant's bundle a letter from the Department of  Work  and  Pensions
    addressed to the Sponsor  referring  to  "evidence  of  entitlement  to
    disability living allowance", which is dated 30th July 2015.  The  fact
    that the Sponsor is in receipt of disability living  allowance  is  not
    new.  He has been in receipt of this since 2010.  Yet, despite this, he
    has also worked to ensure that he  can  meet  the  financial  threshold
    requirement of �18,6000.  There is no requirement to provide "specified
    evidence" in the way that  is  normally  required  in  these  financial
    threshold requirement cases for spouses who wish to enter and settle in
    the UK.

29. The only requirement is that there is, "official documentation from the
    Department of Work and  Pensions  or  Veterans  Agency  confirming  the
    entitlement and the amount received", and  the  requirement  that,  "at
    least one personal bank statement in the twelve month period  prior  to
    the date of application showing payment of  the  benefit  or  allowance
    into the person's  account".   The  Appellant  could  meet  both  these
    requirements.

30. This is because the Sponsor did provide a personal  bank  statement  at
    the time of making the  application.   There  are  also  pay  slips  to
    confirm that the Sponsor  was  earning  �18,600,  because  the  monthly
    payment is �1,550, which corroborates  the  bank  statements  and  also
    confirms that the Sponsor still receives DLA.

31. Finally, there is then the issue of the law and the question as to  how
    the law would deal with a situation such as this.  I accept entirely Mr
    Tabori's submissions, made before me in measured and a skilful  manner,
    that materiality is at the heart of public law review.   In  Amid  A  v
    Kirklees Metropolitan Council [2001] EWCA Civ 582 the Court  of  Appeal
    held that there was one single question, namely, "is there a  realistic
    possibility"  that  the  Tribunal's  conclusion  would  have  been  any
    different to what it in the event  was  if  the  information  had  been
    anything other than what transpired in the circumstances  of  the  case
    (see paragraphs 20 to 21).  Applying that test, I find that there would
    have been no difference, and not least because all  the  evidence  that
    goes to the issue in relation to financial  circumstances  appeared  at
    page 42 of the Appellant's bundle.

32. Similarly, in the case of Smith v Cotswold District Council [2007] EWCA
    Civ 1341, the question was considered, "more importantly whether  there
    is a possibility  that  there  might  be,  having  regard  to  all  the
    circumstances,  be  a  different  decision  were  the  matter   to   be
    reconsidered" (see paragraph 15).  In that case, the court held that if
    the council were required to give proper reasons for the decision there
    was no possibility that there might be a  different  decision  and  the
    appeal was dismissed.

33. Therefore, what they suggest is that even if the  judge  were,  in  the
    circumstances of the case before him on the day in  question,  to  have
    specifically considered the financial  situation,  and  to  have  given
    reasons for why the Appellant, on the evidence that plainly existed  in
    the bundles before him, to have reached a different result, there would
    have been no possibility of a different decision.

34. Accordingly, this is a case where even if there is an error, the  error
    is not material, in that the decision would not have been different and
    certainly it is not a case where this Tribunal  should  set  aside  the
    decision of the judge below, in  a  case  where  there  have  been  two
    previous decisions, that have left much to be desired.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
