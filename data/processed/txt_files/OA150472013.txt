                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hillis made following a hearing at Bradford on 28th May 2014.

Background

 2. The Claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 24th January 1965.   He
    applied to come to the UK as the spouse of a British  citizen  but  was
    refused on the  grounds  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the Sponsor was  employed  in  two  places  of  work  as
    claimed.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer was also not satisfied  that  the  Claimant
    had met the English language requirement.

 4. The decision was reviewed by an Entry Clearance  Manager  on  11th  May
    2014 who stated that the Claimant had now retaken the English  language
    test  and  he  was  satisfied  that  the  relevant  paragraph  of   the
    Immigration Rules had been met.

 5. The judge considered the evidence and was satisfied  that  the  Sponsor
    was employed as claimed and that she had a combined income of  �19,200.
    He said that he was satisfied that the requirements of the  Rules  were
    met and allowed the appeal both under the Immigration Rules  and  under
    Article 8.

The Grounds of Application

 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the Rules  of  specified  evidence  were  comprehensively  set  out  in
    Appendix FM/SE but the Tribunal made no findings on the issue.  It  was
    not clear what the Sponsor's gross annual income was  at  the  date  of
    application.  Furthermore, in allowing the appeal on Article 8  grounds
    the judge had erred.  There was  no  prejudice  to  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor continuing their family life in Bangladesh and  no  reason  why
    the Appellant could not submit a further application or why it would be
    unjustifiably harsh to require him to do so.

 7. It was also argued that the judge had failed to deal with the ground of
    refusal relating to the English language test.

 8. The Claimant served a reply.  He says  that  he  provided  all  of  the
    documents as prescribed by Appendix FM/SE including the  payslips,  the
    letters from the employers,  the  P60  and  the  Inland  Revenue.   The
    application had been refused as a  consequence  of  a  mistake  by  the
    Secretary of State.  She confused the Sponsor's home address  with  one
    of her employer's address.  She works for  two  employers  who  are  in
    partnership together and her working hours are split  between  the  two
    different locations.

Submissions

 9. Mr Diwnycz said that he had checked with HMRC who  had  confirmed  that
    the Sponsor had earned the claimed income of �19,202 gross for the  tax
    year 2013 - 2014. He did not seek to pursue any challenge on the  basis
    that the substantive rule was not met.

10. So far as the required documentation was concerned he had no papers  in
    the Entry Clearance Officer's bundle other than those provided  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer.  He could make no submissions  as  to  whether
    they had been produced or not.

11. Mr Janjua said that Bashir Consultancy was not acting for the  Claimant
    at the time of the application but he was instructed that  all  of  the
    relevant documents had been produced.  He observed that  no  issue  had
    been raised by the Entry Clearance Officer in relation to the  lack  of
    specified documentation.  If documents had been missing, it would  have
    been a Ground for Refusal.

Findings and Conclusions

12. The grounds relating to the  English  language  test  are  misconceived
    since this was not an issue before the Immigration Judge,  having  been
    conceded by the Entry Clearance Manager.

13. It is not now being asserted that  the  Sponsor  was  not  earning  the
    amounts claimed.

14. So far as the lack of specified evidence was concerned, this was not  a
    ground for refusal by the Entry Clearance Officer and the judge  cannot
    be in error in not addressing it. In any event there was no  reason  to
    suppose that the evidence had not been produced  because,  if  any  was
    missing, the Entry Clearance Officer would have said so.  Moreover  the
    Entry Clearance Manager did  not  mention  any  lack  of  documentation
    either, referring only to the Entry Clearance Officer's concerns  about
    the reliability of the employment and  income  claimed.  The  Appellant
    asserts  that  he  provided  all  of  the  relevant  documentation   as
    prescribed in Appendix FM/SE in his response, and there is no basis for
    disbelieving him.

15. Since the judge found that the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    had been met it was not an error for him to allow the appeal on Article
    8 grounds since it would clearly be disproportionate  to  refuse  entry
    clearance to a person who had met the requirements of the Rules.

Decision

16. The original judge did not err in law and  the  decision  stands.   The
    Claimant's appeal is allowed.
