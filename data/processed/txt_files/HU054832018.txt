For the respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on a 28th of April 1979.
      On 5th of October 2016 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on
      the basis of 10 years lawful residence and his article 8 right to
      private life.

   2. His application was considered under 276 B of the immigration rules
      which requires 10 years continuous lawful residence. There contains a
      caveat that there must be no reason why it would be undesirable for
      the applicant to be given indefinite leave to remain, including
      whether the applicant fell for refusal under the general grounds.

   3. His application was refused on 8 February 2018. His application fell
      for refusal under paragraph 322(5) on the basis it was undesirable be
      granted leave having regard to his character and conduct. Regard was
      also had to the provisions of paragraph 276 ADE(1)(vi) and he had not
      lived here the necessary 20 years and the respondent did not see very
      significant obstacles to his reintegration into life in Pakistan. No
      other exceptional circumstances were identified. He did not have any
      family and so family life was not engaged.

   4. The appellant came to the United Kingdom on 18 September 2006. It was
      accepted he had lived in the United Kingdom for over 10 years at the
      date of application. His original leave was for the purposes of study
      and he obtained subsequent leaves on the basis and as a post study
      migrant. Whilst here he obtained a Master's degree in International
      business management from Manchester Metropolitan University in 2010.

   5. Following his application the appellant consider his immigration
      history. As part of his Tier 1 leave to remain application of 4 July
      2011 he claimed an income of �51,693 from self-employment for the
      period 1 April 2010 until 31 March 2011. Based on this, he was awarded
      the necessary 30 points in respect of previous earnings.

   6. In a further application made on 25 May 2013 he claimed an income of
      �51,875 from self-employment for the period 15 May 2012 to 14 May
      2013. Again, he was awarded the necessary 30 points under previous
      earnings.

   7. When he made his present application he was asked on 18 May 2017 to
      complete a tax questionnaire. He returned this, signing the form on 13
      June 2017. He indicated there had been a previous need to correct his
      tax returns. He submitted documents from HMRC which confirmed
      discrepancies in his declared earnings.

   8. The respondent made enquiries with HMRC who confirmed that for the tax
      year 6 April 2010 to 5 April 2011 his total declared income was
      �9,693. This was derived from self-employment. For the tax year 6
      April 2012 to 5 April 2013 his declared total income was �27,329 from
      self-employment. Then, for the tax year of 6 April 2013 to 5 April
      2014 his declared earnings were �25,094. This again was from self-
      employment.

   9. This raised the question as to whether he had either inflated his
      earnings to achieve the necessary points when applying for his further
      visas or alternatively, had undeclared his income to the Revenue. If
      the figures declared to the Revenue were applied that he would not
      have been awarded the required points to obtain his further leaves.

  10. He had submitted a letter from his current accountants, Qadeer and Co,
      dated 1 June 2016 stating that in respect of 15 May 2012 to 14 May
      2013 his income was �51,875 which was then broken down into �27,329 in
      respect of the period 15 May 2012 to 5 April 2013 and �24,546 for the
      much shorter period from 6 April 2013 to 14 May 2013. The respondent
      questioned the genuineness of earning such a substantial amount in one
      month. The respondent acknowledged that his Tier 1 earnings fell over
      2 tax years but in light of the earlier discrepancy did not accept
      they were genuine. His tax calculations for 2012/13 give a total
      income of �27,329 and �25,094 for the tax year 2013 to 14 which
      included a profit from self-employment of �24,546. Based on the
      earnings declared to the revenue for 2012 to 13 he would only have
      received 5 points under the Tier 1 rules and would not have obtained
      the necessary leave.

  11. The appellant blamed his previous accountants, Ali & Co for the
      irregularities in relation to his tax returns for 2010 to 2011.
      However, the respondent took the view that it was his responsibility
      to make an accurate tax return and that he was the one who provided
      the figures for the accountants. Furthermore, he did not seek to amend
      the figures for 2010 to 2011 until 1 June 2016, a delay of several
      years.

The First tier Tribunal

  12. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald at
      Manchester on 9 November 2018. In a decision promulgated on 28
      November 2018 it was dismissed.

  13. The judge was referred to the decision of SM and Qadir -v- SSHD (ETS -
      Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 which related to the
      question of burden of proof in an appeal relating to personation in
      English language testing. The appellant's representative conceded that
      the evidence indicated prima facie deception on the part of the
      appellant. She submitted that the appellant had addressed this and
      given an explanation. She submitted that the respondent had not
      established to the required standard of proof that it should be
      rejected.

  14. She acknowledged that it was the appellant's responsibility rather
      than his accountants to ensure the information sent to the Revenue was
      correct. She confirmed that no argument was being put forward in
      relation to meeting paragraph 276 ADE or in respect of family life.

  15. The appellant gave evidence and said he had established a business in
      2011 as a business consultant. He instructed a firm of chartered
      accountants, Ali and Co to prepare his own accounts. He claimed a
      discrepancy in respect of the returns to the Revenue arose because the
      accountant submitted claims for excessive expenses. He said the
      following year he changed to another firm of accountants, Qadeer and
      Co, but they under declared his profits. He attributed this to them
      using figures supplied by his original accountants. He then stated
      that in June 2016 they undertook a review of his accounts at his
      request in anticipation of his application for leave to remain. It was
      then he claimed that the discrepancies came to light.

  16. First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald set out the findings made at
      paragraph 18 of the decision under subheadings (a) -(w). The judge at
      (b) stated that the appellant's representative had conceded it was the
      appellant's personal responsibility to check his tax return. The judge
      also stated there had been no argument on behalf of the appellant that
      he could still succeed if he had engaged in deception. The judge then
      went on to consider the appellant's explanation and rejected it.

  17. The judge rejected the appellant's claim that he did not understand
      the British tax system, particularly as he was engaged in advising
      others in business. The judge rejected his claim that he was unaware
      he was paying too little tax. The judge also rejected the appellant's
      claim he had not received a copy of the draft tax return for
      confirmation before it submission. The appellant claimed his
      accountant gave him the figures over the telephone which the judge did
      not accept. The judge noted that the appellant had not reported his
      accountants to their professional body. The judge concluded the
      appellant had misled the Revenue to avoid paying tax. Regarding the
      years spanning 2012 /2013 the judge rejected the appellant's claim
      that he nearly earned as much from self-employment for one month in
      2013/2014 as in the previous 11 months. The appellant's explanation
      was that this income covered the completion of projects began earlier.

The Upper Tribunal

  18. Application for permission to appeal was made on a number of grounds
      which were rejected by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal. On a
      renewed application to the Upper Tribunal permission was granted on
      the basis it was arguable the judge may have erred in relation to the
      correct burden of proof applicable. Reference was made to the 1st
      ground of the application.

  19. The 1st ground suggested there were several instances where the judge
      failed to apply the correct standard of proof. It was acknowledged
      that the respondent had satisfied the initial burden because of the
      discrepancies between the figures used in the student Visa
      applications and the returns to the Revenue. It was then for the
      appellant to provide an innocent explanation. The grounds contended
      that this needed to be considered against a minimum level of
      plausibility. The grounds address the question of dishonesty.
      Reference was made to the decision of R (on the application of Addas)
      v SSHD [2017] EWHC 78 at paragraph 7. This referred to the legal
      burden on the Secretary of State to lay sufficient evidence to raise
      the issue of fraud. There was a burden upon applicant to show an
      innocent explanation satisfying the minimum level of plausibility. If
      this is done and the respondent must establish on the balance of
      probabilities that this innocent explanation can be rejected.

  20. The grounds then seek to detail instances in the decision where the
      judge failed to consider the appellant's explanation against the
      minimum level of plausibility. Reference is made to paragraph 18(o) of
      the decision whereby the judge referred to his `surprise' at the
      appellant's claim that he had not received a copy of the proposed tax
      return from Ali and Co rejected the claim the details of the tax
      return have been relayed over the telephone as the appellant claimed.
      The grounds suggest the judge failed to distinguish between
      carelessness and dishonesty and that the judge had erred in applying
      the minimum level of plausibility test.

  21. References then made to paragraph 18(r) the judge referred to the
      appellant's attempt to blame his accountant notwithstanding the
      earlier submission made by his representative that the responsibility
      lay with the appellant. The grounds again maintain this was not
      sufficient to conclude the appellant was dishonest.

  22. Finally, paragraph 18(s) is referred to, whereby the appellant had
      referred to health issues and the judge's reference to the absence of
      evidence that this could have led him to mislead the revenue. The
      grounds contend that the judge failed to provide sufficient reasons
      for rejecting this explanation.

  23. The grounds were advance under the heading 'failure to properly
      consider the appellant's evidence or give sufficient reasons'(Ground
      2).this again alluded to the health argument as well as the claim that
      in respect of the later period the monies related to earlier work
      done. The other ground argued making irrational findings (Ground 3).
      This related to the judge's rejection of the appellant's claim he did
      not understand the tax system given that he was engaged as a business
      adviser.

  24. At hearing, Mr Gajjar relied upon the grounds for which permission had
      been granted. His argument centred upon the need to show dishonesty
      rather than carelessness. In this context he said the initial
      concession by Counsel of a case to answer was not also a concession on
      the dishonesty.

  25. I was referred to the decision of R (on the application of Khan) v
      SSHD (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5) [2018] UKUT 00384 and
      also the decisions of Mr Justice Collins in R (on the application of
      Samant) JR/6546/2016 and the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan
      in R (on the application of Shaik) JR/8324/2017.In respect of Samant I
      was referred to paragraph 10 wherein it is stated is necessary to
      establish that an incorrect tax return was lodged deliberately rather
      than through a mistake or as a result of poor advice. I was referred
      to paragraph 34 of the decision in R (on the application of Khan) v
      SSHD where it was stated:

             `... It is too broad or extreme a proposition to suggest that
             it cannot be an offence for a person who has been refused ILR
             pursuant to paragraph 322(5) on the basis of a discrepancy
             between his tax return and a previous application for leave to
             remain to say that his accountant or agent was responsible for
             the discrepancy on the basis that each person is personally
             responsible for his or her own tax matters and dealings with
             HMRC.... It seems to me that an error by an accountant may
             afford a reason for an applicant shall that he has not been
             dishonest but, at most, careless...'

  26. Mr Gajjar distinguished the personal responsibility upon the taxpayer
      to make the correct return from an individual making a dishonest
      return. He then returned to the appellant's account that his former
      accountant relayed the details of his proposed tax return over the
      telephone. He submitted that just because something was surprising at
      by the judge did not mean it fell below the minimum level of
      plausibility. He referred to the comment by the judge at paragraph
      18(o) that he found it highly unusual that an accountant would not
      forward a copy of the draft tax return to the customer, for
      confirmation, before submitting the same to HMRC. Mr Gajjar again said
      the issue was not whether something was highly unusual or surprising
      but whether it was dishonest. He submitted the correct test was
      whether the explanation was so implausible that it could not have
      happened.

  27. I was referred to paragraph 18 are of the decision with the judge
      recorded the appellant continued to blame his accountant. Mr Gajjar
      submitted again that the judge failed to distinguish between a breach
      of responsibility and deception.

  28. Moving onto the other grounds, he suggested the judge failed to give
      adequate reasons. For instance at paragraph 18(l) the judge referred
      to a series of discrepancies in the appellant's account but only gives
      an example of one. I was referred to paragraph 18(k) where the judge
      did not find it credible that the appellant, engaged in advising
      others on how to improve their business with the suggestion this
      included tax affairs, he could have no understanding of the British
      tax system.in the appellant's statement he said he acted as a business
      consultancy but makes no reference to being a tax adviser.

  29. I was then referred to the judge's comments about the considerable
      income produced over a short period and the absence of an explanation.
      Mr Gajjar submitted that the appellant had given an explanation at
      paragraph 20 of his statement.

  30. By way of response, Mr McVeety referred me to the rationale of R (on
      the application of Khan) v SSHD whereby it was inadequate for the
      appellant simply place the blame at the doorstep of his accountant. He
      submitted this was exactly what the appellant was seeking to do. He
      said there was no evidence the appellant had done anything to
      demonstrate that the fault lay with the accountant. He submitted the
      judge was entitled on the balance of probabilities to reject a claim
      such as that made by the appellant that he was given details of his
      tax return over the phone; that he never read the completed draft and
      simply accepted what the accountant told him. He said it was not
      credible that the appellant who was advising other businesses could
      not be bothered to check his own tax return notwithstanding a lack of
      expertise in tax. He said there was no evidence that the appellant so
      neglected the running of his own business.

  31. In response, Mr Gajjar said the appellant had not simply sought to lay
      the blame with the accountant. They had discussed the figures over the
      phone. The 1st period concerned his 1st year of trading and so we had
      no comparators which would have warned him that the tax bill was too
      low. At its very height the appellant was careless rather than
      dishonest. Regarding the 2nd period issue he submitted that the judge
      failed to make proper findings on the explanation that this related to
      accrued earnings. I was referred at paragraph 32 of R (of the
      application of Shaik) where Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan made the
      point that a single mistake in the 1st tax return might be viewed
      differently from a series of mistakes when the explanation will become
      less and less plausible. He referred to the judge using phraseology
      such as `highly unusual' or `unusual 'rather than `highly unlikely'.

Consideration

  32. A burden of proof and the standard of proof in an appeal are not
      matters of mathematical certainty but are concepts which require an
      assessment of the evidence presented. Paragraph 322(5) of the
      immigration rules provides that leave to remain should normally be
      refused based on `the undesirability of permitting the person
      concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct
      etc...'

  33. In the present appeal there is no dispute that when the declared
      income to the Revenue was compared with that used to obtain the
      necessary points for further leave to remain there was a significant
      disparity. Furthermore, that disparity operated to the appellant's
      advantage in that the figures declared to the Revenue were less than
      they actually where, meaning he did not pay his full tax liability.

  34.  The appellant claims that the discrepancy came to light after he
      asked his accountant to review his returns for the past 5 years in
      anticipation of his application for leave to remain. Matters have been
      resolved with the Revenue and no penalty has been imposed. Payments
      have had to be made to meet the shortfall. As part of the normal
      process following an application for leave to remain the respondent
      sent the appellant a questionnaire in relation to his tax liabilities.
      In light of this and the discrepancies were revealed and his
      application was refused under paragraph 322(5).

  35. There has been guidance in the case law at the applicable principles
      in such matters. The 1st point relates to burdens of proof. The
      guiding case is that of R (on the application of Khan) -v- SSHD. The
      1st point is that where there has been a significant difference
      between the income claimed in a previous application for leave to
      remain and the income declared to the Revenue the respondent is
      entitled to draw an inference that the applicant has been dishonest
      and falls for refusal under paragraph 322(5).

  36. It is accepted in the present appeal that there was a significant
      difference between the income declared to the Revenue and that used in
      previous applications for leave to remain under the points system. In
      the First-tier Tribunal the appellant's representative conceded this.
      This matter however is only the beginning for a decision to be made
      under paragraph 322(5).

  37. The inference is rebutted where there is a plausible explanation for
      the discrepancy. R (on the application of Khan) -v- SSHD makes the
      point that the enquiry is whether the person was careless rather than
      dishonest. The issue is whether the explanation and evidence is
      sufficient to displace the primary inference of dishonesty. Obviously,
      there can be a myriad of explanations. The decision went on to say
      that a finding that the person has been dishonest in relation to their
      tax affairs is a very serious finding with serious consequences.
      Therefore, although the standard of proof is the balance of
      probabilities this must be borne in mind. The case also advised that
      to blame the accountant in relation to a historical tax return is not
      the end of the matter. This is because the accountant will have or
      should have asked the taxpayer to confirm the return was accurate. The
      applicant will also have an awareness, dependent upon their earnings,
      of a tax liability.

  38.  In considering the question of dishonesty the question of a tax
      expectation and remedial steps would be relevant. It follows there is
      a crucial distinction between someone who is dishonest from someone
      who is careless. The case guides that in determining which side the
      person falls then regard is to be had as to whether the explanation
      for the error by the accountant is plausible. Regard can also be had
      to the correspondence between the individual and their accountant and
      whether an applicant should have realised something was wrong.
      Associated with this is consideration of the steps they took to remedy
      the situation, including the question of any delay. Within this
      guidance there are further refinements. For instance, an error by an
      accountant may for a reason for an applicant to show they have not
      been dishonest. There is no rule of strict liability upon an
      applicant.

  39. Ultimately, I am considering whether there is a material error in the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald. Mr Gajjar has skilfully
      dissected the decision and I have attempted to set this out above.
      Meaning no disservice to the points argued, ultimately the thrust was
      that the appellant had given a plausible explanation to the effect
      that at most he was careless and not dishonest. Therefore, he argues
      the judge erred in dismissing his appeal as he had displaced the prima
      facie evidence of dishonesty.

  40. Without rehearsing the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Herwald
      again I would refer to the points made at paragraphs 18(f) to (w). I
      find they indicate the judge correctly understood the issues and the
      changing burdens of proof. There was an adequate basis for the judge's
      conclusions of dishonesty.

  41. Mr Gajjar has suggested that reference by the judge to being
      `surprised' and so forth was the wrong test. However, I do not find
      the use of such expressions indicate any error on the part of the
      judge.

  42. Insofar as submissions made are concerned I prefer those of Mr
      McVeety. The appellant is highly educated and was employed advising
      businesses. Whilst he is not an accountant it is reasonable to infer
      he has some understanding of tax liabilities. The same can be really
      be expected of any earner. The judge did not find he had demonstrated
      an innocent explanation. His actions were not dismissed as mere
      carelessness.

  43. There were two separate incidents where there was disparity between
      the figures to the Revenue and to the respondent. Notably, this was
      not the situation where the disparity was to the appellant's
      detriment. The two occasions involved two separate firms of chartered
      accountants. The explanation for the error by the 2nd accountant was
      that they adopted the figures given by the 1st. No complaint was made
      to the professional body. Furthermore, there was no attempt at
      remedial action on the part of the appellant until he appreciated his
      tax affairs would be relevant to the present application. The fact no
      penalty was imposed by the Revenue is not the issue.

  44.  The appellant seeks to blame his first accountant. I accept in
      certain situations of an accountant's fault can exonerate an
      individual. However, he did not demonstrate this to the judge. His
      explanation was that the 1st accountant relayed the figures relating
      to his tax liability over the telephone and assured him everything was
      in order. The returns were made online so this did not necessitate his
      signature. Nevertheless, it was open to the judge to reject this
      claim.

  45. Judgement was given in Balajigari v The Secretary of State for the
      Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673 on 16th April 2019. Having
      considered the decision I did not feel it necessary to recall the
      parties for comment. Paragraph 4 of the decision states that the Home
      Office became concerned that there was a widespread practice of
      applicants for leave to remain as a T1GM claiming falsely inflated
      earnings, particularly from self-employment. From 2015 the Secretary
      of State began to make use of powers under section 40 of the UK
      Borders and Immigration Act 2007 to obtain information from Her
      Majesty's Revenue and Customs about the earnings declared by
      applicants in their tax returns covering the equivalent period. This
      information disclosed significant discrepancies in a large number of
      cases and reference was made to the common occurrence of applicants
      then submitting amended tax returns. The decision refers to arguments
      on appeal distinguishing between dishonesty and carelessness. The
      Court of Appeal emphasised the need to establish dishonesty.

  46. In the individual cases the Court of Appeal found the decision-making
      process was flawed because the Secretary of State proceeded directly
      from finding that the discrepancies occurred to a decision that they
      were the result of dishonesty without giving applicants an opportunity
      to proffer an innocent explanation. The Court went on to say that
      those defects need not lead to a paragraph 322 (5) refusal being
      quashed if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that they are immaterial.
      It is my conclusion this is the situation in the present appeal. The
      refusal letter does indicate representations were made.

Decision

No material error of law has been established in the decision of First-tier
Tribunal Judge Herwald. Consequently, that decision dismissing the appeal
shall stand.


                                                     Deputy Upper Tribunal
Judge Farrelly.
