                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This appeal  is  determined  on  the  papers  at  the  request  of  the
    Appellant's representatives, Blakewells Solicitors by a letter dated 11
    September 2014 and by new representatives, Bespoke Solicitors by letter
    dated 19 September 2014.  The Respondent's submission  once  permission
    had been granted was that there was no need for an oral hearing and the
    matter can be found in the Appellant's favour on the Section  47  point
    alone.

2.   The Appellant,  a  national  of  the  Philippines,  date  of  birth  30
    September 1979, appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 2  May
    2013 to refuse to vary leave to remain and to make  removal  directions
    under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

3.   An appeal against those decisions was made to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and the matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall (the Judge)
    who dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and dismissed  the
    appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds  but  gave  no  consideration  to  the
    removal directions.

4.   It is accepted that at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's  decision  the
    amendment to the 2006 Act made by Section 51 of the  Crimes  and  Court
    Act had not taken effect and did  not  do  so  until  8  May  2013  and
    accordingly the combined decision in relation to the removal directions
    was unlawful.

5.   Application was made  to  the  Tribunal  by  the  Appellant  which  was
    granted on 6 August 2014 solely on the Section 47 point.  Challenges in
    relation to the Immigration Rule findings and those made under  Article
    8 of the ECHR outside of the Rules were not given permission.

6.   The original Tribunal's decision in relation to the  Immigration  Rules
    and the decision under Article 8 of  the  ECHR  stands.   The  original
    Tribunal's decision in relation to Section 47 of the  2006  Act  cannot
    stand.

7.      The appeal is allowed to the extent that the matter is  remitted  to
    the Secretary of State for further consideration of removal directions.


Signed                                  Date 30 September 2014
