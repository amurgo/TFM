                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Grimshaw
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 16th September 2014.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan  born  on  20th  May  1983.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 12th December 2009 with a student visa
    valid to 31st January 2011.  He entered into an Islamic  marriage  with
    Farzana Kousar on 24th January 2010.  Miss Kousar had two children  and
    the couple now have a daughter born  on  16th  July  2014.   She  is  a
    British citizen.

 3. The Appellant's  application  for  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds, made on 14th March 2012, was refused with no right  of  appeal
    on 15th July 2013.  He made another application on 20th  December  2013
    which was refused on 23rd April 2014 and it is this decision which  was
    the subject of the appeal before Judge Grimshaw.

 4. The judge was satisfied that the Appellant and Miss Kousar  were  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.  However the evidence  before  her
    was that the couple did  not  begin  living  together  full-time  until
    February  2012  because  there  were   family   problems   with   their
    relationship, and accordingly they had not been living together for two
    years as at the date of application in December 2013.   They  therefore
    could not meet the requirements of GEN1.2 of Appendix FM.

 5. The judge said that to meet the eligibility requirements of Appendix FM
    under the parent route the Appellant must show that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable for the child to leave  the  UK.   It  was  clearly  in  the
    child's best interests for her  to  remain  with  her  mother  in  this
    country and although Miss Kousar had a number of heath  problems  there
    was no suggestion that her parenting capacity was impaired so  long  as
    she received adequate support from the care professionals.

 6. So far as Article 8 was concerned the judge said that the Appellant had
    to show more than mere inconvenience as a consequence of being removed,
    and whilst it would cause practical difficulties for  those  he  leaves
    behind, the genuine and subsisting relationship which  he  enjoys  with
    his partner and children would not be severed by his return to Pakistan
    since the separation would only be temporary.  It was his intention  to
    seek entry clearance  as  a  partner  or  fianc�.   Miss  Kousar  could
    continue her life in the United Kingdom with access to the  family  and
    educational support services as she requires.

 7. Moreover the Appellant came to the UK  in  a  temporary  capacity.   He
    acknowledged that he had no right to remain here after 2011.

 8. The judge  said  that  she  bore  in  mind  that  Section  117  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 makes it clear that little
    weight should be given to  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying
    partner or a private life which is established by a person  at  a  time
    when he or she is in the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully  or  where  their
    immigration status  is  precarious.   There  were  no  non-standard  or
    particular features of the application requiring leave  to  be  granted
    outside the Rules and accordingly she dismissed the appeal.





Grounds of Appeal

 9. The Grounds of Appeal state that since the Appellant made  his  initial
    application on 14th March 2012 and further  submissions  were  made  in
    December 2013 the application should have been  considered  before  the
    new Rules came into effect.

10. Second, the judge failed to consider the evidence of cohabitation since
    January 2010.  Furthermore even if it was  accepted  that  cohabitation
    commenced in February 2012, as at the date of the hearing  the  parties
    had been in cohabitation for over two years.  The Appellant  relied  on
    the case of YZ and LX (effect of Section 85(4) 2002 Act,  China  [2005]
    UKIAT 00157.

11. The judge failed to consider that the Appellant's removal would  result
    in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the family and has not properly
    applied the case of  Chikwamba  when  concluding  that  the  effect  of
    separation will only be temporary. She was  wrong  to  state  that  the
    Appellant formed family life when his status was precarious and  failed
    to give any consideration to the welfare of the three children  of  the
    family.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Cruthers  on  24th  November
    2014.

13. On 3rd December 2014  the  Respondent  served  a  reply  defending  the
    determination.

Submissions

14. Mr Ghani relied on his grounds save that so far as the  Edgehill  point
    was concerned  he  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  made  a  second
    application in December 2013.

15. He submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    submission that, by the date of the hearing the Appellant was  able  to
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules since as  at  that  date
    the parties had cohabited for more than two years.  Furthermore she had
    not properly applied Section 117 of the 2014 Act which states that  the
    public interest does not require the person's removal where he/she  has
    a genuine and parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child  and  it
    would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

16. He also submitted that the decision was in breach of Article 12 of  the
    ECHR, the right to marry, because the Respondent had failed  to  supply
    him with a certified copy of his passport  and  thereby  prevented  him
    from entering into a marriage under English law.

17. Mrs Pettersen submitted that there was no mention of Article 12 in  the
    original grounds of application but in any event there was no  evidence
    that the Appellant had pursued his request for his passport or followed
    the correct processes in order  to  obtain  a  certified  copy  of  the
    documents.

18. GEN1.2 states that cohabitation for two years is a  requirement  as  at
    the date of application and accordingly the Appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of the Rules.  However she accepted that the judge had
    not properly considered paragraph 117 of  the  2014  Act  and  to  that
    extent her decision was flawed.

Findings and Conclusions

The decision under the Rules

19. As Mr Ghani properly  conceded  the  decision  under  appeal  was  made
    following an application in December 2013 and accordingly the new Rules
    apply.

20. Under GEN1.2 of Appendix FM,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Appendix  a
    partner means -

      i) The applicant's spouse.

     ii) The applicant's civil partner.

    iii) The applicant's fianc� or proposed civil partner, or

     iv) A person who has been living  together  with  the  applicant  in  a
         relationship akin to a marriage or civil partnership for  at  least
         two years prior to the  date  of  application  unless  the  context
         otherwise requires.

21. The Appellant criticises the judge on two counts, firstly by not taking
    into account evidence of cohabitation prior to February 2012 and second
    by not taking into account cohabitation up to the date of hearing.

22. With regard to the first, it seems to  have  been  the  clear  evidence
    before the judge that the couple did not begin  living  together  until
    February 2012.  Although Mr Ghani states that there was evidence  that,
    prior to that date, they lived together at weekends plainly  the  judge
    was entitled to conclude that cohabitation began when the couple joined
    their households together on a full-time basis.

23. The Tribunal in YZ and LX was concerned with  an  application  when  an
    applicant attained the age of 65 between the date of decision  and  the
    date of the hearing before the Adjudicator. It held that the Appellants
    were entitled to rely on the change  in  circumstances  i.e.  that  the
    first Appellant was now 65, as constituting a matter which was relevant
    to the substance of the decision in accordance with  Section  85(4)  of
    the 2002 Act.

24. The situation is different here. Section  85(4)  does  not  assist  the
    Appellant because he could not meet the requirement specifying that the
    two years must have elapsed when he applied. It is a requirement of the
    relevant Immigration Rules that, to meet the definition of partner,  an
    applicant has  to  have  been  living  together  with  a  person  in  a
    relationship akin to a marriage for at least two  years  prior  to  the
    date of application.  Since he had not done so the Respondent was bound
    to refuse the application, and the issue before the judge  was  whether
    that decision was in accordance with the law and the  Rules,  which  it
    plainly was.

The ECHR

25. Mr Ghani did not pursue his arguments in relation  to  Article  12.   I
    accept Mrs Pettersen's submission that there can be no  question  of  a
    breach of Article 12 in circumstances where the Appellant has not shown
    that he followed the proper processes for the return of  his  passport.
    The sole evidence produced is a photocopy  of  an  undated  handwritten
    letter requesting a faxed or photocopy of the passport but no  evidence
    at all that it was followed up and proper process pursued.

26. However the challenge to the judge's considerations under Article 8  is
    made out.

27. The judge cited Section 117 of the 2014 Act but not the  most  relevant
    Section in this case which is Section 117B(vi) -

         "In the case of a person who  is  not  liable  to  deportation  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

               a) The person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
                  a qualifying child, and

               b) It would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
                  the UK."

28. This is a mirroring of the wedding of  Section  EX.1(a)  which  applies
    where an applicant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
    with a child who -

             "(aa)    is under the age of 18 years,

              ab) is in the UK.

              ac) is a British citizen or has lived in the  UK  continuously
                  for at  least  the  seven  years  preceding  the  date  of
                  application and

          2) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             UK."

 i) The judge did not properly cite Section 117 in relation to  the  weight
    to be given to private and family  life.   A  distinction  is  made  in
    Section 117B between private life, which should be given little  weight
    when established by a person at a time when  the  person's  immigration
    status is precarious  and  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying
    partner which is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
    in  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.   It  is  not  clear   from   the
    determination that the judge had that distinction in mind.

ii) The Appellant's relationship was established by  the  time  of  January
    2010 when he entered into an Islamic marriage and when he was in the UK
    lawfully. Although the Appellant had a period of overstaying, from July
    2011 until March 2012 the evidence is that the relationship was  formed
    before that date.  His status was precarious but that is only  relevant
    to the assessment of his private life and not his family life.

iii) Moreover, in stating that there was no requirement  for  the  child  to
    leave the UK and that her mother could properly look  after  her  here,
    the judge  appears  to  have  been  bringing  into  account  additional
    considerations set out in  Section  117C  in  cases  involving  foreign
    criminals where an applicant has to show that the effect of deportation
    on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

iv) Most importantly, when considering the Article 8  issue,  no  reference
    was made to the statutory  provision  that  public  interest  does  not
    require removal where it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
    leave the United Kingdom, mirroring the requirement in Section EX.1.

 v) There is a clear distinction in the 2014 Act between  Article  8  cases
    involving foreign criminals and Article 8  cases  which  do  not.   The
    Article 8 consideration in this case appears to have confused  the  two
    in that it seems that the judge's focus was whether the effect  of  the
    Appellant's removal would be unduly harsh which  is  only  relevant  in
    deportation cases and not in removal cases.

vi) The judge did not properly take into  account  the  relevant  statutory
    framework and thereby erred in law.

vii)  On  the  unchallenged  evidence  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine   and
    subsisting relationship with his daughter who  is  a  British  citizen.
    She lives in a family unit with her British  mother  and  British  half
    siblings in the UK. No argument was made by Mrs Pettersen that it would
    be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.

viii) The Appellant does not meet the requirements of a partner  because  he
    does not satisfy the definition as set out in GEN1.2.  However he  does
    meet the test set out in EX.1(a), and  the  public  interest  does  not
    require his removal.

Notice of Decision

ix) The original judge erred in law.   Her  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    Appellant's appeal is allowed with respect to the Immigration Rules and
    EX.1(a) and on Article 8 grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
