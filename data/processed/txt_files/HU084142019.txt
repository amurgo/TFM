For the Appellant:     Mr J Trussler, instructed by direct legal access
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and written reasons which
    were given orally at the end of the hearing on 21 November 2019.

Introduction

 2. This is an appeal brought by the  appellant  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge (the 'FtT') promulgated  on  15  July
    2019, in which she dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  appellant  and  her
    husband against the respondent's refusal of  leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of human rights.

 3. The thrust of the appeal, and  the  FtT's  decision,  was  whether  the
    appellant had engaged in deception in arranging  a  proxy  to  take  an
    English language test, or 'TOEIC', which was administered  by  a  third
    party provider, 'ETS' at a number of approved test centres.  The  issue
    was important because if it were found as proven that she  had  engaged
    in deception, the appellant would fall for refusal for leave to  remain
    or re-entry on 'suitability' grounds, in the Immigration Rules.

 4. The FtT noted in her decision the evidence given both by the  appellant
    and her husband as to the circumstances in  which  she  had  taken  the
    test; and why she had not  participated  in  the  TOEIC  deception,  as
    alleged.

 5. The FtT also noted the respondent's evidence that the  test  centre  at
    which the appellant claimed to have taken the test, New London College,
    was the subject of a criminal investigation, which discovered  the  use
    of 'pilots' who had admitted under caution the use of widespread fraud.
     The FtT preferred the evidence of the  respondent  and  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal.

 6. While the FtT also considered the wider proportionality of the  refusal
    of  the  applicant's  leave  to  remain,  no  other  element  of   that
    proportionality  assessment  was  challenged  in  the  application  for
    permission to appeal to this Tribunal or in the hearing before us.  The
    sole issue was whether the appellant had engaged in TOEIC deception. If
    she had done, her appeal would fail.  Her husband did  not  appeal  the
    FtT's decision (he was the appellant's dependant, in any event).

The grant of permission

 7. The appellant sought permission on 8 October 2019 to appeal  the  FtT's
    decision, and while permission  was  initially  refused  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Feeney on 13 September 2019, permission  for  a  renewed
    application was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge S Smith on  14  October
    2019.  We repeat his comments, as they succinctly identify  the  issues
    before us, at [2] of his permission grant: -

         "[2] It is arguable at [25] and  [26]  that  the  FtT  irrationally
         rejected the appellant's proffered  innocent  explanation  for  the
         alleged TOEIC cheating, without providing  sufficient  reasons  for
         doing so.  At [26], the judge said 'there are many  reasons  as  to
         why people cheat, and it is not for me to speculate as to  why  the
         appellant chose to do so.....'  Arguably the judge did  not  engage
         with the appellant's innocent explanation, as, when considering its
         plausibility, she assumed that the appellant had cheated......."



         "[3] The judge found that the motive and ability in English were no
         indication of whether a person did, in fact, cheat (see  [24])  and
         observed 'I  am  not  in  a  position  to  assess  the  appellant's
         abilities historically'.  Arguably, on  the  judge's  approach,  it
         would not be possible for anyone ever to succeed with  an  innocent
         explanation of the sort advanced  by  the  appellant  (no  need  to
         cheat, diligent attempt to comply with the  English  language  test
         requirements). Arguably, that was  an  irrational  approach  as  it
         rendered the provision of an innocent explanation  almost  (if  not
         actually) impossible."

 8. In terms of the appellant's submissions today, without any  discourtesy
    to Mr Trussler, he did little more substantively to develop beyond  the
    points identified by Judge Smith.  This was not a question  that  there
    was no evidence. While the respondent had adduced the  'look-up'  tool,
    which indicated an 'invalid' test result, nevertheless,  the  appellant
    was simply unable to understand why her proffered innocent  explanation
    was rejected.

 9. In contrast, in submissions for the respondent, Mr Clarke invited us to
    consider that none of Judge Smith's concerns were made out and that the
    evidence had developed over the years since the well-known authority of
    SM and Qadir v SSHD (ETS - Evidence -  Burden  of  Proof)  [2016]  UKUT
    00229 (IAC). By way  of  example,  considering  the  recent  report  of
    Professor French there  was  now  less  than  a  1%  chance  of  'false
    positives', and in particular we had to consider the  circumstances  of
    the New London College  fraud,  which  was  widespread.   The  FtT  was
    entitled to find that the appellant had cheated,  at  [9],  considering
    her evaluation of the evidence at [20] and  [21].   There  was  nothing
    wrong in her view (explained at [24]) that proficiency in  English  did
    not provide a sufficient evidential basis for the appellant's appeal to
    succeed.  While there was no evidence that the appellant  was  observed
    using a proxy, nevertheless her claims had  to  be  considered  in  the
    light of Professor French's report.

10. If there were any error of law, it was immaterial in light of the  lack
    of challenge to the FtT's findings on the appellant's ability to return
    to Nepal.

Discussion and conclusions - error of law

11. Taking in reverse order  the  issue  of  materiality,  we  accepted  Mr
    Trussler's submission that even if there was no challenge to the  FtT's
    conclusions on the ability of the appellant to return to Nepal, whether
    she had participated in TOEIC deception remained material, as it  would
    inevitably have a serious impact on her ability to re-enter the  United
    Kingdom in the future, because of serious question marks will be raised
    about her being able  to  meet  the  suitability  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  This is particularly important should, as here, the
    appellant wish to continue  her  studies  in  the  UK.   In  our  view,
    therefore, the submission that any error  could  not  be  material  was
    simply not sustained.

12. Dealing next with the issue of whether the FtT had erred in law, on the
    one hand, we accepted Mr Clarke' submission that at [13], the  FtT  had
    reminded herself of  the  SM  and  Qadir  guidance  on  the  legal  and
    evidential burdens of proof.  Where we find  that  the  FtT  fell  into
    error was that, having recited the evidence of the  appellant  and  her
    husband relating to her innocent explanation, the FtT failed to explain
    why she disbelieved  the  appellant's  evidence,  including  her  prior
    English qualifications; her explanation for why she chose to  take  the
    test at the New London College (its physical  proximity  to  her);  her
    journey to the test centre; and her husband's evidence.  There  was  no
    evaluation by the FtT of the credibility and the  plausibility  of  the
    appellant's explanation.  While it might be argued that it was implicit
    in the FtT's conclusions that she disbelieved the appellant, that  does
    not, in our view, adequately explain her reasoning.  Instead, at  [25],
    the reasoning is limited to recitations  of  the  statistical  evidence
    about the widespread fraud at New London College, noting one  point  in
    the appellant's favour that she was not  personally  observed  using  a
    proxy.

13. In failing to explain her analysis of the appellant's explanation,  the
    FtT erred in law; and that error was material.

Decision - error of law

14. The FtT erred in law in her  findings  on  whether  the  appellant  had
    engaged in a  TOEIC  deception.  We  set  aside  her  decision  on  the
    appellant's  appeal,  which  we  agreed  with  the  parties,   was   an
    appropriate one for us to remake, rather than to remit  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  In doing so, we  limit  our  remaking  to  that  single
    issue, as the remainder of the FtT's analysis  on  proportionality  was
    unchallenged.

The remaking decision

15. The sole issue is whether the appellant had engaged in  'TOEIC'  fraud.
    The respondent had discharged the initial evidential burden,  as  there
    was not only a report into wider cheating at the  New  London  College,
    Hounslow, but also an individual 'look up' result  for  the  appellant,
    which showed her spoken English result  as  'invalid'.  The  evidential
    burden then shifted to the appellant to provide an innocent explanation
    and the final question was then whether the respondent  had  discharged
    the legal burden of proving that the appellant had cheated.

16. We considered all the evidence before us in remaking  the  decision  on
    the appellant's appeal, whether we refer to it expressly or  not.   The
    appellant adopted her written witness statement at pages [1] to [3]  of
    the appellant's bundle ('AB') and she also gave  oral  evidence  before
    us, on which she  was  cross-examined.   The  parties'  representatives
    agreed that the appellant's husband did not need to give oral  evidence
    as his written statement at [4] AB merely recited his support  for  the
    appellant and the fact that he accompanied her to the  test  centre  in
    question, which was unlikely to be of much evidential weight,  as  even
    if we accepted the appellant's account, others  who  were  involved  in
    TOEIC fraud would need to have attended the test centre to  have  their
    photographs taken for the test certificate.

17. Much of the evidence  before  us  was  not  in  dispute  and  had  been
    considered  by  the  FtT  previously,  namely  the   appellant   having
    successfully qualifications with various diplomas and  certificates  in
    the UK, including an English language certificate in 2010 and a level 7
    diploma in 2012, at [9] to [14] AB.

18. We were conscious that we are not expert in assessing  spoken  English,
    and we are not aware of the precise level of comparability between  the
    spoken test that the appellant would have  taken  at  the  test  centre
    which is  the  subject  of  the  cheating  allegation;  and  any  prior
    qualifications.  We are also conscious that a person's ability to speak
    in  English  is  relevant  to  the  question  of  whether   they   have
    participated in a TOEIC fraud,  but  also  that  someone  may,  despite
    having proficiency in spoken English, nevertheless chose to  engage  in
    such a fraud.

19. In her written statement, the appellant recited her history  of  having
    obtained qualifications prior to taking the TOEIC test,  and  she  also
    gave explanations for why she chose the test  centre  she  did;  noting
    that it was on a  list  of  providers  authorised  by  the  respondent,
    although the same was true of all colleges, including  those  at  which
    there was widespread cheating.  We  conclude  that  the  appellant  has
    provided a plausible account of why she booked the  test  at  the  test
    centre she did (it was authorised and close to where she  studied)  and
    her account of travelling to the test centre  is  corroborated  by  her
    husband's brief witness statement.

20. Noting her choice of test centre and her travel to it, we  focussed  on
    the circumstances in which, once having arrived at the test centre, the
    appellant claimed to  have  taken  the  speaking  test.    Her  written
    witness statement provided very limited detail on the point.   In  oral
    evidence, the appellant was clearly able to speak English, but  in  our
    view, she clearly contradicted herself in describing the  circumstances
    of taking the test and her descriptions  of  it  were  also  noticeably
    vague.

21. On the one hand, she was able to describe  how  long  the  spoken  test
    took.  On the other hand, her oral evidence about the number  of  those
    who took the spoken English test at the same time, in the same room  as
    her, varied, from either being 20, or 4.  Her evidence on the number of
    those supervising the test also varied between either 2,  or  1.   When
    she was asked precisely how she took the speaking test, she referred to
    having to 'describe a picture in front of a screen', but despite  being
    repeatedly asked by Mr Clarke for more detail,  particularly  how  this
    was then conveyed to those assessing her spoken English,  she  repeated
    having to describe a picture in front of a screen.   Her  vagueness  in
    describing the test was striking to us, although the eventual gist,  as
    we understand it, was that she had spoken into some sort of  microphone
    with a headset, while in a some form  of  a  booth,  but  she  did  not
    explain this without significant pressing. Her vagueness caused  us  to
    have significant doubts over her credibility when this issue, i.e.  the
    circumstances in which she had taken the test, was  well-known  to  her
    for a number of years; was central to her appeal; and she will have had
    the chance to reflect on the circumstances in which she took the  test.




22. We take into account  that  the  appellant  will  have  been  naturally
    nervous in giving evidence, and we are  conscious  that  the  test  was
    taken a number years ago, on 19 March 2013, but these factors  do  not,
    in our view, adequately explain her inconsistencies and vagueness.

23. When asked to comment on the fact that not a single oral test was found
    to be reliable on the day she took the test at New London College;  and
    the evidence  appeared  to  support  that  there  had  been  widespread
    cheating for many months, in the period in which she  claimed  to  have
    taken the test, she merely asserted that these wider  allegations  were
    not accurate.

24. In light of her oral evidence, we drew  adverse  inferences  about  the
    appellant's credibility and placed limited weight on her oral evidence.
    Nevertheless, we considered all of the  evidence  in  the  round,  when
    considering whether she has provided an innocent explanation capable of
    putting the evidential burden back on the respondent.  On the one  hand
    we have the background of somebody who does have academic  achievement,
    with  some  English  proficiency.   We  note  that  those  who  may  be
    proficient may still have chosen to be have been involved in  having  a
    proxy test taker take their test.   We  have  her  description  of  the
    journey to  the  college,  and  the  choice  of  college,  which  while
    plausible, have limited evidential weight.  The most weighty  evidence,
    in the context  of  evidence  of  widespread  cheating  at  New  London
    College, including on the day she took the test,  and  where  her  test
    result was assessed as 'invalid,' was likely to be the circumstances in
    which the appellant actually took the speaking test and it was in  this
    particular context that the appellant's evidence was noticeably weak.

25. We also considered whether the appellant had challenged the college, or
    the  respondent  upon  learning  that  the  TOEIC   result   had   been
    invalidated.  The test was taken on 19 March 2013. By 2 September  2014
    when she was served with curtailment of her leave, she was aware of the
    TOEIC invalidation, as demonstrated in judicial review papers.  Despite
    presenting a claim for judicial review, (which of course is a  separate
    legal test to the one we are considering), she had not sought her money
    back from the college or raised issues with ETS, despite being, in  her
    words, 'cross'.  This lack of complaint is an additional, although  not
    central  factor,  which  weakened  her  case,  based  on  the  lack  of
    plausibility of her failure to  complain  to  the  college,  which  she
    suggested to us she didn't realise she could do, despite  applying  for
    judicial review.

26. Considering all of the above evidence, we conclude that  appellant  has
    not provided an adequate innocent  explanation,  so  as  to  shift  the
    evidential burden back to the respondent.

27. For completeness, that is not the end of our analysis.    Even  had  we
    concluded differently, going on to consider the issue  of  whether  the
    respondent  had  discharged  the  legal  burden  of  showing  that  the
    appellant had cheated, we considered the appellant's invalid 'look  up'
    result in the wider context of cheating at New London College.   As  we
    have identified, the spoken test  was  taken  on  19  March  2013.  The
    'Project Fa�ade' criminal inquiry report into New London College, dated
    5 May 2015, by Detective Inspector Andrew Carter, states at [11]: -

         "11. Between 20 March 2012 and 15  May  2013,  New  London  College
             undertook 1,423 TOEIC speaking and writing tests of which  ETS
             identified the following:

                . Invalid                                      1,055

                . Questionable                                 368

                . Not withdrawn (no evidence of invalidity)             0

                . Percentage Invalid                               74%"

28. Detective Inspector Carter further went on to note that one 'pilot' had
    been arrested and interviewed and admitted to taking tests on behalf of
    others.

29. This evidence was important not only at the stage of  consideration  of
    the appellant's 'innocent explanation, but in the  final  consideration
    of the overall legal burden on the respondent.   The  evidence  against
    the appellant was overwhelming. In the period in  which  the  appellant
    took the test at New London College, not a single test was regarded  as
    'valid', and the majority (74%) of those test  results,  including  the
    appellant's, were invalid.  Appendix A provided  further  evidence  for
    the specific date on which the appellant took the  test.   Once  again,
    not a single one of the tests taken was valid and 87% were assessed  as
    invalid.

30. In summary, even had we found that the appellant had shown an  adequate
    explanation, we find that  the  respondent  had  discharged  the  legal
    burden of showing that the appellant  had  cheated,  in  light  of  the
    overwhelming evidence  in  the  Project  Fa�ade  report,  when  weighed
    against  the  vague  and  contradictory  explanation  provided  by  the
    appellant.

Notice of Decision

31. We find that  whilst  the  FtT  had  erred  in  law  in  assessing  the
    appellant's innocent explanation, we remake the decision by  concluding
    that the respondent has discharged the legal burden of showing that the
    appellant had participated in a TOEIC deception, and so we dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal.

32. No anonymity direction is made.
