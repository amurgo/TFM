For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble
For the Respondent:    Not represented


                            Notice of withdrawal


   1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer but for  convenience
      I will refer to the original appellant herein,  a  citizen  of  Turkey
      born on 14 August 2009, as the appellant herein.

   2. The appellant applied along with his parents to visit his  uncle,  the
      sponsor, on 11 June, 2013 this application was  refused  on  15  July,
      2013. The refusal of the appellant's application was based on the view
      taken by the entry clearance officer about  the  appellant's  parents'
      financial  circumstances  and  intentions.  Their  applications   were
      refused and accordingly the appellant's application was refused.

   3. The appellant along with his parents appealed and their  appeals  came
      before First-tier Judge Balloch on 7 March 2014.

   4. The First-tier Judge allowed the appeal  of  the  appellants  and  his
      parents under reference VA/16249/2013 and VA/16262/2013, resolving the
      factual issues in favour of the appellants. She allowed the appeal  of
      the appellant in the light of fact that his appeal  was  dependent  on
      the outcome of his father's appeal.

   5. The Entry Clearance Officer did not appeal the decision in respect  of
      the appellant's parents, but argued  that,  as  the  sponsor  was  the
      appellant's uncle, he did not enjoy a full right of appeal, relying on
      the Immigration Appeals (Family Visitor) Regulations 2014 (SI 1532  of
      2012). The judge had not referred to human rights  or  race  relations
      grounds (see section 84(1)(b) and (c)  of the Nationality, Immigration
      and Asylum Act, 2002.)

   6. Mr Bramble informed me that the Entry Clearance Officer  had  in  fact
      granted the appellant a visa on 11th April 2014. There is  moreover  a
      letter from the sponsor dated 12 July 2014 stating that the  appellant
      and his parents had visited and returned to Turkey.

   7. Mr Bramble in the circumstances withdrew the appeal.

      Appeal withdrawn
