Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr F. Khan, Counsel instructed by CTM  Immigration  &
Welfare   For the Respondent:   Mr  M.  Shilliday,  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana, born on  27  January  1969.  She
       appeals  against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Hembrough following a hearing on 11 August 2014 dismissing her appeal
       against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  her
       application for leave to remain on the basis that her removal  placed
       the United Kingdom in breach of its obligations under  Article  8  of
       the ECHR. The  relevant  immigration  decision  was  the  service  of
       removal directions under s. 10 of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       1999.


    2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2002 as  a
       visitor and was permitted to remain until 11 June 2003.  Whether  she
       was ever a genuine visitor must  be  open  to  conjecture  since  she
       failed to return on the expiration of her leave and  remained  as  an
       overstayer until 25 May 2010 when she was encountered by officials of
       the Border Agency. She was then served with notice  of  liability  to
       removal in form IS 151A. Notwithstanding this, she did not leave  the
       United Kingdom and finally, on 28 March 2013 by which  time  she  had
       been in the United Kingdom for a little over 10  years,  she  applied
       for leave to remain on human rights grounds.


    3. The decision made by the respondent recited her immigration  history.
       Consideration was given as to  whether  the  appellant's  application
       raised any viable  Article  3  grounds  based  upon  the  appellant's
       submission of numerous doctors' appointments, none  of  which  raised
       even an arguable case that her medical  condition  merited  leave  to
       remain. The respondent went on to consider  whether  the  appellant's
       private life engaged Article 8 of the ECHR.


    4. At that stage, the appellant did not suggest that she  had  either  a
       partner or a child within United Kingdom. Accordingly, the respondent
       did not engage with those parts of the  Immigration  Rules  concerned
       with protecting family life. The decision-maker therefore  turned  to
       paragraph 276ADE and the criteria  an  appellant  would  normally  be
       expected to fulfil in order to establish a right  to  remain  in  the
       United Kingdom on the basis of her private life. As  a  single  woman
       aged 45 who had resided in the United Kingdom since  2002,  it  could
       not be said that the appellant met any of  the  requirements  of  the
       paragraph. In paragraph 4  of  the  refusal  letter,  the  respondent
       recorded that, in her view, there were no compelling or compassionate
       reasons to warrant any further leave.


    5. It has never been suggested that the appellant met  the  requirements
       of the Immigration Rules.  It was  for  this  reason  the  respondent
       refused the application under paragraph 322(1) of the Rules,  namely,
       that leave to remain was being sought for a purpose  not  covered  by
       the Rules.


    6. In her application to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the appellant
       claimed that the respondent's  decision  was  incompatible  with  her
       Convention rights and that she had been living in the United  Kingdom
       since 2003. She made no reference to having a partner.


    7. However, in his determination, the Judge recorded that,  since  2011,
       the appellant had been in a relationship with  Mr  Peter  Asante  and
       that they had been living together for about 2 � years. Mr Asante  is
       a naturalised British citizen of Ghanaian origin. They had  not  made
       any plans for marriage. The appellant accepted that she was aware she
       had been working illegally in the United Kingdom and that she had had
       access to medical treatment on the NHS to which she was not entitled.
       Mr Asante gave evidence that he was a healthcare  assistant  with  an
       income in excess of �40,000 for the year ended April 2014.  He  spoke
       of the difficulty of finding employment in Ghana. The Judge  accepted
       this evidence.


    8. No attempt  had  been  made  to  seek  leave  to  remain  within  the
       Immigration Rules. The Judge accepted that the relationship  with  Mr
       Asante had to be considered and this first required consideration  of
       whether the couple met the requirements of Appendix FM. They were not
       met because the appellant was an overstayer. The  Judge  went  on  to
       consider whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life
       continuing outside the United Kingdom and properly concluded that the
       appellant failed to establish such obstacles existed. Both she and Mr
       Asante were of Ghanaian origin. He owns property  in  Ghana  and  has
       family there. He is a  qualified  health  professional  and  owns  no
       property in the UK. The Judge reasonably found there were no matters,
       save choice and convenience, preventing him from returning  to  Ghana
       with the appellant.


    9. In paragraph 39 of the determination the Judge said that it was clear
       that if the appellant were to return to Ghana to apply as a  partner,
       it would be granted. While  this  is  an  unequivocal  assertion,  it
       would, of course, depend upon the material that was submitted in  the
       course of the application. Whilst a properly  formulated  application
       supported by  the  appropriate  evidence  was  no  doubt  capable  of
       succeeding, all would depend upon the contents of the application. In
       the context of this application, it is  readily  understandable  that
       the application was capable of succeeding  but  what  if  there  were
       specified documents to be produced, in a particular form, covering  a
       particular period?  If their production is now a  legal  requirement,
       we doubt that the Judge was justified in treating it  as  a  foregone
       conclusion that those requirements would  be  met,  even  though  the
       applicant was capable of  meeting  them.   If  the  Rules  make  such
       requirements,  Article  8  is  not  readily  a   process   by   which
       Parliament's intention that they be met should be  marginalised;  far
       less emasculated or set on one side.


   10. The Judge  went  on  to  consider  the  viability  of  the  appellant
       returning to  Ghana.  Any  disruption  to  family  life  between  the
       appellant and Mr Asante would be  temporary.  It  would  not  involve
       serious hardship. The appellant might occupy Mr Asante's property  in
       the course of the application. He has sufficient income  to  maintain
       the appellant whilst she was awaiting entry clearance.


   11. Pausing at this part in the determination,  we  are  quite  satisfied
       that the Judge was correct in his approach to the appeal. On the  one
       hand, he considered the appellant's appalling immigration history and
       the method by which the appellant's presence in  the  United  Kingdom
       might be regularised by an out-of-country application  for  leave  to
       enter as a partner. Whilst the appellant might  well  be  capable  of
       establishing the maintenance and accommodation  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules, it is not simply a matter of  the  sponsor  giving
       evidence or producing payslips and P60s  which  confirmed  an  annual
       income in excess of �40,000. The  full,  including  the  documentary,
       requirements of the Rules have to be met. It is not suggested in  the
       determination the appellant made her application for leave to  remain
       on the basis of setting out the requirements of the Immigration Rules
       and, at each stage,  submitting  documentary  evidence  to  establish
       these requirements were met.  It cannot be for the Tribunal presented
       with a large bundle of  documentary  material  to  determine  whether
       those documents comply with the requirements of the Rules.   It  does
       not seem  to  us  that,  given  the  specific  requirements  that  an
       applicant now has to meet before the grant of leave to  remain  as  a
       partner (which the applicant could not meet as an overstayer) it  was
       open to the appellant to rely upon an amorphous  concept  of  private
       and family life as justification for not making the attempt  to  meet
       the Rules.


   12. The Judge correctly considered whether the appellant's case exhibited
       any exceptional circumstances permitting a departure from  compliance
       with the Immigration Rules and reached the inevitable conclusion that
       it did not. There was nothing unduly harsh in requiring the appellant
       to meet the requirements of the Rules  by  making  an  out-of-country
       application. Indeed, according to the evidence, it would be a  simple
       and painless exercise.


   13. Unfortunately, the  Judge  then  became  embroiled  in  what  was  an
       unnecessary consideration of the decision in Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]
       UKHL 40.  He concluded by asserting that Chikwamba was no longer good
       law.  It is a bold Tribunal Judge who makes such a statement  and  it
       is little wonder that permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was
       granted in light of  it.   However,  for  the  reasons  we  will  now
       develop, it is  apparent  that  the  Judge  was  not  overruling  the
       reasoning in the House of Lord's decision but pointing out  that  its
       decision has now to be read in the context that Parliament itself has
       now set out the requirements that apply in these  cases.   It  is  no
       longer a policy.  To  pursue  this  point  further  requires  a  more
       detailed consideration of the opinions of Lord Scott and Lord  Brown.
       Lord Scott accepted the broad sense of imposing  an  entry  clearance
       requirement but said such a policy  had  to  be  flexible  enough  to
       produce just results:


          4. Not many would dispute, and I do not, that would-be  immigrants
          who desire to remain permanently in this country should apply  for
          permission to do so before coming here.  It  is  the  Government's
          policy that that should be so and  that  a  failed  asylum  seeker
          should return, or be returned, to his or her country and make from
          there any applications for the right to  reside  in  this  country
          that he or she desires to make. But policies that  involve  people
          cannot be, and should not be allowed to become,  rigid  inflexible
          rules.


    1. Ms Chikwamba had came to this country as a refugee from Zimbabwe. Her
       asylum claim failed but removals were suspended.  In  this  state  of
       limbo she married a Zimbabwe national who had been granted asylum and
       the right to remain. In  April  2004  their  daughter  was  born.  In
       November 2004  the  Secretary  of  State  lifted  the  suspension  on
       removals. The question arose whether the appellant, with her  7-month
       old daughter, should be required to return to Zimbabwe  in  order  to
       apply from Zimbabwe for permission to come to this country  in  order
       to resume  her  life  with  her  husband.  Lord  Scott  thought  that
       unreasonable and disproportionate  because  the  appellant's  husband
       could not be expected to return to  Zimbabwe  where  conditions  were
       described as 'harsh and unpalatable',  the  appellant  could  not  be
       expected to leave her child behind if she is returned to Zimbabwe and
       if the appellant were to be returned  to  Zimbabwe,  she  would  have
       every prospect of succeeding in an application for  entry  clearance.
       Government policy required this to happen but Lord  Scott  considered
       this was elevating policy to dogma.  Unusually, the  House  of  Lords
       substituted its own findings of fact.


    2. Lord Brown  referred  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  Asylum  Policy
       Instruction on Article 8, under the heading Consideration of  Article
       8 Family Life Claims, which included the following:


          "... if there is a procedural requirement (under  the  immigration
          rules, extra-statutory policies or concessions) requiring a person
          to leave the UK and make an application for entry  clearance  from
          outside the UK, such a person should return home to make an  entry
          clearance application from there. In such a case, any interference
          would only be considered temporary (and therefore more  likely  to
          be proportionate).  ...it  may  be  possible  for  the  family  to
          accompany the claimant home while he  makes  his  entry  clearance
          application, in which  case  there  will  be  no  interference  at
          all...For example, where a claimant is seeking to remain  here  on
          the basis of his marriage to a  person  settled  in  the  UK,  the
          policy is that they should return home to seek entry clearance  to
          come here as a spouse under the relevant immigration  rule.  Where
          the spouse can accompany the claimant  home  while  he  makes  his
          application, there will be no  interference.  Where  this  is  not
          possible, the separation will only be temporary. The fact that the
          interference is only for a limited period of time is a factor that
          is likely to weigh heavily in the assessment of proportionality."


    3. No challenge was made to the lawfulness of the policy.   Rather,  the
       challenge  was  whether,  in  the  particular  circumstances  of   Ms
       Chikwamba's  case,  the  policy  as  applied  by  the  decision-maker
       produced a  lawful  result.   There  was  no  dispute  there  was  an
       'insurmountable obstacle' faced by her husband  in  accompanying  her
       back to Zimbabwe. Lord Brown asked himself precisely what purpose was
       served and what in reality was achieved by this policy?  He  thought,
       rhetorically, the  real  rationale  for  the  policy  might  well  be
       deterring people from coming to the  United  Kingdom  without  having
       obtained entry clearance by subjecting them to substantial disruption
       of their lives by requiring them to return. He continued:


          "42. Now I would certainly not say that such an  objective  is  in
          itself necessarily objectionable. Sometimes, I accept, it will  be
          reasonable and  proportionate  to  take  that  course.  Indeed,  R
          (Ekinci) v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 765 still seems to me just such  a
          case. The appellant's immigration history was appalling and he was
          being required to travel no further than to Germany  and  to  wait
          for no longer than a month for  a  decision  on  his  application.
          Other obviously  relevant  considerations  will  be  whether,  for
          example, the applicant has arrived in this country  illegally...In
          an article 8 family case the  prospective  length  and  degree  of
          family disruption involved in going abroad for an entry  clearance
          certificate will always be highly relevant."


          44. I am far from suggesting that the Secretary  of  State  should
          routinely apply this policy in all but exceptional  cases.  Rather
          it seems to me that only comparatively rarely, certainly in family
          cases involving children, should an article 8 appeal be  dismissed
          on the basis that it would be proportionate and  more  appropriate
          for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."


    4. Chikwamba, whilst making it plain that the principle is  not  limited
       to cases where children are involved,  applies  to  all  cases  where
       there is likely to be a significant interference with the family  and
       private lives of a returnee whose  application  for  entry  clearance
       will succeed. However in SSHD v Treebhowan and Hayat [2012] EWCA  Civ
       1054 overturning  Hayat  (nature  of  Chikwamba  principle)  Pakistan
       [2011] UKUT 00444 (IAC), we see the Court of Appeal in  the  judgment
       of Elias LJ analysing the true rationale behind Chiwamba in a passage
       entitled 'Summarising the principles':


          1.  In  my  judgment,  the  effect  of  these  decisions  can  be
             summarised as follows:
             a) Where an applicant who does not have lawful entry clearance
             pursues an Article 8 claim, a dismissal of the  claim  on  the
             procedural ground that the policy requires that the  applicant
             should have made the application from his home state may  (but
             not necessarily will) constitute a  disruption  of  family  or
             private life sufficient  to  engage  Article  8,  particularly
             where children are adversely affected.
             b) Where Article 8 is engaged, it will be  a  disproportionate
             interference with family or private life  to  enforce  such  a
             policy unless, to use the language of Sullivan LJ, there is  a
             sensible reason for doing so.
             c)  Whether  it  is  sensible  to  enforce  that  policy  will
             necessarily be fact sensitive; Lord Brown  identified  certain
             potentially relevant factors in Chikwamba. They  will  include
             the prospective length and degree of disruption of family life
             and whether other members of the family are settled in the UK.
             d) Where Article 8 is engaged and there is no sensible  reason
             for enforcing the policy, the decision-maker should  determine
             the Article 8 claim on its substantive merits,  having  regard
             to all material factors, notwithstanding  that  the  applicant
             has no lawful entry clearance.
             e) It will be a very rare case where it is appropriate for the
             Court of Appeal, having concluded that a  lower  tribunal  has
             disproportionately  interfered  with  Article  8   rights   in
             enforcing the  policy,  to  make  the  substantive  Article  8
             decision for itself. Chikwamba was such an  exceptional  case.
             Logically the court would have to be satisfied that  there  is
             only one proper  answer  to  the  Article  8  question  before
             substituting its own finding on this factual question.
             f) Nothing in Chikwamba was intended  to  alter  the  way  the
             courts should approach substantive Article 8  issues  as  laid
             down in such well known cases as Razgar and Huang.
             g) Although the cases do not say this in terms, in my judgment
             if the Secretary of State has no sensible reason for requiring
             the application to be made from the home state, the fact  that
             he has failed to do so should not thereafter carry any  weight
             in the substantive Article 8 balancing exercise.


    5. The thinking behind Chikwamba thus becomes clear. In the  case  of  a
       female applicant who has an exemplary  immigration  history  and  has
       created a lawful family life in the form of  a  nuclear  family  with
       young children; where her husband is  working;  where  her  departure
       would require him to  give  up  work  in  order  to  look  after  the
       children; where the applicant is departure is likely to result in the
       remaining family depending upon state benefits; where  they  have  no
       obvious  savings  to  pay  for  her  return  trip  or  the  cost   of
       accommodation for a significant period of time while the  application
       is being processed; where the children's education and welfare may be
       jeopardised by their accompanying their  mother  and  increasing  her
       expenses and where the applicant establishes in precise  detail  that
       she meets the requirements for entry clearance,  it  is  plainly  and
       obviously disproportionate to require the applicant to regularise her
       position by making an out of country application which will be rubber-
       stamped at huge personal and financial cost.  In  the  words  of  the
       Court of Appeal, it is not sensible to require her to do so.


    6. This is what the House of  Lords  meant  when  Lord  Scott  spoke  of
       Kafkaesque bureaucracy applying rigid inflexible rules and  elevating
       policy to dogma.  It is what Elias and Sullivan  LJJ  spoke  of  when
       considering the application of policies where there was  no  sensible
       reason for doing so.


    7. Our example of circumstances  in  paragraph  12  above  was  selected
       because it is at the extreme end of the spectrum. It is not difficult
       to imagine a  case  that  is  at  the  other  extreme:  an  appalling
       immigration  history;  a  doubtful  relationship;  no   children;   a
       separation that causes no or limited  disruption  and  few  financial
       consequences; an uncertain outcome for the proposed  application  for
       entry clearance and little or no attempt to establish  the  applicant
       meets the requirements of the Rules.


    8. Both extreme examples do no more than establish that such  cases  are
       fact-sensitive. As the Court of Appeal rightly  pointed  out,  it  is
       normally the preserve of the First-tier Tribunal to make findings  of
       fact. Unusually, in Chikwamba,  the  House  of  Lords  made  its  own
       findings  of  fact  in  order  to  substitute  a  different  ultimate
       conclusion. It is, however, clear that the appeal was decided by  the
       House of Lords on its facts and whilst the legal thinking remains  as
       clear and persuasive as ever, it would be wrong to elevate its  fact-
       finding function (making 'the  substantive  Article  8  decision  for
       itself') to the status of a factual precedent.


    9. In essence, the fact-finder has  to  strike  a  balance  between  the
       legitimate public interest in ensuring, on  the  one  hand,  that  an
       applicant does not achieve an unfair advantage  by  his  own  illegal
       conduct and, on the  other,  the  respondent  using  the  applicant's
       illegal conduct to make life just as difficult as it  might  possibly
       be for him by making compliance an unreasonable burden for  the  sake
       of little more than amour propre, even though that might  fall  short
       of an abuse of power.


   10. As the Judge correctly pointed out in the present appeal,  the  House
       of Lords reasoning has now to be assessed by reference to a new legal
       landscape.  That does not mean that the reasoning ceases to  be  good
       law.  Rather, the common sense of requiring the Secretary of State to
       apply her policies only when there is a sensible reason for doing  so
       has to be re-assessed when a policy has become a rule and  compliance
       with the rule has become a requirement dictated by  Parliament.  Lord
       Brown asked himself what purpose  was  served  and  what  was  to  be
       achieved by the policy.  That approach loses much of its force when a
       policy becomes the law which the Courts and Tribunals are required to
       follow.


   11. For these reasons, we conclude that the First-tier Tribunal reached a
       proper and lawful conclusion on the facts and on the law.


DECISION

       The Judge  made  no  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  the  original
       determination of the appeal shall stand.
