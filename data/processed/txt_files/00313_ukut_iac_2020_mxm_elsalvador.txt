Decision makers should where  possible  apply  the  guidance  in  the  Equal
Treatment Bench Book and use gender terminology which  respects  the  chosen
identity of claimants before them.

The principles in HJ (Iran) are concerned  with  the  protection  of  innate
characteristics. As such they are  to  be  applied  in  claims  relating  to
gender identity.




                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of El Salvador born in 1991.


 2. The Appellant identifies as non-binary. Having had regard to Chapter 12
    of the Equal Treatment Bench Book I began the  hearing  by  asking  the
    Appellant what form of  address  they  would  like  to  be  used.   The
    Appellant requested that I use the gender pronoun 'Mx'. I have  amended
    the file accordingly and have used gender-neutral terms  throughout  my
    decision.


 3. The Appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal to dismiss their appeal on protection grounds.




    Basis of the Protection Claim


 4. Although today the Appellant identifies as non-binary, when  living  in
    El Salvador they considered themselves a homosexual man.  The basis  of
    the claim is that they would, for  reason  of  their  membership  of  a
    particular social group (LGBTI), face a real risk of persecution in  El
    Salvador. They averred that they had been subjected to  persecution  in
    the past, by the police and the general public, and that they would  be
    again. They further claimed that their appearance was  such  that  they
    would be identifiable as/perceived to be gay or transgender and as such
    would be reasonably likely to face  violent  attack  at  the  hands  of
    virulently homo/trans-phobic gangs which the police would, or could, do
    nothing to protect them against.


    Case History and the Respondent's Refusal


 5. The 'reasons for refusal' letter is dated the 27th November  2019.  The
    circumstances in which this decision arose were that the Appellant  had
    made further submissions following an earlier  refusal  of  protection.
    The original claim had been lodged on the 9th October 2017. It had been
    refused and the Appellant's first appeal was dismissed  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on the 17th January  2019.     Further  submissions  were
    lodged on the 27th September 2019 which the Respondent deemed to have a
    "realistic prospect of success" before a properly directed Tribunal and
    so, in accordance with paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules, issued a
    'fresh claim' refusal,  attracting  a  second  right  of  appeal.   The
    Respondent accepted that the Appellant was a  member  of  a  particular
    social group but refused protection on the grounds that  the  Appellant
    could receive a 'sufficiency of protection' from the Salvadoran State.




    The First-tier Tribunal Decision


 6. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself to the principles  set  out  in
    the Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-territorial  effect)  Sri
    Lanka [2002] UKIAT 00702*.  The effect of that decision  was  that  the
    Tribunal was bound to take the earlier findings, made by the First-tier
    Tribunal in 2019, as its starting point.   In  2019  the  Tribunal  had
    concluded that the Appellant had not demonstrated  that  they  were  at
    risk of persecution. Even if they had, as claimed, been beaten  up  and
    spat on by the police in 2013 this  incident  had  not  been  repeated;
    having urine and rubbish thrown at them in the street  amounted  to  no
    more than  discrimination;  the  evidence  did  not  suggest  that  the
    Appellant had faced systematic  discrimination  at  the  hands  of  the
    state; healthcare professionals and police officers receive  specialist
    human rights training; it had not been established that  the  violence/
    "particularly  high  murder   rate"   in   El   Salvador   included   a
    disproportionate number of gay victims.


 7. In 2020 the Tribunal heard evidence from the  Appellant  and  concluded
    that the evidence was as it had been  in  2019.  Before  they  left  El
    Salvador the  Appellant  had  endured  daily  discrimination  including
    having rubbish, drinks cans and on one occasion a bag of  urine  thrown
    at them.  The Appellant had relied on their change  in  appearance  and
    identity since the decision in 2019. The Appellant now wore their  hair
    long and dyed blond and, it was submitted, this  would  attract  a  far
    higher level of animosity from homophobic  elements  within  Salvadoran
    society. The First-tier Tribunal did not find this element of the claim
    to be made out. The Tribunal accepted that the Appellant  has  in  this
    country  been  actively  involved  in   numerous   LGBTI   events   and
    organisations.  It was not however satisfied that these  matters  would
    put them at risk because no one in El Salvador would know  about  these
    activities.

 8. In respect of the Appellant's personal circumstances the  Tribunal  was
    provided with evidence that their mental health  had  deteriorated  and
    they were now receiving counselling and anti-depressants. The  Tribunal
    concluded that since the Appellant's conditions fell short  of  meeting
    the high threshold necessary to engage Article 3  ECHR,  these  matters
    did not represent a change in circumstance which would permit departure
    from the 2019 decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. Turning to the objective country background material the Tribunal noted
    a Human Rights Watch report dealing with the position  of  Salvadoreans
    deported  from  the  United  States.  The  report  stated   that   LGBT
    individuals face 'specific threats' upon return. Such individuals  face
    rejection from their families and so  receive  no  support  during  the
    integration process. Gangs  target  LGBT  people,  subjecting  them  to
    sexual violence and extortion. Several LGBT  returnees  reported  being
    beaten or sexually assaulted by the police.  Of  this  information  the
    Tribunal concluded:

         "In our view that section of the report did not paint  a  different
         picture of the conditions in El Salvador than that portrayed in the
         objective evidence that was  before  [the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
         2019]. The same can be said for the Country Report on Human  Rights
         Practices in El Salvador  dated  13th  March  2019.  The  objective
         evidence confirms that El Salvador has a problem with violent crime
         but  it  was  not  suggested  to  us  that  the   conditions   were
         sufficiently severe to engage article 15(c) [1].

      On that basis the appeal was dismissed.


    Errors of Law: Discussion and Findings


10. This is a claim raising a fear of persecution for reasons of membership
    of a particular social group. That group is defined by the  Appellant's
    sexual orientation and gender identity. As  such  decision  makers  are
    bound to apply the principles set out by  the  House  of  Lords  in  HJ
    (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    [2010] UKSC 31.


11. At paragraph 82 of HJ (Iran) Lord Rodger sets out the  legal  framework
    for enquiry to be applied to such claims:

         82. When an applicant applies for asylum on the ground of  a  well-
         founded fear of persecution because he is gay,  the  tribunal  must
         first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is
         gay, or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors in
         his country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must then ask itself whether it is satisfied on
         the available evidence that gay people who lived  openly  would  be
         liable to persecution in the applicant's country of nationality.


         If so, the tribunal must go on  to  consider  what  the  individual
         applicant would do if he were returned  to  that  country.  If  the
         applicant would in fact live openly and thereby  be  exposed  to  a
         real risk of persecution,  then  he  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
         persecution  -  even  if  he  could  avoid  the  risk   by   living
         "discreetly".


         If, on the other hand, the tribunal concludes  that  the  applicant
         would in fact live discreetly and so avoid persecution, it must  go
         on to ask itself why he would do so. If the tribunal concludes that
         the applicant would choose to live discreetly simply  because  that
         was how he himself  would  wish  to  live,  or  because  of  social
         pressures   eg, not wanting to distress his  parents  or  embarrass
         his friends,  then  his  application  should  be  rejected.  Social
         pressures of that  kind  do  not  amount  to  persecution  and  the
         Convention does not offer protection against them.  Such  a  person
         has no well-founded fear of persecution because, for  reasons  that
         have nothing to do with any fear of persecution, he himself chooses
         to adopt a way of life which means that he is not in fact liable to
         be persecuted because he  is  gay.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the
         tribunal concludes that a material reason for the applicant  living
         discreetly on his return would be a fear of the  persecution  which
         would follow if he were to live openly as a gay  man,  then,  other
         things being equal, his application  should  be  accepted.  Such  a
         person has a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution.  To  reject  his
         application on the ground that he could avoid  the  persecution  by
         living discreetly would be to  defeat  the  very  right  which  the
         Convention exists to protect - his right to live freely and  openly
         as a gay man without fear  of  persecution.  By  admitting  him  to
         asylum and allowing him to live freely and  openly  as  a  gay  man
         without fear of persecution, the receiving state  gives  effect  to
         that  right  by  affording  the  applicant  a  surrogate  for   the
         protection from persecution which his country of nationality should
         have afforded him.

12. To date these principles have not been applied  in  this  case.  HJ  is
    neither cited nor applied in the Respondent's refusal letter. Nor  does
    it feature in the reasoning of  either  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decisions. It is the  framework  that  I  now  apply  when  considering
    whether the 2020 decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for  any
    error of law.


    Q1: Is the Appellant a member of a particular social group?

13. Lord Rodger's first question is this:

         "When an applicant applies for asylum on  the  ground  of  a  well-
         founded fear of persecution because he is gay,  the  tribunal  must
         first ask itself whether it is satisfied on the evidence that he is
         gay or that he would be treated as gay by potential persecutors  in
         his country of nationality".

14. In this case the Respondent accepted, as long ago  as  2018,  that  the
    Appellant identified as, and in El Salvador was treated as, a gay  man.
      That was not however, the extent of the evidence. This  was  a  fresh
    claim. That claim  was  based  largely  on  the  fact  that  since  the
    Appellant had come to live in the United Kingdom  they  had,  with  the
    assistance of a specialist support group in Liverpool, further explored
    their identity. They had changed their appearance and feared that  they
    would in El Salvador be seen as a transgender woman. By the date of the
    appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal   the   Appellant   expressly
    identified as non-binary.   The First-tier Tribunal does not appear  to
    have doubted that assertion, but nowhere is it positively recognised as
    a factor relevant to either the procedural disposal of the  appeal,  or
    the question of risk.


15. In procedural terms the failure to  make  a  positive  finding  on  the
    Appellant's identity meant that they  were  throughout  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision referred to as 'he'.  As the  Equal  Treatment  Bench
    Book notes: "it is important to respect a person's gender  identity  by
    using appropriate terms of address, names  and  pronouns.  Everyone  is
    entitled to  respect  for  their  gender  identity,  private  life  and
    personal dignity". The Bench Book goes on to  observe:  "it  should  be
    possible to recognise a person's gender identity and their present name
    for nearly all court and tribunal purposes, regardless of whether  they
    have obtained legal recognition of their gender  by  way  of  a  Gender
    Recognition Certificate"  (Chapter  12,  March  2020  revision).   This
    guidance is consonant with that given to Home Office caseowners. In the
    June 2011 Asylum Policy  Instruction  Gender  Identity  Issues  in  the
    Asylum Claim decision makers are advised:


         "As with anyone who lives by a name other than their birth name,  a
         transgender applicant should be given respect and  referred  to  by
         their chosen name. If in any doubt, an applicant  should  be  asked
         which personal pronoun and salutation he or she would like used".

16. There will no doubt be cases where there might be justification for not
    following this guidance: a case where,  for  instance  a  claim  to  be
    transgender has been expressly rejected  as  false.    Decision  makers
    should however where possible apply the guidance in the Equal Treatment
    Bench Book  and  use  gender  terminology  which  respects  the  chosen
    identity of claimants before them.  There was no reason not  to  do  so
    here, where  the  self-identification  of  the  Appellant  was  neither
    challenged nor doubted.


17. In terms of the substantive protection issue it is not clear the extent
    to which the First-tier Tribunal  understood  how  the  claim  advanced
    before it had evolved. In  2019  the  Tribunal's  focus  had  been  the
    treatment that the Appellant had endured as a  gay  man  living  in  El
    Salvador between 2011 (when they came out) and 2016 (when  they  left).
    Today the claim was not simply that the Appellant  was  homosexual,  it
    was that in the relative safety  of  the  United  Kingdom  their  whole
    identity had fundamentally changed.   This is acknowledged by the First-
    tier Tribunal at its �42 where it records the  evidence  of  specialist
    psychotherapist Lucy Martin that the Appellant now identifies  as  non-
    binary, but nowhere is that matter considered, nor finding  made.    At
    �37 the Tribunal appears to reduce this evidence, concerned  as  it  is
    with the core of the Appellant's identity as a human being, to this:

         "The factors that are different relate to the Appellant's change of
         appearance, his style of dress, his dyed hair..."

18. Had the Tribunal squarely confronted the evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    changed identity, and made findings on it from  the  outset,  it  would
    have been far better placed to answer the remaining questions posed  by
    Lord Rodger in HJ (Iran).  The Appellant was no longer a  gay  man  but
    was now a member of the wider LGBTI community.




    Q2. Do members of this particular social group face persecution  in  El
    Salvador if they live openly?

19. The short answer reached by the First-tier Tribunal was no. As  I  have
    already identified, that finding is already in  some  difficulty  given
    that the Tribunal had not accurately identified the parameters  of  the
    social group it  was  considering.  I  am  however  satisfied  that  in
    reaching that conclusion the Tribunal erred  in  three  other  discrete
    respects.


20. The first is in its failure to consider all of the  relevant  evidence.
    There was a good deal of country background material before the  First-
    tier Tribunal detailing  the  treatment  of  LGBTI  individuals  in  El
    Salvador.  There was specific evidence relating to the ill-treatment of
    those who were perceived to be transgender  women.   Mr  Wood  submits,
    with justification, that none of that  evidence  is  addressed  in  the
    decision. In particular Mr Wood complains that  the  UNHCR  Eligibility
    Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs  of  Asylum
    Seekers from El Salvador, which he had placed  at  the  centre  of  his
    submissions before the First-tier Tribunal, do not feature  at  all  in
    the Tribunal's reasoning. Mr Wood relies upon Court of Appeal authority
    to the effect that the views expressed by UNHCR will "typically command
    very considerable respect": see for instance HF (Iraq) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1276. He submits that  in
    light of that it was incumbent upon the Tribunal to at  least  consider
    that material, highlights of which include:


         "Discrimination against individuals of diverse  sexual  orientation
         and/or gender identities is reportedly  widespread  in  El-Salvador
         and such persons have consistently been targeted  for  attacks  and
         murder by gangs and other sectors  of  society,  including  by  the
         police  and  other  public  authorities....As  noted   above,   the
         Salvadorian gangs are reported to possess  a  strong  macho  ethos,
         which reportedly expresses itself  on  an  everyday  basis  through
         their virulent hatred and ill-treatment of persons based  on  their
         sexual orientation and/or gender identity "


21. The second error is perversity. Although that is  a  high  test,  I  am
    satisfied that it is here made out.  At its �44 the Tribunal summarises
    the evidence contained in the one country background report to  receive
    mention  in  the  decision,  the  February  2020  Human  Rights   Watch
    publication Deported to  Danger:  United  States  Deportation  Policies
    Expose  Salvodorans  to  Death  and  Abuse.  The  Tribunal  begins   by
    cautioning itself that the report does not "correlate  well"  with  the
    Appellant's case since the Appellant is not a deportee from America.  I
    find it hard to understand why this distinction is made.  Although  the
    Appellant is not facing 'deportation' as we would understand that  term
    of art, and they are obviously not in the United States, the  focus  of
    the report is on persons who are returning to the country after  having
    sought refuge abroad, the precise situation that the Tribunal was being
    asked to consider. As to what conditions they might face, the  Tribunal
    summarised the evidence in the report as follows:


         "LGBT people who are deported from the United States to El Salvador
         are likely to face 'specific threats'. Research had found that LGBT
         people in El Salvador are often rejected by their families  meaning
         there would be no family support during the  reintegration  process
         and that gangs had targeted LGBT  people  on  the  basis  of  their
         sexual orientation, subjected some to sexual violence and extorting
         others  due  to  their  perceived   vulnerability.   Several   LGBT
         Salvadoreans had also reported being beaten or  sexually  assaulted
         by the police".


22. From this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that  LGBTI  individuals  do
    not face a risk of persecution in El Salvador.  Without  more  detailed
    explanation I am  at  a  loss  to  understand  how  that  evidence  was
    logically capable of underpinning that conclusion.   The  evidence  was
    capable of being read to mean  that  some  LGBTI  people  might  escape
    serious harm; it did not support the conclusion that LGBTI  people  are
    as a general matter safe from persecution.    I  should  add  that  the
    passage cited by the Tribunal is incomplete. The rest of it reads:

         "In January 2019, Camila D�az Cordova, a transgender woman deported
         from the United States, was beaten  to  death.  In  July,  the  FGR
         charged three police officers with her  kidnapping  and  aggravated
         homicide. The case remained open at the time of writing. Within the
         span of one month in late 2019, three transgender women and one gay
         man  were  murdered  in  El  Salvador  in  circumstances  that  led
         activists to suspect they were hate crimes".

23. The third error is in the  approach  taken  to  the  Appellant's  lived
    experience. In their evidence the Appellant narrates daily abuse  which
    included having rubbish - including drinks cans and on one  occasion  a
    bag of urine - thrown at them. Such assaults would also be  accompanied
    by verbal homophobic abuse.   In 2013 the Appellant was subjected to an
    assault by five police officers in San Salvador.  The officers  stopped
    the Appellant in the street to ask why their hair was blond.  When  the
    Appellant replied "because I like  it"  the  officers  pushed  them  up
    against a wall and for a period of  about  five  minutes  "slapped  and
    punched" the Appellant whilst subjected them to homophobic insults  and
    spitting on them.


24. The 2019 Tribunal's global conclusion about all of  that,  endorsed  by
    the 2020 Tribunal, was this: "even at its  highest,  I  consider  these
    incidents, whilst  undoubtedly  unpleasant,  amount  to  discrimination
    rather than persecution".   Although this is not a point raised in  the
    grounds, I am satisfied that this  amounts  to  a  misdirection  and  a
    Robinson obvious[2] error of law.

25. Article 9 of the Qualification Directive defines as a minimum  standard
    an 'act of persecution' as follows:

         1. Acts of persecution within the meaning of article  1  A  of  the
         Geneva Convention must:


         (a) be sufficiently serious by their nature  or  repetition  as  to
         constitute a severe violation of basic human rights, in  particular
         the rights from which derogation cannot be made under Article 15(2)
         of the European Convention for the Protection of Human  Rights  and
         Fundamental Freedoms; or


         (b) be an accumulation of various measures, including violations of
         human  rights  which  is  sufficiently  severe  as  to  affect   an
         individual in a similar manner as mentioned in (a).


          2. Acts of persecution as qualified in  paragraph  1,  can,  inter
         alia, take the form of:


         (a) acts of physical or mental violence, including acts  of  sexual
         violence;
         (b) legal, administrative, police, and/or judicial  measures  which
         are in themselves discriminatory or  which  are  implemented  in  a
         discriminatory manner;
         (c)  prosecution  or  punishment,  which  is  disproportionate   or
         discriminatory;
         (d) denial of judicial redress resulting in a  disproportionate  or
         discriminatory punishment;
         (e) prosecution or  punishment  for  refusal  to  perform  military
         service in a conflict,  where  performing  military  service  would
         include crimes or acts falling under the exclusion clauses  as  set
         out in Article 12(2);
         (f) acts of a gender-specific or child-specific nature.


         3. In accordance with Article 2(c),  there  must  be  a  connection
         between the reasons  mentioned  in  Article  10  and  the  acts  of
         persecution as qualified in paragraph 1.

26. Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
    and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) is  one  of  the  non-derogable  rights
    referenced at Article 9(1)(a):


         No one shall be subjected to torture or  to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment.


27. In HJ (Iran) Lord Hope noted that 'persecution' has been recognised  as
    a strong word. It will not cover  each  and  any  harm  experienced  by
    individuals seeking protection; it would not for instance  include  the
    disapproval of family members or wider society. The harm feared must be
    of sufficient severity, and there must be a nexus to one or more of the
    core rights protected by  the  Refugee  Convention.  To  this  end  the
    Supreme Court endorsed Professor Hathaway's oft-cited formulation:


         "In sum, persecution is most appropriately defined as the sustained
         or systemic failure of state protection in relation to one  of  the
         core entitlements which has been recognized  by  the  international
         community."[3]


28. Lord Hope further cites with approval the dicta of the  High  Court  of
    Australia  in  Appellant  S395/2002  v  Minister  for  Immigration  and
    Multicultural Affairs (2003) 216 CLR 473 in which McHugh and  Kirby  JJ
    say [at �40]:


         "Persecution covers many forms of harm ranging from  physical  harm
         to the loss  of  intangibles,  from  death  and  torture  to  state
         sponsored or condoned discrimination in social life and employment.
         Whatever form the harm takes, it will constitute  persecution  only
         if, by reason of its intensity or duration, the  person  persecuted
         cannot reasonably be expected to tolerate it."
29. Applying this guidance to the findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  I
    consider first the incident involving five police  officers.  Five  men
    surround one person. The men are in uniform and are - I assume  in  the
    context of El Salvador - armed. They  hold  a  considerable  amount  of
    power over the individual concerned. There are reports of men like that
    beating, sexually assaulting  or  even  killing  individuals  like  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant is taunted, pushed, slapped, punched and spat
    upon in an assault lasting approximately five minutes before being left
    lying in the  street.  The  sole  reason  advanced  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for its conclusion that this did not amount to persecution  is
    that the Appellant did not go through a similar experience again.  This
    allusion to a lack of persistence does not amount to an analysis of the
    event itself.  Article 9 (1)(a) of the Qualification Directive provides
    that  an  act  of  persecution  is  one  sufficiently  serious  by  its
    repetition or "nature", the signatory states here  recognising  that  a
    single violation of a non-derogable right can be sufficient,  and  that
    repetition  is  not  necessary:  this  recalls   Professor   Hathaway's
    'hierarchy' of  rights,  to  which  I  return  below.   Article  9  (2)
    elaborates that an act constituting a severe violation of  basic  human
    rights can include (but not be limited to):


         "(a) acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of  sexual
         violence;
         (b) legal, administrative, police, and/or judicial  measures  which
         are in themselves discriminatory or  which  are  implemented  in  a
         discriminatory manner"


30. The Appellant does not claim  to  have  sustained  any  serious  injury
    during this assault, but it was a  physical  assault,  by  the  police,
    motivated by nothing other than homophobia. Five minutes is a long time
    to be beaten. I do not doubt that it was for the Appellant a terrifying
    experience  and  one  capable  of  reaching  the  minimum  standard  of
    qualification set out in Article 9(2)(a).  To be surrounded by  men  in
    authority, taunted, physically attacked and spat  upon  was  surely  an
    exercise in humiliation designed to punish the  Appellant  for  nothing
    more than being who they are. The power imbalance between  perpetrators
    and victim, and the nature  of  the  assault,  made  it  of  sufficient
    severity to constitute "inhuman and degrading  treatment"  contrary  to
    Article 3 ECHR, a non-derogable core entitlement.


31. The other aspect of the historical claim advanced by the  Appellant  is
    that on a daily basis, over a number of years, they were  subjected  to
    abuse by people in the local community which included the  throwing  of
    projectiles. Both the 2019 and 2020 Tribunals appear to have  proceeded
    on the assumption that this behaviour was not capable  of  constituting
    serious harm.  I am satisfied that for  two  reasons  this  finding  is
    flawed.

32. The first is that neither Tribunal explored in any detail the  incident
    described by the Appellant where they were hit by a bag of urine  -  by
    any estimation, and for any  victim,  surely  an  act  of  inhuman  and
    degrading treatment.  Nor was any  particular  attention  paid  to  the
    evidence that the  projectiles  very  often  included  cans  of  drink,
    sometimes partially or entirely full: to be hit by even a half-full can
    of drink is a physical assault capable of causing bruising or cuts.

33. The second difficulty with this finding is that  no  consideration  has
    been given to whether the events described are capable of  constituting
    'acts of persecution' within the meaning of  Article  9(1):  were  they
    sufficiently serious by their repetition and accumulation to constitute
    a severe violation of a basic human right. In The Law of Refugee Status
    Professor Hathaway suggests that 'serious harms' can  be  placed  in  a
    hierarchy. The most  serious  violations  -  extrajudicial  killing  or
    torture, from which there can be no derogation -  will  always  attract
    the protection of the Convention. Violations of lesser magnitude -  for
    instance an interference with cultural  rights  -  would  only  attract
    protection where it could be shown that by their  systemic  application
    the violations, considered cumulatively, amounted to serious  harm  for
    the individual concerned.  It is here that the nexus to the  Convention
    ground becomes relevant. If an  individual  has  to  suffer  the  daily
    degradation of telling his children that there is no food to put on the
    table, this is not a matter covered by the Convention: as hard as  that
    might be to bear for the individual concerned it is  a  matter  outwith
    the bounds of refugee protection. Where  however  the  harm  feared  is
    expressly inflicted in order to punish or prevent the  individual  from
    exercising  a  core  entitlement  -  here  'membership'  of  the  LGBTI
    community - then a causal nexus can be established.


34. Where such abuse is occasional,  it  may  reasonably  be  described  as
    harassment. Where however this is inflicted on  a  daily  basis,  every
    time the Appellant leaves the  house,  with  the  direct  intention  of
    "pursuing  with  malignancy  or  injurious  action"  -  the  dictionary
    definition preferred by Nolan J in R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal,  Ex
    parte Jonah [1985] Imm AR 7 - then it  may  legitimately  be  held  to
    constitute persecution of the type conceived by Article 9(1)(b) of  the
    QD.  In this case the harm inflicted  ranged  on  a  daily  basis  from
    verbal abuse to the degrading physical ill-treatment of being  showered
    with rubbish or urine.  It is inflicted for no reason  other  than  the
    Appellant's   perceived   sexuality/gender    identity.     In    those
    circumstances it cannot automatically be reduced to "discrimination" or
    "harassment". I am satisfied that it reaches the threshold  in  Article
    9. As the Australian High Court expressed it in App  S395/2002,  it  is
    harm of such intensity and duration that  the  person  experiencing  it
    cannot reasonably be expected to tolerate it.   LGBT people should  not
    be expected to "tolerate" being abused and  having  rubbish  thrown  at
    them every single day of their lives.




    Q3. How would the Appellant behave if returned home?
    Q4. If he chooses to live discreetly  is  any  part  of  that  decision
    informed by a fear of persecution?


35. The third and fourth questions posed by Lord Rodger were the subject of
    the controversy that led to the decision  in  HJ  (Iran):  whether  gay
    claimants could reasonably be expected to behave "discreetly" in  order
    to avoid persecution. The answer, held the court, was that the  enquiry
    is a mixed question of law and fact. Signatory states  cannot  abdicate
    their responsibility  to  offer  protection  by  telling  the  putative
    refugee to give up the  very  rights  that  the  Convention  exists  to
    uphold. On the other hand a claimant who would choose to conceal  their
    protected characteristic for reasons entirely unrelated  to  fear,  and
    thereby secure their own safety, will not be entitled to protection.


36. Neither of these questions receive a particularly clear answer from the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It appears to be assumed that the Appellant would
    be 'out' if returned to El Salvador. This was no  doubt  based  on  the
    accepted evidence that they had to some degree been 'out' in the  past,
    although the Appellant's more nuanced evidence on this  matter  is  not
    expressly considered:

         "I have not even been able to conduct a relationship in public,  or
         even  hold  the  hand  of  my  partner  in  public,  for  fear   of
         repercussion from the public".


    Nor can either question have been sensibly answered in the absence of a
    proper analysis of the risk of harm to LGBTI individuals.   In  respect
    of how the Appellant might manifest  their  identity  if  returned  the
    First-tier Tribunal recognises that in this country they  could  fairly
    be described as an LGBTI activist, but fails to  consider  any  of  the
    following matters: whether the Appellant could continue in that work if
    returned home, whether they might elect not to do so, and if  that  was
    their decision, whether it would be  a  choice  made  out  of  fear  of
    persecution.     The reasoning on this activism appears to be  confined
    to the commentary at the Tribunal's �40 that the Appellant's work  here
    would not become known  to  people  in  El  Salvador.  That  was,  with
    respect, not the only matter that  needed  to  be  considered.  It  was
    incumbent  upon  the  Tribunal  to  consider  whether  the  Appellant's
    political work - ie his active involvement in numerous LGBTI events and
    organisations - fell at the core  or  the  margin  of  their  right  to
    identify as gay/trans/non-binary.

37. For all of the foregoing reasons I set the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal aside.




    The Re-Made Decision

38. In my risk assessment I follow the framework set out by Lord Rodger  in
    HJ (Iran).


39. I am satisfied that the Appellant is a member of  a  particular  social
    group. At the time  that  the  Appellant  was  refused  protection  the
    Respondent had accepted this, defining the group as  'homosexual  men'.
    As I set out above, the Appellant's identity had by  the  time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing evolved so that they considered  themselves
    'non-binary', that is to say they consider themselves to  fall  outwith
    the fixed gender  binary  of  female-male;  shortly  before  the  final
    hearing before me Mr Wood confirmed that this  remains  the  case,  but
    that his client would also be happy with  the  terms  'she'  or  'her'.
    Regardless of what  label  we,  or  Salvadorans,  might  affix  to  the
    Appellant I am satisfied that for the purpose of this  risk  assessment
    their identity is visibly 'other'. When the Appellant arrived  in  this
    country they wore their hair short and  dark;  today  it  is  long  and
    platinum blond.   They will appear, and will  be  perceived,  to  be  a
    transgender woman.


40. Applying HJ (Iran) the next question I must ask  myself  is  this:   do
    members of this particular social group face persecution in El Salvador
    if they live openly?

41. In considering this matter I have the benefit of a new  Country  Policy
    and Information Note (CPIN) entitled Gangs:  El Salvador. This document
    was published in February 2020 in the  hiatus  between  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing and  its  decision  being  promulgated.  Both  parties
    agreed that it should be  admitted  into  evidence  upon  remaking  and
    having regard to Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, I do so.  It is important for two reasons. In  broad  brush
    strokes the decisions below were built on two premises: that  the  harm
    endured by LGBTI people in El Salvador amounted only to discrimination,
    and that sufficient protection was offered by the state.   The CPIN now
    contains material contrary to both of those conclusions.


42. First, the CPIN sets out evidence from multiple respected sources  that
    as well as suffering significant levels of discrimination LGBTI  people
    are also subject to serious harm in El Salvador [at  section  10.7].  I
    note that the sources emphasise that transgender women are particularly
    at risk:

         10.7.1 The IRBC IGMR on women and sexual  minorities  of  September
         2016 based on a range of sources noted:


         'Several interlocutors indicated that LGBTI persons in El  Salvador
         are  discriminated  against,  ill-treated,  marginalized,[...]  and
         persecuted.[...] The Salvadoran Red  Cross  indicated  that  social
         violence affects the LGBTI population.  The  LGBTI  Justice  Clinic
         (Asistencia Legal para la Diversidad  Sexual/LGBTI,  ALDES)  stated
         that due to  marginalization  and  discrimination,  which  includes
         family members  and  the  society  at  large,  LGBTI  persons  face
         obstacles when trying to access education at  schools,  employment,
         and health care. They also  face  obstacles  accessing  housing  as
         landlords refuse to rent  them  a  place.[...]  The  Among  Friends
         Association  noted  that  in  order  to  secure  employment,  LGBTI
         individuals must hide their gender identity or sexual  orientation.
         The Organization for the Promotion and Defense of Human  Rights  of
         LGBTI Persons (Organizaci�n para la Promoci�n y Defensa de los DDHH
         de  la  Poblaci�n  LGBTI,  COMCAVIS-TRANS)  similarly  stated  that
         transgender persons are four times more discriminated  than  women,
         and they also  face  problems  when  trying  to  access  education,
         banking and credit,  and  employment  in  the  private  and  public
         sectors. Employment for transgendered persons is  limited,  and  is
         usually in sex work, and as street  vendors  and  hairdressers.  In
         2015, three LGBTI persons committed  suicide  because  of  lack  of
         family or state support. LGBTI  persons  are  also  the  object  of
         police ill-treatment and harassment, extortion, physical  violence,
         sexual violence, and physical and psychological violence. They  are
         also forced by gangs  to  smuggle  illegal  goods  and  drugs  into
         prisons...'


         ...


         10.7.3 The UNSR for IDPs noted in her report of April 2018 that:


         'Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender  and  intersex
         community, particularly transgender women, are highly vulnerable to
         violence and hate crimes... Under such a threat of  violence,  many
         members of the community have been displaced internally,  often  on
         several occasions. The Special Rapporteur met transgender women who
         described  threats,  assassination  attempts  and  intimidation  by
         gangs, as well as by  members  of  the  police  and  military,  and
         discrimination and abuse by all authorities. In  one  municipality,
         social media disseminated a message from a gang stating that  every
         transgender person would be killed, leaving  14  people  having  to
         seek safety in San Salvador or abroad.


         10.7.4 The IDMC report 2018, based on a range of sources, noted


         'The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT)  people  are
         not respected, and the community is deeply affected by  stigma  and
         violence. Discrimination  and  exclusion  limits  their  access  to
         education, work and career opportunities. There is no comprehensive
         legislation to protect the LGBT community, nor any legal obligation
         for state actors not to discriminate against it.  Anyone  who  does
         not appear to fit patriarchal gender norms is  targeted,  but  most
         criminal attacks on LGBT people are against trans women,  who  live
         "a life of abuse that is a continuum of violence".'


         10.7.5 IDMC report 2018 also noted:


         'LGBT people flee violence perpetrated by their families, gangs and
         the   security   forces.   Trans   women   in   particular   suffer
         intersectional persecution, a situation that  "the  state  promotes
         with its silence".[...] The violence meted out  by  criminal  gangs
         tends to be either because of their sexual  orientation  or  gender
         identity,  or  general  criminal  violence  used  to  force   their
         collaboration. 'LGBT people are not recruited into gangs,  but  may
         be made to collaborate in other ways. They may be forced to smuggle
         goods into prison, store weapons or drugs, undertake other criminal
         activities or give up a  proportion  of  their  earnings.  If  they
         refuse, they may receive death threats or be  assaulted,  which  in
         turn may lead to their displacement.[...] 'Displacement can also be
         provoked if a gang does  not  want  LGBT  people  living  in  their
         territory.'


         10.7.6 Human Rights Watch noted in its report  covering  events  in
         2019 that  'LGBT  individuals  remain  targets  of  homophobic  and
         transphobic violence by police, gangs, and others.'


43. This evidence, from inter alia the Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  of
    Canada,  the  United  Nations  Special  Rapporteur  and  the   Internal
    Displacement Monitoring Centre at the University of London, is accepted
    by the Respondent to demonstrate that LGBTI  people,  and  specifically
    trans people, are particularly at risk of violence in El  Salvador  [at
    2.4.8]:


         "LGBTI persons,  particularly  trans  persons,  are  vulnerable  to
         discrimination, violence and hate  crimes  from  state  actors  and
         society generally. Gangs are also reported to coerce LGBTI  persons
         to assist them to carry out their criminal activities  and  subject
         them to violence".


44. In respect  of  whether  the  El  Salvadoran  government  can  offer  a
    sufficiency of protection  to  persons  targeted  by  gangs,  the  CPIN
    concludes that as a general matter, it cannot [at 2.5.13]:


         In general, given the weaknesses in the criminal justice system and
         the size, capability and influence of the  main  gangs,  while  the
         state is likely to be willing it is unlikely to be able to  provide
         effective protection. However, each case will need to be considered
         on its facts, taking into account the nature, capability and intent
         of the gang and the profile of person in fear of harm.


45. As to the specific measures implemented to protect the LGBTI community,
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal to defeat the Appellant's  claim,
    the CPIN highlights this evidence:

         10.7.2 The USSD human rights report 2018 states that:


         'The law prohibits discrimination based on  sexual  orientation  or
         gender identity, which also applies to discrimination  in  housing,
         employment, nationality, and access to government services.  Gender
         identity and sexual orientation are included in the  criminal  code
         provisions covering hate crimes,  along  with  race  and  political
         affiliation. NGOs reported that public officials, including police,
         engaged in violence and discrimination against  sexual  minorities.
         Persons from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and  intersex
         (LGBTI) community stated that the PNC, and the  Attorney  General's
         Office harassed transgender and gay individuals when they  reported
         cases of violence against LGBTI persons,  including  by  conducting
         strip searches.'


         10.7.3 The UNSR for IDPs noted in her report of April 2018 that:


         'While some bodies, including the Counsel  General's  Office,  have
         reportedly  shown  greater  openness  to  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
         transgender and intersex issues and concerns and a  willingness  to
         act,   to   date   no   specific   protection   mechanisms   exist.
         Representatives noted that many  in  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
         transgender and intersex community lack the resources  to  live  in
         safer neighbourhoods and have no choice but to live in poorer  gang
         affected localities. Transgender  people  sometimes  seek  relative
         safety by living together and establishing coping strategies. While
         no verified data exists, one community member stated that they  had
         documented "between 600 and 700 homicide cases" against members  of
         the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community with
         over 500 transgender women killed. According to them, no cases have
         gone to court, no one has been prosecuted and few cases  have  been
         investigated. One case that was brought to court related to  a  gay
         man who was killed while visiting from the United States.'


46. All of that is consonant with the UNHCR guidelines and the Human Rights
    Watch report which I refer to above.   In  light  of  that  uncontested
    background material I accept the Respondent's view  that  whilst  there
    are as a matter of law in El Salvador  measures  in  place  to  protect
    citizens from violence, the weaknesses in the criminal  justice  system
    are such that the state is in general unlikely to be  able  to  provide
    effective protection where individuals are facing violence from  gangs.
    Those gangs are, in the estimation of the UNCHR,  virulently  homo  and
    trans-phobic. Transwomen, or those  perceived  to  be  transwomen,  are
    particularly vulnerable. Although the sources cited do  not  offer  any
    explanation as to why that might be, one obvious explanation  could  be
    that unlike  gay  men  who  can  try  and  'pass'  for  straight,  many
    transwomen are, like the Appellant, visibly different.  As  researchers
    at the University of London put it, in the violent and macho culture of
    El Salvadoran gangs, "anyone who does not  appear  to  fit  patriarchal
    gender norms is targeted...most criminal attacks  on  LGBT  people  are
    against transwomen, who live "a life of abuse that is  a  continuum  of
    violence".  I further  note  that  the  Appellant's  account  of  being
    subject to homophobic assault by the police is entirely consistent with
    the information reproduced in the CPIN.


47. Having had regard to that country background evidence  I  am  satisfied
    that a transwoman, or someone perceived as  such,  who  tries  to  live
    openly in El Salvador would face persecution which may include  murder,
    rape and other sexual violence,  physical  assault  and  coercion  into
    criminal activities.  Although the state - or more accurately  elements
    of the state - may be willing to combat such harms the weakness of  the
    criminal justice system, including homo and  transphobic  attitudes  by
    police officers, are such that there is unlikely to be  a  'sufficiency
    of protection' in practice.


48. As to the final stage of my enquiry - how the Appellant would  live  if
    returned home and why- I have had regard  to  the  following  evidence.
    From the Appellant I have the  asylum  interview  record,  two  witness
    statements, and an interview that the  Appellant  conducted  'Jack  All
    Productions' for the purpose of a documentary video  in  June  2019.  I
    also have written evidence from Shereen Cowley and Mr  Mohammad  Taher.
    Ms Cowley and Mr Taher both have long  standing  involvement  with  the
    Liverpool Asylum and Refugee LGBTQ+ Support Network, she as  a  support
    worker with 'Many Hands, One Heart' , he  as  a  community  development
    worker with Merseycare NHS Trust. They have both  known  the  Appellant
    since 2017, and both have,  on  different  occasions,  attended  appeal
    hearings with the Appellant.

49. What emerges from that evidence is a complex,  and  appropriately  non-
    binary, picture.

50. Whilst living in El Salvador it would appear  that  the  Appellant  was
    prepared to push some boundaries. It was their dyed blond  hair  (still
    at that stage short) which led to the attack by the police in 2013.  It
    was their decisions to live with their partner, and  to  use  "feminine
    accessories" which led to the  daily  ritual  of  being  showered  with
    rubbish, pelted with cans and  homophobic  abuse.   It  was  this  ill-
    treatment which led  them  to  modify  their  behaviour,  for  instance
    deciding not to hold hands with male partners in public.

51. In their witness statement the Appellant explains how  having  left  El
    Salvador their desire to live openly has solidified:

         "Being here in the UK allows me to be the real me.  I  am  able  to
         dress how I want to; I am  able  to  talk  about  my  relationships
         openly and honestly. I am able to have  my  sexual  health  checked
         regularly and live openly without fear of being targeted or  abused
         because of the way I dress and I would be able to have a family  of
         my own.


         Whilst I have been here in the UK I have grown  in  confidence  and
         been able to express who I truly am without having to hide it  from
         the public... here I am able to develop a  sense  of  identity  and
         self-worth. I now feel I can walk on the  streets  with  pride  and
         without any fear. I feel I  have  evolved  into  the  real  me  and
         finally found myself"


52. Mr Taher and Ms Cowley both confirm that the Appellant has been heavily
    involved in various LGBTI activities in Liverpool, including  an  event
    to  mark  the  International  Day  Against  Homophobia,  Bi-phobia  and
    Transphobia, Liverpool Pride, and various campaigning/arts events.  The
    Appellant has twice spoken to large conferences of social workers about
    their  experiences,  and  they  helped  to  organise  and  perform   at
    celebrations to mark Refugee Week in Liverpool.  Mr Taher commends  the
    Appellant's "strong leadership" for LGBT+ asylum seekers  in  Liverpool
    over the past two years.  The Appellant has  worked alongside voluntary
    groups,  the  council,  social  workers  and  the  police  to  increase
    understanding of the challenges faced by this group.


53. Whilst this evidence, and past behaviour, would tend  to  suggest  that
    the Appellant may be  willing  to  live  'openly'  if  returned  to  El
    Salvador, the Appellant dispels any such notion:


         "I refuse to change myself I am who I am I  would  rather  take  my
         life here in the UK and  die  with  dignity  than  go  back  to  El
         Salvador where I will be without liberty, forced to hide who  I  am
         in fear of being mistreated, and ashamed to be the real me.  In  El
         Salvador I will have to hide everything about who I am. In the UK I
         have been involved in many public activities where I have  not  had
         to hide my  sexual  orientation;  I  could  never  do  this  in  El
         Salvador.


         I feel really anxious because with my  current  appearance  I  feel
         scared to go back to El Salvador..."


54. So although the Appellant did live, to some extent, openly as a gay man
    in El Salvador, and lives very openly  and  actively  as  a  non-binary
    individual here,  it is apparent that  they  are  extremely  frightened
    about continuing this should they be asked to return home: that this is
    so is further attested to by  the  various  medical  professionals  who
    confirm that the Appellant suffers from depression  and  anxiety  about
    their future.  I bear in mind that the Appellant has  already  left  El
    Salvador once because they could not tolerate the treatment  that  they
    endured there;  now  that  they  believe  themselves  to  be  far  more
    vulnerable to attack it  seems  likely  to  me  that  they  would  feel
    compelled to modify their  behaviour,  including  their  political  and
    social activism, to live  'discreetly'.    Having  had  regard  to  the
    country background evidence, and the evidence  personally  relating  to
    the Appellant, I am satisfied that they would do so for no reason other
    than a fear of persecution. There is for instance  no  suggestion  that
    the Appellant would do so because they are by nature a private  person.
    It follows that applying the principles in HJ (Iran) the appeal must be
    allowed.


    Anonymity Order

55. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Decisions


56. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors
    of law and it is set aside.

57. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on  protection  and  human
    rights grounds.

58. There is an order for anonymity.
