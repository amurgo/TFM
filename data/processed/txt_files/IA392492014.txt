For the Appellant:     Mr N Ahmed (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    H Narayan, promulgated on 20th January 2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Stoke-on-Trent on 5th January 2015.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Beatrice George Makuke, whereupon the Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Tanzania,  who  was  born  on  6th
    February 1983.  She appealed against the decision  of  the  Respondent,
    dated 16th September 2014, refusing her a variation of leave  to  enter
    or remain her decision to remove her under Section 47 of the 2006  Act.



The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she is applying for an extension of  stay
    in the United Kingdom as a spouse of a person present  and  settled  in
    this country.  Her spouse is a British citizen.  He has a child and the
    child was born on 28th August 1999 and lives with her  mother  and  the
    Sponsor is financially responsible for the child who is  also  British.
    The child is currently aged 15 years.

The Findings of the Judge

 4. The judge observed that the Respondent's refusal letter of  15th  April
    2014 informed the Appellant  of  the  fact  that  her  application  was
    considered and fell to be refused solely because she did not  meet  the
    financial income threshold requirement set out in Appendix FM of  being
    able to show the  Sponsor's  earnings  at  ï¿½18,600  per  annum.   Judge
    Narayan observed how the skeleton argument by Counsel on behalf of  the
    Appellant at the hearing "acknowledged the Appellant is unable to  meet
    the minimum income requirements of the Immigration Rules".  However, it
    was alleged that the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  paragraph  R-
    LTRP.1.1(d).  The judge set these matters out at  paragraph  5  of  the
    determination.

 5. At the hearing the Appellant gave evidence and stated that there was  a
    family life with [C], the 15-year-old child of  the  Sponsor,  and  the
    Sponsor also gave evidence to this effect.  However, the evidence  from
    [C] was markedly absent to confirm this.

 6. The Appellant said that she had asked [C] for  a  letter  and  [C]  had
    agreed to give a letter confirming  the  relationship,  but  the  judge
    observed that,
         "I find that even at the date of the hearing there has not  been  a
         statement from [C].  In all the circumstances I reject the evidence
         of both the Appellant and [M] [the sponsoring husband] that [C] has
         ever been willing to give a statement of support  to  support  this
         Appellant and her husband [M] in their assertions that in fact they
         have a close family relationship with [C]" (see paragraph 25).

    The judge also went on to say that there has,
         "Never been any effort to provide any of the information, least  of
         all from [C] and/or her mother and/or this child's school, nursery,
         health visitor, GP or local authority or anyone else who could have
         seen [C] in  contact  with  her  father  and  the  Appellant"  (see
         paragraph 27).

 7. The judge went on to hold that in  these  circumstances  the  Appellant
    could not satisfy the "suitability requirements"  (see  paragraph  28).
    The judge held that there was no  family  relationship  with  [C]  (see
    paragraph 29).  He went on to determine that the Respondent's  decision
    "is proportionate in all the circumstances of this case".

 8. Although it was the case that the parties had married on 4th May  2013,
    the Appellant was on a visa which did not give her permanent rights  to
    stay in the United Kingdom.  The judge went on to  say  that,  "I  have
    noted the evidence of [M] that  they  had  never  discussed  living  in
    Tanzania either before or after the marriage" (see paragraph 34).

 9. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge  failed  to  apply  the
    principle in the case of Chikwamba in requiring the Appellant to return
    back to Tanzania to make an application from  there  in  order  to  re-
    enter.  The grounds also state that the judge did not  have  regard  to
    Section 117 of the 2002 Act and failed to consider whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles of family life continuing outside  the  United
    Kingdom.

11. On 3rd March 2015, permission to appeal was granted with respect to two
    of the grounds but not the remaining two.

12. On 17th March 2015, a Rule 24 response was entered to the  effect  that
    the  Appellant  had  failed  under  the  suitability  requirement   and
    therefore the judge could not have gone on to decide that the Appellant
    could succeed under EX.1 because this was not  a  standalone  provision
    (see Sabir).  Permission had not been granted on  the  challenge  to  a
    suitability finding, and  therefore  the  remaining  grounds  on  which
    permission had been granted would also fail.

13. At the hearing before me Mr Ahmed of Counsel appeared on behalf of  the
    Appellant.  He had a preliminary application to make to begin with.  He
    submitted that this  Tribunal  should  consider  all  four  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  These were, first, that the judge having dismissed the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules he had gone on to paragraphs 31  to  34  to
    consider  Article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   However,   at
    paragraph 34 he stated that there was  no  hardship  to  the  Appellant
    travelling to Tanzania and applying to join  her  husband  from  there.
    This was contrary to Chikwamba.

14. Second, that Section 117A(2) of the 2002 Act  applies  to  all  appeals
    determined on or after 28th July 2014 and the public interest  question
    must be considered.  The judge had failed to do so.

15. Third, the  Respondent  maintained,  and  the  judge  found,  that  the
    Appellant was unable to benefit from Appendix FM because she  fell  for
    refusal on suitability grounds due  to  paragraph  5  -  LTR.1.7  which
    mandates a refusal on account of her  failure  to  provide  information
    that had been requested.  It was said here that the request was not for
    "information" but for "evidence" and so this provision did not apply.

16. Fourth, it was said that the  Appellant  relied  on  paragraph  EX.1(b)
    which refers  to  the  requirement  of  "insurmountable  obstacles"  as
    amounting to "very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
    applicant or their partner in continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside  the  UK"  and  the  judge  had  erred  in  respect   of   this
    determination.

17. Mr Mills submitted that I should reject the application to allow  other
    grounds to be considered because after the rejection of the two grounds
    by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  it  was  open  to  the  Appellant's
    representatives  to  make  an  application  in  writing  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, pursuant to the Procedure Rules, to be allowed to also  argue
    the remaining two grounds on which permission had been rejected.   This
    had not been done.  It was therefore not appropriate for these  matters
    to be raised  now  at  this  substantive  hearing.   I  considered  the
    position, and in light also of  the  materiality  of  these  additional
    grounds to what had already been determined by the judge,  rejected  Mr
    Ahmed's application to resurrect the two remaining grounds that had not
    been permitted to be raised at this hearing.

18. Subject to this, Mr Ahmed began by saying that he would rely  upon  the
    Grounds of Appeal with respect to the two grounds upon which permission
    had been granted.  He said that proportionality had not  been  properly
    undertaken.  Also Section  117A(2)  had  not  been  considered  as  was
    required under the Rules.  This was a material error.   It  had  to  be
    remembered that the Appellant had been in the  UK  lawfully  since  she
    entered in 2007 and that she had never breached the Immigration  Rules.
    This went directly to the public interest and this ought to  have  been
    properly considered.

19. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that Chikwamba did not apply in a case
    such  as  the  present   because   in   this   case   the   Appellant's
    representatives  expressly  conceded  that  the   financial   threshold
    requirement could not be met under the Immigration Rules (see paragraph
    5) and so the Appellant could  not  have  succeeded  under  the  Rules.
    Second, the Appellant would have  failed,  given  that  she  could  not
    comply with the "suitability requirements".  Furthermore, if the  judge
    had  refused  the  appeal  under  Ground  3  then  he  ought  to   have
    automatically also refused it under Ground 4.

20. Mr Mills drew my attention to the  case  of  Muhandiramge  [2015]  UKUT
    00675 which is to the effect that where an  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom is refused under Section 7 -  LTRP.1.7  of
    Appendix FM on the ground of the applicant's failure without reasonable
    excuse to comply with  the  requirement  to  provide  information,  the
    burden establishing a reasonable excuse rests on the applicant and  the
    standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities.  In this case there
    had been a failure to provide the requested information.

21. The suitability requirement could not be met.  It was not accepted that
    there was a viable relationship between the adults  in  this  case  and
    [C], the child.  Three requests had been  made  for  the  provision  of
    information and they had not been complied with.  It  is  difficult  to
    see how this cannot be regarded as a request for  "information"  rather
    than a  quest  for  "evidence".   The  burden  was  on  the  Appellant.
    Therefore Ground 3 did not in any way succeed.  This was what the judge
    himself decided.  That Ground 3 was not material.  If Ground 3 was  not
    complied with then  Ground  4  automatically  became  unarguable.   The
    Appellant did not get through the  Rules  because  of  the  suitability
    requirements and that was the end of the matter.

22. With respect to the suggestion that the Appellant would have  succeeded
    because the  "public  interest  requirement"  actually  benefitted  the
    Appellant given that she had been in the UK lawfully since 2007 and had
    never breached the  Immigration  Rules,  the  latest  decision  of  the
    Tribunal in AM (S.117B) Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  0260  confirmed  that  an
    Appellant can obtain "no positive right to a grant of leave  to  remain
    from either S117B(2) or (3), whatever the  degree  of  his  fluency  in
    English,  or  the  strength  of  his  financial  resources".   In   the
    circumstances this appeal would inevitably have failed anyway.

23. In reply Mr Ahmed submitted that Section 117  has  nevertheless  to  be
    looked at.  The law was clear.  At paragraph 34  of  the  determination
    the judge should have  factored  this  in  in  his  assessment  of  the
    proportionality principle.  The fact that the Appellant had been in the
    UK lawfully, and with leave,  and  had  not  breached  the  Immigration
    Rules, was a positive factor in her favour.  Mr Ahmed submitted that  I
    should make a finding of an error of law and remit the matter  back  to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be determined again.

Error of Law

24. The failure of the judge to make express reference to Section 117,  and
    to properly take it into account was an error, but it is not a material
    error, such that this decision should be set aside.   For  the  reasons
    that Mr Mills has already outlined this was an appeal that was bound to
    fail in the end.  The Appellant did not meet with the Immigration Rules
    because she could not comply with the financial threshold  requirement.
    She did not meet with the suitability requirements.  She was unable  to
    show that there was an Article 8 right outside  the  Immigration  Rules
    because of her own failure to  provide  evidence  in  relation  to  her
    family life with [C].  That left only the matter  of  Section  117A(2).
    The case of AM (S.117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 now confirms  that  "no
    positive right to a grant of leave to remain" arises from Section  117.
    In the circumstances, this is a case where the Upper Tribunal may  (but
    need not) set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (see
    Section 12(2)(a) of the TCEA 2007).  The decision shall stand.

Notice of Decision

25. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

26. No anonymity order is made.
