                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
Appellant   Mr Harrison (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by Malik and Malik Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    3. The appellant is a national of Albania. In April 2012 he entered the
       United Kingdom illegally. On February 6, 2014 he applied  for  leave
       to remain on human rights grounds. His application was certified  as
       unfounded on February 11, 2014 and refused.  A  Judicial  Review  of
       this decision was refused on April 9, 2014.

    4. On June 26, 2014 the appellant  submitted  a  further  human  rights
       application but this was refused on August 18, 2015.

    5. The appellant appealed that decision  on  September  1,  2015  under
       Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
       and his appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Brunnen
       (hereinafter referred to as "the Judge") on April  27,  2016.  In  a
       decision promulgated on May 10, 2016 the Judge allowed his appeal on
       human rights grounds.

    6. The respondent appealed this decision on May 19, 2016 and permission
       to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Pullig  on
       September 16, 2016. He found that it  was  arguable  the  Judge  had
       erred because he failed to properly consider the  appeal  under  the
       Immigration  Rules  or  identify  why  there  were  exceptional   or
       compelling circumstances to consider the claim under article 8 ECHR.



    7. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  occasion  I
       heard submissions from both representatives.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES

    8. An issue  arose  over  whether  this  appeal  was  governed  by  the
       restricted rights of appeal introduced by the Immigration Act  2014.
       Neither Mr Harrison nor Mr Ahmed were able to assist on  this  issue
       at the hearing.

    9. Going back to basics applications for leave to remain  as  a  family
       member under Part 8  submitted  on  or  after  9  July  2012  by  an
       applicant without extant  leave  under  Part  8,  where  this  is  a
       requirement of Part 8, were to be considered under the  requirements
       of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.

   10. On 28 July 2014 paragraph 276ADE(1) of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
       amended to change the requirement in  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  from
       "has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country
       to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK" to  "there
       would be very significant obstacles to the  applicant's  integration
       into the country to which he would have to go if required  to  leave
       the UK." No transitional arrangements applied to this  change.  This
       change took effect on 28 July 2014, so the new  wording  applied  to
       all applications to which paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH apply  (or  can
       be applied by virtue of the Immigration Rules),  and  to  any  other
       ECHR Article 8 claims (except for  those  from  foreign  criminals),
       which were decided on or after that date.

   11. Accordingly, before the Immigration Act  2014  I  would  be  dealing
       initially with applications  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  in
       particular Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

   12. However, the Immigration Act  2014  changed  rights  of  appeal  and
       altered Section 82(1) of the 2002 Act.

   13. The Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement No.4  Transitional and Saving
       Provisions and Amendment) Order 2014 2015 No 371 introduced the  new
       provisions to all decisions made on or after 6 April 2015 other than
       (i)  decisions on Tier 4 applications where the application was made
       before 20 October (ii) decisions on   Tier  1,2  or  5  applications
       where the application was made before 2 March 2015 (ii) decisions to
       refuse leave to enter,  to  refuse  entry  clearance,  to  refuse  a
       certificate of entitlement and to refuse to vary leave to  enter  or
       remain (where the result of that decision is that the person has  no
       leave) on applications where the application was made before 6 April
       2015 (unless the decision is also a refusal of an  asylum/protection
       or human rights claim in which case the new provisions apply). In  R
       (on the application of Roohi and Another) (2014  Act:  saved  appeal
       rights)  IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00685  (IAC)  it  was  held   that   the
       commencement of the Immigration Act 2014 did not  remove  rights  of
       appeal from those who were served with appealable decisions before 6
       April 2015.

   14. Having considered the transitional provisions and the nature of this
       specific application I am satisfied that  although  the  application
       was lodged in June 2014 this was not an application  caught  by  the
       transitional provisions as  it  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the
       exceptions set out in paragraph [13] of this decision.

   15. The Judge quite properly identified that he only has a human  rights
       appeal before him. The issue for  me  to  consider  is  whether  his
       approach contained a material error for the reasons set out  in  the
       grant of permission.

SUBMISSIONS

   16. Mr Harrison relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted  that  the
       Judge's decision was surprisingly short  and  contained  a  material
       error in that he had failed to consider the application through  the
       prism of the Immigration Rules  and  then  failed  to  explain  what
       exceptional circumstances  existed  to  consider  the  appeal  under
       article 8 ECHR. The Court of Appeal in AJ (Angola) [2014]  EWCA  Civ
       1636 made clear at paragraph [39], "The fact that the new rules  are
       intended to operate as a comprehensive code is significant,  because
       it means that an official or a tribunal should seek to take  account
       of any Convention rights of an appellant through the lens of the new
       rules themselves, rather than looking to apply Convention rights for
       themselves in  a  free-standing  way  outside  the  new  rules."  Mr
       Harrison submitted that whilst this was a deport case  the  approach
       to the Rules and article 8 ECHR  remained  the  same  and  this  was
       envisaged in Gen 1.1 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
       affirmed by the Court of Appeal in R (on the application of  Agyarko
       and others) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA
       Civ 440. Even if the Judge was entitled to consider outside  of  the
       Rules, Mr Harrison submitted that his assessment under article 8 did
       not have full regard to Section 117 of the 2002 Act.

   17. Mr Ahmed submitted there was no error in law because  if  the  Judge
       had considered the appeal under the Rules and found that EX.1(a)  or
       (b) applied then this would have had a  significant  effect  on  any
       section 8 proportionality assessment. Under EX.1(a)  the  respondent
       should have allowed the appeal  under  the  Rules  if  there  was  a
       genuine and subsisting relationship with the  wife  and  there  were
       insurmountable  obstacles  to  their  relationship   continuing   in
       Albania. Alternatively, under EX.1(b) if the respondent accepted the
       was  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  between   the
       appellant and his wife's two children then if it was not  reasonable
       for the children to have to leave  then  the  appeal  would  succeed
       under this heading. In any event, there were compelling  reasons  to
       consider this appeal under article 8 as there were two children  and
       the appellant's wife could clearly not join the  appellant  as  both
       children were at school.

   18. Both Mr Ahmed and Mr Harrison invited me to remake the  decision  on
       the evidence before me if there was an error in law.

DISCUSSION AND CONSIDERATION

   19. The grounds seeking permission to appeal raised three points:

        a. Should the Judge have considered the appeal through the lens  of
           the Immigration Rules first and foremost.

        b. Did the Judge set out  exceptional  or  compelling  reasons  for
           considering the appeal under article 8 ECHR.

        c. Was a fair balancing act undertaken.

   20. The Judge in paragraphs [6] to [16] of  his  decision  set  out  the
       evidence and  the  appellant's  immigration  history.  The  evidence
       showed that he entered the  country  illegally  in  April  2012  and
       consequently his immigration status was both unlawful and precarious
       at all times. He made two applications in  2014  to  regularise  his
       situation  on  human  rights  grounds  and  on  both  occasions  the
       respondent  rejected  his  claim.  The   respondent   disputed   the
       genuineness of the relationship and this was an issue the Judge  had
       to deal with at the hearing. He did consider the evidence and  found
       the relationship was both genuine and subsisting  but  concluded  at
       paragraph [18] the relationship was genuine and subsisting.

   21. Having reached that conclusion he then went on  to  find  that  "the
       conditions for leave to remain as a partner have been satisfied" but
       stated at paragraph [20], "The appellant's appeal cannot be  allowed
       simply on the  basis  that  the  respondent's  decision  is  not  in
       accordance with the Immigration Rules since that is not a ground  of
       appeal that is available."

   22. He therefore immediately considered the appeal under article 8  ECHR
       and found:

        a. They had a family life together.

        b. Refusal would cause interference of sufficient severity so as to
           engage article 8 ECHR.

        c. The decision was in accordance with the law and  in  furtherance
           of article 8(2) ECHR.

   23. He then considered proportionality and  concluded  the  decision  to
       refuse the appellant permission  to  remain  was  not  proportionate
       because:

        a. He qualified for leave to remain as a partner.

        b. The public interest in maintaining effective immigration control
           was not damaged by granting leave to remain.

        c. His English was rapidly improving.

        d. The family was supported by the appellant's wife's earnings.

        e. Section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act applied as the relationship  was
           formed whilst here unlawfully but this  was  not  sufficient  to
           tilt the proportionality against him when he had  satisfied  the
           Rules.

   24. Mr Harrison has challenged this approach.

   25. In order to succeed on family life grounds the appellant would  have
       to succeed either as a partner under Section R-LTRP of  Appendix  FM
       or as a parent under Section R-LTRPT of Appendix FM.

   26. Reference to the refusal letter reveals that the respondent  refused
       the "partner" claim because she was not satisfied that he was  in  a
       genuine and subsisting relationship and could not therefore  satisfy
       Section  E-LTRP  1.7.  The  respondent  did  however  consider   the
       application under Section EX.1(b) of Appendix FM but concluded there
       were no insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  outside
       the United Kingdom.

   27. The Judge in his decision did not consider EX.1(b)  when  concluding
       he  satisfied  the  Rules.  Particular  regard  should  be  paid  to
       paragraphs [18] and [19] of the decision as the Judge finds they are
       in a genuine and subsisting relationship  and  therefore  finds  the
       conditions for leave to remain as a  partner  have  been  satisfied.
       There was no consideration of "insurmountable  obstacles"  and  this
       was something he had to consider if he was going to  find  the  Rule
       was  met.  Put  simply  there  was  no  examination  of  what  those
       insurmountable obstacles were.

   28. The test of "insurmountable obstacles", contained in the decision of
       the Court of Appeal in Agyarko, makes clear, this phrase as used in
       the Rules is intended to have the same meaning as in the  Strasbourg
       jurisprudence, illustrated in Jeunesse v The Netherlands [2015] 60
       EHRR 17 at [117].  Giving  the  judgment  of  the  Court,  Sales  LJ
       highlighted two particular features of the insurmountable  obstacles
       criterion. First, while imposing a  stringent  test,  it  is  to  be
       interpreted "in a  sensible  and  practical  rather  than  a  purely
       literal way" and secondly, this criterion is not simply a factor  to
       be taken into account. Rather, it  is  a  condition  which  must  be
       satisfied if a claim under the Rules is to succeed.

   29.  Mr  Ahmed  suggested   in   his   submissions   that   there   were
       "insurmountable obstacles" because the appellant's wife was British,
       worked here and had two children who both attended school.  However,
       the Judge did not consider these factors anywhere and the highest Mr
       Ahmed can put that submission is that is what  the  Judge  may  have
       found.

   30. As the Judge considered the article 8 case on the  basis  the  Rules
       had been met (paragraph [19]) he had  to  demonstrate  that  he  had
       given this full consideration. I am not satisfied he did  and  there
       is material error in his approach to his family life as a partner.

   31. I indicated above there were two possible options under Appendix  FM
       and the second was "parent" route.

   32. However, I am satisfied he cannot meet the eligibility  requirements
       of the "parent" route because:

        a. Neither child is his child as required by Section E-ECPT 2.2.

        b. He does not have  sole  responsibility  of  the  child  and  the
           children live  with  their  mother  who  is  a  British  citizen
           (Section E-ECPT 2.3)

        c. The appellant lives with the children's  mother  (Section  E-CPT
           2.3)

   33. Contrary to Mr Ahmed's submission today the appellant could not have
       satisfied the parent route.

   34. The reasonableness test for the  parent  route  is  similar  to  the
       proportionality assessment under article 8 but  the  "insurmountable
       obstacles test" is different.

   35. I therefore find that the Judge did  err  in  his  approach  to  his
       article 8 assessment because he proceeded on the basis the Rule  was
       satisfied when in fact he had not properly considered  the  Rule.  I
       set aside his decision and at the request of both representatives  I
       have proceeded to remake the decision.

   36. My starting point is to consider whether the  Immigration  Rule  was
       met and I retain the Judge's finding that  the  parties  were  in  a
       genuine and subsisting relationship and  therefore  Section  EX.1(b)
       would apply and it states:

    "The applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner
    who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or in  the
    UK with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian  protection,  and  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK."

   37. Section EX.2 states:

    "For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    means the very significant difficulties which would  be  faced  by  the
    applicant or their partner in continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

   38. The insurmountable obstacle in this case centres  on  the  fact  the
       appellant is from Albanian and his wife and step-children have  only
       ever known life  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  they  do  not  speak
       Albanian.

   39. In R (on the application of Onkarsingh Nagre) 2013 EWHC 720 Sales  J
       at paragraphs [42] and [43] said-

    "The approach explained in the Strasbourg case-law indicates  that  ...
    consideration of whether there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    claimant's resident spouse or  partner  relocating  to  the  claimant's
    country of origin to continue their family life there will be a  highly
    material consideration. This is not to say that  the  question  whether
    there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  relocation  will  always  be
    decisive....  Therefore,  it  cannot  be  said  that  in   every   case
    consideration of  the  test  in  Section  EX.1  of  whether  there  are
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  relocation  will   necessarily   exhaust
    consideration of proportionality, even in the type of precarious family
    life case with which these proceedings are concerned. I agree with  the
    statement by the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu in the latter part  of  para.
    [56],  that  the  Strasbourg  case-law  does  not  treat  the  test  of
    insurmountable obstacles to relocation as a minimum requirement  to  be
    established in a precarious family life case before it can be concluded
    that removal of the claimant is  disproportionate;  the  case-law  only
    treats it as a material factor to be taken into account. Nonetheless, I
    consider  that  the  Strasbourg  guidance  does  indicate  that  in   a
    precarious family life case, where it is only in "exceptional" or  "the
    most exceptional" circumstances that removal of the non-national family
    member will constitute  a  violation  of  Article  8,  the  absence  of
    insurmountable obstacles to relocation of other family members to  that
    member's own country of origin to continue their family life  there  is
    likely to indicate that the  removal  will  be  proportionate  for  the
    purposes of Article 8."

   40. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct  approach)  [2013]  UKUT
       640 (IAC) it was held that the term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in
       provisions  such  as  Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are
       impossible to surmount.

   41. Before the First-tier Tribunal were statements  from  the  appellant
       and his wife. In his witness statement the appellant  spoke  of  all
       the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom
       based  on  what  he  has  done  for  his  wife  after  her  previous
       relationship ended.  His  wife,  in  her  statement,  described  the
       problems that she encountered  with  her  ex-husband  and  how  much
       support the appellant has been to both her and her  children.  There
       is nothing in  the  appellant's  original  bundle  or  the  previous
       decision of the Judge that identifies why the family could  not  re-
       locate to Albania. The appellant has  not  spoken  of  any  personal
       problems in Albania. He never claimed asylum and there is nothing in
       the papers before me that suggests he has no family in Albania or  a
       family home to return to either with or without  his  wife  and  her
       children.

   42. The courts have provided some  guidance  on  what  could  amount  to
       insurmountable obstacles and the only argument advanced before me to
       day was that requiring the family to go and live  in  Albania  would
       amount to insurmountable obstacles.

   43. I do not agree with that submission. This is not  a  proportionality
       assessment but a decision on whether  there  was  an  insurmountable
       obstacle to them enjoying family life elsewhere.  The  appellant  is
       not  the  children's  father  and  I  find  the  appellant  has  not
       demonstrated these circumstances satisfy the requirement of  EX.1(b)
       and consequently I do not find the Immigration Rule is met.

   44. The second issue I have to consider is whether there are  compelling
       or exceptional circumstances to consider the appeal outside  of  the
       Rules. I am satisfied there are as the children's interests have not
       properly been considered under the Rules and the test under  article
       8 is proportionality as against insurmountable obstacle.

   45. The fact the appellant is not their  father  is  not  a  bar  to  my
       considering his position under article 8. Like the Judge in the  FTT
       I find:

        a. They had a family life together.

        b. Refusal would cause interference of sufficient severity so as to
           engage article 8 ECHR.

        c. The decision was in accordance with the law and  in  furtherance
           of article 8(2) ECHR.



   46. As this appeal is a human rights appeal I must consider  Section  19
       of the Immigration Act 2014. This introduced Section  117  into  the
       2002 Act which set out statutory factors  the  Court  must  consider
       when assessing the public interest.

   47. The Court in R (on the application  of  RK)   (s.117B(6);  "parental
       relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 00031 made it  clear  that  in  the
       context of section 117B it was held that  it  was  necessary  for  a
       person to have "parental responsibility" in law for there to exist a
       parental relationship. The fact the appellant is not the  biological
       father does not mean he is not covered by  Section  117B(6)  of  the
       2002 Act as that assessment depends on the individual  circumstances
       and whether the role he establishes he has "stepped into the  shoes"
       of a parent. All the evidence before me suggests that  this  is  the
       case here.

   48. Applying section 117B I find as follows:

        a. The maintenance of  effective  immigration  control  is  in  the
           public interest.

        b. The fact the appellant speaks some English is a neutral factor.

        c. The March 2016 payslip revealed  the  wife's  annual  salary  is
           �13,093 which is less than the �18,600 income requirement  under
           the Rules. The appellant's wife  received  �146.49/week  working
           and child tax credits.

        d. Their relationship was formed when he was here  both  unlawfully
           and his  immigration  status  was  precarious  and  consequently
           little weight should be attached to it.

        e. The appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
           with two British children and  following  respondent  policy  it
           would not be reasonable to  expect  them  to  leave  the  United
           Kingdom. This is a factor to take into  account  but  is  not  a
           standalone reason for allowing an appeal.

   49. Taking all of the above matters into account I find  that  it  would
       not be  disproportionate  for  the  appellant  to  have  leave  this
       country. Whilst his role in helping his wife and her  children  must
       be recognised it has to be balanced against other factors  including
       his  appalling  immigration  history,  the  fact  they  entered  the
       relationship in the knowledge he was not legal in this  country  and
       most significantly they cannot satisfy the  Immigration  Rules.  The
       children are not his children and removing the  appellant  does  not
       mean the children would be forced to leave the country.  If  he  can
       meet the Rules then it would  be  open  to  him  to  make  an  entry
       clearance  application  in  the  knowledge  a  Tribunal  found   his
       relationship genuine and subsisting.



DECISION

   50. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

   51. I have remade the decision and dismiss it on human rights grounds.
