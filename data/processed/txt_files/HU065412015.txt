Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the respondent's refusal to
    grant her a  derivative  right  of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to Regulation 15(4)(a) of the Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 and also purporting  to  dismiss  an  Article  8
    appeal with which the First-tier Tribunal was not seised.

 2. The appellant neither appeared today nor arranged any representation: I
    put the appeal to the end of my list, but by 2.30 pm she still had  not
    appeared nor explained her absence.  I conclude that the appellant  has
    no further interest in  these  proceedings,  but  since  permission  to
    appeal was granted, I shall deal briefly with the  basis  on  which  it
    comes before me.

Background

 3. The appellant claims that  she  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  from
    Cameroon as a pregnant teenager when she was about  17  years  old,  in
    July 1999. In August  1999  she  unsuccessfully  claimed  asylum.    In
    February 2000, she gave birth to a son; the birth certificate  did  not
    initially name the child's father but was later amended to do so.   The
    child's father is another Cameroonian man in the United Kingdom.   Both
    partners claimed asylum but the appeals were dismissed.  The  appellant
    and her partner were appeal rights exhausted in December 2006.

 4. In March 2006, the couple had a second child, with  the  father's  name
    recorded on the birth certificate. The evidence is that  the  appellant
    has joint responsibility for the child with the child's father  who  is
    her partner and who is an exempt person under Regulation 15A(6) of  the
    2006 Regulations.

 5. The appellant's circumstances and those of her partner were  considered
    in the legacy exercise in 2004 but the respondent did not consider that
    there was a reason  to  grant  leave  to  remain  to  either  of  them.
    Indefinite  leave  to   remain   was   refused   for   them   both   in
    October/December 2010.

 6. The appellant is a foreign criminal as defined in section 32 of the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.  On 16 November 2010,  she  was  reprimanded  by  the
    police for using threatening, abusive or insulting words  or  behaviour
    with intent to cause fear or provoke violence. On 7 July 2011, she  was
    sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment on four counts of making dishonest
    representation to obtain benefits and possession or control of a  false
    or improperly obtained identity document belonging to another person.

 7. The sentencing judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  claimed  social
    services benefits in the name of another person and had received almost
    ï¿½200,000,  all  of  which  had  been  spent  and  no   restitution   or
    compensation order was possible.  She had used a false passport  and  a
    false identity.  The public order caution was not taken into account in
    sentencing her.  There was no alternative but  to  impose  a  custodial
    sentence.

 8. The appellant served half of her sentence and was released from  prison
    on 10 January 2012, on licence conditions.

 9. On  3  May  2011,  the  appellant  and  her  partner  applied  for  the
    naturalisation of their first child, who had been in the United Kingdom
    since her birth in February 2000.  The application was successful.  The
    elder child is now a British citizen.

10. On 15 September 2011, the respondent served the appellant  with  Notice
    of Liability for automatic deportation.  The appellant  responded,  and
    her response included an application for EEA residency as the parent of
    a British child.  She made two further applications on the same  basis,
    on 28 November 2011, 15 June  2012  and  5  November  2012:  all  three
    applications for EEA residence as the primary carer of her two children
    were refused. The appellant's partner was successful  in  the  November
    2012 joint application (based on them both being the children's primary
    carers): he has an EEA residence card on that basis.

11. On 31 October 2012, the appellant  was  again  served  with  notice  of
    liability  for  automatic  deportation.   On  29  November  2012,   the
    respondent signed a deportation order which was served on the appellant
    on 5 December 2012.  The appellant appealed, and the respondent  agreed
    to reconsider the decision.  The  appellant's  sentence  expired  on  7
    January 2013.

12. On 3 August 2013, the appellant was again reprimanded by the police for
    common assault.  On 12 August 2013, the respondent  asked  for  further
    details of her family life in the United  Kingdom,  and  the  appellant
    responded on 17 September 2013.  On 2  February  2015,  the  respondent
    made another deportation decision with no in-country right  of  appeal.
    The November 2012 decision was re-served at the same time:   that  also
    carried no right of appeal.  The appellant objected to  both  decisions
    and that was treated as an application for leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds.

Refusal letter

13. In his refusal letter on 8 September 2015,  the  respondent  maintained
    his deportation decision, refused the appellant a derivative  right  of
    residence,  and  refused  to  grant  leave  to  remain  based  on   the
    appellant's Article 8 ECHR family and private life submissions.

14. The respondent considered that the appellant's removal was conducive to
    the public good and required by the public interest,  finding  that  it
    would not be unduly harsh either for the  two  children  to  return  to
    Cameroon with the appellant, or for her partner to look after  them  in
    the United Kingdom without her.

15. Nor was it accepted that there would be very significant  obstacles  to
    the appellant's reintegration in Cameroon, where she had lived for more
    than half her 33 years.  There were no very compelling circumstances to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.

16. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

Asylum determination (2006)

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal on the appellant's asylum claim
    is the Devaseelan starting point for the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  the
    present appeal. The  Judge  in  2006  found  the  appellant's  personal
    account to be inconsistent and lacking in credibility, either as to her
    history or her reasons for leaving the country.  He  did  not  believe,
    even to the lower standard appropriate for protection claims, that  the
    appellant's father had been a notable figure in Cameroon nor  that  she
    was at risk on return as his daughter.

18. The Judge found that there was no credible evidence that the  appellant
    had ever been arrested, nor that she was a wanted person  in  Cameroon,
    though he accepted that it was  'a  regime  endemically  intolerant  of
    political opposition, in which the security services largely ignore the
    human rights of government critics'.   The  appellant's  account  of  a
    wealthy background with servants was inconsistent with  other  evidence
    and internally inconsistent with her account. The  appellant  had  left
    Cameroon openly on a scheduled flight, the Judge finding that  she  had
    used her own passport to do so.  She had failed to keep in  touch  with
    the United  Kingdom  immigration  authorities  which  'did  nothing  to
    promote  the  credibility  of  her  claim  to  be  living  in  fear  of
    persecution'.  The appellant's child and partner were both citizens  of
    Cameroon and there was no reason why they should not  return  and  live
    together in Cameroon.

19. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appeal.  The appellant does not seem
    to have challenged that decision and the negative  credibility  finding
    stands.

First-tier Tribunal decision

20. The First-tier Judge in 2016 treated the 2006 decision as the  starting
    point, and considered both the EEA derivative right of residence  claim
    and the appellant's Article 8 ECHR claim. If the appellant were  to  be
    removed from the United Kingdom that would not force  her  children  to
    leave the EEA as they could remain here with their father.

21. The appellant's derivative right of residence claim failed because  the
    Judge found that the appellant was not the  children's  primary  carer:
    she cared for the children jointly with her partner, who had derivative
    residence for that purpose, and who  is  an  exempt  person.   On  that
    basis, the appellant's claim for derivative right  of  residence  fails
    because she cannot show that as a matter of European Union law  she  is
    the 'primary carer' as defined in Regulation 15(4A).

22. As regards the reasonableness of  removal,  and  whether  it  would  be
    unduly harsh  to  separate  the  appellant  from  her  partner  or  her
    children, applying KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT
    000543 (IAC), the  Judge  noted  that  no  medical  evidence  had  been
    produced about any particular difficulties in relation to the children,
    nor any social services evidence.  the children had their father in the
    United Kingdom to look after them and the  evidence  was  that  he  had
    family members in the United  Kingdom,  France  and  Germany,  who  had
    helped out financially in the past.  Little weight could  be  given  to
    the appellant's private life in the United Kingdom, all  of  which  had
    been unlawful.

23. The public interest required deportation  and  the  appellant  had  not
    shown that there was any lawful reason why that public interest  should
    be displaced. The First-tier Judge dismissed the appeal. The  appellant
    appealed to the Upper Tribunal.





Permission to appeal

24. The grounds of appeal were late but Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb extended
    time as  the  delay  was  not  long,  serious  or  significant  and  an
    explanation had been offered.  He did not consider that the  First-tier
    Judge had erred in finding that removal of this appellant  to  Cameroon
    would not be unduly harsh.   As regards her application for  derivative
    right of residence, the issue  under  Regulation  15(4A)  of  the  2006
    Regulations should be considered  on  the  basis  that  both  would  be
    required to leave the United Kingdom and it was 'by no means clear  but
    ... arguable' that applying Regulation 19(3)(b) read in  by  virtue  of
    Regulation 15A(9), the criteria  in  Regulation  21  should  have  been
    considered.

25. Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb saw no merit in the appellant's challenge to
    the non-EEA based part of the decision  to  remove,  holding  that  the
    First-tier Judge's assessment  of  whether  removal  would  be  'unduly
    harsh' was unarguably rational and lawful.

26. Permission to appeal was granted, limited to the EEA Regulations point.



Rule 24 Reply

27. The respondent in his Rule 24 Reply noted that the appellant's  partner
    is a British citizen and is an exempt person as defined  in  Regulation
    15A(6)(c)(i), in  consequence  of  which  the  appellant  cannot  bring
    herself within Regulation 15A(7)(b)(ii) and Regulation  15A(9)  is  not
    applicable.

28. That was the basis on which the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Upper Tribunal hearing

29. I heard brief submissions from Mr Lindsay on behalf of the  respondent.
    Neither of the children would now be required  to  leave  the  European
    Union as their father was settled and they were both British  citizens.
    European Union law was not engaged.  Even applying the decision of  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 53, which had not been available to
    the First-tier Judge, this appeal could not succeed under EEA  law  and
    permission had not been granted on the remaining grounds of appeal.

Analysis

30. At the date of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, this appellant's
    partner had been granted a derivative right of residence as the  parent
    of the elder child.  The elder child has already been  naturalised  and
    the younger child now has more than ten years in the United Kingdom and
    if she has not already done so then that child can be registered  as  a
    British citizen.  Accordingly, neither the  appellant's  children,  nor
    her partner, would be required to  leave  the  EEA  by  reason  of  her
    removal.

31. I have considered the EEA issue on which permission was granted.  It is
    right that the First-tier Judge did not deal  with  Regulation  21  and
    that this appellant had been in the United  Kingdom  for  more  than  5
    years when she went to prison.  She could  have  acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence  in  that  time,  provided  that  she  was  here  in
    accordance with the Regulations.  However, since she  appears  to  have
    been claiming benefits (unlawfully and in large  amounts)  it  is  most
    unlikely that she would have been able to show that she was working  or
    was otherwise here in accordance with the Regulations.   The  appellant
    has not asserted that such is her sign.

32. On the date of the two relevant decisions in November 2012 and February
    2015, the appellant could not show 10 years'  continuous  residence  in
    the United Kingdom before the making of the decision  because  in  both
    cases, that  residence  would  have  been  interrupted  by  the  prison
    sentence served between 7 July 2011 and 10 January 2012.

33. I am satisfied, therefore, that although the First-tier Judge failed to
    engage with Regulation 21, that  failure  was  immaterial  because  the
    appellant was entitled only to the basic level of protection,  not  the
    medium  'serious  grounds'   or   the   higher   'imperative   grounds'
    protections.

Conclusion

34. The grounds of appeal disclose no material error of law in the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal and I dismiss the appeal.
