For the Respondent:    Miss N Nnamani of Counsel instructed by Howe &
    Company  Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of Colombia born on 1 November  1992,  as
    the appellant herein.  The Secretary of State appeals the decision of a
    First-tier Judge following a hearing  on  10  May  2017  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal on human rights grounds against the decision of  the
    Secretary of State on 30 September 2016 to  make  a  deportation  order
    against him under Section 32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.   The
    appellant had been convicted of four counts of robbery  in  2011  as  a
    result of which he had been  sentenced  to  a  total  of  three  years'
    detention.

2.   The appellant arrived in this country in March 2000 with  his  parents.
    The appellant's father made an application for asylum on behalf of  his
    family.  Although the claim was refused an appeal against the  decision
    was allowed upon the  basis  that  there  was  a  substantial  risk  of
    persecution if the family were removed to  Colombia.   The  family  was
    granted refugee status with leave in line.  The  respondent  considered
    that under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 the appellant had been convicted of a particularly  serious  crime
    and constituted a danger to the community of the UK.  The appellant was
    issued with a notification of intention to cease his refugee status  in
    2014.  Reference  was  made  to  Article  1C(5)  of  the  1951  Refugee
    Convention in the light of significant changes in  Colombia  since  the
    appellant's arrival.

3.   I mention this simply by  way  of  background  because  the  First-tier
    Judge rejected the  appellant's  claim  under  the  Refugee  Convention
    accepting there had been a fundamental change in Colombia.  The  appeal
    was allowed under Article 8 and there was no cross appeal or  challenge
    to the other aspects of the judge's decision.  The judge heard from the
    appellant and his parents and his fianc�e and sister.

4.   The judge in paragraph 36 of her determination sets out the  sentencing
    remarks following the appellant's conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court
    on 10 February 2011.  On 24 March 2011 the appellant was  sentenced  to
    concurrent terms of imprisonment of three years in respect of counts  2
    to 4 and nine months' imprisonment in respect of count  1.   The  judge
    stated as follows:

         "In the early hours of the morning n 23 December last year the  two
         of you engaged in four street robberies in quick succession.  Three
         of them were accompanied by violence.  ...  You Carabali  took  the
         leading role.  Count 1 concerns Mr W a duty manager standing  at  a
         bus stop.  One of you put your face right into his and  shouted  at
         him to give up his telephone.  The other stood nearby.  He gave  up
         his phone.  Count 2 concerns  a  restaurant  manager  walking  home
         alone.  You Carabali demanded her phone on a number  of  occasions.
         You then raised your right hand and slapped her on the side of  her
         face with a semi-clenched fist, knocking her to  the  ground.   You
         said 'give me the phone  bitch.'   You  M  were  against  there  as
         backup.  She gave up her phone.  Count 3 concerns Mr  BS,  a  young
         man on his way home after a night out.  You Carabali said 'we  went
         your phone'.  He ran off.  You pursued him shouting  at  him.   You
         attacked him.  He recalls being on the floor with Carabali over him
         kicking him and you M nearby telling Carabali to  stop.   You  took
         his wallet and mobile telephone.  He suffered a cut above his  left
         eye, a cut and swollen nose and grazes to his hand  and  knee.   He
         had a blow to the jaw which made it difficult to eat for two weeks.
          It had a significant impact on his confidence even a month  later.
         Count 4 concerns KS walking with her sister to  the  tube  station.
         You Carabali put your arm around her neck  and  forcibly  took  her
         handbag from her grip.  You went through the handbag while M  stood
         between saying 'calm down.  Let him do it, it will be ok.'  At  the
         end of the incident, you Carabali  threw  her  handbag  back.   She
         suffered injury in the incident.  These  are  the  four  robberies.
         You were caught red handed  by  police  close  by  each  with  some
         property from the robberies on you.  Counts  2  to  4  are  serious
         robberies.  They are far too serious  for  anything  other  than  a
         custodial sentence.  Violence was involved.  The offences were late
         at night.  They were perpetrated on people who were entitled to use
         the streets peacefully but were vulnerable because it was  late  at
         night.  Force was used and in two cases injury caused."


5.   The judge noted what had been said to the probation service but  stated
    as follows in paragraph 38 of her decision:

         "I find that the version of events given by the  appellant  to  the
         probation officer does not tally with the sentencing remarks of His
         Honour Judge Richardson.  I find that it is clear from the  judge's
         sentencing remarks that it was the appellant who took the lead.  It
         was the appellant who robbed the victims and it was  the  appellant
         who carried out acts of violence on innocent people.   Yet  in  his
         evidence the appellant said that he is remorseful and  regrets  his
         actions.   I  find  that  inability  to  accept  his  part  in  the
         commission of the offences reduces his credibility and his claim of
         genuine remorse.  In evidence he said that he was very  angry  that
         night and that his girlfriend's best friend told him that  she  had
         aborted his child.  I find that the appellant made no reference  to
         his former girlfriend aborting his child when he was interviewed by
         the probation officer.  Nor is there any  mention  in  the  judge's
         sentencing remarks about the appellant's anger on  the  night  when
         the offences were  committed.   There  is  some  reference  in  the
         judge's sentencing remarks to the appellant claiming  that  he  was
         drunk.  In evidence  the  appellant  said  that  his  actions  have
         affected his life.  He said  that  he  recognises  that  he  caused
         emotional and physical damage to the victims."


6.   Having referred to the evidence of the appellant's  parents  the  judge
    stated at paragraph 41 of her decision as follows:

         "I  take  into  account  the  appellant's  evidence  that  he   has
         undertaken a number of  courses  whilst  he  was  in  prison.   The
         certificates relating to those courses are not in  the  bundle.   I
         find that whilst the appellant  has  expressed  remorse  about  his
         actions it is primarily because it has caused significant upset  to
         his family and has disrupted his plans to study and follow a career
         or start a business.  I find that the appellant's evidence abut the
         impact of his actions on his victims was minimal.  I find  that  in
         his interview with  the  probation  officer,  the  appellant  still
         sought to put the  blame  on  his  co-defendant  rather  than  take
         responsibility himself for both robbing  the  victims  as  well  as
         using violence against them.  I accept in assessing the evidence as
         a whole that the appellant's removal will negatively impact on  his
         family."


7.   She accepted that if removed to Colombia the appellant would  miss  his
    younger brothers growing up and  this  may  have  an  impact  on  their
    relationship with him.  She noted that the appellant's  girlfriend  was
    unable to provide clear and credible evidence about  why  she  believed
    the appellant was remorseful for the offences he  had  committed.   She
    rejected the explanation given that the  appellant  had  committed  the
    offences because he had been angry with a former girlfriend.  The judge
    found that the appellant had consumed an excessive  amount  of  alcohol
    and "gratuitously meted out violence to members of  the  public."   She
    noted that while  the  probation  officer  had  put  the  risk  of  the
    appellant's reoffending and the risk to the public as low the officer's
    report had been criticised by the Presenting Officer.  Having  set  out
    relevant authorities such as N (Kenya) [2004] UKIAT  0009  and  Section
    72(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge's
    determination concludes as follows:

         "51. From 28 July 2014, Section 19  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014
             (Commencement Number  1,  Transitory  and  Saving  Provisions)
             Order 2014  came  into  force.   It  amends  the  Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by introducing a new  Part  5A
             which contains Section 117A to D.   The  statutory  provisions
             apply  to  all  appeals  heard  on  or  after  28  July   2014
             irrespective of when the application or  immigration  decision
             was made.  However Part 5A only  applies  where  the  Tribunal
             considers Article 8(2) ECHR directly.  The  Immigration  rules
             already contain the public interest  question.   I  take  into
             account Section 117C and D.  The starting point  is  that  the
             deportation of foreign criminals is in  the  public  interest.
             In Chege (section 117D - Article 8  -  approach)  [2015]  UKUT
             00165 (IAC) the court held that the correct approach, where an
             appeal on human rights grounds has been brought in seeking  to
             resist deportation, is to consider:


             i.    is  the  appellant  a  foreign  criminal  as  define  by
                  s117D(2)(a), (b) or (c);
             ii.  if so, does he fall within paragraph 399 or 399A  of  the
                  Immigration Rules;
             iii. if not are there very compelling circumstances  over  and
                  beyond those falling within 399 and 399A relied upon, such
                  identification t be informed by  the  seriousness  of  the
                  criminality and taking into account the factors set out in
                  s117B.


             The court held that compelling as an adjective has the meaning
             of having a powerful and irresistible effect; convincing.  The
             purpose of paragraph 398 is to  recognize  circumstances  that
             are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the public interest in
             deportation but do not fall within  paragraph  399  and  399A.
             The task of the judge is to assess the competing interests and
             to determine whether an interference with a person's right  to
             respect for private and family life is justified under Article
             8(2) or whether the public interest arguments  should  prevail
             notwithstanding  the  engagement  of  Article  8.   The  court
             further held that if an  appeal  does  not  succeed  on  human
             rights grounds, paragraph 397 provides the respondent  with  a
             residual discretion to grant leave to  remain  in  exceptional
             circumstances where an appellant cannot  succeed  by  invoking
             rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR.


         52.  I find that the appellant has been  convicted  in  the  United
             Kingdom  of  an  offence  and  sentenced  to   a   period   of
             imprisonment of at least two years.  I  find  that  the  crime
             that he committed was a serious crime and which constituted  a
             danger to the community because violence  and  street  robbery
             was perpetrated on  members  of  the  public  unknown  to  the
             appellant.  However I find that the appellant has  served  his
             sentence of imprisonment and he  attended  all  his  probation
             appointments. Ms Nnamani on the appellant's  behalf  submitted
             that the appellant pleaded guilty and has shown remorse.   She
             said he committed the offences under the influence of  alcohol
             and since those offences were committed he has  not  committed
             any further offences.  I bear in mind that the  appellant  was
             of previous good character before he  committed  the  offences
             which were committed over one night.  Despite  the  criticisms
             made by Miss McKenzie of the OASys Report, I nonetheless  bear
             in mind that the probation  officer  concluded  with  all  the
             information before her that the appellant is of  low  risk  of
             reoffending and of being a risk to the public.


         53.  The appellant gave evidence that he has family life  with  his
             fianc�e Ms M.  Both he and Ms M gave evidence that  they  have
             been in a relationship since 2015.  I find that the  appellant
             does not live with Ms M.  She lives with her  daughter  whilst
             the appellant lives with his family.   Whilst  I  accept  that
             they are in a relationship, I do  not  find  the  relationship
             constitutes family life within  the  meaning  and  purpose  of
             Article 8.  Ms  M  said  that  if  the  appellant  returns  to
             Colombia she will not be able to go with  him  because  her  6
             year old daughter has started supervised contact with her  own
             biological father and he will not allow her to  move  away  to
             live in Colombia.  I  take  into  account  Section  117B;  the
             public question means the question of whether an  interference
             with a  person's  respect  for  private  and  family  life  is
             justified under Article 8(2).  I find that Ms  M  accepted  in
             cross-examination  that  she  knew   about   the   appellant's
             immigration problems even before she commenced a  relationship
             with him in July  2015.   I  find  that  she  entered  into  a
             relationship with the appellant in the full knowledge that  he
             could be  removed  from  this  country.   I  accept  that  the
             appellant has a good relationship  with  Ms  M's  6  year  old
             daughter.  I bear in mind that Ms M's mother is half Colombian
             and has visited Colombia.  I find that she would  be  able  to
             maintain contact with the appellant  through  telephone  calls
             and visits to Colombia.  She does not presently live with  the
             appellant.


         54.  I find that the appellant came to the United  Kingdom  at  the
             age of 7 and has not returned to live in Colombia since  then.
             Whilst he has some relatives in Colombia, I find that he  does
             not have a network of support that would enable him to  settle
             there.  I find  that  the  appellant's  father  went  back  to
             Colombia two years ago specifically to see his mother who  was
             very ill.  The appellant's mother has not returned to Colombia
             since she came to this country in 2000.  The appellant himself
             has not returned to Colombia  even  for  a  holiday  since  he
             arrived in this country.  In Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31  the
             court held that there is no family life between a  parent  and
             an adult child unless it goes beyond normal emotional ties  to
             a relationship of real, committed and effective support.  I do
             not find that the appellant has family life with  his  parents
             within the meaning and purpose of Article 8.


         55.  I find that the appellant has family  life  with  his  younger
             siblings.  I find that he has a  good  relationship  with  his
             sister and has begun to have a relationship with  his  younger
             brothers since he  came  out  of  prison.   I  find  that  the
             appellant has a supportive family,  his  parents  continue  to
             have faith in him and are positive that he has  matured  since
             the offences were committed and would now like to settle  down
             and concentrate on his future.  In taking the  evidence  as  a
             whole  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  I  find   that   any
             interference in the appellant's family and private  life  will
             be disproportionate.  Consequently I find that  the  appellant
             meets the exception in Section 33(2) of the 2007 Act  in  that
             removal  of  pursuance  of   deportation   will   breach   the
             appellant's  Article  8  rights.   Consequently  I  find  that
             deportation is not in the public interest."


    The respondent sought permission to appeal arguing that the  judge  had
    failed to consider the appellant's deportation under both the Rules and
    Section 117C of the 2002 Act.  Reference was made to NE-A  (Nigeria)  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  239.
    Section 117C formed a  complete  code  for  considering  Article  8  in
    deportation cases.  The judge had  accordingly  failed  to  attach  the
    correct weight to the public interest and carry out  the  unduly  harsh
    test as defined by the Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda) [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    617 where the Court of Appeal had  stated  at  paragraph  26  that  the
    expression "unduly harsh" in Section 117C(5) and Rule  399(a)  and  (b)
    required regard to be  had  to  all  the  circumstances  including  the
    criminal's immigration and criminal history.  Permission was granted on
    all grounds by the First-tier Tribunal in a decision dated 8 June 2017.
     It was arguable that the First-tier Judge had not directed her mind to
    the right test but had carried out a freestanding Article 8 analysis.

8.   Mr Armstrong relied on the grounds and submitted that  while  the  case
    of Chege (section 117D - Article 8 - approach) [2015] UKUT 00165  (IAC)
    had been referred to it had  not  been  applied.   The  judge  had  not
    referred to paragraph 399A or Section 117C(4).  Mr Armstrong took me to
    paragraphs 13 to 16 of NE-A (Nigeria) where the  Court  of  Appeal  had
    approved the approach in Rhuppiah v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 803 in holding that

         "Sections 117A - 117D, taken together, are intended to provide  for
         a structured  approach  to  the  application  of  Article  8  which
         produces in all cases a  final  result  which  is  compatible  with
         Article 8.  In particular, if in  working  through  the  structured
         approach one gets to Section 117C(6),  the  proper  application  of
         that provision produces a final result compatible with Article 8 in
         all cases to which it applies ..."

     The judge had erred in carrying out a freestanding Article 8  analysis.
     Reference was made to the sentencing remarks  which  I  have  set  out
    above.  All the victims were vulnerable and it had  been  incumbent  on
    the judge to get the law correct.

9.   Counsel submitted that the determination had been  quite  thorough  and
    adequately reasoned and there were complex issues.  The  appellant  had
    arrived as a child and had committed the offences in 2010.   The  judge
    had set out the details of the  offences.   She  had  referred  to  the
    probation officer's findings and the appellant had been out  of  prison
    for some four and a half years.  While the appellant had shown  limited
    remorse he had been supported by his family and there was a low risk of
    offending.  The decision of an expert Tribunal should be respected  and
    it was necessary to prove that there had been a material error of  law.
    The judge had directed herself correctly.   The  judge's  approach  had
    been even-handed and looked at cumulatively the appellant had  ties  in
    the UK and a lack of ties in Colombia.  The offences  were  some  seven
    years ago and could be looked at as a single  offence.   The  appellant
    had been of previous good  character  and  had  undertaken  courses  in
    prison.

10.  In response Mr Armstrong acknowledged that the judge  had  referred  to
    Chege but had not considered Section 117C.  He submitted that while the
    judge had set out the law in paragraph 51 it was not  shown  where  the
    compelling circumstances were.  The appellant did  not  live  with  his
    fianc�e.  No proper assessment had been made by  reference  to  Section
    117C(4).

11.  If a material  error  of  law  was  identified  the  appeal  should  be
    remitted for a fresh hearing de novo  and  I  was  not  invited  by  Mr
    Armstrong to preserve any of the findings of fact.

12.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only  interfere  with  the  decision  if  it  is  was
    materially flawed in law.  When reading the determination it has to  be
    said that the conclusion of the judge in paragraph 55 comes as somewhat
    of a surprise given the number of negative findings made in respect  of
    the appellant.  Counsel argued that the determination showed a balanced
    approach.

13.   One  feature  is  the  issue  of  the  appellant's  claimed   remorse.
    Frequently during the course of the determination the judge rejects the
    appellant's expression of remorse - for example in  paragraphs  38  and
    45. In paragraph 41 she noted that while the  appellant  had  expressed
    remorse this was primarily because his actions had  caused  significant
    upset to his family and had disrupted his plans to study and  follow  a
    career or start a  business.   She  also  found  that  the  appellant's
    evidence about the impact of his actions on his  victims  was  minimal.
    He had still sought to blame his co-defendant.   In  paragraph  52  the
    judge simply  records  Counsel's  submission  that  the  appellant  had
    pleaded guilty and had shown remorse.  It is also to be noted that  the
    judge found that what the appellant had said to the  probation  officer
    did not tally with the judge's sentencing remarks.  In fairness to  the
    judge she does note the criticisms made by the Presenting  Officer  but
    it has to be said it is  difficult  to  reconcile  the  detailed  fact-
    finding with the decision reached.

14.  As is submitted by Mr  Armstrong  this  is  a  case  involving  serious
    offences against members of the public.  It is  a  case  in  which  the
    requirements of the legislation and  the  Rules  need  to  be  followed
    particularly where the determination was  by  no  means  overwhelmingly
    positive in favour of the appellant on issues such as remorse.

15.  The  closest  one  comes  in  the  reasoning  to  any  difficulties  in
    returning to Colombia would be that  the  appellant  did  not  have  "a
    network of support" there which would enable him to settle.   It  would
    be very difficult to read this as satisfying the requirement that there
    should be "very significant obstacles" to the  appellant's  integration
    into Colombia.  As submitted by Mr Armstrong the judge does not  appear
    to have taken into account Section 117C(4).  The same point can be made
    by reference to Rule 399A(c).  It is not clear from  the  determination
    whether the judge found that either of these  paragraphs  applied.   Of
    course if  they  do  not  it  would  be  necessary  to  identify  "very
    compelling circumstances over  and  above  those  described"  in  those
    paragraphs.

16.  In my view the judge's decision is flawed by failing to deal  expressly
    or even by implication with the learning which I accept  had  been  set
    out at an earlier stage in the decision.  This is not a decision  where
    an inference can be drawn that matters were approached correctly and  I
    accept the submissions made on behalf of Mr Armstrong.

17.  The determination was flawed by a material error of  law.   Both  sides
    were in agreement that should I so find a fresh  hearing  de  novo  was
    required.  It was accepted by Mr Armstrong that none  of  the  negative
    factual analysis should be preserved.  The hearing will be de novo.
