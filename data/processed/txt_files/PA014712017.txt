Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Spurling, Counsel instructed by Barnes Harrild
                    & Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. At an error of law hearing on 17 January 2018 this  Tribunal  found  an
    error of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Abebrese
    (promulgated on 11 May 2017) to dismiss the appellant's appeal  on  all
    grounds.  The appellant, an Iranian citizen was born on  28  July  1996
    and had appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 27 January 2017, to refuse his protection claim.  The
    error of law decision is appended to this decision.

 2. That decision found that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  its
    approach to the appellant's sur place activities.  The findings of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, including at  paragraph  22  of  Judge  Abebrese's
    decision, that the appellant had no genuine political opinions and that
    his  claims  in  relation  to  the  Peshmerga  was  not  credible  were
    preserved.

 3. In the interim, the Upper Tribunal has promulgated the country guidance
    decision of HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430 (IAC).

 4. It was agreed by the parties before me that no  further  oral  evidence
    was required and the hearing proceeded by way of detailed  submissions.
    Those submissions are set out in full in the Record of Proceedings.  At
    the end of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now give.

 5. The Upper Tribunal in HB provided  as  follows  as  summarised  in  the
    headnote:



         "(1)     SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG
             [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC) remains valid country guidance in terms
             of the country guidance offered in the headnote.  For the
             avoidance of doubt, that decision is not authority for any
             proposition in relation to the risk on return for refused
             Kurdish asylum-seekers on account of their Kurdish ethnicity
             alone.

         (2)  Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the evidence does
             not support a contention that such discrimination is, in
             general, at such a level as to amount to persecution or
             Article 3 ill-treatment.

         (3)  Since 2016 the Iranian authorities have become increasingly
             suspicious of, and sensitive to, Kurdish political activity.
             Those of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even greater
             suspicion than hitherto and are reasonably likely to be
             subjected to heightened scrutiny on return to Iran.

         (4)  However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish
             ethnicity with or without a valid passport, and even if
             combined with illegal exit, does not create a risk of
             persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

         (5)  Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when
             combined with other factors, may create a real risk of
             persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.  Being a risk factor
             it means that Kurdish ethnicity is a factor of particular
             significance when assessing risk.  Those "other factors" will
             include the matters identified in paragraphs (6)-(9) below.

         (6)  A period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish returnee is
             reasonable likely to result in additional questioning by the
             authorities on return.  However, this is a factor that will be
             highly fact-specific and the degree of interest that such
             residence will excite will depend, non-exhaustively, on
             matters such as the length of residence in the KRI, what the
             person concerned was doing there and why they left.

          (7) Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups or activity are at
             risk of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the
             Iranian authorities.  Even Kurds expressing peaceful dissent
             or who speak out about Kurdish rights also face a real risk of
             persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

         (8)  Activities that can be perceived to be political by the
             Iranian authorities include social welfare and charitable
             activities on behalf of Kurds.  Indeed, involvement with any
             organised activity on behalf of or in support of Kurds can be
             perceived as political and thus involve a risk of adverse
             attention by the Iranian authorities with the consequent risk
             of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

         (9)  Even 'low-level' political activity, or activity that is
             perceived to be political, such as, by way of example only,
             mere possession of leaflets espousing or supporting Kurdish
             rights, if discovered, involves the same risk of persecution
             or Article 3 ill-treatment.  Each case however, depends on its
             own facts and an assessment will need to be made as to the
             nature of the material possessed and how it would be likely to
             be viewed by the Iranian authorities in the context of the
             foregoing guidance.

         (10) The Iranian authorities demonstrate what could be described as
             a 'hair-trigger' approach to those suspected of or perceived
             to be involved in Kurdish political activities or support for
             Kurdish rights.  By 'hair-trigger' it means that the threshold
             for suspicion is low and the reaction of the authorities is
             reasonably likely to be extreme."

 6. Ms Isherwood helpfully took  the  Tribunal  through  all  the  existing
    relevant country guidance case law on  Iran.   As  highlighted  in  the
    headnote above, SSH and HR   remains  valid.   It  was  Ms  Isherwood's
    global submission, applying the case law, given the limited  extent  of
    this appellant's activities (and Ms Isherwood questioned how widely his
    Facebook posts were disseminated) the appellant's activities would  not
    be sufficient to activate the 'hair-trigger' approach  of  the  Iranian
    authorities.

 7. In summary it was Mr Spurling's submission that the appellant, whom  it
    was not specifically disputed before me has, for reasons of  bolstering
    his asylum claim, made Facebook posts whilst in the UK, would fall into
    the risk category, on the facts of his own case and would be  perceived
    to be political, notwithstanding the Tribunal's preserved finding  that
    he held no such political opinions and notwithstanding the reasons  for
    which he had posted that material and Mr Spurling drew my attention  to
    material which supported such a conclusion.

 8. Mr Spurling relied in particular on the expert evidence  considered  by
    the Tribunal in HB that of Enayat and Professor  Emile  Joff�  and  the
    Tribunal in HB, at paragraph 42, had no  hesitation  in  accepting  the
    expertise of the experts whilst indicating at 44 that that did not mean
    that they were bound to accept every aspect of  the  experts'  evidence
    and where they had not done  so  they  explained  why  and  there  were
    several aspects of Professor Joff�'s report in particular that were not
    accepted including that all Kurds were at risk of persecution.

 9. I accept that HB confirms, that all Kurds face a reasonable  likelihood
    of heightened scrutiny on return particularly in  the  context  of  the
    fact that since 2016 the Iranian authorities have  become  increasingly
    sensitive  and  suspicious  about  Kurdish  political   activity.    At
    paragraph 50 of  HB  the  Tribunal  highlight  the  importance  of  the
    consistent evidence  of  both  experts,  supported  by  the  background
    evidence, about the heightened tensions in Iran in security  terms  and
    in relation to those of Kurdish ethnicity.

10. Although the mere fact of being a Kurdish returnee would not in  itself
    lead to persecution, I have taken into  account  that  the  appellant's
    Kurdish ethnicity is a risk factor which must be assessed in the  round
    in the appellant's  particular  circumstances.   It  was  not  disputed
    before me that this appellant would be  returning  without  a  passport
    (the appellant having entered the UK  clandestinely).   Notwithstanding
    the appellant's lack of credibility generally, including given the lack
    of dispute I accept to the lower standard that he  would  be  returning
    without a passport.  Although SB (risk on return - illegal  exit)  Iran
    CG [2009] UKAIT 00053  confirmed that illegal exit is not in  itself  a
    significant risk factor, it could be a  factor  adding  to  risk  if  a
    person otherwise faces difficulties.

11. As recognised in current country guidance  including  SSH  and  HR  and
    confirmed in HB  a returned without a passport such as the appellant is
    likely to be  questioned  on  return.   Paragraph  23  of  SSH  and  HR
    highlighted that a failed asylum seeker will be questioned and that 'if
    there are particular concerns arising from  their  previous  activities
    either in Iran or in the United Kingdom or whichever country  they  are
    returned from, then there would  be  a  risk  of  further  questioning,
    detention and potential ill-treatment'.

12. I am satisfied to the lower standard that the appellant's return  would
    lead to questioning about the content of the appellant's asylum  claim.
    I must then decide the impact,  if  any  of  the  appellant's  Facebook
    activity whilst in the UK.

13. In relation to internet activity specifically the Tribunal  in  HB  was
    clear, at paragraphs 81 and 82, that although guidance was requested on
    behalf of that appellant, to the effect  that  a  risk  of  persecution
    arose where an individual was involved  in  the  making,  reposting  or
    otherwise publicising  critical  comments,  insulting,  satirical  etc.
    comments about Islam, Islamic  religious  figures,  the  Quran,  Iran's
    policies or regime members, online on social media networks whether  in
    Iran or abroad, the Tribunal concluded that such proposed guidance  was
    "way outside the scope of the case before us and in any  event  is  far
    too widely drawn."  The Tribunal  continued  that  although  there  was
    evidence  regarding  the  potential  risk  for  those  whose   internet
    activity/social media may attract  adverse  attention  and  authorities
    that was not a matter in which the parties or experts engaged  with  in
    relation to the giving of country guidance and the  Tribunal  took  the
    view that such  consideration  was  likely  to  require  some  tactical
    evidence and such was not before the Tribunal.

14. Social media however was relevant to that particular  appellant's  case
    in HB and it was considered in that context.  In applying  the  country
    guidance case law and in considering that social media is  relevant  on
    the particular facts of this appellant's case, I have followed the same
    approach.

15. In doing so I have reminded myself that  the  reported  case  of  AB  &
    Others (internet activity - state of evidence) Iran [2015]  UKUT  00257
    (IAC) including as referred to in the appended error of law decision is
    not a country guidance  case  and  I  have  reminded  myself  that  the
    evidence considered by the Upper Tribunal in that case  therefore  must
    not be given any particular weight in the case  before  me  as  country
    guidance cases only are exceptions to the general Rule evidence and one
    case cannot be relied in another case (see including AM  (Iran)  [2018]
    EWCA Civ 2706).

16. I have taken into consideration that although the appellant is clearly,
    and has clearly continued to do so since  the  error  of  law  hearing,
    making Facebook posts in order to bolster his asylum claim, I  rely  on
    what I have said already in the error of law  decision  that  does  not
    obviate the need to consider the  risk,  if  any  that  that  puts  the
    appellant at on return.

17. There were further posts provided for the Upper Tribunal  hearing  (and
    there was no objection by Ms Isherwood to the Rule 15(2A) application).
     The evidence relates to material not in existence at the time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I accept that there has  been  no  unreasonable
    delay in producing it.  The evidence is potentially of significance  to
    the appellant's claim and having  considered  the  relevant  procedural
    rule I admitted it into evidence.

18. The new evidence included various photographs and comments made by  the
    appellant and shared by him on Facebook  including  satirical  comments
    and  other  posts  including  a  post  of  the  appellant  attending  a
    demonstration.  Contrary to Ms Isherwood's submissions, it  is  evident
    that the photographs and posts shared, are supportive of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan and are plainly very critical of the Iranian
    regime including sharing for example a photograph where it  is  written
    'Iran is the state of execution' and 'down with the dictatorial  regime
    of Iran'.  Photographs shared include one where the Iran flag is used a
    toilet paper  and  a  photograph  showing  an  Iranian  leader  with  a
    superimposed pig's nose.  I take into consideration that all the  posts
    show a globe symbol and I  accept  to  the  lower  standard  that  this
    indicates that the posts are publically  available  (although  for  the
    reasons set out below such is not determinative).

19. Whilst Mr Spurling conceded that the activity itself was relatively low
    level, I agree that is not the level of the activity (or the  level  of
    its dissemination) which might give rise to a risk to the appellant.

20. I have taken into consideration that there was considerable  background
    evidence including as relied on in the  country  guidance  cases  about
    routine airport checks which involve  risks  and  checks  including  on
    Facebook activity.  I take into consideration that the summary  of  the
    expert evidence in HB indicated that the authorities  would  ask  about
    and check Facebook material and that the experts were of the view  that
    this extended to asking people about the contents of their asylum claim
    and that people could not escape the risk of persecution even  if  they
    said that their claim was based on lies.  That is consistent with  what
    was said in the country guidance case of BA (Demonstrators in Britain -
    risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36  (IAC)  at  paragraph  65,  that
    whilst  it  may  well  be  that   an   appellant's   participation   in
    demonstrations is opportunistic the evidence suggests it is not  likely
    to be a major influence on  the  perception  of  the  regime  and  this
    finding was endorsed by the expert witnesses in HB.

21. Although this appellant may  have  made  an  opportunistic  claim,  the
    nature and content of the posts that he has  continually  reposted  and
    displayed, rather than the extent of the exposure, creates a risk.  The
    expert evidence annexed in HB which at paragraph 7  of  that  decision,
    the Upper Tribunal confirmed was "essential to the  full  understanding
    of this decision that full reference is made to the  summarised  expert
    evidence" indicates that the  Iranian  authorities  have  a  particular
    interest in Facebook and that merely sharing and liking posts on social
    media is risky.

22. I accept that this is the case and that there is a real risk, given the
    appellant's Kurdish ethnicity and return without a passport,  that  the
    questioning at the airport will  result  in  the  appellant  having  to
    reveal his Facebook details.  I am further  satisfied  that  this  will
    engage the authorities 'hair-trigger' approach  in  relation  to  their
    suspicion, however misplaced, that the appellant is involved in Kurdish
    political activities and/or supports Kurdish rights which will put  the
    appellant at real risk of further questioning/imprisonment  which  will
    put the appellant at real risk of persecution.

23. I find that in these circumstances, the appellant  has  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution in Iran on account of his imputed political opinion
    and.


Humanitarian Protection

24. As I have found that the appellant is a refugee, he cannot qualify for
    humanitarian protection.  If I am wrong as to the Convention reason, I
    find, for the reasons given, the appellant would face a real risk of
    suffering serious harm and is unable, or owing to such risk unwilling,
    to avail himself of the protection of that country.



Human Rights


25. As I have found the appellant has established substantial grounds for
    believing that he would face a real risk of serious harm if returned to
    Sudan, by analogy I find his claim engages articles 2 and 3 of the
    European Convention on Human Rights.



Decision


26. The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.

27. I make no finding under the Qualification Directive.

28. The appeal is allowed on Human Rights grounds (Articles 2 and 3).

29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and is
    set aside.  I remake that decision allowing the appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.

Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer

                   DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND DIRECTIONS

Background

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Iran born on 28 July 1996.
    He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the
    respondent, dated 27 January 2017, refusing the appellant asylum,
    humanitarian protection and his appeal on human rights grounds.  In a
    Decision and Reasons promulgated on 11 May 2017, Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Abebrese dismissed the appellant's appeal on all grounds.

 2. The appellant appealed on the following grounds:

Ground 1:     Flawed assessment of the appellant's Facebook evidence in
light of the case of AB and Others (internet activity - state of evidence)
Iran [2015] UKUT 0257;

Ground 2:     Flawed treatment of the risk to the appellant from his
Kurdish ethnicity.

Error of Law

 3. For the reasons set out below I find an error of law in the appellant's
    first ground.  Mr Spurling, whilst relying on the second ground, did
    not make any substantive submissions before me other than to indicate
    that this issue is being considered by the Upper Tribunal as a country
    guidance case in the coming months.

 4. The background of this case is that the appellant claims to be an
    uneducated Iranian Kurd and is illiterate and made a claim in relation
    to alleged difficulties experienced by himself and his father with the
    Peshmerga and Ettela'at in Iran.  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    did not find the appellant credible in relation to his claim to have
    assisted the Peshmerga; that finding has not been substantively
    challenged and is preserved.

 5. It was the appellant's case that since entering the UK (he was
    encountered on 26 July 2016 and claimed asylum on 1 August 2016) he has
    posted material on the internet which, he states, has put him further
    at risk.  It was not disputed that the appellant has made such posts on
    the internet and there was material before me, from page 22 of the
    appellant's bundle to page 39 of the appellant's bundle, which were
    printouts of that material together with English translations, which
    indicated that material is in support of the Kurds and critical of the
    Iranian regime.  The Tribunal accepted that the appellant had put
    material on Facebook, finding at [23] that:

    'The appellant has in my view put material on Facebook in order to
    enhance and bolster his claim'.

 6. The judge noted that the appellant had not joined any opposition party
    in Iran and had not been politically active prior to his arrival in the
    UK.  The judge went on to find as follows at [26]:

"He has further sought to bolster his claim by putting materials on the
internet in order to attract attention to himself and also in order to
enhance his claim for asylum in this country.  Therefore the risk which
this appellant may face on being returned to Iran has been entirely due to
his own design and an attempt to make a non-genuine asylum claim in this
country.  The objective material which is posted on the internet in my view
does not put him at risk and I have found in favour of the arguments put
forward by the respondent's representative in that this material was only
put up according to the evidence from December 2016 and therefore a
relatively short time of activity, it contains no written comments and also
more importantly there is no evidence to suggest that he has written any
information attached to the posted material.  This appellant would not be
at risk even though he would be a failed asylum seeker being returned with
Kurdish ethnicity and there is no evidence to suggest that his Facebook
material has been monitored by the Iranian authorities."

 7. It was accepted by Mr Tufan that the judge's approach was flawed in
    respect of the established principle in Danian [1999] EWCA Civ 3000,
    that the fact that sur place activity may not be undertaken for a
    genuine motive does not in itself preclude an individual from being
    entitled to a grant of protection.  I am of the view that the judge's
    consideration of the appellant's Facebook posts was tainted by his
    findings that the posts had been made solely to bolster the appellant's
    asylum claim and that there was subsequently no adequate consideration
    of the practical effect of those posts and how they impacted on the
    appellant's risk.

 8. It was not disputed before me that the judge had before him, including
    in the context of the appellant's representative's skeleton argument,
    the arguments of the Upper Tribunal in the reported decision of AB and
    Others (internet activity - state of evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 0257,
    which accepted that being resident in the UK for a prolonged period may
    lead to scrutiny and screening on arrival and that the Iranian
    authorities are very sensitive to even mild criticism and in addition
    that they are not concerned with an individual's motivation and this
    was considered specifically in the context of Facebook posts.

 9. That must be considered in light of BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk
    on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36 (IAC) and more recently SSH and HR
    (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 308 (IAC), the
    most recent country guidance on Iran, where the Tribunal reached the
    view, at [30] that:

"We can understand the sensitivity that the Iranian authorities may have
towards perceived slights against their own state in the form of untruthful
allegations about the conduct of the state, but equally one can expect a
degree of reality on their part in relation to people who in the interests
of advancing their economic circumstances, would make up a story in order
to secure economic betterment in a wealthier country."

10. I have taken into consideration that SSH and HR remains the relevant
    country guidance.  The reported decision in AB and Others is not
    country guidance.  However, it is useful to consider the detailed
    findings of the Upper Tribunal in relation to internet activity:

"466.    It is very difficult to establish any kind of clear picture about
the risks consequent on blogging activities in Iran.  Very few people seem
to be returned unwillingly and this makes it very difficult to predict with
any degree of confidence what fate, if any, awaits them.  Some monitoring
of activities outside Iran is possible and it occurs.  It is not possible
to determine what circumstances, if any, enhance or dilute the risk
although a high degree of activity is not necessary to attract persecution.

467. The mere fact of being in the United Kingdom for a prolonged period
does not lead to persecution.  However it may lead to scrutiny and there is
clear evidence that some people are asked about their internet activity and
particularly for their Facebook password.  The act of returning someone
creates a 'pinch point' so that a person is brought into direct contact
with the authorities in Iran who have both the time and inclination to
interrogate them.  We think it likely that they will be asked about their
internet activity and likely if they have any internet activity for that to
be exposed and if it is less than flattering of the government to lead to
at the very least a real risk of persecution.

468. Social and other internet-based media is used widely through Iran by a
very high percentage of the population and activities such as blogging may
be perceived as criticisms of the state which is very aware of the power of
the internet.  The Iranian authorities in their various guises both
regulate and police the internet, closing down or marking internet sites
although this does not appear to be linked directly to persecution.

469. The capability to monitor outside Iran is not very different from the
capability to monitor inside Iran.  The Iranian authorities clearly have
the capacity to restrict access to social internet-based media.  Overall it
is very difficult to make any sensible findings about anything that
converts a technical possibility of something being discovered into a real
risk of it being discovered.

470. The main concern is the pinch point of return.  A person who was
returning to Iran after a reasonably short period of time on an ordinary
passport having left Iran illegally would almost certainly not attract any
particular attention at all and for the small number of people who would be
returning on an ordinary passport having left lawfully we do not think that
there would be any risk to them at all.

471. However, as might more frequently be the case, where a person's leave
to remain had lapsed and who might be travelling on a special passport,
there would be enhanced interest.  The more active they had been the more
likely the authorities' interest could lead to persecution.

472. The mere fact that a person, if extremely discrete, blogged in the
United Kingdom would not mean they would necessarily come to the attention
of the authorities in Iran.  However, if there was a lapse of discretion
they could face hostile interrogation on return which might expose them to
risk.  The more active a person had been on the internet the greater the
risk.  It is not relevant if a person had used the internet in an
opportunistic way.  The authorities are not concerned with a person's
motivation.  However in cases in which they have taken an interest claiming
asylum is viewed negatively.  This may not of itself be sufficient to lead
to persecution but it may enhance the risk."

In addition, at paragraph 455:

"455.    We do reject Mr Rawat's submission that a high degree of activity
is necessary to attract persecution.  It is probably the case that the more
active persons are the more likely they are to be persecuted but the
reverse just does not apply.  We find that the authorities do not chase
everyone who just might be an opponent but if that opponent comes to their
attention for some reason then that person might be in quite serious
trouble for conduct which to the ideas of western liberal society seems of
little consequence.

...

457. We accept the evidence that some people who have expected no trouble
have found trouble and that does concern us.  We also accept the evidence
that very few people seem to be returned unwillingly and this makes it very
difficult to predict with any degree of confidence what fate, if any,
awaits them.  There is clear evidence that some people are asked about
their internet activity and particularly for their Facebook password.  We
can think of no reason whatsoever to doubt this evidence.  It is absolutely
clear that blogging and activities on Facebook are very common amongst
Iranian citizens and it is very clear that the Iranian authorities are
exceedingly twitchy about them.  We cannot see why a person who would
attract the authorities sufficiently to be interrogated and asked to give
account of his conduct outside of Iran would not be asked what he had done
on the internet.  Such a person could not be expected to lie, partly
because that is how the law is developed and partly because, as is
illustrated in one of the examples given above, it is often quite easy to
check up and expose such a person.  We find that the act of returning
someone creates a 'pinch point' so that returnees are brought into direct
contact with the authorities in Iran who have both the time and inclination
to interrogate them.  We think it likely that they will be asked about
their internet activity and likely if they have any internet activity for
that to be exposed and if it is less than flattering of the government to
lead to a real risk of persecution.

..."

11. In light of the current evidence in relation to the Iranian
    authorities' approach to internet activity and to returnees in general,
    it was incumbent on the First-tier Tribunal to consider and assess the
    nature and extent of the appellant's blogging activities and whether in
    his particular circumstances that would bring him to a risk of harm on
    return (notwithstanding his motives for doing so).  That consideration
    ought to have had regard to whether or not in the particular facts of
    this case, his Kurdish ethnicity would be an aggravating factor.
    Failure to consider AB and Others, or SSH, is a material error, albeit
    that the appellant has yet to address the concerns expressed in SSH, as
    detailed above, as to the likely approach of the Iranian authorities to
    returnees in these circumstances.

12. I am therefore satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    contains a material error of law such that it should be set aside.  The
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the appellant does not
    have genuine political opinions and that his claims in relation to the
    Peshmerga were not credible are preserved.  I further preserve the
    findings that the appellant has made Facebook posts, that there were
    pictures but no specific original comments from the appellant.

Notice of Decision on Error of Law

13. The First-tier Tribunal's determination contains an error of law
    capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal and is set aside, other
    than as set out in the preceding paragraph.  The decision on appeal
    will be remade by the Upper Tribunal

Remaking the Decision

14. I was initially disposed to remake the decision on the available
    evidence.  However, I took into consideration Mr Spurling's submissions
    that further country guidance, that may be relevant to the second
    ground of appeal, is imminent.  In addition the appellant has
    undertaken further activities and wishes to produce evidence in this
    regard.  Mr Tufan had no objection to an adjournment on that basis.

Directions

The appeal is to be relisted, before a single Judge or Deputy Judge of the
Upper Tribunal no earlier than 1 May 2018

The appellant is to file and serve a consolidated bundle of evidence so it
is received no later than 1 April 2018.  The bundle is to separately
tabulate

      i) the evidence relied upon before the First-tier Tribunal; and

     ii) the additional evidence it is now sought to rely upon before the
         Upper Tribunal.

The bundle must contain any evidence relied on to address the relevant
country guidance both in SSH and any guidance subsequently promulgated in
relation to the risk on return for failed asylum seekers with Kurdish
ethnicity.

The Secretary of State is to file and serve, by no later than 8 April 2018,
any evidence relied upon that is not contained within the bundle to be
relied upon before the FtT.

Any failure to comply with these Directions may lead to the Tribunal to
exercise its power to decide the appeal without a further oral hearing and
to conclude that the defaulting party has no relevant information, evidence
or submissions to provide.
