For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq born in 1986.  He  appeals  against
    the Secretary of State's decision to deport him on protection and human
    rights grounds.



    Case History and Introduction

 2. The material history of this matter is as follows:

    November 2007 The Appellant claims asylum on arrival

    January 2008  His asylum claim was refused

    March 2008    The First-tier Tribunal dismiss his asylum appeal

    2009 Further representations are made, and rejected

    August 2014   The Appellant was granted 3 years' Discretionary Leave on
                      Article 8 grounds

    3rd December 2015 The Appellant sentenced to  12  months'  imprisonment
                      for evasion of customs duty on smuggled cigarettes

    10th August 2016  The Respondent signs a deportation order

                      The Appellant  appeals  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
                      resisting deportation on protection and human  rights
                      grounds

    11th July 2018    First-tier Tribunal Judge Pickup dismisses the appeal
                      on all grounds

                      First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro  grants  permission
                      to Appeal to Upper Tribunal

    31st July 2018    Mr Justice Lane sets the decision  of  Judge  Pickup,
                      insofar as it related to the  matter  of  protection,
                      aside to be  remade.   The  error  identified  was  a
                      failure to follow country guidance.

                      Judge  Lane  upholds  Judge  Pickup's  reasoning   on
                      Article 8, rejecting the contention  in  the  grounds
                      that he erred by 'double counting'  when  he  weighed
                      the  Appellant's   criminality   against   the   best
                      interests  of  his  children  in  the  assessment  of
                      whether it would be "unduly harsh" on those  children
                      were he to be deported. Judge Lane finds  that  Judge
                      Pickup did not err in following the guidance  of  the
                      Court of Appeal (in for instance MM  (Uganda)  [2016]
                      EWCA Civ 450).

    24th October 2018 Supreme Court hands down judgement in KO (Nigeria)  v
                      Secretary of State for the Home Department

    1st  November  2018  Principle  Resident  Judge  O'Connor  makes  order
                      transferring the case from the President's list

    29th January 2019 Matter listed before me at Manchester CJC  to  remake
                      the decision in the appeal.  The parties agreed  that
                      pursuant to the decision in KO  (Nigeria)  a  further
                      error has been identified in the  decision  of  Judge
                      Pickup. The Appellant's grounds to the Upper Tribunal
                      had specifically challenged the First-tier Tribunal's
                      approach to the question of  'undue  harshness'.   At
                      the date of the hearing before Judge Lane,  Court  of
                      Appeal authority was firmly with Judge Pickup and  no
                      arguable error therefore arose.   By the date of  the
                      hearing before me, the legal landscape  had  markedly
                      altered in that  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the
                      question of 'undue harshness' was one that was to  be
                      determined with reference to the child alone: it  was
                      not  lawful  to  determine  what   might   constitute
                      'harshness' with reference to the offending  parent's
                      criminality.   On that  basis  Mr  Jafferji  made  an
                      unopposed application to amend the grounds of  appeal
                      which I granted.

                      By my oral judgment and written decision of the  29th
                      January 2019 I found as follows:

                           "Although the  First-tier  Tribunal  conducted  a
                           careful 'balance sheet' analysis of  all  of  the
                           relevant factors it was quite clear that  it  did
                           take the approach then endorsed by the  Court  of
                           Appeal, and subsequently ruled  unlawful  by  the
                           Supreme  Court.  At  paragraph  85  the  Tribunal
                           directs itself to MM (Uganda) in which the  court
                           directed  that  the  'unduly   harsh'   balancing
                           exercise "must involve an assessment of the wider
                           public  interest  in  the  appellant's   removal,
                           including his immigration and criminal  history".
                           The Tribunal  concludes:  "it  follows  that  the
                           consideration is not merely on the effect on  the
                           child or partner alone".   I  am  satisfied  that
                           this was an error in approach.  I  therefore  set
                           the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  insofar
                           as it relates to Article 8, aside".

                      On the 29th January 2019  the  Respondent,  that  day
                      represented by Senior Presenting Officer Mr  Diwnycz,
                      was not in a position to proceed to a full  remaking.
                      He had come to the hearing only prepared to argue the
                      protection point  and  had  no  instructions  on  the
                      position taken by the criminal  casework  directorate
                      to such cases post-KO.  He asked that the  matter  be
                      adjourned to enable him to take such instructions and
                      if necessary, to conduct a  review  of  the  case  in
                      accordance with the KO principles.

                      Given that the Article 8 issue  had  only  arisen  at
                      hearing, and given the indication that the Respondent
                      may wish to review his decision, I agreed to  adjourn
                      the re-making.

    18th July 2019    The hearing resumed before me. The  Home  Office  had
                      not, as Mr Diwnycz had hoped, conducted a  review  of
                      the case. I proceeded to hear oral evidence from  the
                      Appellant and his British partner, CN.  This evidence
                      was wholly concerned with the Appellant's  Article  8
                      family life in the United Kingdom. At the  conclusion
                      of  the  evidence  it  was  agreed  that  before  the
                      Tribunal proceed to determine the protection limb  of
                      the Appellant's case, the Tribunal should  await  the
                      new country guidance on Iraq,  then  believed  to  be
                      shortly forthcoming.

    20th December 2019     The decision in SMO and  Others  (Article  15(c)
                      identity documents)  Iraq  CG  [2019]  UKUT  400  was
                      published

    3rd March 2020    The appeal is relisted before me to hear  submissions
                      on Article 8 and the protection claim, made in  light
                      of the new country guidance.

 3. It will be apparent from that chronology that there has been  a  series
    of unfortunate delays in the resolution of this matter, caused in  part
    by the Home Office, and in part by the Tribunal.   For those delays the
    parties, and in particular  the  Appellant  and  his  family,  have  my
    apologies.

 4. The Appellant is not a British citizen and at present he has  no  leave
    to remain. He is therefore liable to deportation pursuant to  s3(5)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971. On the 3rd November 2015 at Manchester  Crown
    Court the Appellant was convicted of two counts of fraudulently evading
    duty and on the 3rd December 2015 he was  sentenced  to  12  months  in
    prison. The effect of this sentence is that in accordance with  s32  of
    the United Kingdom Borders Act 2007 the Secretary of State must make an
    'automatic' order for  the  Appellant's  deportation.   Notwithstanding
    that his deportation is in the public interest the Appellant can  avoid
    actually being removed if he can demonstrate that one or  more  of  the
    'exceptions' set out in s33 of the Borders Act 2007 apply to him.

 5. In this regard the Appellant makes two submissions. He submits that  he
    cannot be removed to Iraq because  he  will  be  in  danger  there;  he
    further  submits  that  to  remove  him  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with his right to Article 8 family life.    The  statutory
    provision relating to the latter  'exception'  is  unambiguous:  it  is
    found at s33(2)(a) of the Borders Act 2007, to be read with Part 5A  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as  amended).  As  to
    the 'protection' limb of the claim it  is  less  clear.  Section  33(2)
    reads:

         (2)  Exception 1 is  where  removal  of  the  foreign  criminal  in
         pursuance of the deportation order would breach-

             (a)  a person's Convention rights, or

             (b)   the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the  Refugee
             Convention.

 6. Although he asserts that he would face a  real  risk  of  serious  harm
    should he be returned to Iraq the Appellant does  not  in  fact  assert
    that he is entitled to refugee status.  His  claim  under  the  Refugee
    Convention was  rejected  long  ago,  his  asylum  appeal  having  been
    dismissed by Immigration  Judge  Battersby  on  the  17th  March  2008.
    Before  me  Mr  Jafferji's  submissions  were  solely  concerned   with
    subsidiary protection status under  Article  15  of  the  Qualification
    Directive, not  a  matter  that  prima  facie  engages  s33(2)(b).    I
    therefore proceed on the  basis  that  the  'protection'  limb  of  the
    Appellant's case is, in the context of s33, more properly understood as
    a second element of his 'human rights' claim, it being  concerned  with
    Article 3 ECHR as well as Article 15 of  the  Qualification  Directive.
    That said, if the Appellant succeeds in demonstrating that  his  appeal
    should be allowed on Article 15 grounds the effect  of  this,  for  the
    purpose of the appeal under s82 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002, will be that the appeal is allowed on protection grounds. I  deal
    with each element of the case in turn.

    Protection: Article 15 QD/ Article 3 ECHR

 7. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq.  The Respondent tells  me  that  he
    arrived in the United Kingdom on the  2nd  November  2007  and  claimed
    asylum the same day.   The Appellant has consistently  stated  that  he
    was born in Douz, in the Kirkuk governate, and that when he  left  Iraq
    this is where his family were residing: see 1.10,  3.1,  3.2  screening
    interview, Q2-5 asylum interview.   In his decision  of  the  11th  May
    2018 Judge Pickup found [at his paragraph 59] that the Appellant  still
    has some contact with his family in Kirkuk. That finding was  expressly
    upheld by Lane J.

 8. It is not in issue  that  the  Appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally. The Respondent has never challenged his claim to  have  done
    so with the assistance of people smugglers.  It is accepted that he did
    not have an Iraqi passport with him when he arrived. As to  what  other
    documents he might have had in his possession the  Appellant  told  the
    officer at his 'screening interview' that he had  a  National  Identity
    card but that he had left this in Iraq. It was issued to him at  birth:
    see 7.36 and 7.37.  At the outset of his substantive  asylum  interview
    the Appellant handed in to the officer documents described  as  follows
    [at Q1, B6]:

         "ID card

         Photographs

         Military ID card (badge)

         Conscription letter for 3 months"

 9.  These  documents  were  subsequently  examined  by  Immigration  Judge
    Battersby at the Appellant's asylum appeal. At paragraph  12.2  of  the
    decision Judge Battersby describes the "identification card". He states
    that it was issued on the 1st December 2015,  it  expired  on  the  1st
    December 2006 and that an enrolment date of the 11th  January  2005  is
    entered. Given these  dates,  and  the  consequent  findings  of  Judge
    Battersby, I am satisfied that the 'identification  card'  in  question
    was the Appellant's military ID as  opposed  to  a  CSID  or  an  Iraqi
    National Identity card. I say so because these documents would, as  the
    Appellant indicates in his screening interview, tend to  be  issued  at
    birth or at least in childhood. The document being  examined  by  Judge
    Battersby was not issued until  2005  and  referred  to  an  'enrolment
    date': both of these are consistent with it being  document  issued  to
    the Appellant by the Iraqi national Army.

10. In the Appellant's more recent  foray  into  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    before Judge Pickup in May 2018, he was informed  that  the  Respondent
    had obtained for him from the Iraqi Embassy in London a  Laissez-passer
    issued in his name.  The Appellant for his part avers that he has  made
    "a couple" of attempts to obtain other documents from the consulate  in
    Manchester. He requested an Iraqi passport or "any sort of ID document"
    because he needed the same in order to register  his  marriage  in  the
    United Kingdom. Consulate staff advised that they were unable  to  help
    him.  Further enquiries were made by  the  Appellant's  solicitors  who
    were advised, in a letter dated the 30th April 2018, that the Consulate
    were at the time unable to issue passports, and that  in  order  to  be
    issued with one the Appellant would in any event need  to  present  his
    "National ID and Nationality Certificate" - I take the latter to  be  a
    reference to a CSID.

11. In assessing all of this  evidence  I  have  borne  in  mind  that  the
    Appellant has been convicted of a dishonesty  offence,  and  that  both
    Judge Battersby and Judge Pickup found reason to doubt elements of  his
    evidence. Applying the lower standard of proof, and having  had  regard
    to all material evidence, I am satisfied of the following:

      i) The Appellant is from Kirkuk;

     ii) The Appellant must, at one time, have had both CSID  and  INC:  see
         sections 5.4  and  5.6  of  the  Respondent's  Country  Policy  and
         Information Note Iraq: Internal relocation, civil documentation and
         returns (Version 9.0 February 2019);

    iii) He had neither of these documents on arrival;

     iv) It is reasonably likely that the Appellant was  telling  the  truth
         when he says that he left these documents at home;

      v) The 'ID' he presented at his interview and original  asylum  appeal
         was his military ID.

12. Having made these findings I now proceed to consider the effect of  the
    guidance in SMO (Iraq) on the Appellant's case.

13. The Appellant is from Kirkuk. Although Kirkuk was previously considered
    to be a 'contested area' such that Article 15(c)  of  the  QD  applied,
    that is no longer the case.  The Tribunal in SMO set out  a  number  of
    factors that might enhance the risk to an individual per  the  Elgafaji
    'sliding scale'. It has not been contended  that  any  of  those  apply
    here.  Accordingly I find that there is no risk of indiscriminate  harm
    to the Appellant arising from an internal armed conflict in Iraq.

14. The next focus  of  my  enquiry  is  whether  the  Appellant  would  be
    reasonably likely to find  himself  in  circumstances  of  such  socio-
    economic deprivation so as to engage the United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under Article 3 ECHR/ Article 15(b) of the QD.    In  that  regard  the
    concession made by the  Secretary  of  State  in  AAH  (Iraqi  Kurds  -
    internal relocation) CG [2018] UKUT 212 and  repeated  in  SMO  remains
    Home Office policy:

         "it remains the position that a person returning  to  Iraq  without
         either family connections able to  assist  him,  or  the  means  to
         obtain a CSID, may be at risk of enduring  conditions  contrary  to
         Article 3 ECHR".

15. The Appellant does not have a CSID. I  am  not  satisfied  that  it  is
    reasonably likely that he will  manage  to  obtain  one  prior  to  his
    departure from the United Kingdom. I so find  for  two  reasons.  First
    because it seems likely that had the Iraqi  authorities  felt  able  to
    issue him with a CSID in the United Kingdom, this fact would have  been
    mentioned in their  letter  to  the  Appellant's  solicitors.   Second,
    because successive country guidance  cases  have  made  it  clear  that
    redocumentation from within the United Kingdom is not a straightforward
    process. In SMO [at �383] the Tribunal refers back to the  findings  in
    earlier appeals:

         "We have not been asked to revisit the extant country  guidance  on
         the way in which an individual might obtain a replacement CSID from
         within the UK, for which see [173]-[177] of AA (Iraq) and  [26]  of
         AAH (Iraq).  We add only this: whilst the INID is clearly replacing
         the CSID in Iraq, consulates do not have the  electronic  terminals
         necessary to issue the INID and continue to issue the CSID instead,
         as confirmed in a Canadian Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  report
         which is quoted at 5.6.9 of the respondent's CPIN entitled Internal
         Relocation, civil documentation and returns, dated  February  2019.
         An Iraqi national in the UK would be able to apply for  a  CSID  in
         the way explained  in  AA  (Iraq)  and,  if  one  was  successfully
         obtained, we find that it  would  be  acceptable  evidence  of  the
         individual's identity throughout Iraq.  Notwithstanding the plan to
         replace the old CSID system with the INID by the end  of  2019,  we
         accept what was said by EASO (in  February  2019)  and  the  Danish
         Immigration  Service  and  Landinfo  (in   November   2018),   that
         implementation was delayed and that the CSID was still  being  used
         in Iraq, and that it continues to be issued in those parts  of  the
         country in which the INID  terminals  have  not  been  rolled  out.
         Given this evidence, and the fact that the CSID has been a  feature
         of Iraqi society for so long, we do not accept that there will come
         a time at the end of this year when the CSID suddenly ceases to  be
         acceptable as proof of identity."

16. Whilst the Tribunal in this passage clearly envisage  that  it  remains
    possible to  obtain  a  new  CSID  in  London,  the  likelihood  of  an
    individual successfully doing so must be read in light  of  Dr  Fatah's
    earlier evidence on the point. The passages in AA to which the Tribunal
    refer are these:

         "173.    As regards those who have  an  expired  or  current  Iraqi
         passport but no CSID - Dr Fatah identifies in his first report that
         a CSID may be obtained through the "Consular section of  the  Iraqi
         Embassy in London", which will send a request for a replacement  or
         renewed CSID to the General Directorate for Travel and  Nationality
         - Directorate of Civil Status. A request  for  a  replacement  CSID
         must be accompanied, inter alia, by "any form of official  document
         in support of the applicant's identity" and  the  application  form
         must be signed by "the head of the family, or the legal guardian or
         representative to verify the truth of its contents." He also  added
         that an applicant must also authorise a person in Iraq  to  act  as
         his representative in order for that person to "follow  up  on  the
         progress of the application".

         174.  However,  Dr  Fatah  continued  by  explaining  that  if   an
         individual has lost his CSID and does not know  the  relevant  page
         and book number for it, then the Iraq Embassy in London will not be
         able to obtain one on his behalf. Instead, he or she will  have  to
         attend the appropriate local office of family registration in  Iraq
         or give a relative, friend or lawyer power of  attorney  to  obtain
         his or her CSID. The process of a giving power  of  attorney  to  a
         lawyer in Iraq to act "as a proxy" is commonplace and Dr Fatah  had
         done this himself. He also explained that  the  power  of  attorney
         could be obtained through the Iraq Embassy.

         175. Dr Fatah gave further evidence to the  effect  that  having  a
         marriage certificate may be useful as it would contain  data  found
         in the family records. It  is,  however,  not  possible  to  use  a
         "health card" in order to obtain a CSID because there is no primary
         health care or GP system in Iraq,  but  instead  patients  attended
         hospital when they needed to do so and no central records are held.



         176. There is a consensus  between  Dr  Fatah's  evidence  and  the
         following more general evidence provided  by  UNHCR-Iraq  in  April
         2015 on the issue of obtaining CSID's from abroad. "In principle, a
         failed asylum seeker, or  indeed  any  Iraqi  citizen  abroad,  can
         acquire Iraqi documents through  Iraqi  embassies  and  consulates.
         There is a special authorization granted to these bodies to provide
         documents for Iraqi abroad on the condition that the  beneficiaries
         should have  any  available  documents  in  order  to  prove  their
         nationality."

         177. In summary, we conclude that  it  is  possible  for  an  Iraqi
         national living in the UK to obtain a  CSID  through  the  consular
         section of the Iraqi Embassy in London, if such a person is able to
         produce a current or expired passport  and/or  the  book  and  page
         number for their family registration details. For  persons  without
         such a passport, or who are unable to produce the  relevant  family
         registration details, a  power  of  attorney  can  be  provided  to
         someone in  Iraq  who  can  thereafter  undertake  the  process  of
         obtaining the CSID for such person from the  Civil  Status  Affairs
         Office in their home governorate. For  reasons  identified  in  the
         section that follows below, at the  present  time  the  process  of
         obtaining a CSID from Iraq is likely to be severely hampered if the
         person wishing to obtain the CSID is from  an  area  where  Article
         15(c) serious harm is occurring".

17. And the supplementary evidence given by Dr Fatah in AAH was as follows:

         "26. If applying through a consulate abroad  the  requirements  are
         different. Having contacted the consulate in London, and checked on
         the website of the Iraqi embassy in Sweden, Dr  Fatah  states  that
         the  authorities  will  require  the  applicant  to  first  make  a
         statement explaining why he needs a CSID and  attach  this  to  his
         application form, which must  countersigned  by  the  head  of  the
         applicant's family and stamped by the consulate or embassy; he must
         then produce his Iraqi passport and proof of status in the  country
         where he is applying, the name of a representative (proxy) in Iraq,
         an additional form completed by the head of the applicant's  family
         verifying that the contents of his application form were true, four
         colour copies of his INC, and 10 colour photographs. Crucially  the
         applicant must be able to produce something which can establish the
         location of his family's details in the civil register. This should
         be a CSID, an INC or  birth  certificate.  If  none  of  these  are
         available to the applicant he must supply the identity documents of
         his parents. This evidence again  accords  with  that  of  Landinfo
         (December 2017) who conclude that it can  be  difficult  to  obtain
         replacement ID documents from an embassy abroad for the  individual
         who is unable to verify his or her identity.

         27.  If you are in Iraq, and have all of the required documents, in
         normal circumstances the process is straightforward and  quick  and
         should take no more than three days. Dr Fatah's  own  daughter  was
         born in the United Kingdom and he managed to obtain her a  CSID  in
         one day from the office in Sulaymaniyah, upon payment  of  a  small
         fee. Dr Fatah was less  optimistic  about  the  efficiency  of  the
         process if in the United Kingdom. He has regular dealings with  the
         consulate in London and he is not impressed.  He  said  that  staff
         there are generally very unhelpful.

         ..."

18. Applying that guidance, and in particular the evidence of Dr  Fatah,  I
    conclude as follows.   There is no obstacle to the Appellant signing  a
    statement explaining why he does not currently have a CSID. Whether  he
    could get  that  countersigned  by  the  head  of  his  family  remains
    debatable. The First-tier Tribunal found that he will still  have  some
    contact with his family in Kirkuk but it is far from  clear  that  this
    includes his father.  The Appellant's father  was  certainly  alive  in
    2007 when he assisted the Appellant in leaving  Iraq,  but  I  have  no
    reliable information about what might have happened to him  in  the  13
    intervening years of civil war  and  massive  population  displacement.
    Even assuming that the Appellant's father is alive and well and  living
    in Kirkuk, and that there is no reason why he could not countersign the
    application form, there remains the matter of the colour  photocopy  of
    the INC.   This the Appellant does not have.  Add to  this  Dr  Fatah's
    overall conclusion that embassy staff in  London  are  "generally  very
    unhelpful", and I am left to conclude that it is  at  least  reasonably
    likely that the Appellant will not be able to acquire  a  new  CSID  in
    London. The strict evidential requirements for the application must  be
    viewed in the context of the very great number of Iraqi  nationals  who
    are undocumented, and Dr Fatah's  evidence  that  the  problems  of  an
    individual returnee are regarded as "trivial".

19. This means that there is a reasonable  likelihood  that  the  Appellant
    will find himself at Baghdad airport with no means of onward travel. He
    cannot board a domestic flight to Kirkuk, and cannot pass  through  the
    many checkpoints on the road north.  In order to do so he would need  a
    CSID, or one of the new generation of identity cards - the INID - being
    progressively rolled out across the country.  Mr McVeety  accepted,  in
    light of the findings of the Tribunal in SMO, that he would not be able
    to use his Laissez-passer for this purpose.

20. The next question is whether the Appellant would be able to secure such
    identity documents within a reasonable time frame.  Assuming  that  his
    family in Kirkuk would be able to assist him by approaching  the  civil
    status office in that city on his behalf,  and  that  one  male  family
    member would be able and willing to make the journey to Baghdad airport
    to greet the Appellant and bring to him  a  replacement  card,  I  must
    nevertheless consider the likelihood of such a card being issued  to  a
    proxy. It was the clear evidence of Dr Fatah that the new generation of
    cards are not being  issued  to  proxies.  At  its  paragraph  431  the
    Tribunal in SMO concluded that the Kirkuk civil status  office  is  now
    issuing INIDs. That being so it does not appear to be feasible that the
    Appellant will be able to obtain a INID  from  his  home  city  Kirkuk,
    given that he cannot get there and  any  family  member  who  might  be
    willing to help will not be assisted by the authorities.  Applying  the
    guidance in AAH and  SMO  it  follows  that  the  Appellant  would,  on
    arrival, be exposed to conditions amounting to a violation  of  Article
    15(b) and his appeal must be allowed on that basis.

    Human Rights: Article 8 ECHR

21. It is not in issue that the Appellant is in a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his partner CN, and that  they  have  three  children
    together. All three children  are  British  and  the  Appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with each of them.   I  am
    accordingly satisfied that the Appellant has an Article 8 'family life'
    in the United Kingdom.

22. The Respondent accepts that it would be unduly harsh to expect  CN  and
    the children to relocate to Iraq should the Appellant be deported.  The
    only matter in issue is whether it would be "unduly  harsh"  to  expect
    these other family members to remain in the United Kingdom without  the
    Appellant.

23. The higher courts have repeatedly emphasised that although  the  'undue
    harshness' test falls somewhere in the middle of the statutory spectrum
    - framed on one side by 'reasonableness' and on  the  other  by   'very
    compelling circumstances' - this should not obscure the fact  that  the
    test sets a high threshold.  The 'commonplace' distress  that  will  be
    caused to children if a parent is removed is not sufficient:  otherwise
    any parent facing deportation would be able to succeed.  Dicta to  this
    effect can be found in Secretary of State for the Home Department v  PG
    (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213, BL (Jamaica) v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 357, Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department v AJ (Zimbabwe) and VH (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ  1012
    and NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department [2016]
    EWCA Civ 662.  It was further underlined in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53 where [at �27] the Supreme
    Court endorsed the dicta of the Upper Tribunal in MK (Sierra  Leone)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as  to
    what kind of suffering the statute is here concerned with:

         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold.
         'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It  is
         the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.  Furthermore,   the
         addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard
         still higher."

24. At the hearing in July I heard oral evidence from CN and I found her to
    be a pleasant young woman and a wholly credible witness.  I noted  that
    CN became quite distressed during her evidence, particularly where  she
    was asked to contemplate what will happen to her and  the  children  if
    the Appellant is deported.  I have no hesitation in  finding  that  she
    loves the Appellant a  lot,  and  that  she  regards  him  as  being  a
    "brilliant dad". They have lived together since 2012 (apart from the  7
    months that he  was  in  prison  and  the  2  months  he  spent  in  an
    immigration detention facility).     I fully accept that she finds  the
    prospect of life without him upsetting and stressful.  CN has  run  her
    own beauty salon for two years. She has two employees and  she  herself
    worked there full time before she became pregnant again.  When  she  is
    working it is the Appellant who looks after the  children  -  he  drops
    them to and from nursery, and brings them home at the end of  the  day.
    She corroborated the evidence given by  the  Appellant  that  he  is  a
    "hands on Dad". He takes his son to boxing and plays "horse" with their
    daughter.   CN could not conceive of how she would  manage  should  the
    Appellant be deported. She has no  close  family  living  nearby.   The
    nearest are her mother and sister who live in Wigan.  CN told  me  that
    she and her mother are not particularly close  -  they  only  see  each
    other at Christmas and during the Easter holidays. She has a stepfather
    in Newcastle but she would not look to him for help.   CN  expressed  a
    fear that if she was a single mum she would have no option but to  sell
    her business because she does not see how she would be able to continue
    to work.

25. I accept that it would be in the best interests of these three  British
    children if they could remain living in their family home with both  of
    their parents. I  need  not  elaborate  on  that  finding  because  the
    Respondent also accepts that to be so.

26. I accept that the impact upon CN and the children if the Appellant were
    to  be  deported  will  be  harsh.  Again,  this  is  accepted  by  the
    Respondent.  They have not committed any crime and yet it is  they  who
    are asked to pay the price for  the  Appellant's  criminality.    I  am
    however unable to find  that  the  consequences  would  be  "bleak"  or
    "severe". CN has shown herself to be a capable  mother,  and  as  Judge
    Pickup observed, there is no real merit  in  the  submission  that  she
    would have to give up work if her husband left the country  -  that  is
    the normal consequence of family break up and it is one that parliament
    no doubt contemplated when it approved s117C of the Act. CN  would,  if
    necessary, be able to turn to the  state  for  support.    It  will  be
    enormously upsetting to all of the Appellant's family members,  but  it
    will not be unduly harsh.  I  am  unable  to  identify  any  particular
    features of the evidence which would elevate the circumstances of  this
    family above the 'commonplace' distress that the Court of  Appeal  have
    ruled is an acceptable consequence of deportation.

27. Accordingly I am not satisfied that the  'exception'  at  s33(2)(a)  is
    made out.

28. Finally, I consider whether, in all of the circumstances of  the  case,
    there are "very compelling circumstances over and  above"  the  matters
    set out in the exceptions. As the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) made
    clear, this most  demanding  of  tests  is  as  available  to  'medium'
    offenders such as the Appellant  as  it  is  to  the  most  serious  of
    offenders under s117C(6).

29. Mr Jafferji referred me to Judge Pickup's Hesham Ali evaluation, at his
    paragraphs 87-88, of all of the relevant factors in play when  applying
    this test.  Paragraph 87 contains a balanced and fair evaluation of all
    of the possible factors militating in the Appellant's favour. To  these
    I need only add that since that decision, the Appellant and CN have had
    a third child.  Judge  Pickup's  paragraph  88  sets  out  the  factors
    weighing against the Appellant. Prominent among these is Judge Pickup's
    pre-SMO conclusion  that  the  Appellant  would  have  no  problems  in
    returning to Iraq. Insofar as I have found that he would today  face  a
    reasonable likelihood of enduring conditions in  breach  of  Article  3
    ECHR/Article 15(b), then the test of "very compelling circumstances" is
    obviously met, and the appeal is  therefore  allowed  on  human  rights
    grounds. For the sake of clarity I record that if I am wrong about that
    matter, then I would adopt and endorse the findings so  carefully  made
    by Judge Pickup and the result  would  be  that  the  appeal  would  be
    dismissed on human rights grounds.

    Anonymity Order

30. This appeal concerns a claim for protection, and a  number  of  British
    minors.  Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of  2013:
    Anonymity Orders I therefore consider it appropriate to make  an  order
    in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.

32. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:

         "The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.

         The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds".

33. There is an order for anonymity.
