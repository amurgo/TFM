                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellants  with regard to a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Jerromes) promulgated on 21st January  2015 by which it  dismissed  the
    Appellants' appeals against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse
    them leave to remain, taken on 7th August 2014.

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife and their 8 year-old son.  All  are
    Ghanaian nationals. The first Appellant first entered the  UK  in  2001
    with entry clearance for six months as a visitor. She again entered  as
    a visitor in October 2003 and again in September 2004.  She  overstayed
    on the last occasion, she says, because she wanted to go to  school  in
    the UK.

 3. The second Appellant entered the UK on a date which is unknown; he says
    in May 2001, although his wife suggested it was in 2003.  They  met  in
    either 2003 or  2005  (the  evidence  differed)  and  started  to  live
    together. The 3rd Appellant was born in the UK on 4th January 2007  and
    is now eight years of age. The family live together in High Wycombe  in
    a flat for which they pay ï¿½200 per month rent.

 4. The 1st and 2nd Appellants struggle to maintain themselves  financially
    and have relied on financial support from friends and have not resorted
    to public funds. The 1st Appellant is trained as a carer  but  has  not
    been able to  work  as  such  due  to  her  lack  of  status.  The  2nd
    Appellant is a car valeter.

 5. The 3rd Appellant initially attended nursery and now primary school  in
    the UK. He is a member of a local football club and  also  a  committed
    member of the church. He has never been outside the UK.

 6. The 1st Appellant's mother was in Ghana but has died since  the  First-
    tier Tribunal decided the case. She has an elderly uncle and  a  cousin
    in the UK. The 2nd Appellant has a sibling and cousins in the  UK.  His
    parents are deceased.

 7. The Appellants first  made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain  in
    February 2012. However, that was refused without a right of appeal  and
    following judicial review proceedings the Secretary of State agreed  to
    make another decision which did carry a right of appeal  and  that  was
    the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal at page 4 of its decision set out  the  grounds
    of appeal which included that the Secretary of State had failed to take
    into account the fact that the 3rd Appellant is over the age  of  seven
    and was born and raised in the UK and has no connections with Ghana.

 9. In its decision the First-tier Tribunal considered the situation of the
    3rd Appellant but noted that at the date of the application as  he  was
    under the age of seven, he had not then been in the UK for 7 years  and
    was not satisfied that he could meet the requirements of 276ADE.

10. Before me it was conceded by Mr Tarlow that that was wrong. At the date
    of hearing, the relevant date for  the  purposes  of  consideration  of
    Article 8 and the Rules, the child had been in the  UK  for  more  than
    seven years.

11. On that basis it was accepted that the decision should be set aside and
    redecided on the basis that consideration should be given to the appeal
    taking into  account  the  fact  that  Kelvin  may  be  entitled  under
    paragraph 276ADE.

12. With regard to the first two Appellants, there is no error  of  law  in
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision. They are of  Ghanaian  nationality,
    lived there for the majority of their lives and  there  is  nothing  to
    prevent their returning there. They do not  meet  the  requirements  of
    appendix FM nor any  of  the  exceptions.  Neither  is  there  anything
    unusual  or  compelling  about  their  circumstances   to   render   it
    disproportionate to remove them.

13. That decision will only be upset if the situation in  relation  to  the
    child alters things. Mr Tarlow relied on the case of  Azimi-Moayed  and
    others (decisions  affecting  children;  onward  appeals)  [2013]  UKUT
    00197(IAC) which indicated that while seven years has for a significant
    period of time been taken as a threshold after which a child may not be
    able to be returned to their home  country,  it  is  the  time  in  the
    child's life that the seven years have occurred that is significant.  A
    child who is aged seven will be less affected than a child who is  say,
    aged 14. That is because during the early years of life the child  will
    be unaware of its surrounding save for his immediate family. Mr  Tarlow
    pointed out that paragraph 276 ADE of the Immigration Rules,  which  is
    the route by which a person can be permitted to remain on private  life
    grounds, requires not only that the child should have been  in  the  UK
    for a period of seven years but it also must be unreasonable to  expect
    the child to leave the UK. What is required therefore is an  assessment
    of whether it is reasonable to expect the 3rd Appellant  to  leave  the
    UK.

14. In any case involving children we are required  to  consider  the  best
    interests of the child as a primary consideration. Those best interests
    however,  particularly  when  the  child  is  not  British,   are   not
    determinative and can be outweighed by other factors.

15. The best interests of the child in this case are no doubt to live  with
    his parents; to live in a safe  and  secure  environment  and  to  have
    access to education and health care.

16. Absent other factors, it  will  be  in  a  child's  best  interests  to
    maintain the status quo.  That is not to say that he would suffer  harm
    if the geography changed provided he continued to be with  his  family.
    It is the case that every year many thousands of children are  uprooted
    by their families and moved either to the opposite end of  the  country
    or to foreign countries because that is part  of  general  family  life
    when parent's circumstances change and they decide to relocate.  It  is
    never suggested, absent serious health problems that that is contra  to
    the children's best interests. It is generally assumed by all  that  it
    is in the best interests of the child to be wherever his parents are.

17. In this case the child's parents are Ghanaian, as is he. Both lived  in
    Ghana for most of their lives, his mother until  she  was  36  and  his
    father until he was approximately 35. Given their links to that country
    and the skills that they have acquired  while  in  the  UK  they  would
    easily able to re-establish themselves there.

18. Additionally, in the same way that it is a  British  child's  right  to
    grow up in the UK and enjoy the benefits of British citizenship, it  is
    a Ghanaian child's right to  be  brought  up  in  the  country  of  his
    nationality, culture and heritage.

19. The family have been in the UK without leave for  a  very  considerable
    length of time enjoying the benefits living in the UK brings, including
    the education of the child, none of which they were entitled to.

20. Taking all matters into consideration it is quite  clear  even  if  the
    child's best interests in this case were to remain in the UK  and  that
    is a  finely  balanced  point  in  itself,  those  best  interests  are
    outweighed by the other factors, one of the most significant being  the
    maintenance of immigration control but also the economic  interests  of
    the UK. I therefore conclude that it would not be unreasonable in  this
    case for the 3rd Appellant to leave the United Kingdom.

21. Having set aside the First-tier  Tribunal's  Decision  and  Reasons  in
    relation to the question of the 3rd Appellant in redeciding it  I  find
    that the 3rd Appellant does not succeed under paragraph 276ADE and  the
    appeals of all three Appellants are dismissed.
