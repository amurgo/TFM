Representation

For the Appellant:     Ms P Heidar, AA Immigration Lawyers
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan born on  3  July  1976.  He
      applied for a residence card as confirmation of his right to reside in
      the UK. His application dated 26 November  2014  was  refused  by  the
      respondent on 14 March 2015 as he had  not  met  the  requirements  of
      Regulation 10(5) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the  2006
      Regulations").


   2. He appeals with permission granted on 16 October  2015  by  First-tier
      Tribunal  Judge  Martins,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge dismissing his appeal on 9 July 2015.  His  appeal  was
      determined on the papers.


   3. It was common ground that the appellant entered the  UK  on  16  March
      2003. His claim for asylum was refused on 28 April 2003.


   4. On 22 July 2008 he married a Polish  national,  Ms.  Tatarzyna  Doeota
      Gawlik, who at the time was exercising Treaty rights in the UK.


   5. On 18 July 2014, the appellant divorced his wife.


   6. The First-tier Judge stated that the issue as set out in  the  refusal
      letter was whether the appellant had established that his ex-wife  was
      exercising Treaty rights on 18 July 2014 - the date  of  the  divorce.
      The respondent had also contended that the bank statements provided by
      his spouse did not establish that she was working during 2009-12.


   7. The Judge found that the appellant had not established  that  the  EEA
      national was exercising her Treaty rights at the date of  the  divorce
      [26]. Her July 2014 wage slip stood in isolation in establishing  that
      she was working at the time of the divorce.


   8. Ms Heidar relied on the grounds seeking permission. She submitted that
      although there was a 603 page bundle before the  First-tier  Tribunal,
      there was also a skeleton argument which had been submitted  detailing
      the basis of the claim  as  well  as  the  relevant  authorities.  The
      skeleton unfortunately not been placed  before  the  Judge.  This  had
      however been sent and received by the Tribunal. She has  produced  the
      skeleton argument sent to the Tribunal.  It was confirmed by the First-
      tier Tribunal that it had been received.


   9. She submitted that  the  Judge  erred  in  finding  that  insufficient
      evidence had been produced in order to demonstrate the retained  right
      of residence. Furthermore, it was evident in the bundles  produced  to
      the First-tier Tribunal there had been more than one payslip  produced
      to confirm that his ex-wife had been exercising Treaty rights  at  the
      time of divorce.


  10. In that respect, Ms Heidar referred to a  sequence  of  such  payslips
      produced at pages 14-21 of  the  appellant's  bundle.  Some  of  these
      payslips had also been disclosed in the respondent's bundle  at  F1-6.
      There were thus  payslips  disclosed  for  each  of  the  months  from
      December 2013 up to and including July 2014.


  11. At the adjourned hearing before Upper Tribunal on 16  March  2016  the
      originals of these payslips  were  handed  to  the  Senior  Presenting
      Officer, Mr Duffy, who represented the respondent.  On  that  occasion
      the  respondent  was  requested  by  the  Tribunal  to  use  her  best
      endeavours to procure from HMRC the sponsor's tax records and details.




  12. Mr  Duffy  subsequently  sent  several  emails  confirming  that  such
      requests had been made and had sent 'chasing' emails inquiring whether
      there had been any outcome to the HMRC  checks  in  this  case.  Those
      emails are contained in the Tribunal's file.


  13. Ms Heidar accordingly submitted that there had been more than one wage
      slip before the First-tier Tribunal Judge which demonstrated that  the
      ex-wife had been working for at least eight months prior to  the  date
      of their divorce.


  14. Ms Heidar referred to the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Samsam
      (EEA: Revocation and Retained Rights) Syria [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC) at
      [44]. The Tribunal concluded that their analysis of  Regulation  10(5)
      indicates that the focus is whether the wife retained  the  status  of
      worker at the time of the divorce and not whether she had that  status
      throughout the three years preceding the divorce.  There  is  no  such
      requirement in  Regulation  10(5).  Where  the  regulations  impose  a
      requirement of qualification throughout a relevant period they say  so
      (contrast Regulation 15(1)(a)).


  15. In Samsam, the Tribunal  noted  that  the  wife  was  a  worker  under
      Community law  at  the  time  of  divorce.  She  had  worked  for  the
      appellant's business during her marriage.  This  was  demonstrated  by
      isolated wage slips (as referred to at [57a]).


  16. Ms Heidar also referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  NA
      (Pakistan) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 995. In that case the  issue  to  be
      decided was whether a third country national  ex-spouse  of  an  Union
      citizen must be able to show that their former spouse  was  exercising
      Treaty rights in the host Member State at the time of their divorce in
      order to retain a right  of  residence  under  Article  13(2)  of  the
      Directive 2004/38/EC.


  17. The Court of Appeal noted that the Upper Tribunal  concluded  that  it
      was bound by the decision of Amos v SSHD [2011] EWCA  CIV  552.  There
      the Court of Appeal stated that Regulation 10(5) required the divorced
      third country national to satisfy the condition that their former  EEA
      national spouse  was  residing  in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the
      Regulations at the date of the divorce [30].


  18. The Court of Appeal in NA made a reference to the Court of Justice  of
      the European Union by requesting a preliminary ruling from that  Court
      on the proper interpretation of Article 13(2). One of the reasons  was
      that there was no express requirement in Article 13(2) that  in  order
      to retain a right of residence a third country national ex-spouse of a
      Union citizen must be able  to  show  that  their  former  spouse  was
      exercising Treaty rights in the host member state at the time of their
      divorce.


  19. Neither party in NA contended that the issue raised in the appeal  was
      "acte clair". Accordingly, the Court of  Appeal  posed  the  following
      question for the Court:


"Must a third country national spouse of a Union citizen  must  be  able  to
show that their former spouse was exercising Treaty rights in a host  member
state at the time of their divorce in order to retain a right  of  residence
under Article 13(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC?"


  20. Ms Heidar further submitted that in the respondent's  own  application
      form,  which  was  completed  by  the  appellant,  there  was  a  list
      confirming that the appellant could provide wage slips. Moreover,  the
      respondent's IDIs did not specify the documents.


  21. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Whitwell submitted that  the  payslips
      submitted  by  the  employer  to  Ms  Gawlik   were   cash   payments.
      Accordingly, these should be treated with "scepticism".  There  is  no
      witness statement from the appellant's ex-wife, albeit that there  had
      been oral evidence from the appellant.


  22. He submitted that such earnings could be verified  by  HMRC  which  he
      acknowledged was a 'double  edged'  submission.  He  referred  to  the
      attempts made  by  the  senior  presenting  officers  in  the  appeal,
      including himself, to obtain a response from HMRC to requests for such
      information. Attempts  had  been  made  in  this  respect  on  several
      occasions since January 2016 up to and including 17 May 2016, the  day
      before the hearing.


  23. I reserved my decision in this appeal.


  24. Mr Whitwell informed me shortly thereafter that he had  just  received
      an email from the senior case worker, European  Case  Work,  in  which
      information regarding Tatarzyna Doeota  Gawlik,  the  appellant's  ex-
      wife, was attached.  Ms  Heidar  had  by  then  already  departed  the
      building.


  25. I requested that Ms Heidar be contacted to ascertain whether she would
      wish to have the opportunity of making further submissions later  that
      day. She stated when contacted that this would not be possible. I  did
      not consider it to be necessary to postpone the hearing in  the  light
      of the contents of the HMRC report to which I refer below.


  26. It was noted in the written response to Mr  Whitwell  that  there  had
      been a request for HMRC information under s.40 of the UK  Borders  Act
      2007.


  27. The documents produced stated that the subject of the inquiry  is  the
      appellant's  ex-wife.  There  are  various  personal   details   given
      including her address. The address in HMRC  records  corresponds  with
      her address set out on the payslips to  which  I  have  referred.  Her
      national insurance number with HMRC also corresponds with the national
      insurance number identified and set out in her payslips.


  28. The information requested related to the tax years commencing in  2008
      until 2015. The income details are set out in  respect  of  those  tax
      years. Her employer for the 2014/15 tax year, with the start date on 8
      December 2013, was stated to  be  Hounslow  Quality  Fish  Ltd,  which
      corresponded to the name of the  employer  on  each  of  her  payslips
      submitted. For the tax year 2014/15 her  "pay"  was  �11,662.98,  from
      which �330.60 tax was deducted. Further, she was employed by the  same
      employer during the tax year 2015-16.


     Assessment


  29. I am grateful for the efforts made by both Mr. Duffy and Mr.  Whitwell
      to obtain information held on record relating to the  appellant's  ex-
      wife's employment history. That evidence had not been available to the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge.


  30. It is unfortunate that the Judge did  not  have  the  benefit  of  the
      skeleton argument which directed the Tribunal to the relevant pages in
      a bundle over 600 pages long.  The Judge at [24] stated that the  July
      2014 wage slip stood in isolation in establishing that the spouse  was
      working at the time of the divorce.  That  however  was  incorrect  as
      there were payslips produced in the bundle  for  the  period  December
      2013 until July 2014; there were also several  such  payslips  in  the
      respondent's bundle.


  31. Mr Whitwell's submission that they should be treated "with scepticism"
      as she was paid  in  cash,  was  made  shortly  before  HRMC  provided
      evidence confirming the appellant's ex-wife's earnings and tax paid at
      the date of divorce. It turns out that she had  been  working  at  the
      relevant time. There was thus nothing to suggest that the  wage  slips
      were in any way suspicious.


  32. I accordingly find that the Judge materially erred in concluding  that
      the appellant's appeal could not succeed on the basis that it had  not
      been established that the EEA national was exercising Treaty rights at
      the time of the divorce [26].


  33. I accordingly set aside the decision and re-make it.


  34. Having regard to the production of the HMRC printout  and  authorities
      to which I have been referred, I am satisfied that the  appellant  has
      produced  satisfactory  evidence  demonstrating   that   his   ex-wife
      exercised Treaty rights at the date of the divorce. 0


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law and is set aside.


      I re-make the decision by substituting for it a decision allowing  the
      appellant's appeal.


      No anonymity direction is made.
