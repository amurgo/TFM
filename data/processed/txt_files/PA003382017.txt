Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a
Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings or any form of

This direction applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any failure to
comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of court
proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on [ ] 1990 who applied for
   asylum in July 2016. His application was refused by the respondent on 3
   January 2017. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where his
   appeal was heard by Judge Moore. In a decision promulgated on 27 February
   2017 Judge More dismissed the appeal. The appellant is now appealing
   against that decision.

The Appellant's Claim


2. The appellant claims to be a politically active Kurd who has been
   persecuted, and would be at risk of persecution on return to Turkey,
   because of his involvement with the People's Democratic Party (HDP) and
   the Turkish authority's belief that he is a supporter of the PKK. He
   claims to have been detained and subjected to torture on three occasions
   - in 2010 following a protest and hunger strike; in 2012 following a raid
   on his family's home; and in 2016 following a further raid on his home.
   He claims that on the first occasion he was released unconditionally
   after two days and on the second he was released after 2 or 3 days but
   required to report monthly to a security station.


3. He claims that during his detention in 2016 the authorities focused
   their questioning on his alleged involvement with a PKK supporting
   Kurdish television channel ROJ TV, which they mistakenly believed was
   connected to a newspaper published by his cousin that he had distributed
   whilst at university. He claims that he was forced to sign a document
   confessing to being a supporter of the PKK and to agree to obtain
   information on two branches of the PKK. He claims to have reported on one
   occasion and then gone into hiding before fleeing Turkey with the
   assistance of an agent.


4. In support of his case, the appellant submitted, inter alia, a witness
   statement from a cousin who was granted refugee status in the UK in
   January 2017. His cousin claimed to have taken part in political
   activities for the HDP with the appellant. He also claimed that he
   published, and the appellant distributed, a Kurdish newspaper at their
   university that was thought to support the PKK. He claims that he was
   detained and tortured with others involved in the newspaper but that the
   appellant was not detained at that time. He became aware that the
   appellant was detained in 2016 through family.


5. The appellant also submitted in support of his claim a medical report
   from Dr J Hajioff, a consultant psychiatrist and medical practitioner
   qualified in medicine and surgery. Dr Hajioff analysed the appellant's
   scarring and, applying the Istanbul Protocol, concluded that they were
   "consistent with" the appellant's account. He also concluded that the
   appellant suffers from chronic PTSD and has some symptoms of depression.


Decision of the First-tier Tribunal


6. Judge Moore did not find the appellant credible.


7. The judge, inter alia, drew adverse inferences from the following:


     a) In his screening interview the appellant was asked if he had ever
        been detained and replied that he had not. The judge did not accept
        as plausible the appellant's explanation for this, which was that
        he did say he was detained but the interpreter told him to include
        this in his witness statement.


     b) In the screening interview the appellant claimed to be a member of
        a political party who had to give up his membership due to threats
        but later claimed to have only been a supporter.


     c) The appellant claimed to have gone into hiding for 1 ï¿½ months with
        his father's friend but this was inconsistent with his witness
        statement which indicated he was in hiding for three months.


     d) The judge also stated that he did not find it credible that the
        appellant would have remained in Turkey for three months if he was
        really of such interest to the authorities and was required to be
        an informer.


     e) The appellant had said that after his third detention, when he
        reported to the police and told them he had not managed to obtain
        any information, he was told that was fine for now but he would
        need to bring information next time. The judge described this
        alleged response from the police as "timid and pathetic" and
        therefore lacking in credibility.


8. In respect of the evidence of the appellant's cousin, the judge at
   paragraph 28 accepted that the cousin was politically involved with the
   HDP and published a newspaper but not that the appellant was also
   politically active. He noted that the cousin came to the UK in July 2015
   and was therefore not in Turkey when the third detention was said to have
   taken place.


9. The judge considered the report of Dr Hajioff at paragraph 29 of the
   decision. The judge acknowledged that Dr Hajioff found the appellant's
   account of ill treatment to be consistent with his injuries but
   maintained his view that the appellant was not tortured because of his
   lack of credibility and reliability.


10. The judge considered the Country Guidance cases IA (Risk-Guidelines-
   Separatists) Turkey CG (2003) UKIAT 00034 and IK (Returnees-Records-IFA)
   Turkey CG (2004) UKIAT 00312 and concluded that they did not apply to the
   appellant given his credibility findings.


11. In the fourth paragraph of paragraph 31 the judge considered the
   appellant's sur place activity, finding that he is not a member of a
   political organisation in the UK and that his activities have not
   extended beyond attending talks.


12. In the same paragraph, the judge stated:


         "At its highest, and there is little reliable evidence of this, the
         appellant may have been a low level supporter of the HDP, and this
         in my view would not place the appellant at risk on return. There
         is no credible evidence demonstrating that this appellant was
         targeted personally due to his political opinion or indeed his
         ethnicity"


  13. The judge concluded that his:


         "negative credibility findings fundamentally undermine this
         appellant's claim".


Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

  14. Five grounds of appeal are pursued.


  15. The first ground states that the judge failed to adequately explain
      why the appellant's cousin's supportive evidence was not capable of
      corroborating the appellant's account. Ms Nnamani, in her submissions,
      argued that as the judge accepted the appellant's cousin as credible
      and accepted his evidence the judge needed to explain why he did not
      attach weight to the cousin's evidence about the appellant's political
      involvement and detention.


  16. The second ground of appeal maintains that the judge reached his
      conclusion about there being inconsistencies between the screening
      interview and the rest of the evidence without having regard to the
      appellant's explanation of this in his witness statement. The grounds
      also assert that the judge failed to have regard to the materiality of
      the alleged inconsistency.


  17. The third ground contends that the judge failed to explain why the
      appellant's evidence about the third detention was rejected. It is
      also argued that the judge misdirected himself by implying the
      authorities were "soft" on the appellant in respect of his reporting
      after the third detentions when the appellant was warned he was
      required to bring information on the next occasion. It is also argued
      that the judge erred by placing weight on the length of time the
      appellant remained in Turkey in hiding when this is immaterial.


  18. The fourth ground argues that the judge failed to properly consider Dr
      Hajioff's evidence. Relying on Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 367, Ms
      Nnamani argued that the judge erred by determining credibility first
      and not looking at the medical evidence holistically.


  19. The fifth ground argues that there was a failure to properly consider
      the background evidence and that the extant Country Guidance case IK
      (Returnees) was not properly applied. Ms Nnamani argued that if the
      judge found the appellant to be a low level supporter of HDP, as
      stated in paragraph 31 of the decision (see paragraph 11 above where
      the paragraph at issue is quoted), then the country guidance case law
      and country background information indicates the appellant would be at
      risk.


  20. Mr Singh argued that this was a sufficiently reasoned decision where
      the judge had properly concluded the appellant lacked credibility.
      Most fundamentally, there was a significant discrepancy between the
      appellant's screening interview and his other evidence and the judge
      was correct to take this into consideration in assessing credibility.

Consideration

  21. The central issue in this appeal is whether the judge, for the reasons
      he gave and based on the evidence that was before him, was entitled to
      conclude that the appellant lacked credibility. Reading the decision
      as a whole, I am satisfied that this conclusion was open to the judge
      for several reasons.


  22. Firstly, there is a substantial discrepancy in the appellant's
      evidence. The core of the appellant's claim is that he was detained
      and tortured by the Turkish authorities on three occasions. Yet in his
      screening interview no mention is made of this. At paragraph 5.4 of
      the screening interview it is recorded that the appellant said he had
      never been detained. At paragraph 4.1, in response to being asked the
      basis of his asylum claim, the appellant only stated that he was under
      surveillance and the Turkish government wants to get rid of him.
      Although recognition must be given to the strain the appellant may
      well have been under at the screening interview, the judge cannot be
      criticised for attaching weight to the appellant giving an entirely
      different account at the screening interview to that which he gave
      subsequently.


  23. Secondly, although the appellant submitted an expert report by Dr
      Hajioff to substantiate his claim to have been subjected to torture,
      the report did not provide strong support for this claim. The Istanbul
      Protocol lists five categories for describing a lesion, as follows:


         (a) Not consistent: the lesion could not have been caused by the
         trauma described;
         (b) Consistent with: the lesion could have been caused by the
         trauma described, but it is non-specific and there are many other
         possible causes;
         (c) Highly consistent: the lesion could have been caused by the
         trauma described, and there are few other possible causes;
         (d) Typical of: this is an appearance that is usually found with
         this type of trauma, but there are other possible causes;
         (e) Diagnostic of: this appearance could not have been caused in
         any way other than that described.


  24. Dr Hajioff was only able to conclude that the appellant's lesions were
      "consistent with" his account, which means there are "many other
      possible causes".


  25. Thirdly, the evidence of the appellant's cousin, which the appellant
      sought to rely on to substantiate his claim, does not touch on much of
      the appellant's account. In his statement dated 2 February 2017, the
      appellant's cousin makes no mention of the appellant being detained or
      tortured in 2010 or 2012. The only knowledge the cousin claims to have
      in respect of the 2016 detention is based on what he was told by
      family. The statement says that he and the appellant used to take part
      in activities for the HDP but there is no explanation of what these
      were and the only activity by the appellant described is that the
      appellant distributed the newspaper the appellant's cousin published.
      There is no inconsistency in accepting, as the judge did, that the
      appellant's cousin was politically involved with the HDP but that the
      very limited information provided by the cousin about the appellant
      was not sufficient to find that he was also politically active.


  26. Fourthly, the judge's approach to the country guidance case law and
      the objective country information must be considered in the context of
      his credibility findings. Having rejected the appellant's claim to
      have been arrested or detained, or to have been politically active in
      pro Kurdish activities either in Turkey or the UK, it was consistent
      with the Country Guidance case law and background information to find
      that the appellant would not be at risk on return to Turkey.


  27. For the reasons I have given, none of the appellant's grounds of
      appeal are able to establish that the decision of the First tier
      Tribunal contains a material error of law and accordingly the appeal
      is dismissed.



Decision


A. The appeal is dismissed.

B. The judge has not made a material error of law and the decision of the
First-tier Tribunal stands.
