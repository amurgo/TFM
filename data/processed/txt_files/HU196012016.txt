                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Quinn promulgated 27.9.17, dismissing his appeal against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 14.7.16,  to  refuse  his
    application for entry clearance (EC) to join his  partner  in  the  UK,
    pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    8.12.17.

 3. Thus, the matter came before me on 12.3.18 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.





Error of Law

 4. For the reasons summarised below, I found such  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision should be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Holmes observed that there  was
    no reference to case law in the decision and it was not  clear  if  the
    judge accepted whether the appellant and the sponsor are married.

 6. However, reading the decision it appears that the fact of marriage  was
    not challenged. The appellant and the sponsor were married in  Pakistan
    on 8.11.15. Throughout the decision, the judge  referred  to  both  the
    relationship as a marriage and the sponsor as the appellant's wife. The
    issue in the appeal was not about the validity of the marriage. Both Mr
    Bates and Mr Schwenk confirmed that there was no issue as to  marriage,
    only as to the subsistence of the relationship.

 7. However, Mr Schwenk went on to elaborate a number of errors of fact and
    law in the decision, so that I was satisfied that the  decision  cannot
    stand. After  hearing  part  of  Mr  Schwenk's  submissions,  Mr  Bates
    confirmed that he felt the respondent could no longer resist the appeal
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. In the  circumstances,
    it was not necessary for Mr Schwenk to  continue  the  balance  of  his
    submissions.

 8. It is not necessary to set out all of the matters  of  concern  in  the
    decision, but the following were some  of  the  points  which  I  found
    persuasive of establishing an error of law.

 9. In support of the conclusion that the relationship was not  strong,  at
    [22]  the  judge  relied  on  an  alleged  absence  of  photographs  or
    statements from friends confirming the status of their relationship  in
    the UK. The point about photographs is repeated at [24]. In  fact,  the
    appellant's bundle contained at least two photographs of them in the UK
    at A382. More significantly, there were a total of  9  statements  from
    friends and associates attesting to their relationship in  the  UK.  It
    appears that the judge may have forgotten about those statements  until
    drafting [40] when referencing the 9 statements and stating  that  they
    were not in the bundle where the skeleton argument had  suggested.  The
    skeleton argument was indeed in error on the page reference (so was the
    judge in citing the skeleton argument), but the  index  to  the  bundle
    reveals the location of the statements at A27-36. It is not clear  from
    [40] whether the judge ever saw the statements,  but  whilst  the  fact
    that those persons were not called to  give  evidence  may  reduce  the
    weight to be accorded to the evidence, their absence  was  insufficient
    reason to reject the evidence. All of this affects the adequacy of  the
    judge's fact-finding exercise.

10. At [24] the judge commented on the telephone  records,  noting  that  a
    number of them were of  short  duration,  when  the  judge  would  have
    expected their calls to be of  a  substantial  duration.  However,  the
    judge ignored the explanation that whilst some of the calls were short,
    that was because they were cut off by the Lyca service, evidenced by an
    examination of the call record, which shows that many of the calls were
    very long indeed and that many of the short or zero duration calls were
    followed by a longer call shortly afterwards.  More  importantly,  both
    the appellant and his wife explained in their statements that the calls
    were often short because they  conducted  most  of  their  relationship
    using WhatsApp. In support of that several hundred of the pages in  the
    appellant's   bundle   comprises   transcripts   of   their    WhatsApp
    communications,  evidence  pointing   towards   the   genuineness   and
    subsistence of their relationship.

11. At [25] the judge pointed out that the relationship was entered into in
    precarious circumstances, which is a fair and relevant point.  However,
    the judge was in error in stating that the  appellant  was  subject  to
    removal directions. After a check online with Home Office  records,  Mr
    Bates  confirmed  that  the  appellant  was  not  subject  to   removal
    directions.  Mr  Schwenk  pointed  out  that  he  had  made  a  student
    application, then varied the application to rely on private and  family
    life, but following legal advice decided to make a voluntary  departure
    from the UK, as confirmed by the Home Office  letters  at  A319-320.  I
    find that the judge erred by making  an  adverse  finding  against  the
    appellant.

12. The judge also erred in relation to the  sponsor's  employment.  Whilst
    there were several  features  addressed  in  the  decision  which  gave
    justifiable cause to regard the employment with  suspicion,  the  judge
    made a number of factual errors which  infected  the  validity  of  the
    conclusion that the employment was not genuine.

13. Some of the factual errors appeared at [34] of the decision. The  judge
    noted that there were a number of payments from Manchester City,  which
    the judge took to  be  housing  benefit.  This  was  derived  from  the
    description of deposits into the sponsor's  bank  account  labelled  as
    Manchester City. However, there are similar deposits labelled Chorlton.
    It is clear when the statements are examined more carefully that  these
    descriptions are not of the employer, but of the  bank  location  where
    the deposits were made. Mr Schwenk also pointed to the evidence in  the
    appellant's bundle that she  is  not  on  housing  benefit  but  has  a
    mortgage and produced the land registry registration for her  property,
    all of which documents were within the appellant's bundle.

14. More significantly, the judge took as a major credibility point against
    the appellant that the judge could not reconcile the  wage  slips  with
    the  bank  deposits.  The  judge  also  ignored  the  submissions   and
    representations explaining the correlation between the payslips and the
    bank deposits set out in detail in  the  letter  from  the  appellant's
    representatives, contained within the bundle at A282-285.  In  summary,
    the sponsor did not immediately bank her wage  cheques,  but  generally
    did so on a monthly basis in groups of four cheques combined to make  a
    single deposit. Thus, the ï¿½1,222.76 made on 2.2.17 computed to the four
    preceding wage slips.  Mr  Schwenk  pointed  out  that  the  particular
    examples the judge chose to highlight at [34] and [36]  post-dated  the
    refusal decision, when the judge should have  concentrated  on  the  6-
    month period prior to the date of application. Mr Schwenk took me to  a
    number of similar examples, all suggesting that the wage slips  did  in
    fact  correspond  to  the  bank  deposits.  A  full  schedule  of   the
    corresponding wages and deposits was set out in the appellant's bundle.

15. As stated above, there were matters relied on by the judge that do cast
    suspicion on the genuineness of the employment.  However,  the  serious
    mistakes of fact in relation to the employment entirely  undermine  the
    credibility assessment,  so  that  it  is  flawed  and  unfair  to  the
    appellant.

16. The judge also made an unfounded suggestion at [27] that the  sponsor's
    lack of English undermined the credibility of the claim to  work  as  a
    Customer Service Advisor. That does  not  necessarily  follow,  as  the
    sponsor was  employed  by  a  retain  business  serving  the  Pakistani
    community. Neither was it fair to suggest there was  any  contradiction
    between the descriptions of the same employment as a shop assistant and
    as  a  Customer  Service  Advisor  when  it  is  commonplace  for  both
    descriptions to be employed.

17. In all the circumstances, it is clear  that  there  were  a  number  of
    significant factual errors, which  were  undoubtedly  material  to  the
    credibility assessment of both the subsistence of the relationship  and
    the sponsor's claimed employment. These errors infect the remainder  of
    the findings so that none of the findings and assessments are  safe  or
    fairly made. In the circumstances, the decision cannot stand  and  must
    be set aside to be remade in its entirety.

Remittal

18. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. The errors in the decision  vitiate
    all other findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that
    there has not been a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

19. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh, with no findings preserved.



Decision

20. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be decided afresh  in  the  First-
                    tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014. Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
pursuant to section 12(4)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
