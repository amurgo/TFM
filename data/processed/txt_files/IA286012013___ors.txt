                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1.  The  claimants  each  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against
    decisions of the Secretary of State of 21 June 2013 refusing  to  issue
    them with EEA Permanent Residence Cards. It is not in dispute that  the
    first claimant is married to a Mr Ejaz Ahmed, a citizen of Germany, and
    that the second to sixth claimants are their children.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal allowed each of the  claimants'  appeals  in  a
    combined determination of the 7 April 2014.

(1) Abida (IA/28601/2013) & Mohammed (IA/28629/2013)

 3. On 24 April 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy purported to grant the
    Secretary of State permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    relation to each of the six above named claimants.

 4. It is accepted by the Secretary of State that the grants of  permission
    made in relation to the appeals of Abida Ejaz and Mohammad Assad  Ullah
    Khan are to be treated as a nullity because no application was made for
    permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  relation  to  these
    claimants.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  has  no  jurisdiction  to  grant
    permission to appeal of its own motion; it can only do so upon  receipt
    of an application by one of the parties to the appeal.

(2) Abdul (IA/28627/2013)

 5. Although permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  by  the
    Secretary of State, and granted by Judge  Foudy,  in  relation  to  the
    Abdul Rehmen Ejaz, at the hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  Mr  Smart
    sought permission for the Secretary of State to withdraw  her  case  in
    relation to this claimant  -  the  application  being  based  upon  the
    Secretary of State's acceptance that she  had  inaccurately  calculated
    Abdul's age as at  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and that now, having identified that he was under the  age  of
    21 as of that date, she accepts he is entitled to a Permanent Residence
    Card.   Unsurprisingly Mr Pipe did not object to such permission  being
    granted.

 6. I grant permission to the Respondent to withdraw her case  in  relation
    to  Abdul  and,  having  done  so,  conclude  that  it  has  not   been
    demonstrated by the Secretary of State that, in relation to Abdul,  the
    First-tier Tribunal's determination contains an error of law capable of
    affecting  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.  The  First-tier   Tribunal's
    determination is, therefore, maintained insofar as  it  allows  Abdul's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse to issue him
    with a EEA Permanent Residence Card.

(3) Aysha (IA/28622/2013), Umama (IA/28625/2013) & Bushra (IA/28626/2013)

Legal Background

 7. These three appeals fall to be considered within  the  context  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006  (SI  1003/2006)
    ("2006 EEA Regulations"). An EEA national is defined in the Regulations
    as a person who is a national of an EEA State and who  is  not  also  a
    British Citizen. By regulation 7 of the 2006 EEA Regulations the spouse
    and direct descendants under the age of  21  of  an  EEA  national  are
    treated as 'family  members'  of  that  EEA  national,  as  are  direct
    descendants of an EEA national of any age as long as they are dependent
    on such person.

 8. A dependency under regulation 7 can be a dependency of choice. For such
    a dependency to arise it is not necessary that a person  be  wholly  or
    even mainly dependent. If a person requires material support for  their
    essential living needs, that is sufficient (See Lim (EEA -  dependency)
    [2013] UKUT 00437 and Reyes v Migrationsverket Case C-423/12 ECJ  -  16
    January 2014).

 9. Broadly speaking an EEA national is entitled to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom for as long as he or she is a 'qualified person'.  A  qualified
    person is defined in regulation 6  of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations  and
    includes 'a worker' and a person who is  'self  employed'.   A  'family
    member' of an EEA national qualified person is entitled  to  reside  in
    the United Kingdom for as long as the EEA national remains a  qualified
    person, or if the EEA national has permanent residence here.

10. By Regulation 15(1) of the 2006 EEA Regulations a family member  of  an
    EEA national who is not himself or herself an EEA national but who  has
    resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA national in accordance  with
    the Regulations for a continuous period of five  years  "shall  acquire
    the right to reside in the United Kingdom permanently".  The  Secretary
    of State must issue such  a  person  a  document  certifying  permanent
    residence and a Permanent Residence Card - save in circumstances  which
    are not relevant in the instant appeal.

Matters not in dispute

11. The following matters of fact have either never been, or are no longer,
    in dispute:

        i) The claimants' father ("the sponsor") is a national of Germany;

       ii) He has been a qualified person in the United Kingdom  since  (at
           the latest) December 2007 and probably since December 2006;

      iii) The claimants entered the United Kingdom on 30 November 2007;

       iv) The claimants were each issued with an EEA Residence Card as the
           family member of an EEA national on 24  June  2008,  such  cards
           expiring on 24 June 2013:

        v) The claimants' dates of birth are:

           Aysha - 11 August 1987

           Umama - 14 August 1989, and

           Bushra - 18 June 1991.

Decision on Error of Law

12. Mr Pipe accepted that the First-tier Tribunal's determination  contains
    an error of law in relation each of these three claimants and  that  it
    ought to be set aside. I agree that this is so.

13. The core of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  for  allowing  the
    appeals is found in paragraph 10 of its determination, which reads:

       "Under Regulation 7, family members include  a  spouse,  and  direct
       descendants of the EEA national, who are under 21, or dependents  of
       the EEA national or of his spouse. This raises an issue relating  to
       Ayesha, Umama, Bushra and Abdul. All were granted residence  permits
       when they were under 21, but they are now  over  21.  The  issue  of
       their  age  was  not  raised  by  the  Respondent.  The   Appellants
       representative submitted first that as it  was  not  raised  by  the
       Respondent, it was too late for  the  issue  to  be  raised  at  the
       hearing. I disagree: as the Respondent cannot confer on herself  the
       right to issue documents which has no basis in law. However, he also
       submitted that these four appellants had been admitted  lawfully  to
       the UK on the basis of his or her EEA rights, it would be  arbitrary
       to deprive them of those rights just  because  they  had  reached  a
       certain age. I agree. I consider that as they  were  family  members
       under 21 when they entered the UK, that entitles them (if the  other
       requirements of the 2006 Regulations  are  satisfied)  to  Permanent
       Residence cards"

14. It is clear that the judge misdirected himself in law in this paragraph
    of the determination. It is not  sufficient  for  a  person  seeking  a
    Permanent Residence Card for that person to demonstrate only that he or
    she was a family member under 21 upon entry into  the  United  Kingdom.
    Such a person would have remained in the United Kingdom  in  accordance
    with the 2006 EEA  Regulations  until  their  21st  birthday,  but  not
    necessarily after that date. There is nothing arbitrary about this  and
    even if there were, this fact alone would not entitle such person to  a
    Permanent Residence Card. The First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  properly
    direct itself and apply the terms of the 2006 EEA Regulations. Although
    Mr Pipe initially sought to defend the  First-tier  Tribunal's  on  the
    basis that its conclusions had a sound basis in EEA  community  law  (a
    submission I make no  finding  on)  this  is  not  how  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dealt with the issue and  consequently  its  conclusions  were
    inadequately reasoned.

15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is therefore set aside. As
    the hearing of the 11 November I directed  that  I  would  re-make  the
    decisions under appeal for myself, with the conclusion  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal that the sponsor has been a qualified person since at the
    latest December 2007, being saved.

Re-making of decisions on appeal

16. I heard oral evidence from Ayesha, Umama and Bushra, each  of  whom  Mr
    Smart carefully  cross-examined.  During  the  course  of  his  closing
    submissions Mr Smart accepted that no issues of credibility arose  from
    the  evidence  given.  Having  heard  the  evidence  for  myself,   and
    considered it in the round with all of the other evidence before me,  I
    am prepared to accept that each of the three  claimants  has  told  the
    truth to the Tribunal.

Ayesha

17. Ayesha turned 21 years old on the 11 August 2008. There is  no  dispute
    that she was a family member of her sponsor father between the date  of
    her arrival in the UK i.e. 30 November 2007, and the date she turned 21
    years old. For the  purposes  of  regulation  15(1)  of  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations, she need also demonstrate that she remained  dependent  on
    her father in the United Kingdom continuously from 11 August 2008 until
    December 2012. If she does so she would have accrued the required  five
    year period as the family member of an EEA  national  residing  in  the
    United Kingdom and thus would be  entitled  to  a  Permanent  Residence
    Card.

18. Ayesha lived with her father for the entire period between August  2008
    and December 2012. Her accepted evidence is that during this period her
    father at all times paid for the cost of her accommodation, the utility
    bills and for a majority of the costs of the households groceries.  She
    herself occasionally bought groceries and decorations  for  the  house,
    but this was on an ad hoc basis.   She and her siblings share  the  use
    of a car, which was purchased for them  by  their  father.  Her  father
    generally pays for the running costs of the car, although  her  brother
    sometimes paid for the costs of petrol. Ayesha stated  that  she  first
    started in employment in June or July 2013, with a  company  called  D-
    Star fashion.

19. On the basis of the above evidence I accept that  Ayesha  was  entirely
    dependent on her father between August 2008 and December  2012.  During
    that period she was not in employment and lived with her father. It was
    her father who funded all of her essential living needs  at  that  time
    as, indeed, he still does - albeit it appears she is now a dependent of
    choice and not necessity.

20. Ayesha  has  therefore  accrued  a  continuous  period  of  five  years
    residence as the family member of an EEA national qualified person  and
    she has, as a consequence, acquired permanent residence in  the  United
    Kingdom and is entitled to an EEA Permanent Residence Card.

Umama

21. Umama turned 21 years of age on 14 August  2010  and  therefore  was  a
    family member of her sponsor father from the date of her arrival on  30
    November 2007 until such date. She is required to further  demonstrate,
    for the purposes of regulation 15(1) of the 2006 EEA Regulations,  that
    she remained continuously dependent  upon  her  father  in  the  United
    Kingdom from 14 August 2010 until December 2012. I accept that she  has
    demonstrated such.

22. There is no dispute that  Umama  lived  continuously  with  her  father
    between 14 August 2010 and December 2012. Her accepted evidence is that
    during this period her father at all times paid for  the  cost  of  the
    accommodation, the utility bills and for a majority of the costs of the
    household  groceries.  Like  her  siblings,  she  occasionally   bought
    groceries for the house, but this was on an ad hoc basis.   She and her
    siblings share the use of a car, which was purchased for them by  their
    father. Her father generally paid for the running costs of the car.

23. Umama stated that she began working for Melton  Moblezz  (her  father's
    business) in 2011, earning �120 per week.  She  spent  the  monies  she
    earned from this employment on her social life  and  shopping  (clothes
    etc) for herself. She began work for D-Star fashion in October 2013.

24. On the basis of this evidence I accept on the balance of  probabilities
    that Umama was dependent upon her father for her essential living needs
    between 14 August 2010 and December 2012. Although she earned  a  small
    sum of money for part of this period, she  did  not  spend  it  on  her
    essential living needs. Even if I am wrong in this and  the  purchasing
    of clothes can be said to amount to her spending  her  income  to  meet
    some of her essential living needs, it  is  still  the  case  that  she
    received material support from her father to meet those needs.  On  any
    view therefore she was dependent on  her  father  during  the  relevant
    period and I find this to be so.

25. Umama has therefore accrued a continuous period of five years residence
    as the family member of an EEA national qualified person and  she  has,
    as a consequence, acquired permanent residence in  the  United  Kingdom
    and is entitled to an EEA Permanent Residence Card.

Bushra

26. Bushra turned 21 years of age on 21 June 2012  and  was,  therefore,  a
    family member of her sponsor father during the period from the date  of
    her arrival in the United Kingdom on 30 November  2007  until  21  June
    2012. As a consequence, in order to meet the requirements of regulation
    15(1) of the 2006 EEA Regulations, she is required to demonstrate  that
    she remained dependent on her father in the United Kingdom continuously
    between 21 June 2012 and December 2012.

27. There is no dispute that  Bushra  lived  with  her  father  during  the
    aforementioned period. As with her siblings, her father  at  all  times
    paid for the cost of the accommodation, the utility  bills  and  for  a
    majority of the costs of the household groceries.  Bushra  occasionally
    bought groceries for the household.

28. She worked for Melton Moblezz (her father's business) in 2011 and 2012,
    earning �100 per week and in March 2012 she began a course of  studies,
    whilst also remaining employed. She spent her income on 'going out with
    friends'.

29. On the basis of this evidence I accept on the balance of  probabilities
    that Bushra was dependent on her father for her essential living  needs
    between June 2012 and December 2012. Although  she  was  in  employment
    during that time, she did not spend her income on her essential  living
    needs.

30. Bushra  has  therefore  accrued  a  continuous  period  of  five  years
    residence as the family member of an EEA national qualified person  and
    she has, as a consequence, acquired permanent residence in  the  United
    Kingdom and is entitled to an EEA Permanent Residence Card

Decision

The grants of permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in relation to  (1)
Abida Ejaz  and  (2)  Muhammad  Asad  Ullah  Khan  are  a  nullity  and  the
determination of the First-tier Tribunal  in  relation  to  these  claimants
stands.

Consent is given for the Secretary of State to  withdraw  her  case  in  the
appeal brought in relation to Abdul Rehman Ejaz. In such  circumstances  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal made in relation to this  claimant  also
stands.

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to (1) Ayesha  Ejaz
Khan, (2) Umama Ejaz and (3) Bushra Ejaz contains an error  of  law  capable
of affecting the outcome of the appeal and is set aside. Upon re-making  the
decision in relation to these three claimants I allow each of their  appeals
for the reasons set out above.
