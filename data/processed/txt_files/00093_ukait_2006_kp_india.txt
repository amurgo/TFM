Representation



(1)  A mother-in-law is not within the wording of paragraph 317,  and  there
is no requirement to read that  paragraph  as  applying  to  mothers-in-law.
The  Immigration  Rules   can   lawfully   distinguish   between   different
relationships.  R (Carson) v SSWP applied.  (2) Before  s  3  of  the  Human
Rights Act 1998 comes into play, a claimant must establish that the rule  as
expressed is inconsistent with a Convention right.  (3)   Counsel  appearing
before a specialist Tribunal should  be  prepared  to  inform  the  Tribunal
about cases he cites that are outside the Tribunal's usual field.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India, born on 2 October 1937.   This  is
    the  reconsideration  of  her  appeal  against  the  decision  of   the
    respondent on 7 October 2004 refusing to vary her  leave  in  order  to
    allow her to remain in the United Kingdom for settlement.

 2. The appellant, a widowed lady with family in England and India, came to
    the United Kingdom on 13 March 2004 with entry clearance.  She obtained
    six months leave to enter in order to visit her  son  and  daughter-in-
    law.  A few days before the end of her leave, she applied to remain for
    settlement, with her son as sponsor.  The application was  refused,  as
    we have said, on 7 October 2004.  The grounds of refusal were that  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant was financially  wholly
    or mainly dependent on the sponsor, or that  she  had  no  other  close
    relatives in her own country to whom she could for  financial  support.
    We should point out, in view of subsequent events, that  those  grounds
    were a comment on the financial position, not  on  the  status  of  the
    sponsor.  The appellant appealed.  Her notice of  appeal  is  dated  12
    October 2004.  The grounds are simply as follows:

        "The Secretary of State's decision is not in  accordance  with  the
        Immigration Rules" and "The applicant's has emotional ties  in  the
        UK with her relatives".

 3. By the time of that notice, the sponsor was very ill.  We do  not  know
    whether his illness was diagnosed before or after his mother arrived in
    the United Kingdom, but by as early as 4 August 2004 his  doctor  wrote
    that he was suffering from a neuro-endocrine tumour of  oat  cell  type
    with  metastatic  disease  involving  his  liver.   He  was   receiving
    chemotherapy, which was expected to continue for some time.  No mention
    of the sponsor's illness was made in the appellant's application or her
    appeal.  Indeed, the application was firmly based on an assertion  that
    the sponsor was receiving net pay of  �2,600  per  month,  and  had  an
    additional household income of �962 a month from his wife's work.

 4. The appellant's son, her sponsor for the purposes of  her  application,
    died on 19 May 2005.  That was, of course, during the currency  of  the
    present appeal.  On 9 September  2005  the  appellant  made  a  further
    application for her leave to be extended.   This  time  she  named  her
    daughter-in-law, her late son's wife, as her  sponsor.   The  sponsor's
    net pay was given as �1,100 per month, with additional household income
    of �1,872.12 from a pension.  In the  course  of  the  application  the
    appellant refers to the death of her son and the  support  provided  by
    her daughter-in-law and grandchildren in the UK: she says that her  son
    in India "is not  willing  to  help  me  financially  and  he  is  very
    unhelpful to me at me time of needs".

 5. Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, as inserted by s118 of the 2002
    Act, provides that, where an application  for  further  leave  is  made
    during the currency  of  existing  leave,  the  leave  continues  until
    determination of the  application  and  any  subsequent  appeal.   Sub-
    Sections 4 and 5 are as follows:


        "(4)     A person may not make an application for variation of  his
             leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave
             is extended by virtue of this section


        (5)      But sub-section (4) does not prevent the variation of  the
             application [that was made in time]."

    What was in form a second application by the  appellant  was  therefore
    considered as a variation of the original application.


The Secretary of State's Decision

 6.  On 23 January 2006  the  respondent  issued  an  expanded  Explanatory
    Statement containing the following passage.


      "4.3  The Secretary of State has  carefully  considered  the  further
             grounds, however, the Secretary of State remains satisfied that
             the appellant would not be living alone in the most exceptional
             compassionate circumstances and that she  did  not  have  close
             relatives in her country to whom she could turn  for  financial
             support.


      4.4   Furthermore, the Secretary of State  notes  the  appellant  has
             visited the United Kingdom on several  occasions  and  sees  no
             reason why  she  cannot  continue  to  do  so.   Moreover,  the
             relationship  between  her  daughter-in-law  and  grandchildren
             could be maintained from  overseas.   The  Secretary  of  State
             remains satisfied that the appellant circumstances is not of  a
             compelling enough nature  to  grant  the  appellant  indefinite
             leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


          5. The  Secretary  of  State  is  not  persuaded  to  reverse  his
             decision."

The Immigration Judge's Decision

 7. The appeal came before an Immigration Judge on 20 March 2006.  He heard
    oral evidence from the appellant and from her daughter-in-law.  He  had
    before him a witness statement by the  appellant  and  the  submissions
    made at various stages on her behalf by her representatives.  There was
    little documentary evidence relating to the  financial  consequence  of
    the appellant's son's death.  It  was  asserted  that  the  appellant's
    daughter-in-law had available to her a sum of �60,000, representing her
    husband's "life savings", but the only evidence of that  was  a  letter
    from the bank, addressed after the husband's death to both husband  and
    wife, confirming the amount of the balance.

 8. At the hearing, the  Presenting  Officer,  readily  acknowledged  that,
    because the appellant is over 65 years old, the reference in the latest
    Explanatory Statement to "most exceptional compassionate circumstances"
    was inappropriate.  There is no requirement to prove such circumstances
    in a case of the appellant's age.  He indicated, however, that  in  his
    view the real  problem  now  was  that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and the proposed sponsor, her daughter-in-law,  was  not  one
    which would allow the daughter-in-law  to  sponsor  the  appellant  for
    settlement within the Immigration Rules.  The  Immigration  Judge  said
    that he would hear submissions on that after taking the  evidence.   He
    did so.  He agreed with the Presenting  Officer.   He  therefore  found
    that the appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules, and made no further findings on whether she would have been able
    to do so if her daughter-in-law could have been her sponsor.  We do not
    criticise him for that, but it is important to note that no  concession
    had been made as to the original and continuing  reasons  for  refusal,
    which were that the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant was
    wholly or mainly financially dependent on her sponsor or that  she  had
    no close relatives in her own country to turn to for financial support.
     We do not read the subsequent reasons, provided  in  the  supplemented
    Explanatory Statement, as superseding  those  reasons,  which  clearly,
    remained relevant to the substantive decision: they  merely  supplement
    those reasons in answer to a new application made on a new basis.

 9.  Having  decided  that  the  appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules, the Immigration Judge continued his determination as
    follows:

      "14.  ... the appellant therefore has to seek to rely on Article 8 of
             the European Convention on Human Rights.


      15.   In order to satisfy Article 8 of  the  European  Convention  on
             Human Rights I have to be  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
             established a family life in the United Kingdom.  At  the  date
             of the hearing the appellant had been in the United Kingdom for
             approximately 2 years.  She is an adult and lived with her  son
             and daughter-in-law and their family.  Unfortunately her son is
             now deceased and she is living simply with her  daughter-in-law
             and her family.  There is  nothing  truly  exceptional  in  the
             appellant's relationship to her daughter-in-law and her  family
             It  is  no  more  than  a  normal  relationship  of  mother-in-
             law/daughter-in-law and  grandparent/grandchild  with  the  one
             exception that clearly the appellant  and  her  daughter-in-law
             are able to support and console each other in relation  to  the
             death of the appellant's son Chakarworti Singh Parmar who  died
             on 19th May 2005 but the appellant lived with her son, a Police
             Officer, and his wife and family in India before  she  came  to
             the United Kingdom as a visitor.


      16.   There appears to be no particular  reason  why  she  could  not
             return to  her  son's  home  from  where  she  came  in  India.
             Although there may have  been  some  difficulties  between  the
             appellant and her daughter-in-law, these do  not  appear,  from
             the evidence before me, to have been particularly severe and if
             this was the case, it  tends  to  suggest  that  the  appellant
             obtained a Visa whilst planning to come to the  United  Kingdom
             for  settlement.   Alternatively,  if  the  appellant  was  not
             intending to settle in the United Kingdom  when  she  made  her
             visit then if returned  she  would  go  back  to  the  existing
             situation in India, which is as it was when  she  came  to  the
             United Kingdom, this is evidenced by the  appellant's  letters.
             These circumstances appear not to have altered.  As far as  the
             appellant's health is concerned, she states  that  she  suffers
             from Arthritis and depression.  There is no medical evidence to
             support the appellant's claimed  health  problems.   I  am  not
             therefore  prepared  to  accept  that  the  appellant's  health
             problems are such that they  would  cause  her  any  particular
             difficulty if returned to India.  There is no evidence  of  the
             treatment she receives  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  that  any
             treatment she requires is not available in India.  There is  no
             reason why her family in the United Kingdom couldn't send money
             to her in India if she is returned thereto.


      17.   On balance therefore I am prepared to accept the appellant  has
             a degree of family life in the United Kingdom but it would  not
             be   disproportionate,   considering   the   United   Kingdom's
             entitlement  to  control  immigration  into  this  country  and
             standing  [sic]   that   there   are   no   truly   exceptional
             circumstances in relation  to  the  appellant,  to  return  the
             appellant to India.  I am not satisfied  therefore  that  there
             would be a breach of Article 8 if the appellant  were  returned
             to India.


      18.   Although neither the Immigration Rules nor  Article  8  of  the
             European Convention on human rights are of  assistance  to  the
             appellant,  the  Home  Office  may  wish  to  reconsider  their
             decision considering the particular facts of this case although
             I make no recommendation in relation thereto."

10. The Immigration Judge accordingly dismissed the appeal.  The  appellant
    applied for reconsideration.

The Reconsideration Grounds and Submissions

11. The grounds for reconsideration were drafted and signed by counsel  who
    also appeared before us.  The grounds begin with a not  quite  accurate
    statement  of  the  reconsideration  process,  and  continue  with  two
    paragraphs headed "background facts",  which  unfortunately  contain  a
    misstatement as to the age of the appellant and a  misstatement  as  to
    the date of her son's death.  The latter error (only) was corrected  at
    the hearing before us.  The "background facts" clearly acknowledge that
    the ground for the respondent's refusal was that the Secretary of State
    was not satisfied that the appellant was financially wholly  or  mainly
    dependent on the relative present and settled in  the  UK.   The  other
    reasons for refusal, in particular, the question whether the  appellant
    has close relatives in her  own  country  to  whom  she  can  turn  for
    financial support, are omitted.  After  two  short  extracts  from  the
    Immigration Judge's determination, the grounds for reconsideration  are
    summarised as follows:

      "8.   There are three submissions:


            (i)  that the reference to 'mother  or  grandmother  who  is  a
                 widow...' in para 317(i)(a) should be read not  to  exclude
                 'mother-in-law' in circumstances such as the present;


            (ii) that on the facts of this case,  the  present  application
                 could be determined on that basis because it was  initiated
                 by the mother's son, ... before  he  dies,  and  is  indeed
                 being sustained by funds from his savings; and


            (iii)      that he has determined  the  Article  8  application
                 wrongly.  Therefore it is submitted that  in  a  number  of
                 material respects the learned IJ  has  misdirected  herself
                 [sic] and/or committed an error of law."

12. On the construction of  the  Rules,  the  grounds  assert  as  follows.
    First,

        "The correct Rule that applies to the appellant is  para  317(i)(a)
        which simply requires her to be the 'mother or grandmother who is a
        widow aged 65 years or over ... .' once it  is  accepted  that  the
        appellant falls under para 317(i)(a) then all she has to do  is  to
        comply with the requirements of para 317(ii) - (vi), which  include
        the requirements of dependency and maintenance and accommodation."

      We pause there to note that the phrase "all she has to do" appears  to
      be a rather casual dismissal of the actual reasons for refusal in  the
      present case.  The grounds continue by asserting  that  "the  cultural
      expectations  of  the  appellant  and  her  daughter-in-law  militates
      against an interpretation of the word  'mother'  that  does  not  also
      include the relationship of a  mother  and  daughter-in-law".   It  is
      unnecessarily limiting and destructive of the  relationship  at  hand.
      That submission is supported by a few words cited from the judgment of
      Munby J in Singh v ECO  [2004] EWCA (Civ) 1075.  It  is  not  easy  to
      understand the relevance of those dicta in this context, because Singh
      v ECO was a case in which the argument was wholly  about  whether  the
      appellants could succeed under Article 8: it is a  necessary  part  of
      the background to that case  that  the  Immigration  Rules,  correctly
      interpreted,   excluded   the   appellant,   cultural   considerations
      notwithstanding.

13. The grounds continue as follows:
            "11. In the alternative, this application should be seen  as  a
             'continuing application'.  The application is that of  being  a
             dependant of the  son  ...  .   A  second  application  by  the
             appellant to remain here as the dependant of  her  daughter-in-
             law ... has never been determined by the SSHD.  The  appeal  is
             in relation to the  refusal  of  the  first  application.   The
             application should be seen as a continuing application  because
             the financial support remains that of the son ...  whose  life-
             savings have been passed onto his wife ... ."

14. As we have already pointed out, there could be no  second  application.
    What was in form a second application has, so far as we can  see,  been
    properly dealt  with.   Counsel's  submission  that  it  had  not  been
    "determined", fails to take account of s3C(4) with its prohibition on a
    further application.

15. The grounds relating to Article 8 assert  that  the  Immigration  Judge
    failed to adopt a proper step-by-step approach to  discovering  whether
    the appellant's Article 8 rights had been breached by the  decision  to
    refuse her leave.  In the alternative it is  submitted  (as  ground  3)
    that the Immigration Judge had failed to consider whether the  decision
    might be regarded as a breach of the appellant's right to private  life
    (as distinct from family life), which is equally protected  by  Article
    8.  The grounds put this as follows:

      "15.  There is no evidence that the learned  IJ  has  considered  the
             appeal from the basis of 'private rights'.


      16.   Yet, if he had considered them there is every  likelihood  that
             given the fact that - she is 65 years old,  a  widow,  and  has
             lived with her sponsor for two years  -  that  the  learned  IJ
             could   have   concluded   that   these   circumstances    were
             'exceptional' of the way that 'dependency' has been defined  in
             the judicial authorities: See, Sayid Marjan [1989] Imm  AR  162
             (which is mentioned in Swaran Singh) where  it  was  said  that
             dependency arises 'where a person is isolated from his  or  her
             close relatives and is therefore unable to  turn  to  them  for
             those things for which a person can normally expect to turn  to
             his family, such as  companionship,  affection,  discussion  of
             problems and courses of action, advice, physical help.  This is
             not an exhausted definition'."

16. We find it surprising that in making that submission  counsel  did  not
    take the opportunity to draw attention to the fact  that  Sayid  Marjan
    was not  concerned  with  the  interpretation  of  Article  8  or  with
    paragraph 317 of HC 395, but with a previous version of the Immigration
    Rules, whose requirements as to dependency were very much  vaguer  than
    those in the present Rules and therefore became subject to considerable
    judicial elaboration.  In the present Rules, dependency  is  explicitly
    stated to be a matter of financial dependency alone.  It is not easy to
    see how a decision on the detailed construction of the  previous  Rules
    could be of very much assistance in defining the  rights  protected  by
    Article 8.

17. The grounds conclude with  two  pages  headed  "Appendix".   There  are
    paragraphs numbered 12, 13, 18, and 19 - 24; they are grouped under sub-
    headings, lettered E, F and F.  The contents appear to be a general but
    rather outdated treatment of some of the decisions on "living alone  in
    the most exceptional  compassionate  circumstances".   That  is  not  a
    matter relevant  to  this  reconsideration,  and  was  never  a  matter
    relevant  to  this  appeal,  as  the  Presenting  Officer  so   readily
    acknowledged before the Immigration Judge.  Many of the cases cited  in
    this "Appendix" are very old; the most recent is 2000.  Of  the  eleven
    cases, nine are unreported.  It is difficult  to  understand  counsel's
    decision to raise an issue of no importance in this case in this way as
    anything other  than  an  obvious  flouting  of  paragraph  17  of  the
    President's Practice Direction.  We say no more about it.

18. Reconsideration was ordered by a Senior Immigration Judge, who gave the
    following reasons for his order:

        "It is arguable that the Immigration Judge was wrong  to  find,  at
        paragraph 13 of his determination, that a 'daughter-in-law  is  not
        covered by paragraph 317' and that 'the appellant's daughter-in-law
        is not a relative in terms  of  paragraph  317'.   In  the  unusual
        circumstance where the appellant applies for leave to remain in the
        household of her son and daughter-in-law, and - after variation has
        been refused - on the demise of the son, the daughter-in-law  takes
        over the role of 'sponsor',  it  is  arguable  that  'sponsor',  as
        defined at paragraph 6 of HC  395  (as  amended  by  Cm  6330),  is
        capable of including the daughter-in-law in the instant case.


        Reconsideration is not granted on Article  8  grounds.   The  judge
        gave sustainable reasons for finding  nothing  'truly  exceptional'
        about the appellant's private and family life  in  the  UK.   Human
        rights are not arguable in any  event,  this  being  a  'variation'
        appeal: see JM* [2006] UKAIT 9."


19. At the beginning of the  hearing  before  us,  counsel  handed  up  his
    skeleton argument, and told us that he relied primarily upon it and  on
    the grounds for reconsideration.  The precise structure of the skeleton
    argument is not immediately clear.  It begins by asserting  that  there
    are "two central issues in this case", and then proceeds to  list  four
    issues, in three separate paragraphs.  The following  nine  pages  then
    make various assertions of fact and of law.   So  far  as  the  law  is
    concerned, it is not entirely clear  what  position  is  being  put  on
    behalf of the appellant.  For example para 19 of the skeleton says  (in
    a footnote) that "no reference will be made" to Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza
    [2004] UKHL 30.  Paragraph 33 of the skeleton consists almost  entirely
    of a long extract from that case.

20. There was a second problem dealing with counsel's  submissions  on  the
    law.  When we asked him, at the hearing, to give us some indication  of
    what was the subject of the litigation in the cases from which  he  had
    cited long or short extracts, he told us that he knew nothing about the
    cases other than that, as reported, they contained the extracts he  had
    cited.  He confirmed the limits of his knowledge by telling us that  he
    thought that Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza was one of the "one of the  Gurkha
    pension cases" and that the extract he had cited was from the speech in
    the House of Lords of "Lord Justice Brooke".  He justified his position
    by telling us that, in the higher courts, there is never  any  need  to
    have any knowledge of a case beyond any extract from a  judgment  cited
    in a skeleton argument.  We have to say that we do not  think  that  is
    right.  Even if it is, however, it may often be necessary  for  counsel
    (in particular) to do more, before a specialist Tribunal.  Although  we
    try not to be entirely ignorant of the development of  other  areas  of
    the law, a specialist Tribunal cannot perhaps be expected to  have  the
    general legal knowledge that other courts have.  In the  present  case,
    the position has been that we have had to take the appropriate steps to
    inform ourselves about the cases which counsel cited.

21.  In preparation for the hearing of the reconsideration, the appellant's
    representatives  submitted  documents   relating   to   the   financial
    consequences  of  the  appellant's  son's  death.   There   have   been
    substantial payments from insurance policies, apparently  enabling  the
    mortgage on their house to  be  discharged,  and  there  is  a  pension
    payable to the widow and two of the children.  (It is by no means clear
    why only two of the children are covered, but it may be that  the  fact
    that the father was already very ill when the third child was born  has
    something to do with the matter.)  No reference at all was made to that
    at the hearing or in counsel's skeleton.   So  far  from  pursuing  any
    application to introduce it, counsel relied solely on the sum of merely
    �60,000  to  which  reference  was  made  at  the  hearing  before  the
    Immigration Judge.  He was of course right to confine  himself  to  the
    evidence before the Immigration Judge in attempting to show an error in
    the determination, but we have to say that  we  have  no  idea  why  no
    reference was made to  what  was  said  to  be  the  present  financial
    position.  What is clear from counsel's  skeleton  is  that  there  are
    apparently relevant facts which have  not  previously  been  disclosed.
    Paragraph 11 of the skeleton gives, for the first time, the information
    that the appellant's mother (who must be a very old lady)  is  also  in
    the United Kingdom.  We do not think there can  be  any  mistake  about
    this.  The period  of  her  leave  is  given,  in  the  context  of  an
    explanation why she herself could  not  act  as  the  sponsor  in  this
    appeal.  If questions of available finance are in issue, as they are in
    this appeal, it is surprising  that  nobody  has  previously  indicated
    whether there is any commitment in respect of the  appellant's  mother,
    and her being mentioned at this late stage might naturally give rise to
    questions  about  whether  there  are  other  relatives  who  may  need
    supporting out of the finances available.

22. So far as the original reasons for  refusal  are  concerned,  counsel's
    skeleton, like his grounds, mystifyingly  leaves  them  unargued.   The
    skeleton simply asserts that  "if  the  appellant  satisfies  paragraph
    317(a) [presumably paragraph 317(i) is meant] of HC 395 then  she  also
    satisfies the other provisions of the Rules."  We have to say  that  we
    do not know how that submission could properly be made in  the  context
    of this appeal, given the reasons for the refusal and the decision  not
    to pursue matters relating to  evidence  of  finances  here,  financial
    dependency, or other close  relatives  in  India.   We  shall  have  to
    return, later in this determination,  to  the  appellant's  ability  to
    satisfy the requirements of the Rules other than paragraph 317(i).

The Claim of Failure to Consider the 'Application'

23. Looking now at the matters that are raised by  the  appellant  in  this
    appeal, we may begin with the question  put  in  the  skeleton  in  the
    following way: "Can  this  application  be  treated  as  a  'continuing
    application'?"  The substantive submission on that is as follows:

        "In the alternative [that is to say, if the Tribunal is against the
        appellant on all other issues] it is submitted that the application
        by the son ... to have his mother, the claimant, stay with him,  be
        treated as a continuing application.  The application  was  put  in
        when he was alive.  The funds that  are  currently  being  used  to
        support this application (namely, the �59,501-75) are very much the
        son's funds and  this  would  obviate  the  need  to  consider  the
        application made to stay with  the  daughter-in-law  which  remains
        outstanding."

24. It is very difficult to see what argument is  intended  here.   As  the
    Secretary  of  State  explains,  and  as  we  have  explained  in  this
    determination, to treat the matter as "continuing" was  precisely  what
    the Secretary of State did.  What he did not  do,  of  course,  was  to
    treat the matter as continuing with unchanged facts when it  was  quite
    obvious that the facts had changed.  If what is being said is that  the
    Secretary of State should have ignored the  death  of  the  appellant's
    son, the submission would appear to be obviously wrong.  The  Secretary
    of State was specifically invited to take into account the son's death;
    and, by s85(4), the Immigration Judge was entitled (and, we would  say,
    in the circumstances essentially bound) to take into  account  evidence
    of facts arising since the date of the decision.  Further, it does  not
    appear to us to be right to  say  that  the  original  application  was
    supported entirely by the savings.  The savings are  not  mentioned  in
    the application.  What is mentioned is a  substantial  monthly  income,
    which ceased on the appellant's son's death, although  it  is  in  part
    replaced by a pension to  which  counsel  makes  no  reference  in  his
    submissions on the "continuing application".

25. It appears to us that there is nothing in this point at all.   The  new
    information was considered by the Secretary of State and considered  by
    the Immigration Judge.  If the financial basis of the  application  was
    now the son's "life savings", there had been a very substantial  change
    in the circumstances even apart from the son's death, since the date of
    the decision.  In order to determine whether the appellant was entitled
    under the Immigration Rules or otherwise, matters need to be considered
    at the date of any decision, whether by the Secretary of  State  or  on
    appeal.

26. There was no procedural error here.  Contrary to counsel's  submission,
    there is no application which remains outstanding.  What purports to be
    an application was made at a time when, by statute,  it  could  not  be
    made, but the appellant has had, through  the  appeals  process,  every
    opportunity to challenge the decision as a whole.  It could rightly  be
    said that the  Secretary  of  State's  initial  response  was,  in  its
    reference to most  exceptional  compassionate  circumstances,  somewhat
    wide of the mark.  That error has, however, subsequently been cured and
    the appellant is no worse for it.

27. That is, we think, sufficient to deal with that part of the submissions
    made on the appellant's behalf.  We think we shall do no  injustice  to
    the appellant if we summarise the remainder of counsel's submissions as
    posing the following four questions.

     1) Do the Immigration Rules, correctly interpreted and read  in  their
        ordinary sense, permit the appellant, as the mother-in-law  of  her
        sponsor, to succeed in her application for further leave?


     2) If not, is there some rule of law which  requires  the  Immigration
        Rules to be read in such a way as to give mothers-in-law  the  same
        entitlements as mothers?

     3) If not, is there some rule of law under which the appellant,  as  a
        mother-in-law, is entitled to the leave she seeks?

     4) If not, is there some rule under which, in all the circumstances of
        the present case, the appellant is entitled to the leave she  seeks
        on an exceptional basis?

    We shall  attempt  to  answer  those  questions  in  turn.   We  remind
    ourselves, however, despite the terms in which the skeleton argument is
    put, the question whether the appellant can benefit from her status  as
    the sponsor's mother-in-law by no means deals with all issues as to her
    entitlement.  The actual reasons why the  Secretary  of  State  refused
    this application have always to be borne in mind.

Question 1

28. Can mothers-in-laws succeed  under  the  Rules?   The  Rules  primarily
    applicable to this application are those contained in paragraph 317  of
    HC 395, which reads as follows:

        "Requirements for indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United
        Kingdom as the parent, grandparent or other dependent relative of a
        person present and settled in the United Kingdom
        317. The requirements to be met  by  a  person  seeking  indefinite
        leave to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  parent,
        grandparent or other dependent relative of  a  person  present  and
        settled in the United Kingdom are that the person:
             (i)  is related to a person present and settled in  the  United
               Kingdom in one of the following ways:
                  (a)  mother or grandmother who is a widow aged  65  years
                     or over; or
                  (b)  father or grandfather who is a widower aged 65 years
                     or over; or
                  (c)  parents or grandparents travelling together of  whom
                     at least one is aged 65 or over; or
                  (d)   a parent or grandparent aged 65  or  over  who  has
                     entered into a  second  relationship  of  marriage  or
                     civil partnership but cannot look to the spouse, civil
                     partner or children of that  second  relationship  for
                     financial support; and where the person settled in the
                     United Kingdom is able and  willing  to  maintain  the
                     parent or grandparent and any spouse or civil  partner
                     or child of  the  second  relationship  who  would  be
                     admissible as a dependant; or
                  (e)  parent or grandparent under the age of 65 if  living
                     alone  outside  the  United  Kingdom   in   the   most
                     exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  and  mainly
                     dependent financially  on  relatives  settled  in  the
                     United Kingdom; or
                  (f)  the son, daughter, sister, brother,  uncle  or  aunt
                     over the age of 18 if living alone outside the  United
                     Kingdom  in   the   most   exceptional   compassionate
                     circumstances  and  mainly  dependent  financially  on
                     relatives settled in the United Kingdom; and
             (ii)      is joining or accompanying a person  who  is  present
               and settled in the United Kingdom or  who  is  on  the  same
               occasion being admitted for settlement; and
             (iii)      is financially wholly or  mainly  dependent  on  the
               relative present and settled in the United Kingdom; and
             (iv)  can, and will, be accommodated adequately, together  with
               any  dependants,  without  recourse  to  public  funds,   in
               accommodation   which   the   sponsor   owns   or   occupies
               exclusively; and
             (iva) can, and will, be maintained  adequately,  together  with
               any dependants, without recourse to public funds; and
             (v)  has no other close relatives in his own country to whom he
               could turn for financial support; and
             (vi)  if seeking leave to enter, holds a valid  United  Kingdom
               entry clearance for entry in this capacity."

29. The submissions made in the skeleton argument are these:

        "12.     The starting point in this appeal is the reference to  who
             is 'the parent, grandparent, or other dependent relative  of  a
             person present and settled in the UK...' (see PARA 317).


        13.      It  is  submitted  that  the  Claimant  qualifies  as  the
             'mother' under paragraph 317(a)  HC  395,  as  the  'mother  or
             grandmother who is a widow aged 65 years of over ...'.   Mother
             is not defined in  paragraph  6  HC  395.   Para  6  is  simply
             concerned  in  defining  'a  parent',  and  includes   both   a
             'stepmother' (at 6B) and 'the mother of an illegitimate  child'
             (at paragraph 6C), but does not exclude a mother-in law.  It is
             submitted that 'mother' includes  'mother-in-law'  even  though
             the natural mother may still be alive.  This interpretation  is
             also consistent with the reference in para  317  to  'or  other
             dependent relative' who can qualify."

      14.   This interpretation does not distort the  purpose  of  the  Rule
             which is to unite  close  families.   It  is  not  designed  to
             separate families unnecessarily.  This interpretation will  not
             weaken the application of the Immigration Rules.  This must  be
             so if regard is taken of the other conditions which have to  be
             satisfied  in  paragraph  317(i)(iii)-(vi)  (i.e.   is   mainly
             dependent financially on the sponsor in the UK."

30. It is very difficult indeed to see how those submissions  can  be  made
    out.  So far as concerns paragraph 317, the opening  words,  mentioning
    parents, grandparent and other dependent relative  serves  to  describe
    the scope of the Rule, but the   precise  relationships  which  qualify
    under the Rule are immediately set out.  It cannot properly  be  argued
    in these circumstances that the Rule is intended to benefit  all  those
    who  come  within  the  category  of  parents,  grandparents  or  other
    dependent relatives.  In particular,  the  initial  description  "other
    dependent relative"  is  confined,  in  paragraph  317(i)(f)  to  "son,
    daughter, sister, brother, uncle or aunt".  There is no scope here  for
    the inclusion of other relatives,  such  as  parents-in-law.   To  this
    extent at least the Rule is precisely drafted: in order to qualify, the
    applicant must be related to the sponsor in one of the  ways  specified
    in paragraph
    317(i)(a) - (f).

31. Counsel's submission is not  improved  by  his  reference  to  relevant
    definition in paragraph 6, some  of  the  words  of  which  he  quotes,
    unfortunately in a context that  fails  to  give  their  true  meaning.
    Paragraph 6 contains a number of definitions including the following:

      "'A parent' includes
          a) the stepfather of a child whose father is dead;
          b) the stepmother of a child whose mother is dead;
          c) the father as well as the mother of an illegitimate child where
             he is proved to be the father;
          d) an adoptive parent, where a child  was  adopted  in  accordance
             with a decision taken by the competent administrative authority
             or court in a country whose adoption orders are  recognised  by
             the United Kingdom or where the child is the subject  of  a  de
             facto adoption in accordance with the requirements of paragraph
             309A of these Rules...
          e) in the case of a child born in the United Kingdom who is not  a
             British citizen, a person to whom  there  has  been  a  genuine
             transfer of  parental  responsibility  on  the  ground  of  the
             original parent(s)' inability to care for the child."

32. Of  course  the  grammatical  form  of  the  definition  is  inclusive:
    definitions often are, because their purpose is to extend  the  natural
    meaning of a word in a defined  way.   But  the  full  wording  of  the
    definition of "parent" in paragraph 6 makes it  absolutely  clear  that
    the basic submission in the skeleton, based as it is on a few  selected
    words from that paragraph,  cannot  be  sustained.   Step-parents  only
    count if  the  relevant  parent  is  no  longer  still  alive.   It  is
    absolutely clear that the effect of  the  definition  is  that  if  the
    natural parent is still alive, a step-parent does  not  count  for  the
    purposes of the Rules as  a  parent,  however  close  the  relationship
    between stepparent and stepchild may be.  There is no  foundation  here
    for an argument that the Rule intends "parent" to apply to anybody  who
    is in a close quasi-parental relationship with  a  sponsor.   There  is
    certainly no basis for the submission that, in this context,  "'mother'
    includes 'mother-in-law' even though the natural mother  may  still  be
    alive", as the  skeleton  suggests.   There  does  not  need  to  be  a
    definition of mother:  in  cases  raising  no  issues  of  reproductive
    technology, one's mother is obviously the woman  from  whose  womb  one
    came.  One's mother-in-law is not one's mother.   It  would  have  been
    open to the draftsmen of the Rules to extend the definition of "parent"
    to include parents-in-law, but, despite making a number  of  extensions
    by the definition in paragraph 6 he has not done so: and nothing in the
    Rules suggests that "parent" or "mother"  is  to  be  given  the  wider
    meaning advocated by counsel.

33. We conclude that the wording of the Rules, properly  constructed,  does
    not enable the appellant to succeed as the sponsor's mother-in-law.

Question 2

34. We now pass to the second question.  This must  be  distinguished  from
    the third.  We are not here concerned with departing  from  the  Rules,
    but merely with departing from their wording. The question  is  whether
    the effect of the Rules as they are  expressed  demands  that  they  be
    expressed another way with, evidently,  a  different  effect.   If  the
    claimant can show that  the  Rules  as  expressed  infringe  her  human
    rights, she may in principle be able to demand that they be read, using
    different words, in order to prevent the infringement.  She then  might
    succeed as a mother-in-law, not because the  rights  of  mothers-in-law
    are not recognised by the Rules, but because the rights of  mothers-in-
    law themselves compel the Rules to be read so as to include them.

35. It goes without saying that this is a difficult argument to  establish.
    Generally speaking, courts are concerned with the law as written and as
    enacted or otherwise authorised, not with some different form of  words
    which might have been used but was not.  But, as the  speeches  of  the
    House of Lords in Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza make clear, s3 of  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 may require legislation to bear a meaning which departs
    from the unambiguous meaning that it would otherwise bear, in order  to
    make it Convention compliant.  So the doctrine espoused  in  Ghaidan  v
    Godin-Mendoza may provide a remedy for a  threatened  breach  of  human
    rights, by allowing the impugned  legislation  to  be  read  in  a  way
    differently from the way in which it is expressed.  That does  not,  of
    course,  mean  that  the  words  of  statutes  and  other   legislative
    instruments can generally be disregarded.  One needs first to establish
    whether the rule as such breaches the claimant's human rights.  If  the
    claimant could show, as Mr  Godin-Mendoza  did,  that  the  legal  rule
    violates his Convention rights, judicial rewriting of the rule  may  be
    the way forward.  But the claimant cannot start with the  proposal  for
    change.  Before any such issue arises, a claimant must  establish  that
    the rule as expressed is inconsistent with a Convention right.  Only if
    it is will s3's requirement to read and apply the rule "in a way  which
    is compatible with the Convention rights" require the rule to  be  read
    in a way other than that in which it is written.

36. In order to establish the  incompatibility  with  a  Convention  right,
    counsel advanced an argument based on Article 14 that there  is  simply
    no justification for a distinction between mothers and mother-in-law in
    the Immigration Rules.  He referred to the well known process  set  out
    by Brooke LJ in Michalak v  Wandsworth  LBC  [2002]  EWCA  Civ  271  at
    paragraph 20.  He submitted that the facts fell  within  the  ambit  of
    Article 8, and that there was an obvious difference between mothers-in-
    law and mothers, his chosen comparator, in  that  mothers  are  treated
    more favourably under the Immigration Rules  than  mothers-in-law.   He
    submitted that  the  situations  of  mothers  and  mothers-in-law  were
    "broadly analogous".  His skeleton argument, which he expanded  at  the
    hearing, continues as follows:

      "26.   There  is  simply  no  justification  for  the  difference  of
             treatment in the case of a mother/mother-in-law's son who  will
             be maintained and accommodated adequately without  recourse  to
             public funds.


      27.   The corrected approach in order to determine justification  was
             described, obiter, by Elias J  in  the  case  of  Williamson  v
             Secretary of State for Education  and  Employment  [2001]  EWHC
             Admin 960  at  paragraph  60,  describing  how  he  would  have
             approached mere assertions by  counsel  for  the  Secretary  of
             State as to justification under Article 9(2) of the Convention.
              The learned Judge said that he would have required evidence to
             support the contention that a ban on corporal  punishment  (and
             not other forms of punishment) in schools was justified:


                 'Without such evidence, it is impossible  to  say  whether
                 the response was a proportionate  one.   The  Court  cannot
                 find  justification  simply  on  the  basis  of   counsel's
                 assertion as to possible grounds which  a  state  might  be
                 able to rely upon to justify the provisions in question.'


         28. The burden of establishing justification is on the state.


         29. No justification  has  been  advanced  for  the  difference  of
             treatment between the two analogous groups.

         30. Clearly if the mother-in-law meets all the  conditions  of  the
             Rule in question but is excluded from its scope simply  on  the
             grounds of her status then there can be no immigration  defence
             for the difference of  treatment.   The  mother-in-law  is  not
             dependent on her natural son and her dependency on her daughter-
             in-law is one of necessity not choice."

37.  In his oral submissions counsel relied firmly on the extract from  the
    judgment of Elias J.  He said there was no evidence in this case either
    that there was any justification for treating mothers-in-laws different
    from mothers.  He said that he put the Secretary  of  State  to  proof.
    Where, he submitted, there is  a  challenge  to  the  Rules,  as  here,
    alleging direct  discrimination  between  mothers  and  mothers-in-law,
    "plainly, the Secretary of State had the burden of proof  to  establish
    why the distinction was made".

38. This submission is on its face  remarkable.   As  we  remarked  at  the
    hearing, every one of the Immigration Rules draws a distinction between
    those who are entitled and those who are not entitled.  The purpose  of
    the Rules is to draw a line and it is clear that there  will  often  be
    cases very close to the line.  If it  is  right  that  it  is  for  the
    Secretary of State to justify all distinctions, by evidence, then every
    immigration appeal would probably have to start with  such  a  process.
    Counsel confirmed that that was his view, and that it was  the  process
    to which Elias J had pointed; although he confirmed that he was unaware
    of any immigration appeals having actually taken that course.

39. As we have indicated previously, counsel was unable to tell us anything
    about the cases he had cited.  The proposition derived from  Williamson
    seemed to us to be unlikely to be right, and we said  so.   It  was  in
    this context that counsel told us that he was unable  to  tell  us  any
    more about the case.

40. In Williamson, the claimants were  members  of  a  Christian  sect  who
    believed that  corporal  punishment  of  children  was  authorised  and
    demanded by the Bible.  Section 548  of  the  Education  Act  1996,  as
    amended by the Schools Standards and  Framework  Act  1998,  prohibited
    corporal punishment by teachers in schools.  The claimants claimed that
    a  total  prohibition  would  breach  their  right  to  manifest  their
    religion, protected by Article 9 of the European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.  They accordingly  sought  a  declaration  that  s548  did  not
    prevent them delegating to a school teacher their own right as  parents
    to administer corporal punishment to their children.   Their  case  was
    based in part on the argument that there  was  no  lawful  or  rational
    justification  for  a  regime  in  which  parents  were  permitted   to
    administer corporal punishment, but teachers were not.   The  Secretary
    of State called no evidence to justify the distinction.

41. Elias J held that the parents' wish to administer  corporal  punishment
    to their children did not amount to the manifestation  of  a  religious
    belief; so he dismissed the claim on  the  ground  that  s548  was  not
    inconsistent with a  right protected by  Article  9.   His  remarks  on
    justification were therefore, indeed, obiter.  The matter did  not  end
    there.  We have to say that we are very surprised indeed  that  counsel
    did not refer us to the fact that the parents appealled to the Court of
    Appeal [2002] EWCA Civ 1926, where  the  justification  point  was  not
    taken, and to the House of Lords [2005] UKHL 15, where it was taken and
    where it was decisive. All the members of the House of Lords who  heard
    the appeal took the view that the parents' rights under Article 9  were
    engaged, and that s548 interfered with them.   On  justification,  Lord
    Nicholls, who gave the leading  speech,  at  paragraph  [42]  described
    Elias J as having dismissed the Secretary  of  State's  submissions  on
    justification "with a degree of briskness".  He then went  on  to  hold
    that the justification was made out, without hearing any evidence.   He
    held that Parliament was amply entitled to take a considered  view  and
    to espouse a policy on corporal punishment such as  that  contained  in
    s548.  All the other members of the House shared Lord Nicholls' view.

42. It seems to us that the subsequent history of Williamson v Secretary of
    State for Education and Employment demonstrates conclusively  that  the
    dictum upon which counsel relied in this appeal does not represent  the
    law.  Given the  final  decision  on  the  matter,  reached  apparently
    without evidence ever being called by the Secretary of State, it cannot
    be right to say  that  the  justification  of  a  distinction  requires
    evidence.  In our view the citation from Elias J's judgment was certain
    to mislead.  Whatever view is taken of  counsel's  obligation  to  have
    some knowledge of the authorities  he  cites,  we  are  confident  that
    counsel has a duty not to mislead.  The claim  that  the  Secretary  of
    State can be put to proof and required to produce evidence in order  to
    justify any distinction made in the Immigration Rules  between  similar
    classes of people, and that a finding on human rights  grounds  against
    him will follow unless  he  do  so,  appears  to  be  entirely  without
    substance.  We reject it.

43. The Secretary of State is bound by the Immigration  Act  1971  to  make
    rules governing non-UK nationals' admission to and stay in  the  United
    Kingdom.  In doing so he is bound to make  distinctions,  even  between
    members  of  families.   He  is  responsible  for  general  policy   on
    immigration, and the rules are to an extent an emanation of his policy.
     The Rules have to distinguish between those who are allowed  to  enter
    and  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  those  who  have  no   such
    entitlement.  A line  has  to  be  drawn  somewhere.   In  the  present
    context, it is drawn between mothers and  mothers-in-law.   As  counsel
    submitted, the effect is that mothers are for  these  purposes  treated
    more beneficially under the Rules than mothers-in-law.  But there is no
    reason why they should not be, because, wherever  the  line  is  drawn,
    those on one side of it will be treated more beneficially than those on
    the other.  There will always be a distinction, and it may  be  a  fine
    one.

44. A similar issue came before  this  Tribunal  in  HK  (Discrimination  -
    refugees' family policy) Somalia [2006]  UKAIT  00021.   There  is  was
    argued that the Secretary  of  State's  policy  for  the  admission  of
    certain  members   of   a   refugee's   family   constituted   unlawful
    discrimination against other  family  members.   In  its  determination
    rejecting that argument the Tribunal referred to R (Carson) v Secretary
    of State for Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 37, [2005]  2WLR  1369.   At
    paragraphs  [15]-[17],  Lord  Hoffmann  (with  whose   reasoning   Lord
    Nicholls, Lord Rodger and Lord Carswell expressly agreed) said this:
        "15.     Whether cases  are  sufficiently  different  is  partly  a
             matter of values and partly a question of rationality.  Article
             14 expresses the Enlightenment value that every human being  is
             entitled to equal respect and to be treated as an end and not a
             means.  Characteristics  such  as  race,  caste,  noble  birth,
             membership of a political party and (here a  change  in  values
             since  the  Enlightenment)  gender,  are   seldom,   if   ever,
             acceptable  grounds  for  differences  in  treatment.  In  some
             constitutions, the prohibition on discrimination is confined to
             grounds of this kind and I rather suspect that article  14  was
             also intended to be so limited. But the  Strasbourg  court  has
             given it a wide interpretation, approaching that  of  the  14th
             Amendment, and it is therefore  necessary,  as  in  the  United
             States, to distinguish between those grounds of  discrimination
             which prima facie appear to offend our notions of  the  respect
             due to the individual  and  those  which  merely  require  some
             rational justification: Massachusetts  Board  of  Retirement  v
             Murgia (1976) 438 US 285.
        16.      There  are  two  important  consequences  of  making  this
             distinction. First, discrimination in the first category cannot
             be justified merely on utilitarian grounds,  e.g.  that  it  is
             rational to prefer to employ men rather than women because more
             women than men give up employment to look after children.  That
             offends the notion that everyone is entitled to be  treated  as
             an individual and not a statistical unit. On  the  other  hand,
             differences in  treatment  in  the  second  category  (e.g.  on
             grounds of  ability,  education,  wealth,  occupation)  usually
             depend upon considerations  of  the  general  public  interest.
             Secondly, while the courts, as guardians of the  right  of  the
             individual to equal respect, will carefully examine the reasons
             offered for any discrimination in the first category, decisions
             about the general public interest which underpin differences in
             treatment in the second category are very much a matter for the
             democratically elected branches of government.
        17.      There may be borderline cases in which it is not  easy  to
             allocate the ground of discrimination to one  category  or  the
             other and, as I have observed, there are shifts in  the  values
             of society on these matters. Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza  [2004]  2
             AC 557 recognised that  discrimination  on  grounds  of  sexual
             orientation   was   now   firmly   in   the   first   category.
             Discrimination on grounds of old  age  may  be  a  contemporary
             example  of  a  borderline  case.  But  there  is  usually   no
             difficulty about deciding whether one is dealing with a case in
             which the right to respect for the  individuality  of  a  human
             being is at stake  or  merely  a  question  of  general  social
             policy. In the present case, the  answer  seems  to  me  to  be
             clear."
45. The Secretary of State clearly has power under the Immigration  Act  to
    make distinctions in the  Immigration  Rules.   A  distinction  between
    one's mother (or stepmother) on the one hand and one's spouse's  mother
    on the other hand is a distinction which is  obviously  justifiable  as
    the sort of distinction which has to be drawn  when  the  Secretary  of
    State decides which family members are to be entitled to settlement  in
    the United Kingdom.  It is not a matter in which a right to respect for
    the individuality of the human being is at stake.  It is  a  matter  of
    social policy, well within the competence of the Secretary of State and
    Parliament.  We very much doubt whether the situation of mothers is  so
    closely analogous to that of mothers-in-law that a distinction  between
    them needs any justification at all.   Whether  or  not  it  does,  the
    difference between them in this  context  is  not  a  matter  of  human
    rights.

46. No unlawful discrimination has been established.  There is no breach of
    Article 14, and accordingly no reason under s3 of the 1998 Act to  read
    paragraph 317 in any way other than that in which it is written.

Question 3

47. The third question is whether, in all the circumstances  of  the  case,
    the appellant should be entitled simply as a mother-in-law to the leave
    she claims.  We have posed this  question  because  it  appears  to  be
    raised by counsel's submission that Articles 8 and 14 might enable  the
    claimant to succeed other than under paragraph 317.  This submission is
    at paragraph 37 of the skeleton.  It  is  not  a  simple  human  rights
    argument, because of the reference to Article 14, which, in the context
    of this appeal, must be a reference to the distinction between  mothers
    and mothers-in-law.  It seems to us, however, that precisely  the  same
    considerations apply in answering  this  question  as  the  last.   The
    distinction is justifiable; it is not unlawful discrimination; applying
    the distinction is not of itself  a  breach  of  the  claimant's  human
    rights; the claimant has  no  more  claim  solely  as  a  mother-in-law
    outside the Rules than she has within them.

Question 4

48. The last question is whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the
    appellant is entitled by reason of the Human Rights Act  to  settle  in
    the  United  Kingdom  despite  not  meeting  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  That is  the  same  as  the  question  whether  the
    appellant's circumstances are so truly exceptional that  the  Secretary
    of State's immigration policy contained in the Immigration Rules cannot
    properly  be  applied  to  her.   This  is  different  from  the  other
    questions.  It is unlike the second, because we are here concerned with
    whether the appellant has a claim outside the Rules rather than  within
    them; it is different from the second and the third because we are here
    concerned with all the  circumstances  of  the  case  rather  than  the
    appellant's  claim  simply  as  a  mother-in-law.   Despite   counsel's
    submissions, we are not prepared to ignore the decision of the Court of
    Appeal in Huang and Others v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 105, which is clearly
    binding on us.

49.  The  question  whether  the  appellant's  circumstances   were   truly
    exceptional was considered by the Immigration Judge  in  the  terms  we
    have set out earlier in this  determination.   The  Senior  Immigration
    Judge who made the order for reconsideration regarded his treatment  of
    the issue as adequate, and so do we.   The  order  for  reconsideration
    rejects the possibility of further argument on this issue, and  counsel
    gave no reason for going behind that order.  As AH (Sudan) [2006] UKAIT
    00038 makes clear, all the matters that  were  before  the  Immigration
    Judge may be before the Tribunal on  reconsideration,  but  there  will
    need to be a good reason for  going  again  into  an  issue  which  has
    already been properly dealt with.  No such good reason is shown here.

50. Nevertheless, counsel made brief submissions on  this  issue.   In  our
    view they lacked  reality.   In  particular,  we  entirely  reject  his
    suggestion that it is "truly exceptional" for  a  man's  wife  and  his
    mother to be united in mutual sympathy and grief at his death.

51. For the reasons given by  the  Immigration  Judge,  we  find  that  the
    appellant's circumstances are not truly exceptional, and  that  she  is
    therefore not entitled to remain in the United Kingdom  for  settlement
    despite the Rules.

Other Requirements of Paragraph 317

52. So the four questions put  by  counsel's  argument  are  answered.   We
    should not part from this case, however,  without  pointing  out  that,
    despite the way in which the matter was put before us, the relationship
    between the appellant and her proposed sponsor is far  from  being  the
    only issue in this case.  The matters raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer are, so far as we are aware, still live.  The way in which  the
    appellant might seek to meet the other requirements  of  paragraph  317
    may well have changed as a result of her son's death.  Counsel made  no
    submissions in any detail on the financial requirements of  the  Rules,
    simply asserting that the appellant met them.  It is very difficult  to
    see the basis for  that  assertion.   Two  particular  requirements  of
    paragraph 317 are in issue: the financial dependence of  the  appellant
    upon her relative settled in the United Kingdom,  and  the  absence  of
    other close relatives in her own country  to  whom  she  can  turn  for
    financial support.  As  the  Immigration  Judge  pointed  out,  nothing
    appears to have changed in the appellant's own country since  she  came
    to the United Kingdom.  We must assume that, when she  used  her  visit
    visa, she intended to return to India.  The circumstances in India must
    therefore be ones to which, in her view, she could return.  If  nothing
    has changed in India, however, a great deal has changed in  the  United
    Kingdom.  And because this is an in-country appeal, it is the facts  at
    the date of any hearing which are to be taken into account.   It  seems
    to us that the evidence before the Immigration Judge and before  us  is
    wholly insufficient to establish that the appellant met  or  meets  the
    relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules.

53. We remind ourselves that when an application for an extension  of  stay
    has to be determined by reference to paragraph 317, the questions to be
    asked are not whether whilst the applicant is in the United Kingdom she
    meets the requirements of the Rules, but whether she would meet them if
    she were notionally considered as being in her own country at the  time
    when the decision has to be made.  (If it were not so, the  requirement
    of "living alone in the most exceptional compassionate  circumstances",
    for example, would be impossible to fulfil.)  The  appellant  has  said
    that her other son, the son who lives in India, is unwilling to provide
    for her.  The evidence that that was the case was rightly  regarded  by
    the Immigration Judge as difficult to reconcile  with  the  appellant's
    intention to return to India at the end of her visit.  But  things  are
    different now: the son in India is the appellant's only son.   She  has
    no other  male  descendant.   There  is  no  evidence  that,  in  those
    circumstances, he would decline to look after her.

54. Similarly, the question of support has to be looked at from a different
    angle.  The appellant's claim was that when she was in  India  she  was
    financially mainly dependent upon her son in the United  Kingdom.   Her
    daughter-in-law may or may not be prepared to send money  to  India  in
    the same way: we do not know, and there is no evidence on it.  But even
    if the appellant met the requirements of paragraph  317(i),  she  would
    need to show that, if she were in India at the present time, she  would
    be financially wholly or mainly dependent upon her  daughter-in-law  in
    England, and that her own son in  India  would  not  provide  her  with
    financial support.

55. In the light of the conclusions we have reached in the  issues  arising
    from the relationship between the appellant and her  proposed  sponsor,
    we, like  the  Immigration  Judge,  do  not  need  to  reach  any  firm
    conclusion on the other aspects of paragraph 317.  But it seems  to  us
    that even if we had  been  persuaded  by  counsel's  arguments  on  the
    relevance of the relationship, we could not have allowed  this  appeal,
    because of the lack of evidence that  the  other  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules are met.

56. For the reasons we have given we find that the Immigration  Judge  made
    no material  error  of  law,  and  we  order  that  his  determination,
    dismissing this appeal, shall stand.
