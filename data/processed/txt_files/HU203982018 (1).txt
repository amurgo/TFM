                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GLEESON


                                   Between

                              RANGA RAO GUDURU
                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                        PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF
             THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to refuse him leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted on 27 February 2019 on the basis  that
    the First-tier Judge arguably erred in law at [7]  by  considering  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of  decision  not  the  date  of
    hearing.

 3. By a Rule 24 Reply dated 13 March 2019, the respondent  indicated  that
    he does not oppose the application for permission to appeal and invited
    the Upper Tribunal  to  determine  the  appeal  by  setting  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remitting  the  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

 4. Pursuant to rule 40(3) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 (as amended), the  Upper  Tribunal  is  not  required  to  provide
    written reasons for its decision under paragraph 40(2)(a) of the Rules,
    where the decision is made  with  the  consent  of  the  parties  (rule
    40(3)(a)), or the parties have consented  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  not
    giving written reasons (rule 40(3)(b)).

 5. The requirements of sub-paragraphs 40(3)(a) and 40(3)(b) of  the  Rules
    are met.  I am satisfied that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    can properly be set aside without a reasoned decision notice.

DECISION

 6. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with  no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved.  The decision in this appeal
    will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
