                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of India born on 5th July 1991.  He  appeals
    against the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Russell
    sitting at Taylor House who on the  papers  dismissed  the  Appellant's
    appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated 19th  November  2014.
    That decision was to refuse the Appellant's application  for  leave  to
    remain on the basis of the Appellant's family and private life.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 12th  February  2014  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  On 5th August 2014 he  applied  for  further
    leave to remain on the basis of  his  family  and  private  life.   The
    Respondent refused the application on the grounds  that  the  Appellant
    did not enjoy family life with his relatives in the United Kingdom  nor
    had he established a private life in such a short space of  time.   The
    Respondent declined to  exercise  her  discretion  in  the  Appellant's
    favour to grant him further leave  because  the  Appellant  was  having
    problems with his place of study.

The Proceedings at First Instance

3.   The Appellant appealed against that decision and on 11th February  2015
    the Tribunal informed the Appellant and his  representatives  that  the
    hearing of this matter would be take  place  on  17th  July  2015,  the
    Appellant having paid ï¿½140 for an oral hearing.  On 13th July 2015  the
    Appellant's representatives Messrs. Simon Noble Solicitors wrote to the
    Tribunal seeking an adjournment on the grounds that the  Appellant  had
    contracted chickenpox.  The solicitors stated that  not  only  was  the
    Appellant unable to attend the hearing he was also unable to give  them
    any instructions.  The letter attached some  (photocopied)  photographs
    of the Appellant's face and a pharmacy receipt and a packet of cream.

4.    The  application  for  an  adjournment  came  on  the  papers   before
    Designated  Judge  Campbell  on  16th  July  2015.   He   refused   the
    application in the absence of medical evidence "that the  Appellant  is
    suffering from chickenpox". The Appellant sent another  letter  by  fax
    later in the evening of the 16th at approximately 8.30pm  stating  that
    no medicine was available for chickenpox but the GP had suggested  that
    the Appellant should buy some cream from the local pharmacy and stay at
    home.  His letter added:

         "Now as I have been refused with the adjournment application at the
         last moment I could not get any solicitors or Counsel to  represent
         me having chickenpox.  They even do not want to meet me because  of
         the health and safety of others.  Therefore I request once again to
         review the decision and adjourn my case."

5.   When the case was called on 17th July 2015 there was no  appearance  by
    or for the Appellant by  12.15  pm.   Attempts  by  the  clerk  to  the
    Tribunal to contact the Appellant's representatives were  unsuccessful.
    At paragraph 5 of the determination the Judge dealt with  his  reaction
    to this situation stating:

         "In the absence of the Appellant or his representatives and  noting
         that the Appellant has  been  on  notice  since  11th  February  to
         prepare for his hearing  I  proceeded  to  decide  the  Appellant's
         matter on the papers before me.  The  Appellant  has  submitted  no
         further papers or statements for the hearing of this  matter  since
         being informed of the date of hearing.  There  is  no  Respondent's
         bundle on file."

6.   The Judge concluded that the Appellant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules as there was no  evidence  of  any  family  life  the
    Appellant might have with his relatives in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant could not succeed  under  paragraph  276ADE  in  relation  to
    private life since the nature of the  Appellant's  connections  to  the
    United Kingdom or any problems he  might  face  in  reintegrating  into
    India were unknown.  He was a citizen of India and  had  only  recently
    entered the United Kingdom as a student with no legitimate  expectation
    of being allowed to remain for a longer period than his studies.

7.   At paragraphs 8 to 12 the Judge dealt with the  Appellant's  claim  for
    leave to remain outside the Rules under Article 8.   Directing  himself
    in accordance with the step-by-step approach required in  the  case  of
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 the Judge found that the Appellant had failed  to
    establish how the Respondent's decision interfered with the exercise of
    family  or  private  life.  Nor  could  the  Appellant  show  that  any
    interference there might be would have consequences of such gravity  as
    to engage Article 8.  If there was interference it  was  in  accordance
    with the law. The Judge dismissed the appeal  commenting  at  paragraph
    12:

         "In a matter as serious  as  an  allegation  of  a  breach  of  the
         Appellant's human rights and bearing in  mind  the  long  time  the
         Appellant has had to prepare his case I would have expected to  see
         material of sufficient weight to support  the  Appellant's  appeal.
         As noted above the Appellant has submitted no further evidence  and
         failed to appear for his hearing despite being  informed  that  his
         matter would proceed on the date and at the time notified."

The Onward Appeal

8.   The Appellant appealed against that decision arguing that he  had  been
    unable to get any medical evidence to confirm  that  he  was  suffering
    from chickenpox as he had  been  advised  not  to  go  to  his  General
    Practitioner or a hospital due to the infectious nature of the disease.
     The Tribunal had power to adjourn or postpone a hearing but the  Judge
    had not considered this or indeed the authority of Nwaigwe [2014]  UKUT
    00418.  The refusal of the adjournment  application  despite  the  fact
    that there was medical  evidence  without  considering  the  overriding
    objective of the Procedure Rules to ensure a fair trial amounted to  an
    arguable material error of law.

9.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Landes  on  4th  January  2016.   In
    granting permission to appeal she wrote that it was arguable  that  the
    Judge  had  erred  in  failing  to  consider  the  further  adjournment
    application sent by the Appellant on 16th July.  Alternatively  if  the
    Judge had never seen that second application it  was  arguable  that  a
    procedure irregularity had occurred.  It was not clear when the  second
    application of 16th July 2015 was received by the Tribunal.  There  was
    nothing to indicate anything other than that it  was  received  on  the
    evening of 16th July.  The Judge's decision would indicate that he  had
    not seen that second application by 12.15 on 17th  July  or  18th  July
    when he signed his decision.  It was not  inevitable  that  the  second
    application would have been refused  had  it  been  considered  by  the
    Judge.  The Procedure Rules did not  require  medical  evidence  to  be
    supplied. It was arguable  that  the  Appellant  had  supplied  further
    information with the subsequent application both as to why he could not
    obtain medical evidence and also explaining that he had not  been  able
    to give instructions to his legal representatives or to be  represented
    at the hearing.

10.  Following the grant of permission the Respondent wrote to the  Tribunal
    pursuant to Rule 24 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules arguing  that
    the first application for  an  adjournment  had  been  refused  by  the
    Tribunal for sustainable reasons but the Respondent could  not  comment
    on the second adjournment application as the Respondent  had  not  seen
    the Appellant's letter of 16th July 2015 or attachments (there  were  a
    number of attachments to that letter but they appear to have  been  the
    same as was sent with the letter of 13th July 2015).

The Hearing Before Me

11.  At the hearing before me the Appellant's solicitor  stated  that  there
    was still no medical evidence to support the Appellant's claim to  have
    suffered from chickenpox as he had been told not to attend the surgery.
     The letter of 16th July had been received by the Tribunal but had  not
    reached the Judge when the case was called on for hearing on 17th.  Had
    that letter been before the Judge he would have taken a different  view
    of the request for the adjournment.  Permission should be  granted  and
    the appeal should be remitted back to the First-tier.  In response  the
    Presenting Officer stated that as there was still nothing from a GP  or
    doctor there was nothing to indicate  that  the  Judge's  decision  was
    wrong.

Findings

12.  The issue in this case is whether the  Judge  was  correct  to  proceed
    with the hearing of the case or whether he should have  adjourned.   If
    the Appellant was suffering from chickenpox he would not have been able
    to attend for his hearing and the case should have  been  adjourned  to
    another date.  The question is whether the decision of  the  Designated
    Judge of 16th July  and  the  decision  of  Judge  Russell  to  require
    evidence that the Appellant actually was suffering from chickenpox  and
    then go ahead with the hearing in the absence of evidence was  correct.
    It was not necessary for evidence  to  be  supplied  in  support  of  a
    request for an adjournment (that had been in the old  Rule  21  of  the
    2005 Procedure Rules but Rule 21 had  been  abolished).  However  where
    evidence could reasonably be expected the trial Judge would be entitled
    to draw an adverse inference from the absence of such evidence.

13.  Although the Judge granting permission was of the  view  that  had  the
    trial Judge seen the subsequent letter of 16th July it might have  made
    a difference to the decision not to adjourn, it is difficult to see how
    it would have made any difference. There was little of substance in the
    letter of 16th July 2015 which was different from the  letter  of  13th
    July sent by the solicitors.  The letter of 16th July repeated what had
    been said in the letter of 13th July namely that the Appellant had  had
    medical advice not  to  go  to  hospital.   The  copy  photographs  and
    pharmacy receipt had been attached to the first request  on  13th  July
    which was rejected by the Designated Judge.

14.  It does appear that the Judge had not seen the  letter  of  16th  July.
    This was hardly surprising given that  it  was  only  received  by  the
    Tribunal after office hours the  night  before  the  hearing.   However
    there was no error of law for the  Judge  to  fail  to  refer  to  that
    document since it could have made no difference to the situation as  it
    added nothing to the earlier application. The Appellant was well  aware
    from the refusal of the  Designated  Judge  what  he  was  expected  to
    provide but his letter of 16th July did not provide that. The  position
    before the Judge  was  essentially  the  same  as  it  was  before  the
    Designated Judge.

15.  In this connection I note  two  points.   Firstly  there  is  still  no
    evidence that the Appellant has ever suffered from chickenpox.   All  I
    have are two letters, one from his solicitors and the  other  from  the
    Appellant himself both saying that  the  Appellant  had  complained  of
    suffering from chickenpox but with no medical evidence  to  show  that.
    The photographs in the file (they are photocopies but I was  shown  the
    original colour photographs during the hearing) merely  show  that  the
    Appellant had a small number of spots on his face.  They may or may not
    be indicative of chickenpox but they are not  evidence  (and  certainly
    not medical evidence) which shows that it is more likely than not  that
    the Appellant was indeed suffering from an infectious disease.  In  any
    event it is not clear when the photographs were taken  and  it  is  not
    surprising that both the Designated Judge and the Trial Judge  came  to
    the view that they did on that evidence.

16.  The second point to note which creates a difficulty for  the  Appellant
    is that no-one represented him  at  the  hearing  on  17th  July.   The
    Appellant had paid for an  oral  hearing  but  an  application  for  an
    adjournment  had  been  refused  and  both  the   Appellant   and   his
    representatives were aware of that.  In those circumstances  it  was  a
    great discourtesy to the Tribunal  that  no-one  from  the  Appellant's
    representatives attended the hearing at the very  least  to  renew  the
    application.  It was not reasonable for the Appellant  to  expect  that
    his application for an adjournment would  be  granted  on  the  day  in
    circumstances where he had been told what evidence he needed to produce
    to support his application for an adjournment.   He  had  not  produced
    that evidence and indeed he has still not produced any  evidence.  This
    is despite the fact that even if the Appellant was unwell  in  the  few
    days before the hearing  no  explanation  has  been  provided  for  the
    earlier failure to provide evidence to the First Tier in good  time  in
    support of the appeal in accordance with the Tribunal's directions.

17.  In those circumstances it is difficult  to  see  what  else  the  Judge
    could have done but to continue with the case.  The question of whether
    to adjourn or not is a test of fairness.  Given that the Appellant  had
    been told to produce some medical evidence to confirm his  illness  and
    given that no-one attended on his behalf at  the  hearing  even  though
    clearly he was  instructing  solicitors  (hence  their  letter  to  the
    Tribunal of 13th July), fairness did not in my view require  the  Judge
    to grant an adjournment given the very limited information before  him.
    I do not find that there was any error of law in the Judge refusing  to
    adjourn the case and continuing with the hearing and deciding  the  way
    that he did.

18.  The Appellant's appeal is  essentially  a  procedural  one.   There  is
    nothing to indicate that there was any merit in the Appellant's  appeal
    in the first place.  That of itself is not decisive since if there  has
    been a fundamental error of procedure then the Appellant is entitled to
    have the matter looked at again.  However I do not consider that  there
    was any error although I am bound to say had I found an error  and  set
    the decision aside I would have remade the decision by  dismissing  the
    appeal.  The Appellant cannot succeed under the Rules and there  is  no
    evidence to show any compelling reason why his appeal should be allowed
    outside the Rules.  The Judge did  not  hear  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant but I have seen nothing in the papers that indicates that the
    Judge's conclusions on Article 8  inside  or  outside  the  Rules  were
    wrong.  However as I have indicated the case does not reach that far as
    I do not find that there was  any  procedural  error  in  the  Tribunal
    proceeding with the hearing on 17th July.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold the decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
