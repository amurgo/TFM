Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Marfat, Solicitor, Newcastle Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, entered the United  Kingdom
           lawfully on 12 September 2005 as a student. His leave to  remain
           as such expired on 31 October 2009. An application made in  time
           for a variation of his leave as a Post Study  Work  Migrant  was
           refused on 17 November 2009, and his appeal rights  in  relation
           to that decision were exhausted on 8 March 2010.
        2. On 5 July 2010 the Appellant was granted leave to  remain  as  a
           student until 5 July 2012. On 13 June 2013 he was granted  leave
           to remain as a Post Study Work Migrant until 14 October 2013. An
           application having been made  after  the  expiry  of  that  last
           period of leave, he was then granted leave to remain as a Tier 4
           student on 9 November 2013 until 25 January 2015; although  that
           leave was then curtailed by decision of 1 August 2014.
        3. On 26 November 2014 the Appellant was granted a  further  period
           of leave to remain as a Tier 4 student until 28  June  2015.  An
           application to vary that leave on the basis  of  his  Article  8
           rights was made pursuant to Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules
           on 24 June 2015, but this was withdrawn on 7 September 2015.  In
           the meantime, on 19 August  2015,  the  Appellant  had  made  an
           application for indefinite leave to remain based upon the length
           of his residence in the UK, which  was  refused  on  5  November
           2015.
        4. An appeal against the refusal was allowed on Article  8  grounds
           in a decision of the First tier Tribunal ["FtT"] promulgated  on
           16 May 2016.
        5. The Respondent's application to the FtT for permission to appeal
           that decision complained  that  it  had  been  conceded  at  the
           hearing that the Appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of
           the Immigration Rules, and that  the  Judge's  approach  to  the
           Article 8 appeal was flawed. Permission to appeal was granted by
           decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Foudy on 30  January  2017
           on the basis it was arguable  the  Judge  failed  to  apply  the
           correct test when considering Article 8, in  particular  to  the
           weight attached to the circumstances the  Appellant  might  face
           living in Nigeria.
        6. The Appellant filed no Rule 24 notice in response to that  grant
           of permission, until the hearing itself.  That  document  failed
           however, as Mr Marfat acknowledged, to engage with the terms  of
           the Respondent's challenge, and simply sought  to  re-argue  the
           appeal.
        7. Neither representative had, or had read, a copy of the  decision
           of the Supreme Court in Agyarko and Ikuga [2017] UKSC 11, so the
           appeal was stood down to allow them to do so.
        8. Thus the matter comes before me.


      Error of law?
        9. As Mr Marfat (who did not appear below) was forced to accept, it
           was conceded before the FtT by Counsel who then  appeared,  that
           the Appellant did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
           Rules for the application for indefinite leave to remain that he
           had made on 19 August 2015 on the basis of his "long residence".
           That concession was clearly correctly made in the light  of  the
           Appellant's immigration history.
       10. Although the Judge appears to have proceeded on the  basis  that
           the Appellant was always  under  a  genuine  and  well  founded,
           albeit mistaken, belief  that  he  had  a  flawless  immigration
           history, there  was  no  concession  to  that  effect  from  the
           Respondent, and no reasons were  given  for  such  a  conclusion
           [20]. It  is  not  possible  to  discern  from  the  Appellant's
           immigration history how he could have genuinely  formed  such  a
           mistaken belief, when he had unsuccessfully  pursued  an  appeal
           against a  refusal  of  leave  in  2009  so  that  there  was  a
           significant break in the chain of grants until 5 July 2010.
       11. Counsel below conceded in addition that the  Appellant  did  not
           meet the requirements of any  of  the  routes  potentially  open
           pursuant to Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  Judge
           reviewed the evidence and concluded  that  this  concession  was
           also correctly made in the light of  the  Appellant's  age  upon
           first arrival in the UK in 2005, and his age at the date of  the
           hearing. He noted that the  Appellant  had  visited  Nigeria  as
           recently as 2010, and that he remained in regular  contact  with
           his parents and family in  Nigeria,  so  that  he  retained  his
           social cultural and family  links  to  Nigeria  and  fluency  in
           Yaruba.
       12. Although the Judge did not have the benefit of the  guidance  of
           the Supreme Court in Agyarko, and did not refer himself  to  the
           guidance to be found in the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in
           that case, he did find  that  there  was  no  reliable  evidence
           before him of any insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant's re-
           integration into Nigerian society [12(g)].
       13. The Judge went on to note that no  valid  application  had  been
           made for a grant of leave to remain based upon  the  Appellant's
           relationship with a British citizen, Ms W. In any  event,  there
           was no evidence before him to suggest that the  Appellant  could
           meet  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  the  threshold  financial
           requirement for such an application.
       14. The Judge therefore dismissed the appeal under  the  Immigration
           Rules,  and  went  on  to  consider  the  appeal   outside   the
           Immigration Rules on Article 8  grounds,  although  in  fact  it
           would appear that by virtue of section 82(1) of  the  2002  Act,
           the only ground of appeal available to the  Appellant  was  that
           the decision was unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human  Rights
           Act 1998.
       15. I am satisfied that the Judge did accept that  the  relationship
           formed between the Appellant and Ms W constituted "family  life"
           for the  purposes  of  Article  8  [18].  However  that  finding
           requires some unpicking, and the development of the relationship
           requires some analysis against the chronology of the Appellant's
           immigration status, which is not to  be  found  in  the  Judge's
           decision. That is in my judgement an error of law, because  such
           an analysis is relevant to the weight that the tribunal is  able
           to attach to the "family life" relied upon, and in turn  affects
           the fair balance that the Tribunal is required to strike against
           the clear public interest in the Appellant's removal.
       16. The couple are an unmarried couple, who have as yet no children.
           They told the Judge they would like to marry and start a family,
           but they had no concrete plans to do so. On the evidence  placed
           before the Tribunal they had met in  November  2009  [11(j)].  I
           note that this was therefore at  a  time  when  the  Appellant's
           position was at its most precarious, although by virtue  of  the
           operation of section 3C, I accept that it fell  short  of  being
           unlawful; Jeunesse. The Appellant's initial grant  of  leave  to
           enter as a student had expired on 31 October 2009. He  had  made
           an in time application to vary that leave, but it was refused on
           17 November 2009 and his appeal  rights  against  that  decision
           were exhausted on 8 March 2010.
       17. The couple had commenced co-habitation in July 2012.  This  too,
           occurred at a time when the Appellant's position  was  extremely
           precarious, albeit lawful. His most recent period  of  leave  to
           remain as a student had expired on 5 July 2012, and although  he
           had made an application to vary that period of leave as  a  Post
           Study Work Migrant it was not granted until 13 June 2013.
       18. The Judge ought then to have turned to the issue of  whether  or
           not the Appellant was bound  to  be  successful  in  a  notional
           application for entry clearance as Ms W's partner, were such  an
           application under consideration at the date of the  hearing.  If
           he was certain to be granted leave, then it would be open to the
           Tribunal to conclude in the appropriate circumstances that there
           might be no public interest in his removal; Agyarko  [51].  This
           was however, on its facts, not such a case.
       19. Equally, it could not be said that the Appellant and Ms W  could
           never arrange their affairs so  that  a  successful  application
           might be made in the future. Ms W had an income  from  her  self
           employment as a beautician of �8,000 pa. On the face  of  things
           she had a further unused earning capacity, and she also  had  an
           asset in the form  of  the  home  she  owned  jointly  with  her
           parents, although the evidence did not disclose  the  equity  in
           that property.
       20. Given that the relationship was formed and continued whilst  the
           Appellant's situation was precarious, the Judge  ought  to  have
           gone on to  recognise  that  the  European  court  had  said  in
           Jeunesse  that  it  is  likely  only  to   be   in   exceptional
           circumstances that the removal will constitute  a  violation  of
           Article 8, as recognition of the weight that must  be  given  to
           the public interest in removal. This the Judge did not  do,  and
           in my judgement the decision clearly discloses a failure to give
           the public interest the proper weight. That being the case  both
           parties were content that I should set aside  the  decision  and
           remake it without the need for hearing either further  evidence,
           or argument.
       21. There was no delay in the enforcement of  immigration  controls,
           and thus there was nothing on the evidence in  this  case  which
           could be said to give rise to a dimunition in the cogency of the
           public interest in the Appellant's removal.
       22. If the  Judge  had  recognised  expressly  that  something  very
           compelling was required to outweigh the public interest, then he
           would have been bound to  recognise  that  the  evidence  placed
           before him simply did not disclose such a state of affairs. I do
           note the Judge's finding that the Appellant had  benefited  from
           his education in the UK, and had paid the  taxes  due  upon  his
           earnings in the UK, but that is hardly unusual and is  certainly
           not enough to outweigh the public interest, even when considered
           in conjunction with a desire to marry and start a family with  a
           British citizen.
       23. The simple truth that lies at the heart of this appeal  is  that
           the Appellant could return to the shelter  and  support  of  his
           family in Nigeria  in  safety,  and  with  the  benefit  of  his
           education and employment experience, could be expected to have a
           promising career in Nigeria. He had  no  entitlement  to  demand
           that  he  be  allowed  to  pursue   his   career   in   the   UK
           notwithstanding his inability to meet the  requirements  of  the
           Immigration Rules. His partner faced a choice. She could  either
           relocate to Nigeria to live with him there, or, the couple could
           arrange their affairs so that in the future he would be able  to
           make a successful application under the  Immigration  Rules  for
           entry clearance as a partner. In the meantime she  was  able  to
           visit him in Nigeria in safety. What the couple could not do was
           simply demand that the Appellant be  granted  leave  to  remain,
           notwithstanding his inability to meet immigration  controls,  in
           reliance upon the "family life" created whilst his  position  in
           the UK was precarious, as a fait accomplit.
       24. I dismiss the appeal.





      DECISION


      The decision promulgated on 16 May 2016 did involve the making  of  an
      error of law that requires it to be set aside and remade. I remake the
      decision so as to dismiss the appeal.
