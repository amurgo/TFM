Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A. Chohan, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Punj is a citizen of India.  He was born on 7 April 1946.  He was 72
    years old at the date of the decision and is now 73 years old.

 2. He entered the United Kingdom on 1 March 2018 and had  been  previously
    issued with a visa permitting him to visit the  United  Kingdom.   That
    visa was due to expire on 14 April 2018.  On 14 April 2018  he  made  a
    human rights claim asserting that it would be a  breach  of  his  human
    rights were he to be removed from the United Kingdom.  By that stage he
    had been in the United Kingdom for about six weeks.

 3. The nature of the claim was probably best set out in a letter he  wrote
    on 11 April 2018.  He wrote:

         "Up until 2007 I was supported and cared for by my  late  wife  but
         after the unfortunate event of her death I was deeply affected  ...
         My eldest son Rajiv Kumar who was  previously  living  with  me  in
         India and taking care of me now resides in  Turkey.   In  September
         2017 he moved to Turkey for work and now lives there and he intends
         to settle there, leaving me alone without any family member to look
         after me."

    That was the way he advanced his case.

 4. It was a matter  of  some  importance  identified  by  the  appellant's
    representatives that adequate evidence be provided by experts  to  make
    out a claim that the appellant should remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Pursuant to this, efforts were made successfully  to  obtain  a  report
    from a social worker and a report from a psychologist dealing with  the
    appellant's current medical condition.

 5. There was also evidence in the form of a statement from  the  appellant
    himself where he said, amongst other things,  in  paragraph  3  of  his
    statement

         "My daughter's mother-in-law was diagnosed with  dementia  recently
         and this is what made me visit my GP.  My GP informed me that as  I
         had not visited him for mental health issues  previously  he  would
         not have them on his record.  However, he wishes  to  now  make  me
         undergo certain tests and will then provide me with  a  report  and
         advise me on the necessary treatment."

    That was as far as the allegation of dementia went.

 6. The reports that were actually provided and which were before the judge
    did not suggest that the appellant was suffering  from  dementia.   For
    example, in a psychological assessment report provided on 18  May  2018
    Mr O'Doherty, who has amongst  other  things  a  diploma  in  cognitive
    behaviour therapy, said that the applicant described how he feels safer
    and less worried when he is here  with  family  in  the  UK.   He  also
    apparently experiences a degree of sadness and low mood when he  is  by
    himself in India.  His wife passed  away  in  2007  in  India  and  the
    applicant has felt additional loneliness since then.

 7. That was as far as the evidence  went.   The  judge  recorded  that  he
    suffered from anxiety.  That was a proper description of  the  evidence
    before him.

 8. The thrust of the submissions made before me this morning is  that  the
    judge erred in law when he failed to  adjourn  this  matter  to  enable
    further evidence to be provided.  The judge  recorded  in  paragraph  3
    that at the beginning of the hearing an application  was  made  for  an
    adjournment to enable a medical report to be prepared and presented:

         "I was told that his son had recently visited  the  appellant's  GP
         who said that there was nothing on their medical records  and  that
         tests could be carried out.  This was a statement dated 23 January.
          They said they were still waiting for a date for a consultation."

    On that basis the judge refused the application.

 9. The determination of the judge on that issue  was  a  perfectly  lawful
    one.  There had been opportunity since the  decision  was  made  on  14
    October  2018  to  present  medical  evidence.   Sine  the  appellant's
    representative  had  adduced  two  reports,  it  cannot  be  said   the
    representative was not aware of the need to obtain and present evidence
    supporting the claim.   The  appellant's  medical  condition  had  been
    considered by the decision-maker. The decision letter said at paragraph
    23:

         "You have claimed that you require monitoring day and  night  as  a
         result of your medical conditions.  You have provided reports  from
         an independent social  worker  and  a  psychologist  and  they  are
         inclined to believe you suffer from anxiety.  However, you have not
         provided any confirmation  from  the  NHS  regarding  this  medical
         condition or that you are receiving any treatment  in  the  UK  for
         this.  Furthermore, you have not  provided  any  NHS  documentation
         that you are receiving treatment for any  other  medical  condition
         anything confirming you require 24 hour care or anything confirming
         that you cannot travel."

10. That was an assessment that was made on the basis of the material  that
    was then provided.  It was not substantially different when the  matter
    came 2 ï¿½ months later  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  on  13
    January 2019.   The  Secretary  of  State's  misgivings  had  not  been
    addressed.  No adequate steps had been taken to pursue the matter  and,
    if it was to be the case that the appellant  was  not  relying  on  the
    psychologist's report or the social  worker's  report  then  one  would
    certainly have expected steps to have been taken  to  obtain  a  formal
    referral from a GP addressed to a specialist.  As it was, all the judge
    had before him was what the  appellant  said  in  paragraph  3  of  his
    statement and what the son said which is also summarised by  the  judge
    in paragraph 3 of the determination.

11. It was simply nowhere near sufficient to  establish  the  need  for  an
    adjournment.  That is the sole matter which is raised before me  as  to
    unfairness and a failure on the part of the judge to  provide  a  short
    adjournment.  My assessment of the situation is that there were  simply
    not the building blocks upon which the judge could make  the  inference
    that a referral was imminent; that a diagnosis of dementia was  a  real
    possibility and that steps had been taken so far to obtain the evidence
    in view of the hearing date which had been notified to  the  appellant.
    In those circumstances I take the view that the judge made no error  of
    law and accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

12. I will say at this stage that it is not the  end  of  the  matter.   If
    there comes a change of circumstances, then that may or  should  result
    in fresh medical evidence being produced  to  support  that  change  of
    circumstances.  If that change in circumstances is sufficient  to  meet
    the test in paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules, then it will be for
    the Secretary of State to consider  and  to  make  a  decision  in  the
    context of a paragraph 353 fresh claim.  At that  stage  the  appellant
    will have amassed the evidence that he has not provided so  far.   Only
    then will the Secretary of State be required to reconsider the matter.

13. I might add something as to the grant of permission that  was  made  in
    this case.

14. The appellant's representative asserted that  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant's health had deteriorated whilst he was here.  There  was  no
    evidence of a deterioration in the appellant's  health  whilst  he  was
    present in the United Kingdom.  Indeed, he had only been present in the
    United Kingdom for about six weeks when the application was made.  When
    it came to the decision of the judge, that situation had not materially
    altered.  The judge was left with the same  psychologist's  report  and
    social worker's report as was before the original decision-maker.

15. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  in  granting  permission  said  it  is
    arguable that factors capable of further evaluation remain  unevaluated
    to a sufficient degree for the proportionality  exercise  to  encompass
    consideration in such a way that the  correct  weight  is  attached  to
    factors bearing upon  the  outcome.   I  am  bound  to  say  I  do  not
    understand that sentence as identifying a material error  of  law.   It
    does not assist  me  in  understanding  what  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    considered to be an arguable error.

16. It was also said that the medical report was a  central  issue  in  the
    case.  It was not a central issue in the case  in  that  there  was  no
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant's health had
    deteriorated or was of  sufficient  complexity  to  require  additional
    medical evidence.  I am not, therefore, satisfied  that  the  grant  of
    permission identifies anything which amounts to a material error of law
    in the way the First-tier Tribunal Judge handled the application for an
    adjournment or the evidence that was before him.

DECISION

The grounds of appeal fail to disclose  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
determination of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  and  the  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
