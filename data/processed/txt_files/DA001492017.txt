                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge S.J. Clarke promulgated  on  11  December  2017
         allowing the appeal of Mr Stefanov "to a  limited  extent"  against
         the decision of the Secretary of State made on 27 February 2017  to
         make a deportation order in accordance with  reg.  27  of  the  EEA
         Regulations 2016. I shall refer to Mr Stefanov as  'the  appellant'
         as he was before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

      2. The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge  Clarke  on  20  November
         2017.  A  signed  deportation  order  had  been  made  against  the
         appellant on 27 February 2017. The appellant appealed  on  7  March
         2017  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to   make   a
         deportation order. That was a non-suspensive appeal in that it  was
         a decision made  under  the  EEA  Regulations.  The  appellant  was
         deported on 5 April 2017.

      3. The Supreme Court gave its decision in Kiarie and Byndloss (on  the
         application of) the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2017] UKSC 42 on 14 June 2017. Inevitably, the facts in  the  case
         of Mr Kiarie and Mr Byndloss  were  substantially  different.  More
         important still was the fact that the relevant  decisions  made  by
         the Secretary of State were to certify the  claims  pursuant  to  a
         power conferred upon her by s.94B of the  Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 which had been inserted into it by s.17 (3)  of
         the Immigration Act 2014 coming into force  on  30  November  2016.
         This provision provided the power, despite the appeals process  not
         having been begun or  not  having  been  exhausted,  to  remove  an
         appellant pending the outcome of his appeal provided it  would  not
         be unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 on  the  grounds
         that the appellant would not during the period of his appeal face a
         real risk of serious irreversible harm if removed.

      4. The Supreme Court was largely silent upon other methods of removing
         an appellant during the pendency of  his  appeal  in  circumstances
         other than pursuant to s.94B. In  particular,  given  the  discrete
         regime affecting EU citizens, particularly  those  who  are  to  be
         returned within the Union, statute has not provided  an  in-country
         right of appeal. Lord Wilson in his judgement made it plain that in
         deciding whether an out-of-country appeal against the refusal of  a
         human rights claim is incompatible with the procedural requirements
         of Article 8 was a fact sensitive question requiring four  specific
         questions to be addressed:

               i) The first question was whether the appellant would be able
                  to secure  legal  representation  which  might  have  been
                  available had the appellant remained in the United Kingdom
                  and whether the appellant is able to give instructions  to
                  his lawyer and receive advice.

              ii) The second question was whether on removal  the  appellant
                  was likely to experience  difficulties  in  obtaining  the
                  supporting  professional  evidence  crucial  in  achieving
                  success  on  appeal.  Such  professional  evidence   might
                  include probation or similar reports, forensic reports  as
                  to the level of risk on return and psychiatric evidence.

             iii) The third question concerned whether oral  evidence  would
                  provide the appellant with a greater prospect  of  success
                  and, if so, the fourth question, whether the use of modern
                  video facilities  would  provide  an  effective  means  of
                  providing oral evidence and participating from abroad.

      5.  These  questions  were  considered  by  Higginbotham   LJ   in   a
         comprehensive and detailed judgement refusing permission to  appeal
         against the dismissal of judicial review  applications  challenging
         s.94B certificates in R (Nixon and Anor.) v Secretary of State  for
         the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 3.

      6. All of these questions operate in the context of s.94B to the issue
         of whether there was a real risk of serious  irreversible  harm  if
         removed during the appeal process. That is not a consideration that
         arises under reg. 37(1)(d)  of  the  2016  Regulations  which  only
         permit out-of-country appeals where the decision is to  remove  the
         person from the United Kingdom is, in effect, a refusal to revoke a
         deportation  or  exclusion  order  made  against  the   individual.
         Although subsection (2) provides exceptions, they do not  apply  in
         the case of regulation 37(1)(d).

      7. These  considerations  are  essentially  concerned  with  fairness.
         However, as the Supreme Court made clear in paragraphs 65  and  66,
         the place where the issue of fairness was to be  addressed  was  in
         the appeal hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. It is there that
         the appellant is  able  to  raise  the  difficulties  that  he  has
         encountered with legal representation and  with  the  provision  of
         documents including expert evidence. It is also in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal that he can raise the issues upon which his  own  evidence
         is required and which cannot be properly provided by video link. It
         should, perhaps be pointed out that in many deportation appeals, it
         is not the impact that removal has upon the appellant which is key;
         he is, after all, the offender who may well be unable  to  complain
         that it is disproportionate to  remove  him  given  his  offending.
         Instead, it is usually the family members, often children, who will
         render separation disproportionate but who are, of course,  in  the
         United Kingdom.

      8. The problems faced by giving evidence from a fellow member  of  the
         EU are likely  to  be  significantly  less  than  from  some  other
         countries.

      9. The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  provide  an  adequate
         analysis of these considerations. Instead, the First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge concluded that it  was  a  requirement  that  the  respondent
         should provide a written  supplementary  letter  dealing  with  the
         certification point and its absence amounted to an  error  of  law.
         There is no basis for imposing that burden upon  the  Secretary  of
         State.

     10. Furthermore having found that the decision was unlawful, the  judge
         went on to say that the absence  of  an  invitation  given  to  the
         appellant to return to the United Kingdom  to  participate  in  his
         appeal hearing was also unlawful. He concluded that there could  be
         no remedy by adjourning the hearing because the appellant  had  not
         notified the Tribunal of his new address and his mother and partner
         did not attend the hearing. He therefore concluded that this was an
         error of law 'which is such that I allow the appeal  to  a  limited
         extent.'

     11. It is difficult to understand what is meant by the judge's decision
         to allow the appeal to this 'limited  extent'.  If  a  decision  is
         unlawful, it is for the First-tier Tribunal to substitute a  lawful
         decision. It is only in the limited circumstances where there is  a
         discretion vested in the  Secretary  of  State  that  can  only  be
         exercised by the Secretary of State (and which  the  Tribunal  does
         not itself possess) that a decision is 'remitted' to the  Secretary
         of State to enable her to make a fresh and lawful decision pursuant
         to her own, sole, discretionary powers. See generally Abdi  v  SSHD
         [1996] Imm AR 148 (CA).

     12. However, in the present case, it is clear that the system  was  not
         unlawful.

     13. I have read and considered the decision letter made by an  official
         on behalf of the Secretary of State dated  27  February  2017.  The
         appellant claims to have entered the United  Kingdom  on  5  August
         2014. He provided no evidence to substantiate  his  claim  but,  of
         course, Union citizens are not required to seek entry clearance  or
         to obtain evidence of entry. The decision-maker then deals with the
         appellant's criminal history  in  2015  culminating  in  his  being
         sentenced on two counts of burglary for which he was sentenced to a
         total period of imprisonment of 45  months  (3�  years),  being  30
         months and 15 months consecutively.

     14. The decision-maker, surprisingly, having concluded that  there  was
         no evidence before him that  the  appellant  had  exercised  Treaty
         rights, did not simply conclude that the appellant was  liable  for
         removal simply because he was not  a  qualified  person  exercising
         Treaty rights in the United  Kingdom.  He  could  not,  of  course,
         establish that he had  acquired  a  permanent  right  of  residence
         because the length of his time in the United Kingdom was too short.
         The decision-maker then went on to deal with the sentencing remarks
         in which he commented on the fact that he had stolen property to  a
         value of �5,000 including a wedding ring and an engagement ring  (a
         factor to which the judge attached 'great importance'). None of the
         property had been recovered  and  the  appellant  himself  had  not
         assisted in the process.

     15. The decision maker went on to say that the appellant was  34  years
         of old age and there were no  medical  issues  raised  by  him.  He
         provided no evidence of any rehabilitative work  conducted  by  him
         whilst in prison. He provided  no  evidence  of  being  engaged  in
         regular or lawful employment. He had no family  members  living  in
         the United Kingdom. The decision-maker noted in paragraph  47  that
         the appellant claimed to have a  partner  residing  in  the  United
         Kingdom but the material about his partner was limited to a comment
         that his partner was unlikely to provide him with  any  support  to
         reduce the risk of re-offending since he had not  done  so  in  the
         past.

     16. This summary  of  the  material  that  was  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge raised no arguable case that the decision-making was
         flawed. The appellant enjoyed no protection under  the  Regulations
         but, if he did, it was the lowest level of protection confined,  in
         essence, to whether it was proportionate to remove  him  which,  of
         course, it was.

     17. The appellant was removed on 5 April 2017.

     18. On 27 February 2017, however, the Secretary of State wrote  to  the
         appellant  in  prison  setting  out  her  reasons  for   making   a
         deportation order and inviting the appellant to signify whether  if
         he did not wish to raise any objections to his deportation, he  was
         free to sign the attached disclaimer. More importantly, on 14 March
         2017 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant, once again in prison,  in
         these terms:

             '... You can be removed from the United  Kingdom  before  your
             appeal has been finally determined.

             If this is the case you will have to continue with your appeal
             after you have left the United Kingdom and as a result of  the
             address the Tribunal currently uses  to  correspond  with  you
             will need to be updated.

             If you wish to continue with your appeal  you  should  provide
             the Tribunal with your new address within 28 days  of  removal
             from the UK. If you do not do so your appeal  may  be  decided
             without a hearing on the basis of the papers currently  before
             the Tribunal.'

     19. This letter was sent  some  three  weeks  before  his  removal  and
         provided the appellant with a sufficient opportunity to put him  on
         notice that, if he wished to pursue his appeal, he had  to  provide
         an address by which he might be contacted.  He  failed  to  do  so.
         Accordingly he precluded himself from participating in his  out-of-
         country appeal.

     20. In paragraph 10 of the determination, the First-tier Tribunal Judge
         noted that his mother and partner did not attend the hearing.

     21. By a direction made by a judge of the Upper  Tribunal,  an  attempt
         was made to serve the appellant at his former address with a notice
         of hearing, this being the only means by  which,  if  he  had  been
         living with a partner or his mother, he might be contacted. No  one
         has attended in response, assuming that address would operate as  a
         means of re-opening contact.

     22. This was the situation as it was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge.

     23. The decision made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge served no useful
         purpose. Allowing the appeal to 'a limited extent', created a state
         of legal limbo which was not justified. It was for the appellant to
         satisfy the Tribunal that his removal would be a violation  of  his
         human rights, assuming there was a human rights appeal. He did  not
         do so. Accordingly, there could have been only one lawful result to
         the appeal. It was open to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  reach  a
         decision  to  deport  the  appellant  because   of   his   criminal
         misconduct. There was little or no evidence of a private or  family
         life, far less of a  private  and  family  life  that  engaged  the
         Convention given his history of criminal wrongdoing and the limited
         time in which  he  had  remained  in  the  United  Kingdom  without
         establishing that he was exercising Treaty rights or otherwise  had
         a right to remain. All this was known to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge.

     24. Even if the appellant's position should be equated with one who was
         the subject of a certification under s.94B, the four-stage  process
         outlined in Kiarie and Byndloss does not reveal that the system had
         operated unfairly in the specific circumstances of the  appellant's
         case, given the  fact  that  such  cases  are  fact-sensitive.  The
         appellant had not sought legal aid in the United  Kingdom  and  did
         not complain of the lack of it. Since he failed to  participate  in
         the appeal process by leaving an address in the United  Kingdom  or
         elsewhere at which he might be contacted and that his relatives  in
         the United Kingdom have not sought to raise his case,  his  ability
         to provide adequate instructions to lawyers in the  United  Kingdom
         is academic. Nothing was raised by the appellant in  the  material,
         he supplied to the Secretary of State to suggest that he wished  to
         obtain, or was in a  position  to  obtain,  documentary  or  expert
         evidence as to the issues before the Tribunal. Whilst  we  have  no
         evidence that it would have been impossible to provide evidence  by
         video link from Bulgaria, this is also academic since the appellant
         rendered effective participation in the appeal process impossible.

     25. For these reasons, I set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge as containing an error of law. I allow the appeal of
         the Secretary of State.  I  re-make  the  decision  dismissing  the
         appeal of Mr Stefanov on all the grounds advanced.

    DECISION

               i) I allow the appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
                  determination of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  discloses
                  an error of law.

              ii) I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

             iii) I re-make the decision dismissing the  appellant's  appeal
                  against the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  make  a
                  deportation order as the  decision  does  not  violate  Mr
                  Stefanov's human rights.

              iv) I dismiss the  appeal  of  Mr  Stefanov  on  human  rights
                  grounds and on the grounds advanced.
