|The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of State and the respondent is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on 15 May 1974. I shall       | |
|however for the sake of convenience refer to the Secretary of State as the appellant and Ms Tumare as the respondent which other      | |
|designations that they had before the First-Tier Tribunal.                                                                            | |
|The appellant appealed against the decision of the respondent to refuse to issue her with a right of residence as a family member of  | |
|an EEA national in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations"). First-tier     | |
|Tribunal Judge Britton allowed the appellant's appeal. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Clayton who said | |
|that it is arguable that the Judge erred in law by placing too much weight on documentary evidence alone in finding that the appellant| |
|and her Irish EEA national partner were in a subsisting relationship.                                                                 | |
|Thus the appeal came before me.                                                                                                       | |
|In a letter dated 27 August 2014 the appellant's representatives Danielle Cohen Solicitors stated that on 12 August 2014 the appellant| |
|"outlined her intention not to pursue the appeal in the Upper Tribunal and she no longer wishes to contest the decision of the        | |
|Secretary of State. The client also stated her intention to discuss the matter further in a scheduled meeting in their office on      | |
|Thursday, 21 August 2014. However, Ms Tumbare never attended the meeting and she has been unreachable ever since." The Solicitor      | |
|further stated that they will not attend court on Friday, 29 August 2014 unless they receive instructions from their client before the| |
|hearing date.                                                                                                                         | |
|The appellant did not appear for the hearing and as the appellant has not specifically withdraw her appeal, I proceeded to hear       | |
|submissions from the Senior Presenting Officer.                                                                                       | |
|The Judge's findings in his determination promulgated on 16 June 2014 states the following.                                           | |
|The appellant has produced Council tax Bill's addressed to both the appellant and her sponsor and a letter addressed to the appellant | |
|from MKCC at the same address.                                                                                                        | |
|The appellant's bundle of documents of 245 pages contains evidence that the appellant's sponsor is a self-employed carpenter. There is| |
|evidence from the company accountants in relation to his tax returns and income from his property. The sponsor's bank statements show | |
|money paid into the account from work carried out by him. On the evidence Judge was satisfied that the appellant and her sponsor have | |
|been living together since 2008.                                                                                                      | |
|The Judge is satisfied that the appellant's sponsor is exercising EEA rights and the appellant is entitled to a residence permit as   | |
|his EEA family member.                                                                                                                | |
|The Judge allowed the appeal.                                                                                                         | |
|                                                                                                                                      | |
|The grounds of appeal                                                                                                                 | |
|The respondent's grounds of appeal state the following which I summarise. The   Judge did not take into account that the appellant    | |
|having been issued with IAS 15A notice to leave the country did not do so and it was not until 22 May 2013 that she made an           | |
|application pursuant to the 2006 Regulations notwithstanding her claim that she has been in a relationship with her EEA national since| |
|2008. The Judge found it surprising that the EEA national did not attend the hearing as he claimed to have work commitments. The      | |
|Judge's findings as to there is a durable relationship between the appellant and entry sponsor is manifestly inadequate. The          | |
|determination does not in any way you look at the appeal in line with the case of R (Iran) &Ors v Secretary of State for the home     | |
|Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982 where it was said that it is incumbent on the Judge to explain why he reached the decision he did.     | |
|The Judge relied on documentary evidence alone even though the appellants partner was according to the Judge surprisingly not present.| |
|The appellant's immigration history had considerable problems including being an over stayer for many years and not making an         | |
|application for a residence card for at least five years after the start of her purported durable relationship. The Judge clearly     | |
|misunderstood the requirements pursuant to regulation 8 (5) of the 2006 Regulations.                                                  | |
|The Judge fell into error when he found that the appellant is entitled to a residence card as an EEA family member. The case of YB    | |
|(EEA reg 17 (4), proper approach) Ivory Coast [2008] UK AIT 00062 to which the Judge made no reference, states that Immigration Rule  | |
|295D acts as a rule of thumb in the context of durable relationships.                                                                 | |
|The Judge similarly erred in law when finding that the appellant is entitled to a residence card because YB makes it plain that if the| |
|Secretary of State has not purported to exercise their discretion in regulation 17 (4), that cannot be exercised by the Judge as a    | |
|primary decision maker. The most the Judge could have done, had this finding be lawful and allow the appeal on the bases that the     | |
|decision was not in accordance with the law and send it to the Secretary of State awaiting the lawful decision.                       | |
|At the hearing I heard submissions from the senior presenting officer relied on the grounds of appeal and said that the determination | |
|lacks reasoning. He added that living together does not necessarily mean a durable relationship and that this brought The Judge into  | |
|material error and invited me to allow the appeal.                                                                                    | |
|Decision on error of law                                                                                                              | |
|The Judge in his findings at paragraph 12 to 17 found that he was satisfied on the evidence that the appellant's sponsor is a         | |
|qualified person in the United Kingdom. This finding was primarily based on the documentary evidence provided. The appellant sponsor  | |
|did not attend the hearing on the basis that he had work commitments.                                                                 | |
|The Judge having expressed surprise that the appellant sponsor did not attend the hearing, however accepted the appellant's           | |
|explanation that he had work commitments. The Judge did not take into account the appellant's adverse immigration history in that she | |
|was an over stayer and only applied for a residence card five years after the start of her purported durable relationship.            | |
|                                                                                                                                      | |
|The Judge placed too much reliance on the documentary evidence in his finding that the appellant and her sponsor are in durable       | |
|relationship. He did not follow the correct approach is set out in YB that Immigration Rule 295D acts as a rule of thumb in the       | |
|context of durable relationships. The reasoning in the determination is manifestly inadequate.                                        | |
|Furthermore, at paragraph 6 the Judge stated that the appellant in her application form stated she was married to her sponsor yet the | |
|appellant's evidence at the hearing was that she is an unmarried partner.                                                             | |
|In all the circumstances, I find that the Judge fell into material error and therefore I set aside his determination. Furthermore, at | |
|paragraph 6 the Judge stated that the appellant in her application form stated she was married to her sponsor yet the appellant's     | |
|evidence at the hearing was that she is an unmarried partner.                                                                         | |
|Conclusions                                                                                                                           | |
|                                                                                                                                      | |
|Accordingly I find an error of law in the determination and allow the Secretary of State's appeal.                                    | |
|Decision                                                                                                                              | |
