For the Appellant:     Mr P Armstrong, Senior Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    Ms S Iqbal, of Counsel.


                           DECISION AND Directions

 1. The Secretary of State has been granted permission to appeal against  a
    decision  of  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Seelhoff  who,
    following a hearing on 14 November 2016, allowed the appeal of  Analiza
    Vicente Azuero (hereafter the "claimant") against  a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State of 21 April 2015 to  refuse  her  application  of  5
    March 2015 for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  civil
    partner of a Ms Anabel  Alipio  Martin  (hereafter  the  "sponsor"),  a
    British citizen. The judge allowed the appeal under Article  8  outside
    the Immigration Rules (hereafter the "Rules").

 2. The claimant is a female  national  of  the  Philippines,  born  on  27
    February 1978. She arrived in the United Kingdom on 17  September  2009
    with leave until  24  January  2010  as  a  domestic  worker.  She  was
    subsequently granted a further five periods of leave  to  remain  as  a
    domestic worker until 30 May 2015.



Immigration history

 3. The claimant first came to the United Kingdom  as  a  domestic  migrant
    worker  on  17  September  2009.  She  was  subsequently  granted  five
    extensions of leave to remain  as  a  domestic  worker  with  the  last
    expiring on 30 May 2015. On 5 March 2015,  she  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as the civil partner of the sponsor.  This  is  the  application
    that was the subject of the decision of 21 April 2015.

The Secretary of State's decision:

 4. The claimant's application was refused under the 5-year  partner  route
    under the Rules for the following reasons:

    i)       The  claimant  had  not  submitted  evidence  that  her  civil
        partnership was valid. She had submitted a certificate stating that
        she and the sponsor  had  celebrated  and  registered  their  civil
        partnership at Hackney Town Hall but  she  had  not  submitted  the
        official civil partnership certificate.

    ii)     She had not submitted the specified evidence to  establish  the
        sponsor's income. She had only provided payslips  for  the  sponsor
        dated between September 2014 and February 2015 and bank  statements
        dated between October 2014 and January 2015.

    iii)    She was required to submit, but had failed to submit, specified
        evidence that she had passed an English language test  in  speaking
        and listening at a minimum of  level  A1  of  the  Common  European
        Framework of Reference for Languages with an approved provider. The
        claimant had submitted a Trinity Entry Level  certificate  in  ESOL
        International dated November 2012. However, Trinity  qualifications
        were only valid for a period of 2 years for immigration purposes.

 5. The claimant's application was refused under the 10-year partner  route
    under the Rules because EX.1. of Appendix FM did not  apply.  This  was
    because the Secretary of State had not seen  any  evidence  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  being  enjoyed  in  the
    Philippines.

 6. The application was also refused under  para  276ADE(1)  of  the  Rules
    because the claimant had not provided evidence to show that there  were
    very significant obstacles to her reintegration in the Philippines  for
    the  purposes  of  276ADE(1)(vi)  and  para  276ADE(1)(iii)  and   para
    276ADE(1)(iv) did not apply.

 7. The Secretary of State considered that the claimant had not raised  any
    exceptional circumstances for  the  grant  of  leave  under  Article  8
    outside the Rules.

The judge's decision

 8. The claimant submitted a bundle of documents for her appeal before  the
    judge. At para 12 of his decision, the judge said  that  this  evidence
    was reviewed at the start of the hearing, that it was agreed  that  the
    mandatory documents in  terms  of  income  and  the  civil  partnership
    certificate had been submitted and that it was open to him (the  judge)
    to admit and consider those documents. The parties  agreed  before  the
    judge that the sole outstanding issue in terms of compliance  with  the
    Rules was the fact  that  the  claimant's  English  language  test  had
    expired before she had made her application and that she had  not  been
    able to sit another one.

 9. At para 12, the judge also said he accepted on the  basis  of  his  own
    personal experiences as a lawyer in practice that it was  not  possible
    for the claimant to sit another English test as her passport  was  held
    by the Home Office and because the original and  not  a  copy  must  be
    produced at a test centre.

10. As stated above, the judge had a witness statement from the claimant in
    which she explained that she had not realised that the English language
    certificate was only valid for two years because  there  is  no  expiry
    date listed on the certificate. She said that she  had  tried  to  take
    another English test since the refusal but that she cannot take a  test
    without an original passport or identity card.

11. As stated above, the judge allowed the claimant's appeal under  Article
    8 outside the  Rules.  In  reaching  his  decision  on  proportionality
    outside the Rules, he found, in relation to EX.1 of Appendix FM of  the
    Rules, that it was "appropriate and  proportionate  to  find  that  the
    requirements of  EX  .1  are  met  in  that  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in the Philippines on a  comparable
    footing to what is currently enjoyed in the UK". He said  that  "moving
    to the Philippines would represent a significant  interference  in  the
    legal rights  of  the  [claimant's]  British  sponsor"  and  that  "the
    [Secretary of State] should  have  allowed  the  application  on  human
    rights grounds" (para 22). Accordingly, he said that he considered that
    "it was appropriate and proportionate to  allow  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds" (para 24).

12. The judge gave his reasons for his decision at paras  16  to  24  which
    read as follows:


            Findings


        "16.     It is accepted that the [claimant] and her partner are  in
            a  genuine  relationship  and  that  they  meet  the  financial
            requirements under the Immigration Rules. The [claimant] has  a
            good immigration history in that she has lived in  the  UK  for
            nearly 7 years  now  with  no  suggestion  that  she  has  ever
            breached the Immigration Rules. The [claimant] has been in  the
            UK as a migrant domestic worker which is a Visa route  that  is
            designed to lead to settlement  but  I  note  that  it  is  not
            suggested that she met the requirements for settlement in  that
            capacity.


        17.       The  [claimant's]  partner  is  a  British  national  and
            together the couple earn approximately �50,000 a year which  is
            well in excess of the amount  required  under  the  Immigration
            Rules.  All  evidence  specified  under  Appendix-FM   of   the
            Immigration Rules in respect of the Sponsor's income  has  been
            provided.


        18.      The sole reason for which the application  fails  is  that
            the [claimant] does not hold a valid English certificate. It is
            accepted  that  the  [claimant]   has   previously   passed   a
            qualification  which  met  the  required  standard   but   that
            certificate is deemed to have expired before  this  application
            was made. I note that the Trinity language certificate it  does
            not contain an expiry date on the certificate itself  and  that
            it is perhaps easy to understand how the  [claimant]  made  the
            mistake she did.


        19.      I have  considered  the  question  of  whether  there  are
            significant  obstacles  to  the  [claimant]  and  her   partner
            enjoying family life in the Philippines. Civil partnerships and
            marriages between persons of the same gender are not recognised
            in the Philippines  and  there  is  some  documentary  evidence
            before me to suggest that there is discrimination against those
            who are LGBT. I feel able to find that the [claimant]  and  her
            partner would not be able to enjoy the  same  level  of  family
            life in the Philippines on account of the relationship  between
            them having no legal status and certainly having  significantly
            less rights associated with it than the couple currently  enjoy
            in the UK through their civil partnership.


        20.       In  assessing  whether  the  legal  obstacles   represent
            insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in  the
            Philippines  I  have  taken   account   of   the   [claimant's]
            immigration history and all the factors set out in section 117B
            of the 2002 Nationality Immigration and Asylum act. Whilst  the
            [claimant] has never met the requirements for  settlement,  but
            for an oversight in respect  of  the  English  certificate  she
            would meet the  requirements  of  the  rules  for  leave  under
            appendix  FM  even  without  relying  on  Ex  .1.  In  all  the
            circumstances I consider that the [claimant]  and  her  partner
            are entitled to have some weight attached to their private  and
            family life even taking  into  account  section  117B  and  the
            comments on family life in  Rajendran  (s117B  -  family  life)
            [2016] UKUT 00138 (IAC).


        21.      I have considered whether it is reasonable to  expect  the
            [claimant] to return to the Philippines  and  apply  for  entry
            clearance. I do consider that  the  [claimant]  would  probably
            only be out of the UK for 3 to 4 months  whilst  she  submitted
            her application to return. I do not consider it likely that the
            [claimant] would have any problems in meeting the  requirements
            of appendix FM and returning to the UK however I do  note  that
            we are talking about asking the [claimant] to pay Visa fees and
            travel costs which are likely to total in excess  of  �3000  in
            order to make this further application.


        22.      In all the circumstances of this case  I  do  consider  it
            appropriate and proportionate to find that the requirements  of
            EX .1 are met in that there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
            family life continuing  in  the  Philippines  on  a  comparable
            footing to what is currently enjoyed in the  UK.  I  note  that
            moving  to  the  Philippines  would  represent  a   significant
            interference in the legal rights of  the  [claimant's]  British
            sponsor. In these circumstances I find that the [claimant]  and
            her  partner  do  meet  the  requirements  of  EX  .1  of   the
            Immigration Rules which means that  I  am  satisfied  that  the
            Respondent ought to  have  allowed  the  application  on  human
            rights grounds.


        23.      I note that because the application was lodged in May 2013
            it is subject to the new provisions in respect of  appeals  and
            the current version of  section  82  of  the  2002  Nationality
            Immigration and Asylum Act, I can only allow an  appeal  in  so
            far as I find that the decision is not  compatible  with  human
            rights. I have taken account of  a  number  of  tribunal  cases
            including the case of Mustafa to which  I  was  referred  which
            reminds me that whilst demonstrating that the  requirements  of
            the rules are met is not determinative of an article  8  appeal
            it is a weighty factor to take into account.


        24.      The right to an appeal on human rights  grounds  makes  no
            sense if it is not open to the  tribunal  to  allow  an  appeal
            where  an  [claimant]  can  demonstrate  that  they  meet   the
            requirements of the rules in a category which is deemed to be a
            human rights category. It is important to note  that  the  full
            title of the Visa route in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
            is "family life as a partner". Further I note that appendix  AR
            of the  Immigration  Rules  confirms  that  applications  under
            Appendix FM are deemed to be human rights applications. In  the
            circumstances of this case and in light of the fact that  there
            are significant obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in  the
            Philippines I find that it is appropriate and proportionate  to
            allow the appeal on human rights grounds."

The Secretary of State's grounds and submissions

13. The Secretary of State's written grounds of appeal raise  two  grounds,
    i.e. grounds 1 and 2 below. At the hearing, Mr  Armstrong  applied  for
    permission to rely upon two further grounds (grounds 3 and 4). Ms Iqbal
    did not object. I granted permission. I raised two  points  of  my  own
    which, given my conclusions on grounds 1 and  2,  I  did  not  find  it
    necessary to consider.

14.  I  therefore  summarise  the  issues  and  the  Secretary  of  State's
    submissions as follows:

    i)      (Ground 1)  The  judge  failed  to  apply  the  high  threshold
        applicable in deciding whether there are  insurmountable  obstacles
        to family life  being  enjoyed  in  the  Philippines.   The  phrase
        "comparable footing" in para 22 of the judge's decision shows  that
        the judge applied the wrong threshold. Reliance is placed on  paras
        20-24 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R (Agyarko) v  SSHD
        EWCA Civ 440, which read:


      "21.  The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in this  paragraph
            of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an
            applicant for leave to remain under  the  Rules.  The  test  is
            significantly more demanding than a mere  test  of  whether  it
            would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family
            life outside the United Kingdom.

      22    This interpretation is in  line  with  the  relevant  Strasbourg
            jurisprudence. The phrase "insurmountable  obstacles"  has  its
            origin  in  the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence   in   relation   to
            immigration cases in a family context, where it is mentioned as
            one factor among others to be taken into account in determining
            whether any right under Article 8 exists for family members  to
            be granted leave to remain or  leave  to  enter  a  Contracting
            State: see e.g. Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v  Netherlands
            (2007)  44  EHRR  34,  para.  [39]  ("...  whether  there   are
            insurmountable obstacles  in  the  way  of  the  family  living
            together in the country of origin of one or more of them ...").
            The phrase as used in the Rules is intended to  have  the  same
            meaning as in the Strasbourg jurisprudence. It  is  clear  that
            the ECtHR regards it as a formulation imposing a stringent test
            in respect of that factor, as  is  illustrated  by  Jeunesse  v
            Netherlands (see para.  [117]:  there  were  no  insurmountable
            obstacles to the family settling in Suriname, even  though  the
            applicant and her family would experience hardship if forced to
            do so).

       23.    For  clarity,  two   points   should   be   made   about   the
            "insurmountable  obstacles"  criterion.  First,   although   it
            involves a stringent test, it is obviously intended in both the
            case-law and the Rules to be  interpreted  in  a  sensible  and
            practical rather than a purely literal way: see, e.g., the  way
            in  which  the  Grand  Chamber  approached  that  criterion  in
            Jeunesse v Netherlands at para. [117]; also the observation  by
            this court in MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
            Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192; [2014]  1  WLR  544,  at  [49]
            (although it should be noted that the passage in  the  judgment
            of the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu v Secretary of  State  for  the
            Home Department  [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC); [2013] Imm AR 453  there
            referred to, at paras. [53]-[59], was making a rather different
            point, namely that explained in para. [24] below regarding  the
            significance of the criterion in the context of  an  Article  8
            assessment).

      24.   Secondly, the "insurmountable obstacles" criterion  is  used  in
            the Rules to define one of the preconditions set out in section
            EX.1(b) which need to be  satisfied  before  an  applicant  can
            claim to be entitled to be granted leave to  remain  under  the
            Rules. In that context, it is not simply a factor to  be  taken
            into account. However, in the context of making a wider Article
            8 assessment outside the Rules, it is a factor to be taken into
            account, not an absolute requirement which has to be  satisfied
            in every single case across the whole range of cases covered by
            Article 8: see paras. [29]-[30] below."

    ii)     (Ground 2) The judge erred in his approach in his consideration
        of whether there were insurmountable obstacles. Instead of reaching
        a finding on whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  family
        life being enjoyed in the Philippines and then taking that  finding
        into account when assessing proportionality outside the  Rules,  he
        decided the issue  of  insurmountable  obstacles  as  part  of  the
        proportionality balancing exercise.

    iii)    (Ground 3) At para 21, the judge erred by speculating  when  he
        said that, if the claimant were to return  to  the  Philippines  to
        make an entry clearance application, she would only be out  of  the
        United Kingdom for 3 to 4 months. There was no evidence before  the
        judge to this  effect.  In  fact,  the  evidence  (obtained  by  Mr
        Armstrong post-hearing) is that all applications are decided within
        60 days and may take less time. Mr  Armstrong  submitted  that  any
        separation would be for a short period in any event.

    iv)     (Ground 4) In reliance upon R (Chen) v SSHD [2015]  UKUT  00189
        (IAC), Mr Armstrong submitted  that  the  judge  did  not  properly
        assess whether it would be disproportionate to expect the  claimant
        to make an entry  clearance  application.  There  was  no  evidence
        before the judge, as Ms Iqbal confirmed, of  the  impact  upon  the
        claimant and the sponsor  of  temporary  separation.  Mr  Armstrong
        submitted that, given the short duration  of  any  separation,  any
        discrimination in the Philippines of limited significance.

The claimant's Reply and submissions

15. In the claimant's Reply lodged under rule 24 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the "UT  Rules"),  it  is  submitted  that
    ground 1 overlooks the fact that the judge  considered  proportionality
    outside the Rules and he was therefore entitled to  take  into  account
    all relevant factors on the issue of  proportionality.  He  found  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  in  the
    Philippines "on a comparable footing". Ms Iqbal submitted that this was
    a summary of the judge's earlier assessment and therefore the judge had
    not applied too low a threshold.

16. Ms Iqbal submitted that the judge reached  his  view  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  on  a  "comparable
    footing" because he had background material before him that showed that
    there was discrimination against members of the LGBT community  in  the
    Philippines when compared with heterosexual married  couples.  He  took
    into account the fact that the sponsor was a British citizen and  found
    that there would be significant interference in her legal rights.

17. Ms Iqbal submitted that the judge  took  into  account  other  relevant
    factors in the balancing exercise outside the Rules, as follows:

    i)      The claimant and the sponsor were in a genuine relationship.

    ii)     The judge applied s.117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002. In applying s.117B, the judge  took  into  account
        Rajendran [2016] UKUT 00138 (IAC) and found that the  claimant  and
        the sponsor were entitled to have some  weight  attached  to  their
        private and family life.

    iii)    The claimant met the financial  requirements  under  the  Rules
        because the joint earnings of the claimant  and  the  sponsor  were
        approximately �50,000. The claimant had  provided  at  the  hearing
        specified evidence to establish the sponsor's income.

    iv)     The claimant had a good immigration history. She had  lived  in
        the United Kingdom for 7 years with no breach of the Rules.

    v)      Although the claimant's English language test  certificate  had
        expired, it did not  contain  any  expiry  date.  As  a  lawyer  in
        practice, the judge considered that it was  not  possible  for  the
        claimant to sit another English language test as her  passport  was
        held by the Home Office and the original was required at  the  test
        centre.

18. Ms Iqbal considered the above factors and said at para 18 that the sole
    reason for which the claimant's application failed was that she did not
    hold a valid English language test certificate. He  said  that  it  was
    easy to see how the claimant made the mistake she made given  that  the
    Trinity language certificate did not contain  an  expiry  date  on  the
    certificate itself and that she could not obtain  an  English  language
    test certificate because the Home Office held her passport.

19. Ms Iqbal submitted that the judge took into account that  the  claimant
    could have satisfied the requirements for leave to remain under the  5-
    year route but for the fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State  held  her
    passport. The judge took into account that the claimant  satisfied  the
    requirements for leave to remain under the 10-year route because  there
    were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing   "on   a
    comparable footing" to what is currently enjoyed. He took into  account
    the cost of the claimant returning to the  Philippines  and  making  an
    entry clearance application.

20. Ms Iqbal submitted that the judge's  decision  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision was not proportionate was reasonably open to him.

Assessment

21. There was no dispute before the  judge  that  the  claimant  could  not
    satisfy the requirements for leave to remain  as  the  partner  of  the
    sponsor under the 5-year route as she did not have the required English
    Language  test  certificate.  This  was  because  the  certificate  she
    submitted had expired. It was not disputed  that  the  certificate  she
    submitted was only valid for  a  period  of  2  years  for  immigration
    purposes.

22. Accordingly, the claimant had to rely upon EX.1 of Appendix FM and,  if
    she failed to satisfy EX.1., she had to rely upon an assessment of  her
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules.   EX.1  and  Ex.2.  of  Appendix  FM
    provide as follows:

        EX.1. This paragraph applies if
        (a)      ...

            (b)  the applicant has a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
           with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
           settled  in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave   or
           humanitarian protection, and there are insurmountable  obstacles
           to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.

        EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
        obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
        faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
        life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
        would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
        partner.

23. In R (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11, the Supreme Court held  that  the
    phrase "insurmountable obstacles" and the definition of "insurmountable
    obstacles" in Ex.2 were consistent with Strasburg jurisprudence  (paras
    43 and 44). It is a stringent test. The European  Courts  intended  the
    words "insurmountable obstacles" to be understood in  a  practical  and
    realistic sense, rather than as referring to obstacles  which  make  it
    literally impossible for the family to live to in the  country  of  the
    non-national concerned (para 43 of the judgment).

24. At para 43, Lord Reed referred, by way of  example,  to  the  facts  in
    Jeunesse v Netherlands (application no. 12738/10) (2015) 60 EHRR 17. In
    that case, the European Court of Human Rights held that there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the relocation of the family  to  Suriname,
    although the children, the eldest of whom was at secondary school, were
    Dutch nationals who had lived there  all  of  their  lives,  had  never
    visited Suriname, and would experience a degree of hardship  if  forced
    to move and the applicant's partner was in full-time employment in  the
    Netherlands. This example serves as a reminder of  the  high  threshold
    for a finding that there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
    continuing in the country of the non-national.

25. It is necessary to apply the high threshold so as to  ensure  that  due
    weight is given to the Secretary of State's policy  on  immigration  as
    expressed in the Rules and approved by Parliament.

26. In a case in which reliance  is  placed  upon  EX.1.  and  there  being
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside  the  United
    Kingdom, the correct approach was explained by Lord Reed at para 48  of
    the Supreme Court's judgment in Agyarko as follows:


        "48      ... If the applicant or his or her partner would face very
            significant  difficulties  in  continuing  their  family   life
            together outside the UK, which could not be overcome  or  would
            entail  very  serious  hardship,   then   the   "insurmountable
            obstacles" test will be met, and leave will  be  granted  under
            the Rules. If that test is not met,  but  the  refusal  of  the
            application would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences,
            such that refusal would not be proportionate, then  leave  will
            be granted outside the  Rules  on  the  basis  that  there  are
            "exceptional circumstances...."

27. Plainly, the judge had to make a clear finding as  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life between the  claimant  and  the
    sponsor continuing in the Philippines, applying the  correct  threshold
    and, if not, consider whether there  were  "exceptional  circumstances"
    i.e.  whether  the  refusal  of  the  application   would   result   in
    unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  such  that  refusal  would  not  be
    proportionate.

28. There were therefore two stages that the judge was  obliged  to  adopt.
    First, he had to consider the position under  EX.1  and  Ex.2  and,  if
    there were no insurmountable obstacles, consider the  position  outside
    the Rules. This is the subject of ground 2.

29. Ms Iqbal did not address me specifically on ground 2. I have  carefully
    considered the reasoning of the judge at para 16 onwards. It is  plain,
    in my judgment, that he conflated his assessment of whether there  were
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  being   enjoyed   in   the
    Philippines with the balancing exercise in relation to  proportionality
    outside the Rules. This is particularly  clear  from  his  use  of  the
    phrase "appropriate and proportionate" in the first sentence of para 22
    of his decision and the last sentence of para 24, phrases which he used
    in  conjunction  with  "insurmountable  obstacles"  at  para   22   and
    "significant obstacles to family life" at para 24.

30. However, it is also clear from the following:

    i)      At para 16, the judge took into account that the  claimant  and
        the sponsor are in a genuine relationship. However, the  fact  that
        they are in a genuine relationship tells us nothing  about  whether
        they will experience insurmountable obstacles to their enjoyment of
        family life in the Philippines.

    ii)     Likewise, the  fact  that  the  claimant  meets  the  financial
        requirements under the Rules tell us nothing about whether she  and
        the  sponsor  will  experience  insurmountable  obstacles  in   the
        Philippines.

    iii)    The same can be said of the fact that the judge  considered  it
        understandable that the  claimant  overlooked  the  fact  that  her
        English language test certificate had expired and that  it  is  not
        possible for her to  sit  another  English  language  test  as  her
        passport is being held by the Home Office.

    iv)     The possibility of  the  claimant  making  an  entry  clearance
        application is not relevant to the issue of whether there  will  be
        insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  being  enjoyed  in  the
        Philippines.

31.  The  factors  mentioned  above  are  relevant  to  an  assessment   of
    proportionality outside the Rules but not relevant to an assessment  of
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed
    in the Philippines.  The judge's consideration of these matters and his
    use of the phrase "appropriate and proportionate" in the first sentence
    of para 22 of his decision and the last sentence of para 24, show  that
    he conflated the balancing exercise outside the  Rules  with  a  proper
    consideration of whether there are insurmountable obstacles under EX.1.



32. I have therefore concluded that ground 2 is established  and  that  the
    judge did  err  in  law  by  conflating  the  issue  of  insurmountable
    obstacles under EX.1 with the balancing exercise outside the Rules.

33. I turn to consider ground  1,  that  the  judge  failed  to  apply  the
    applicable high threshold in his consideration of  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles.

34. Ms Iqbal took me to page 127 of the claimant's bundle  which  concerned
    the situation for LGBTs in the Philippines  I have  considered  all  of
    the documents at pages 125-130 of the claimant's bundle.  Whilst  there
    is some evidence of some killings of members of the LGBT community, the
    documents also mention that the Philippines is one of the most tolerant
    countries in Southeast Asia when it  comes  to  LGBT  issues  and  that
    "(t)here is high tolerance [in the Philippines], there's not [sic] real
    acceptance".

35. In my judgment, on the basis of these documents, the judge was  correct
    to find that there is discrimination, that the claimant and her partner
    would not be able to enjoy "the  same  level  of  family  life  in  the
    Philippines on account of the relationship between them having no legal
    status" (para 19 of his decision") and that they would not be  able  to
    continue their family life in the Philippines "to a comparable  footing
    to what is currently enjoyed" in the United  Kingdom.  However,  it  is
    plain that he has not applied the high threshold. If he considered that
    the high threshold was met, he failed to explain why that was so, as it
    is simply impossible to understand from the material before him why the
    high threshold was met in this particular case. On any reasonable view,
    it simply cannot be  said  that  the  evidence  and  facts  before  him
    demonstrated that the high threshold, as indicated by the facts and the
    decision in Jeunesse by way of example, was met.

36. I have therefore concluded that ground 1 is established  and  that  the
    judge did err in law by failing to apply the applicable high  threshold
    to the question of whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family
    life being enjoyed in the Philippines.

37. The next question is whether these errors of law are material.

38. The judge considered proportionality outside the  Rules.  However,  his
    approach was wrong. The correct  approach,  explained  at  para  48  of
    Agyarko, quoted at my para 26 above, required  separate  assessment  of
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed
    in the Philippines and, if not, whether the refusal of the  application
    would result in unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  such  that  refusal
    would not be proportionate or,  put  another  way,  whether  there  are
    "exceptional circumstances".  I am satisfied that the judge's error, in
    conflating the issue of insurmountable obstacles under  EX.1.  and  the
    balancing exercise outside the Rules renders his  errors  material.  In
    other words, the errors of law have led him also to materially  err  in
    his consideration of the  balancing  exercise  by  adopting  the  wrong
    approach to it.

39. Thus, the judge's  assessment  of  proportionality  outside  the  Rules
    cannot be relied upon to demonstrate  that  the  errors  identified  at
    paras 21 to 36 above are not material.

40. I therefore do not need to consider grounds 3 and 4.

41. I therefore set aside the judge's assessment from paras 16 to 24 of his
    decision save that his findings that the claimant and the  sponsor  are
    in a genuine relationship and that the  claimant  meets  the  financial
    requirement for the grant of leave to remain as  a  partner  under  the
    Rules stand. I set aside his decision to allow the appeal.

42. Before turning to consider whether the appeal should be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal, I make one further observation. This concerns  the
    fact  that  the  judge  took  into  account  in   his   assessment   of
    proportionality the fact the sponsor is a British citizen and  that  he
    said that there  would  be  significant  interference  with  her  legal
    rights. If the claimant relies upon the fact  that  the  sponsor  is  a
    British citizen, she will need  to  address  paras  61  to  68  of  the
    judgment in Agyarko.

43. In the majority of cases, the Upper Tribunal  when  setting  aside  the
    decision  will  be  able  to  re-make  the  relevant  decision  itself.
    However, the Practice Statement for the Immigration and Asylum  Chamber
    of the Upper Tribunal at  para  7.2  recognises  that  it  may  not  be
    possible for the Upper Tribunal to proceed to re-make the decision when
    it is satisfied that:

         "(a)     the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
             the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity
             for that party's case to be put to and considered by the First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)      the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

44. In the instant case, the decision is finely balanced. On the one  hand,
    the re-making of the decision on the appeal is limited to the following
    discrete issues:

    i)     whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
        continuing outside the United Kingdom.

    ii)    if not, whether  refusal  of  the  claimant's  application  will
        result in unjustifiably harsh consequences such that refusal  would
        not be proportionate.

45. On the other hand, the claimant succeeded  in  her  appeal  previously.
    Both Ms Iqbal and Mr Armstrong submitted that  the  claimant  ought  to
    have a further opportunity of having a decision on her Article 8  claim
    re-made before the First-tier Tribunal so that any adverse decision can
    be challenged to the Upper Tribunal. After  much  thought,  I  am  just
    about persuaded, having regard to para 7.2 of  the  Practice  Statement
    and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in JD (Congo) &  Others  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 327 that the decision on the appeal should be re-made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  errors  on
points of law such that it is set aside, to the extent explained at para  41
above.

This case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  judge  other  than
Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Seelhoff to re-make  the  decision  on  the
claimant's appeal.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill                    Date: 24 August 2017
