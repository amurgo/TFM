Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Lane, instructed by Genesis Law Associates Ltd

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



   1. The appellant, who had arrived in the UK on 26th August 2005 had  been
      granted leave to enter as a student  which  was  extended  until  15th
      November 2011, sought asylum on 1th November 2011. His application was
      refused. It does  not  appear  he  appealed  that  decision.  On  21st
      November 2014, he was served with a notice  declaring  he  had  sought
      leave to enter through deception based on false declarations as to his
      nationality. During 2014, further submissions made by him  for  asylum
      were refused.


   2. On 8 December 2014, he made an application for leave to  remain  based
      on his family and private life in the UK. That application was refused
      by the respondent on 21st April 2015; his appeal against that decision
      was allowed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Frankish  in  a  decision
      promulgated on 1st November 2016.   The SSHD was granted permission to
      appeal that decision on 28th March 2017.

   3. The grounds relied upon by the SSHD are as follows:

             "1. The Judge gives no reasons for his decision to  allow  the
             appeal. It is unclear whether he allows the appeal  under  the
             immigration rules or under Article  8  of  the  ECHR.  If  his
             decision is under the Rules (he makes reference to EX.1)  then
             his self-direction [23] that human rights appeals are  decided
             on the facts at the date of hearing is misconceived. There  is
             in any event no  reasoning  in  respect  of  EX.1;  merely  an
             underlining of those parts of the rule that  the  judge  finds
             appropriate  and  no  explanation   of   how   and   why   the
             circumstances   of   this   appellant   come   within    those
             requirements. Although there is  a  statement  [22]  that  the
             Judge has found it was not reasonable to expect the  child  to
             leave, a careful reading of the determination fails to  reveal
             such a reasoned conclusion.
             2. If the intention of the judge was to allow the appeal under
             Article 8  outside  the  rules,  there  is  no  reasoning,  no
             balancing act and no proportionality assessment.
             3. For these reasons the Judge has materially  erred  in  law.
             Permission is sought to appeal to the Upper Tier(sic) Tribunal
             with a view to having the determination set aside.




   4. The First-tier Tribunal judge sets out the relevant  case  law.  There
      was considerable argument before the  First-tier  Tribunal  about  the
      nationality  of  the  appellant.  The  judge,  having  considered  the
      evidence before him reached the uncontested finding  that  Mr  Mupayah
      was a Zambian national. He is married to a Zimbabwean citizen, who  is
      recognised as a refugee and has indefinite leave to remain, with  whom
      he has been in a relationship since 2010. They have a child,  born  on
      7th July 2015, who also has indefinite leave to remain. The judge also
      finds, again uncontested, that it is open to  Mr  Mupayah's  wife  and
      child to go to Zambia but that it was abundantly clear from the wife's
      evidence that she would not consider doing so.


   5. The relevant paragraphs of the First-tier  Tribunal  judge's  decision
      are as follows:

             "20. [The child] has a future here and  I  have  accepted  his
             mother's evidence that she will emphatically not  abandon  her
             right to remain here  in  favour  of  returning  to  her  home
             country of which she is a refugee or Zambia of  which  I  have
             found her husband to be a  citizen.  [the  child]  could  only
             accompany [Mr Mupayah] to Zambia  if  a  UK  family  court  so
             ordered. My conclusion is that,  based  on  the  child's  best
             interests, including remaining with  the  mother,  they  would
             not.
             .....
             22.  Obviously  6(a)  and  6(b)  [of   s117B(6)   Nationality,
             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002] greatly favour [Mr  Mupayah].
             He has the requisite  relationship  with  the  child.  I  have
             concluded, as above, that it is not reasonable to  expect  the
             child to leave and, indeed, that I t would  be  impossible  to
             bring this about. With regard to financial considerations, [Mr
             Mupayah] is dental nurse. His wife works at two jobs plus  her
             studies in order to convert her foreign  dental  qualification
             into one recognised  here.......financial  considerations,  at
             the moment, are not greatly against [Mr Mupayah].
             23. In the refusal letter, the application  is  refused  under
             EX.1   on   the   grounds   that   [the   wife]   was   merely
             pregnant.....That is no longer the case, human rights  appeals
             being decided on the facts as at the date of  hearing....
             24. It is apparent from the  findings  of  this  determination
             that the appellant falls within EX.1, the outcome of this case
             being, essentially, the consequence of the [SSHD] leaving  [Mr
             Mupayah] to police the expiry of his visa on 15 November  2011
             and her decision dated 13 May 2013  against  himself.  In  the
             light of finding for [Mr Mupayah], I emphasis  [Mr  Mupayah's]
             evidence at ï¿½11 in connection with  any  subsequent  dependant
             relative claims."


        Error of law


     6. The SSHD is incorrect in her assertion  that  if  the  appeal  were
        under the Immigration Rules then the relevant  time  would  be  the
        date of the decision the subject of appeal. Irrespective of whether
        the First-tier Tribunal decision is under the Rules or an appeal on
        human rights grounds, the relevant date for an   in-country  appeal
        assessment of evidence, is the date of hearing.


     7. The scheme of the legislation under which this appeal is heard is a
        human rights scheme. At the time, Mr Mupayah made  his  application
        for  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK,  he  was  an  overstayer.  His
        application was made on the basis of his family and private life as
        engaged by Article 8. The refusal of that application is appealable
        only on human rights grounds - under the pre-Immigration  Act  2014
        scheme he would not have had  a  right  of  appeal  unless  it  was
        against a s10 Immigration and Nationality Act 1999  decision  taken
        pre-amendment by the 2014  Act.  In  either  case  the  success  or
        otherwise of Mr Mupayah's  appeal would, given the basis upon which
        he made his application, be dependent on whether he could show that
        his removal from the UK was a disproportionate interference in  his
        Article 8 rights namely the right to respect for  his  private  and
        family life. Part of the assessment of that is the issue of whether
        Mr Mupayah meets the requirements of the  Rules.  If  he  does,  it
        would be very unlikely that  his  removal  could  be  found  to  be
        anything other than disproportionate.  If  he  does  not  meet  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules all factors, including  those
        that may not be referred to in the legislative  scheme,  are  taken
        into account.

     8. Mr Lane submitted that the grounds as set out  in  the  application
        for permission to appeal and upon which permission had been granted
        did not seek to challenge the finding of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        judge that the child fell within the provisions  of  s117B  of  the
        2002 Act or EX.1. He submitted that the grounds were a disagreement
        with the findings of the judge, which were not perverse and  should
        thus be upheld. He submitted the grounds simply asserted  that  the
        judge had failed to undertake a proportionality assessment  whereas
        he had.

     9. Ms Petterson submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  was
        unclear. There had been no proportionality assessment,  there  were
        factual errors in the judge's findings and the grounds do challenge
        the findings by reference to the lack of any findings by the  judge
        of  how  Mr  Mupayah  falls  within  EX.1  which  had  been  simply
        underlined rather than an exercise undertaken  to  explain  how  Mr
        Mupayah met the criteria.

    10. There is no proportionality assessment. Although the judge sets out
        s117B of the 2002 Act, the judge does not consider that section  in
        the context of an assessment overall. There is no reasoning at  all
        why it is not reasonable for the child to go to Zambia  other  than
        an assertion that it is in the best interest of  the  child  to  be
        with his mother and his mother refuses to go  there.  That  is  not
        reasoning but a statement of an assertion.

    11. The judge has underlined the subsection in EX.1 that  it  would  be
        unreasonable for the child to leave  the  UK  and  underlined  that
        there are insurmountable obstacles to his partner going  to  Zambia
        or why it would be unreasonable for the child to leave the UK.  But
        he has not said what they are. ï¿½17 of the decision  refers  to  the
        wife's ability to go to Zambia (which has not been  challenged)  so
        it does not appear that there are, in,  fact  any  obstacles  other
        than her refusal.

    12. In ï¿½24 the judge states that from the  findings,  the  child  falls
        within EX.1. But there are no findings to that effect. The  grounds
        for appeal refer to the lack of findings. Mr Lane is  incorrect  in
        his submission that the grounds do not challenge the findings  made
        in connection with EX.1 and s117B.

    13.  There are two matters that  are  incorrect  on  the  face  of  the
        decision: the child is not a qualifying child under EX.1 and nor is
        a court order required for the child to be taken to Zambia with its
        parents or with the consent of each  parent.  The  failure  by  the
        First-tier Tribunal judge to explain how he came to his findings is
        one of the challenges by the SSHD.

    14. Nowhere in the decision  is  there  any  attempt  to  consider  the
        proportionality of the removal of Mr Mupayah. No account  is  taken
        of his immigration history in any proportionality  assessment  even
        though it is set out in the decision. That he speaks English and is
        therefore less  of  a  burden  on  taxpayers  and  better  able  to
        integrate are not factors that weigh greatly in his favour  -  they
        are factors that do not militate against him.

    15. ï¿½24 of the First-tier Tribunal decision is rather incomprehensible.
        The fact that the appellant chose not to leave  the  UK  after  his
        failed asylum claim is not solely down to  the  SSHD's  failure  to
        enforce immigration control. That it appears she  may  have  chosen
        not to enforce his departure may  be  a  matter  to  weigh  in  the
        balance but it is not a matter upon which he can achieve  leave  to
        remain as some sort of reward. The  reference  to  other  dependant
        relative applications and ï¿½11 must be some  sort  of  gremlin.  ï¿½11
        sets out some history and there is not, so far as I  can  see,  any
        dependant relative application made.

  16. In short, the judge has left out of  account  material  considerations
      and has placed impermissible weight upon others. I  am  not  satisfied
      that, had these matters been considered as they should have been,  the
      outcome would have been the same. It follows the errors of law made by
      the judge were  material  ones.  I  set  aside  the  decision  in  its
      entirety, to be remade, no findings of fact preserved.

    17. It is not the function  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  make  primary
        findings of fact. As indicated at the hearing (if I  were  to  find
        material errors of law), and to which there was  no  dissension,  I
        remit this appeal to be  heard  afresh  by  a  First-tier  Tribunal
        judge.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  remade,  no
    findings of fact preserved.
