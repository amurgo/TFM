Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 28 May 1995.  She appeals
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thapar dismissing her
    appeal  against  a  decision  dated  14  February  2020  refusing   her
    protection and  human  rights  claim.  Permission  to  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal was granted on 25 March 2021 by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara.

Background

 2. The appellant's father is a British citizen of Albanian origin. He came
    to the UK in 2000 and claimed to be a national of Kosovo.  In 2012  the
    appellant's mother applied for the family to join the  sponsor  in  the
    UK. It took over 6  years  to  make  a  decision  on  the  application.
    Eventually the appellant's mother decided to  enter  the  UK  illegally
    with her two children. The appellant was aged 16 when she  entered  the
    UK on 15 May 2012. Her mother applied for the family to remain  in  the
    UK with her father on human rights  grounds  but  the  application  was
    refused.

 3. In July 2016, the appellant was told by the respondent that she was  no
    longer eligible to be treated as a dependent of  her  mother.  She  was
    detained for 17 days during which time she claimed asylum on the  basis
    that she had been threatened by her ex-fianc�, that she was at risk  as
    a lone female and because of her significant  mental  health  problems.
    The claim was made on 26 September  2016.  The  appellant  subsequently
    tried to commit suicide and was hospitalised  and  has  since  received
    medical treatment for depression. The respondent refused the  claim  on
    14 February 2020.

First-tier Tribunal Decision

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Thapar dismissed the appeal, finding that the
    appellant was not credible and that there would be no risk  to  her  on
    return to Albania. The judge found the appellant's asylum claim  to  be
    fabricated The judge did not accept that the appellant had been engaged
    or received threats from her ex-fianc�. The  judge  took  into  account
    discrepancies in the account, the failure of the appellant  to  mention
    her ex-fianc� earlier, the lack of  threats  and  the  failure  of  her
    parents to give evidence at her appeal. The judge found that she  could
    return to Albania with her family. The judge found that  the  appellant
    did not meet the Article 3 ECHR threshold and that there would not be a
    disproportionate breach of the appellants right to private  and  family
    life in accordance with Article 8 ECHR.

The Grounds of Challenge

 5. The appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed in the following material respects.

    Ground 1 - Failure to take  into  account  the  medical  evidence  when
    assessing credibility.

    The judge concluded the credibility assessment prior to considering the
    medical evidence. In accordance with JL (medical reports  -credibility)
    China [2013] UKUT 145 (IAC) the medical evidence was  relevant  to  the
    assessment of credibility and should have been considered in the  round
    with the remaining evidence.  The judge erred  by  separating  out  the
    assessment of credibility and the assessment of the appellant's health.



    Ground 2 - Taking into account irrelevant matters.

    The judge erred by referring to the lack of evidence in relation  to  a
    family feud when the appellant's claim was not based on any such  feud.
    This infected the assessment of credibility.

    Ground 3 - Flawed approach to 276ADE (vi) of the immigration rules

    The judge failed to make findings on  the  issue  of  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant returning to Albania.

Rule 24 response

    The respondent submits that the judge directed  himself  appropriately.
    The decision is sustainable, adequately reasoned and rational.

Decision on error of law

    Ground  1  -  Failure  to  consider  medical  report   when   assessing
    credibility


 6. It was accepted by Mr Melvin that the judge carried out the  assessment
    of  credibility  prior  to  considering  the  medical   evidence.   The
    credibility findings are made from [19] to [35]  of  the  decision.  At
    [35] the judge states;


           "I find that the Appellant has failed to establish to the lowest
           standard that she was ever engaged in Albania and that she is at
           risk of harm from her former fianc� and his family. I  have  not
           for the reasons stated above accepted that the Appellant was  in
           a relationship with Andera Mozaris and therefore find that there
           would be no such risk to the Appellant from the former fianc� in
           Albania as identified by Dr Mirela Bogadani".


 7. From [19] to [35] there is no consideration given  to  the  appellant's
    mental health.  The judge does not consider the medical evidence  until
    later in the decision at [50] where the judge  gives  consideration  to
    Article 3 ECHR on medical grounds.


 8. Ms Daykin's submission is that this is a clear error.  Credibility  was
    an issue in this appeal  and  the  judge  in  accordance  with  various
    authorities including Mibanga v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 367 is obliged  to
    consider the medical  evidence  in  the  round  along  with  the  other
    evidence prior to reaching a view on the appellant's  credibility.  Her
    submission is that the medical evidence was relevant to the question of
    credibility. Although the medical report makes it clear  that  part  of
    the reasons for the appellant's depression was her  detention  in  2016
    the report also makes reference to her fear of return at various points
    and she took me through the relevant references.


 9. I am satisfied that the judge's approach to  the  medical  evidence  is
    manifestly erroneous. He has committed the classic error as set out  in
    Mibanga by Mr Justice Wilson who at [24] states;

           "It seems to me to be axiomatic  that  a  fact-finder  must  not
           reach his or her conclusion before surveying  all  the  evidence
           relevant thereto. Just as, if I may take a banal if alliterative
           example, one cannot make a cake with  only  one  ingredient,  so
           also frequently  one  cannot  make  a  case,  in  the  sense  of
           establishing its truth,  otherwise  than  by  combination  of  a
           number of pieces of evidence. Mr Tam, on behalf of the Secretary
           of State, argues that decisions as  to  the  credibility  of  an
           account are to be taken by the judicial fact-finder and that, in
           their reports, experts, whether in relation to  medical  matters
           or in relation to in-country  circumstances,  cannot  usurp  the
           fact-finder's function in assessing credibility. I agree.  What,
           however, they can offer, is a factual context in which it may be
           necessary for the fact-finder to survey the  allegations  placed
           before him; and such context may prove  a  crucial  aid  to  the
           decision whether or not to accept the truth of  them.  What  the
           fact-finder does at his  peril  is  to  reach  a  conclusion  by
           reference only to the appellant's evidence and then,  if  it  be
           negative, to ask whether the conclusion should be shifted by the
           expert evidence. Mr Tam has drawn the  court's  attention  to  a
           decision of the tribunal dated 5 November 2004, namely  HE  (DRC
           -Credibility and Psychiatric  Reports)  [2004]  UKIAT  00321  in
           which, in paragraph 22, it said:


                 "Where the report is specifically relied  on  as  a  factor
                 relevant to credibility, the Adjudicator should  deal  with
                 it as an integral  part  of  the  findings  on  credibility
                 rather than just as an add-on, which does not undermine the
                 conclusions to which he would otherwise come."


           25. In my view such was the first error of law  into  which  the
           adjudicator fell. She addressed the medical evidence only  after
           articulating conclusions that the central  allegations  made  by
           the appellant were, in her extremely forceful if rather  unusual
           phraseology, 'wholly not credible".




10. Mr Melvin accepted that the approach of the judge was not in line  with
    the authorities but submitted that in this particular case the error is
    not material.  The  judge  gave  numerous  reasons  for  rejecting  the
    appellant's account including her failure to mention the fianc� at  any
    time during the course of her time in the UK,  the  failure  to  supply
    corroborating evidence and the failure of her parents to  come  to  the
    hearing. He submitted that it was clear from the  medical  report  that
    the appellant's mental health problems  were  caused  directly  by  her
    detention which is what she stated  to  Dr  Singh.  She  had  no  prior
    medical reports.




11. In my view the approach of the judge is  clearly  flawed.  The  medical
    report should have been considered in  the  round  with  the  remaining
    evidence when assessing credibility.


12. Although the appellant did inform Dr Singh that her mental  health  had
    deteriorated significantly when she was detained, she explains  in  her
    statement that this was because of the  prospect  of  being  imminently
    removed to Albania where she feels  unsafe.  Her  fear  of  return  was
    mentioned at various places in the report and Dr Singh  concluded  that
    the appellant suffers from a depressive illness of  moderate  severity,
    her illness was caused by the psychological trauma  of  being  detained
    and her anxiety stress and low mood due to the fear of  her  ex-fianc�,
    she was visibly distressed at the idea of being returned to Albania and
    being exposed to her ex-fianc�,  factors  which  would  exacerbate  her
    trauma. Dr Singh also concluded that she was not  feigning  her  mental
    illness. Sr Singh's conclusion was that it was the twin experiences  of
    detention and threats from her fianc� which led to the deterioration in
    her mental health. This was material which  was  corroborative  of  her
    claim.




13. In my view this error fundamentally infects  the  credibility  findings
    made by the judge. Although it may well be that the  judge  might  have
    formed the same view on the appellant's credibility  having  taken  the
    report into account this is not  a  foregone  conclusion,  particularly
    when combined with the error at Ground 2 below.  I  am  satisfied  that
    this is an error which was material to the outcome of the appeal.


    Ground 2 - Taking into account irrelevant matters



14. At [36] to [41] of the decision the judge makes  negative  findings  in
    respect of a blood feud.  Ms Daykin submits that the references to  the
    blood feud were irrelevant. The appellant did not claim asylum  on  the
    basis of a blood feud; she simply mentioned in passing that her  father
    originally left Albania in 2000 because of a  dispute  over  land  with
    family members. Her case was not that she was at risk on return because
    of a blood feud and she did not present her appeal  in  this  way.  The
    respondent did not consider the appellant's fear  on  the  basis  of  a
    blood feud and did not raise this issue in the decision giving  reasons
    for refusal which meant that the appellant was not on  notice  of  this
    issue and did not deal with the issue at all in  her  appeal  statement
    and supporting evidence.


15. However, the judge refers to  the  purported  blood  feud  in  numerous
    different paragraphs of his decision including [23], [24],  [28],  [29]
    and then gives detailed consideration to the issue at [36] to [41].  At
    [41] he  concludes  that  the  existence  of  a  blood  feud  has  been
    fabricated  to  support  the  appellant's  claim  that  she  and   more
    particularly her brother and father would be at risk if they return  to
    Albania.

16. Mr Melvin referred to this as being a "belt and braces" approach.  This
    was his only submission in respect of Ground 2.

17. I am satisfied that the judge's approach to this  issue  is  erroneous.
    The blood feud was not a  material  issue  in  the  appeal.  By  making
    negative findings in relation to an issue which was not raised  by  the
    appellant as relevant to her claim, the judge infected his view of  the
    appellant's credibility in relation to her  claimed  fear  of  her  ex-
    fianc� and her credibility in general. This feeds  into  the  error  at
    Ground 1.


18.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge's  findings  on   credibility   are
    fundamentally undermined by these errors and should  be  set  aside  in
    their entirety.




    Ground 3 - 276ADE(vi)




19. This ground as originally pleaded was that the  judge  failed  to  make
    material findings in respect of paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the immigration
    rules in respect of "very significant obstacles".  Ms  Daykin  properly
    conceded at the outset of the appeal that the judge in fact did use the
    wording of "very significant obstacles" at [64] and that the judge  has
    considered this issue. However, she amplified her grounds by submitting
    that when the judge considered  whether  there  were  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration to Albania, the  judge  failed
    to take into account the appellant's poor mental health and the  extent
    to which this would impact on her ability to access  treatment  and  to
    participate in life in Albania. This issue was given  no  consideration
    at all.




20. Mr Melvin's submission was that elsewhere in the decision the judge had
    pointed to evidence that treatment  was  available  for  mental  health
    problems in Albania and the judge found that the  appellant's  extended
    family could return with her. The appellant's claim  could  simply  not
    succeed under Article 8 ECHR.




21. I consider that the judge has compartmentalised  the  issue  of  mental
    health. He gives it consideration under the heading of Article  3  ECHR
    only.


22. The judge notes that the appellant was admitted to hospital following a
    suicide attempt on 24 February 2017, has worked with the  adult  mental
    health team at Warneford Hospital, was participating in  a  therapeutic
    group with Oxfordshire Mind and started to receive counselling  at  the
    Refugee Resource in May 2017. Counselling went on for  15  months  with
    follow-up sessions. The appellant had experienced  severe  anxiety  and
    depression.  She  is  taking  medication.  The  judge  notes  that  the
    appellant's mood is linked to her immigration situation  and  that  the
    respondent did not dispute her medical condition. The judge then  found
    that the appellant's condition was not at a critical stage and that she
    can access treatment is available in Albania. The judge concluded  that
    the appellant's rights under Article 3 ECHR would not be breached.  The
    appellant does not take issue with this finding.


23. However, there is no consideration at  all  about  the  impact  on  the
    appellant's  mental  health  of  returning  to   Albania   or   how   a
    deterioration of her mental health  might  impact  on  her  ability  to
    access treatment or to participate in society. This appellant had  made
    a suicide attempt and produced ample  evidence  of  significant  mental
    health problems. Her bundle  of  evidence  included  letters  from  her
    brother and friends detailing how her poor mental health impacts on her
    in the UK. The medical  evidence  was  that  her  mental  health  would
    deteriorate if she were returned to Albania. This evidence  appears  to
    have been ignored by the judge. The skeleton argument made  submissions
    on this point and referred to the authority of  Akhalu  (health  claim:
    ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 400 as well  as  the  authority  of  Kamara
    [2016] EWCA Civ 813.




24. The appellant has been in the UK since the age of 16,  her  father  has
    now been in the UK for 20 years and she  was  previously  motivated  to
    obtain a good educational outcome in the UK. There was evidence of  her
    difficulties since 2016. There was  also  expert  material  before  the
    Tribunal in relation to likelihood of her mental  health  declining  on
    removal and the difficulties that the appellant might face in Albania.


25. It was incumbent on the  judge  when  considering  Article  8  ECHR  at
    276ADE(vi) of the immigration rules as well as in  the  proportionality
    exercise to take into account the appellant's poor mental health  which
    was relevant to that exercise as well as the impact  on  her  of  being
    able to access treatment and participate in life in Albania.


26. I am satisfied that when considering Article 8 ECHR the judge failed to
    take into consideration a  relevant  matter  and  that  this  error  is
    material to the outcome of the appeal.


Preserved findings


27. I preserve only the finding that it would not be a breach of Article  3
    ECHR to return the appellant to Albania on medical grounds.

Decision


28. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error of on a point of law.


29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


30. The appeal is remitted, de novo, apart from the preserved  findings  in
    respect of Article 3 ECHR, to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  heard  by
    any Judge except First-tier Tribunal Judge Carroll.



    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

    Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her or any member of her  family.   This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
