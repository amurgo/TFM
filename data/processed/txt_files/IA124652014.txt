For the claimant: Mr P Richardson, instructed by Kothala & Co
For the appellant:     M S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Amin promulgated  28.10.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated
    21.2.14, to refuse his application for an  EEA  residence  card  as  an
    extended family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty  rights  in
    the UK, pursuant to regulations 8  and  17  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006, as amended.  The Judge heard the appeal on 9.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    9.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 2.2.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Amin should be set aside.

 5. Judge  Amin  found  that  the  claimant  had  shown  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities  that  he  is  an  extended  family  member  within   the
    definition of regulation 8(2)(c) and thus allowed the appeal.

 6. In essence, the grounds of appeal suggest that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge misapplied the guidance in Reyes (EEA  Regs:  dependency)  [2013]
    UKUT 00314, in finding that the  claimant  was  dependent  on  his  EEA
    sponsor and cousin both in Sri Lanka and in the  UK.  It  is  submitted
    that the judge failed to provide adequate reasons for  concluding  that
    there was prior dependence, when there was no evidence that the sponsor
    was able to financially support the claimant.

 7. Whilst, as Mr Richardson accepts, the decision may have been 'generous'
    to the claimant, by accepting the credibility of the oral  evidence  in
    the absence of documentary support, I find there is  no  merit  in  the
    grounds of application for permission to appeal. The  judge  considered
    the evidence as a  whole  and  accepted  that  the  claimant  had  been
    supported by the sponsor both in Sri Lanka and in UK  both  financially
    and emotionally. The test for dependency on the  current  case  law  is
    that the claimant needs material support to meet his everyday essential
    needs. That was the assertion in the  oral  evidence  which  the  judge
    accepted. I cannot  see  how  that  conclusion  could  be  regarded  as
    irrational or perverse. Neither is it  without  adequate  reasoning.  I
    have to say that the reliance in �30 and �32 on what is described as  a
    cultural norm in Sri Lanka for the extended family to provide financial
    support distributed through other family members tends to suggest  that
    the relationship is not one of dependency, but that is what  the  judge
    accepted on the oral evidence. It was a conclusion to which  the  judge
    was entitled to come and for which he has provided adequate reasoning.

 8. What was not adequately considered is  that  under  regulation  17  the
    issue of a residence card for an extended family member is a matter  of
    discretion in the hands of the Secretary of State. It has  been  argued
    in other cases that this does not give rise to a right of  appeal,  but
    that was not an issue taken by the Secretary of State  in  the  present
    case. However, it does mean that the correct decision should have  been
    for the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal to the  limited  extent
    that the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with
    the law and that it remains for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  make  a
    decision that is in accordance with the law, exercising her  discretion
    on the basis of the factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.
    To that limited extent only there is an error of law in the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal, which  Mr  Richardson  accepted  and  did  not
    challenge.

Conclusion & Decision:

 9. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

                    I set aside the decision, preserving the findings of the
                    First-tier Tribunal;

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  to
                    the limited extent that  I  find  that  it  was  not  in
                    accordance with the law and  that  it  remains  for  the
                    Secretary of State to remake the decision in  accordance
                    with the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
                    claimant meets the requirements of  an  extended  family
                    member under regulation 8.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed  but  only  to  the
extent  that  it  remains  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  her
discretion in making a decision in accordance with the law.
