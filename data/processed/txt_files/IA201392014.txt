                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Claimant is a national of Sri Lanka, born  on  9  June  1985.  She
arrived in the United Kingdom on 20  August  2010  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
Dependant Partner. Her leave and that of her partner was  curtailed  without
the right of appeal on 31  December  2013  and  on  21  February  2014,  the
Claimant applied for  residence  cards  for  herself,  her  spouse  and  her
daughter. The basis of this application was her relationship with her  aunt,
Melita Rajani Joseph-Gubral Geb Siluvairajah, a German  national  exercising
treaty rights in the United Kingdom and with  whom  the  Claimant  had  been
living since her arrival until 2012 and  again  from  November  2013.  On  3
April 2014, the Secretary of State for the Home Department refused to  issue
her with a residence card as confirmation of  a  right  of  residence  under
European Community law as an extended  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

2.    Her appeal came before Judges of the First-tier Tribunal  Cheales  and
Moan for hearing on 26  February  2015.  The  Claimant  and  her  aunt  gave
evidence in support  of  the  appeal.  The  Claimant  stated  that  she  had
previously resided with her aunt in Sri Lanka until 1994 when her aunt  went
to Germany. Thereafter, her aunt  supported  her  financially  by  remitting
�100 a month until she arrived in the United Kingdom. Thereafter,  her  aunt
had continued to financially support her by way of �45-�50  a  week.  Whilst
she was living in Sri Lanka her aunt covered  all  her  education  expenses.
The Claimant's aunt confirmed that she had always supported her niece  until
she married and had continued to support her financially.

3.    In a decision promulgated on 16  March  2015  the  Judge  allowed  the
appeal finding at [20] that there is  consistency  throughout  the  evidence
that the Claimant was supported by her aunt in Sri Lanka because she  was  a
teacher there and then went to Germany in 1994. She found both witnesses  to
be credible and consistent [23].

4.    The Secretary of State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal on 18 March 2015 on the  basis  that  the  panel  had  inadequately
analysed the evidence and failed to adhere  to  the  guiding  case  law  cf.
Moneke (EEA-OFM's - assessment of evidence) Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00430  in
that there was no documentary evidence  to  support  the  Claimant's  claim;
that the panel gave no reasons for concluding at  [23]  that  the  witnesses
gave credible and consistent evidence; the panel failed  to  establish  when
the EEA sponsor acquired  EEA  nationality  and  misdirected  themselves  in
allowing the appeal outright in that, even if they were correct in  arriving
at the conclusion that Regulation 8 was satisfied, the most they could  have
done is to have remitted the matter back  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for
discretion under Regulation 17(4)  to  be  exercised  cf.  Ihemedu  (OFMs  -
meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 340 (IAC).

5.    Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
McDade on 5 May 2015 on the basis that the grounds are  arguable  and  there
is an arguable error of law. A rule 24 response was filed by the  Claimant's
representatives on 2 June 2015.

Hearing

6.    At the hearing before me, Mr Staunton submitted that at [15] and  [16]
of the panel's decision there was a clear discrepancy between money  in  and
out of the Appellant's bank account. The  panel  acknowledge  at  [22]  that
there is an inconsistency and this conflicts with the finding at  [23]  that
the witnesses  have  given  credible  and  consistent  evidence  given  [22]
relates directly to whether the Claimant is dependant.  In  respect  of  the
decision in Moneke he submitted that one needed to  examine  the  supporting
evidence with some care and the panel had not done this  and  there  was  no
finding on the inconsistency and no supporting evidence in relation  to  out
of country support. In respect of the second ground, Mr  Staunton  submitted
that this is a narrow point and if were to find there was no material  error
of law the appeal should be remitted to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the
exercise of discretion pursuant to section 17(4) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
Regulations 2006, following Ihemedu (OFMs -  meaning)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT
340 (IAC).

7.    In response, Mr Iqbal stated that he relied  upon  paragraphs  15,  16
and  22  of  the  panel's  decision.  He  submitted  that  with  respect  to
regulation 8 the requirement is such  that  there  has  to  have  been  past
financial  dependency  or  membership  of  the  household  plus   continuing
financial dependency or membership of the household. Even if  the  Secretary
of State's case was taken at  its  highest  and  the  two  judges  were  not
entitled to find as they did at [22] even then the  error  of  law  was  not
material because the alternative point of membership  of  the  household  is
met. Mr Iqbal  accepted  that  regulation  17(4)  was  correct  in  law  and
supported by authority and there is an error of law in this respect  but  it
was not material because it is  simply  an  admission  at  the  end  of  the
judgment that could be cured by the slip rule and sending back to the First-
tier Tribunal and that it was a matter of form rather than substance.

8.    In respect of  past  financial  dependency  at  [20]  &  [21]  of  the
decision there was complete consistency in the evidence  of  the  witnesses.
In contrast to the Rules, there was no  requirement  of  specified  evidence
under regulation 8(2) of the  2006  Regulations.  Even  in  the  absence  of
specific evidence if the panel accepts that what  they  are  being  told  is
credible, reliable and truthful they can say  so.  He  submitted  that  this
ground of appeal amounts to no more than a disagreement  with  the  findings
of the panel. In respect of past financial  dependence,  Mr  Iqbal  drew  my
attention   to   the   number   of    letters    from    people    including
friends/acquaintances who travelled from the UK  to  Sri  Lanka  and  handed
money over to the Claimant from the Sponsor eg letters from a priest,  which
were before the Tribunal  and  were  taken  into  account  as  part  of  the
credibility assessment. He submitted that  the  panel  had  considered  this
evidence together and formed a view as to past  financial  dependency.  They
did apply strict test of scrutiny cf Moneke.  He  submitted  that  this  was
simply a case  where  the  two  judges  were  impressed  by  the  Claimant's
evidence and that of  her  witness  and  also  recognized  they  could  have
retained remittance slips but did not have in mind they would need  them  in
the future. He submitted that there were no material errors of  law  in  the
panel's decision.

Decision

9.    I reserved my decision, which I now give, with my reasons. Despite  Mr
Staunton's clear submissions, I find that there is no material error of  law
in the decision of the panel in respect of the assessment  of  the  evidence
before them. It was open to the panel to find  as  they  did  at  [20]  that
"there is a consistency throughout  the  evidence  that  the  Appellant  was
supported by her aunt in Sri Lanka." The evidence comprised  both  the  oral
evidence of the Claimant and her  aunt,  the  EEA  sponsor  and  documentary
evidence which the panel refer to at [19] of  their  decision.  I  have  had
regard to the decision  in  Moneke  (EEA-OFM's  -  assessment  of  evidence)
Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00430 and I do not consider that  the  decision  of  the
panel infringes the principles set out therein. This was not  a  case  where
there was no documentary evidence to support the  claim  that  the  Claimant
had been financially dependant upon her aunt in Sri Lanka, whilst  her  aunt
was working in Germany.  Whilst  there  was  no  evidence  in  the  form  of
remittance slips, the panel were satisfied on the basis of all the  evidence
before them that the Claimant resided  with  her  aunt  and  mother  at  her
grandmother's house in Sri Lanka prior to her  aunt  moving  to  Germany  to
work in 1994 and that she was financially dependant upon her aunt until  she
came to the United Kingdom. This was a finding that  was  open  to  them  to
make on the basis of the evidence that was before them.

10.   The panel also  found  that  there  was  one  inconsistency  regarding
deposits into the Claimant's bank account but at  [22]  that  this  was  not
material given that all the money in the Claimant's bank account  was  given
to her by her aunt and uncle and that she is dependant upon  this  money.  I
find that it was open to the panel to reach this finding,  given  that  they
had the benefit of the assessing the oral evidence of the Claimant  and  her
aunt and reaching findings on their credibility, which are  sustainable  and
given  the  overall  consistency  in  the   remainder   of   the   evidence.
Consequently, I find that this ground of appeal amounts to no  more  than  a
disagreement with the findings of  the  panel  and  does  not  disclose  any
material error of law.

11.   The second ground of appeal impugns the decision of the panel  on  the
basis that they allowed the appeal outright and this  was  contrary  to  the
decision in  Ihemedu  (OFMs  -  meaning)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  340  (IAC).
However, the panel in this case did not find that the Claimant was  entitled
to a residence card but rather allowed the appeal on  the  basis  that  they
were satisfied that the requirements of  regulation  8  of  the  Immigration
(EEA) Regulations  2006  were  met.  They  did  not,  therefore,  usurp  the
function of the Secretary of State for the Home Department to  exercise  her
discretion pursuant to regulation 17(4) of  the  aforementioned  Regulations
as the effect of allowing the appeal is that the  Secretary  of  State  will
now consider the exercise of her discretion in light of the findings of  the
panel.

Notice of decision

12.   For the reasons set out above, I find no material error of law in  the
decision of the panel and I dismiss the appeal by  the  Secretary  of  State
for the Home Department. It is now a matter for the Secretary  of  State  to
consider exercising her discretion  under  regulation  17(4)  to  grant  the
Claimant a residence card in light of the finding by the panel that  she  is
the extended family member of her aunt, in accordance with regulation  8  of
the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.
