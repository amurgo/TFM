                            DECISION AND REASONS
                 (Remaking - Error of Law having been found)

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nepal whose date of birth is recorded  as
    25th  July  1983.  On  or  about  4th  July  2013  the  Appellant  made
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  human  rights
    grounds as the adult dependent  child  of  a  former  Ghurkha  soldier,
    present and settled in the United Kingdom. On  10th  September  2013  a
    decision was made to refuse the application both under  the  Rules  and
    with respect to the wider application of Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The Appellant appealed and on 31st July 2015 his appeal  was  heard  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M A Khan,  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross.
    Judge Khan dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 3. Not content with that decision, by Notice dated 21st September 2015 the
    Appellant made application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal. On 9th February 2016, I granted permission on the basis  that
    it was arguable that Judge Khan had erred in his understanding  of  the
    application of Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 and in so  doing  had  afforded  insufficient  weight  to  any
    historical injustice which might have been established.

 4. On 6th June 2016 the matter came before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Saini, sitting in the Upper Tribunal at  Field  House.  He  found  that
    Judge Khan had erred in law for the reasons set out in his Decision and
    Reasons promulgated 14th June 2016.  He  set  aside  the  decision  and
    findings of Judge Khan in their entirety but directed that  the  matter
    should be retained in the Upper Tribunal for the decision to be remade.

Preliminary Matter

 5. It was common ground,  though  it  was  not  entirely  clear  from  the
    decision of Judge Saini, that when the matter was before him, his error
    of law finding included the failure of Judge  Khan  to  deal  with  the
    historical injustice and that the decision was set aside with the focus
    at the remaking to  be  on  proportionality.  The  Secretary  of  State
    conceded that family life pursuant to Article 8(1) was made out insofar
    as it related both to private and  family  life.  It  was  also  common
    ground that it was for the Respondent to justify any interference.

Substantive Matters

 6. I heard evidence from the Appellant. He adopted his  witness  statement
    of 23rd June 2015. His evidence  was  that  his  father  was  a  former
    Ghurkha soldier who had joined the British Army in 1975 and  discharged
    in 1990, after fourteen years service.  Just  prior  to  discharge  the
    Appellant's father returned to Nepal having been told that he would not
    be allowed to settle  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Had  his  father  been
    permitted to remain in the United Kingdom he would have done  so  at  a
    time when the Appellant would have been only 7 years old.

 7. Eventually the Appellant's father  and  mother  did  obtain  indefinite
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom and his father came in 2007  with
    his mother joining him some time later.

 8. In December 2010 the Appellant came to the United Kingdom as a student.
    He had not entered earlier because his application for entry  clearance
    had been refused. Whilst in the United Kingdom the Appellant  was,  and
    remains, supported by his father and mother but he, the Appellant,  has
    never worked due to his immigration  status.  The  Appellant  describes
    himself  as  being  very  close  to  his  parents  with  family   being
    particularly important within Nepalese culture.

 9. Were the Appellant to return to Nepal he contends that he would  be  in
    difficulty finding employment because the unemployment rate as high  as
    42 percent. He would have no family or connections  able  to  find  him
    work; indeed it was for that reason that his father retired abroad. The
    Appellant has distant relatives in Nepal but he is not in contact  with
    them.

10. The Appellant was cross-examined. He told me that he did not know  when
    his father first enquired about settling in the United Kingdom but  did
    know that when his father retired in 1990  he,  in  common  with  other
    Ghurkha soldiers, was required  to  return  to  Nepal.  Eventually  the
    Appellant came to know that  those  who  retired  after  1997  had  the
    opportunity to come to the United Kingdom but he, the Appellant did not
    qualify and was not permitted. So it was that  the  Appellant  did  not
    join his father in 2007. At the time he was only 18 years  of  age  and
    was not sure whether a person over 18 would be permitted to  enter  and
    further his mother was, at that time, unwell. The idea, therefore,  was
    that his father would come to the  United  Kingdom  first  of  all  and
    settle. In the event his mother was subsequently allowed to  enter  the
    United Kingdom but he was not.  However  the  Appellant  had  not  made
    formal enquires about whether he could join  his  father  in  2007  but
    rather believed that to be the case from enquiries  that  he  had  made
    amongst friends and ex-colleagues.

11. Eventually, in 2010 the Appellant made application to enter the  United
    Kingdom as a student. He had the intention of  returning  to  Nepal  on
    completion of his studies but  the  college  closed  so  he  could  not
    complete his studies. It was then that the decision was  made  to  make
    application to remain through the connection  with  his  father.  There
    were others who had applied in similar fashion who had been  successful
    leading the Appellant to believe that he might well be successful also.
    Had the Appellant completed his studies he would have returned to Nepal
    to look after his mother and thereafter  would  have  tried  to  go  to
    another country, possibly in the Gulf.

12. The Appellant has a brother in Nepal  who  is  married.  At  first  the
    evidence which the Appellant gave with respect to his brother was  that
    he was a doctor (at least that is what was translated) though that  was
    subsequently corrected to being  a  farmer.  Be  that  as  it  may  the
    evidence was that the Appellant's family were not on  good  terms  with
    this brother since when he had married, about eight to ten  years  ago,
    he did so  into another caste and the marriage which was  not  approved
    of.

13. When asked if his father would continue  to  support  him  were  he  to
    return to Nepal, the Appellant said that he would.  There  was  no  re-
    examination.

14. The Appellant's father, Him Bahadur  Pun,  ("Mr  Pun  Snr")  then  gave
    evidence. His evidence was similar to that of  his  son.  He  confirmed
    that when discharged from the army, had he been allowed  to  settle  in
    the United Kingdom, he would have done so and would  have  applied  for
    his son, the Appellant, to join him.

15. Mr Pun Snr is in employment. He produced his P60 for the  year  end  to
    5th  April  2015  showing  earnings  of  ï¿½21,567.57.  He  supports  the
    Appellant from his income.

16. He was cross-examined. He said  that  he  first  made  enquiries  about
    settling in the United Kingdom in 2006, because at that time  a  person
    who had remained in the United Kingdom for three  years  as  a  serving
    soldier would be allowed to remain. He said that he did not  apply  for
    his son in 2007 because he did not have good English  and  no  job.  He
    went on to tell me that his son came to the United Kingdom in 2010 as a
    student because most applications as dependents were being refused  and
    so any application would have been a waste of money.

17. At this point the Appellant's father said that  at  the  completion  of
    studies he would not have wanted his son to return to Nepal because his
    wife, the Appellant's mother was unwell and  the  conditions  in  Nepal
    were not good. The Appellant's father said that he had not returned  to
    Nepal since 2007. He confirmed that he was  not  in  contact  with  his
    other son and confirmed that were the Appellant to return to  Nepal  he
    would continue to support him financially.  There  was  some  confusion
    about the timing  of  the  Appellant's  mother  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

18. In re-examination Mr Howells clarified the confusion which  arose  over
    when it was and where the Appellant's mother was when she  was  unwell.
    The evidence was that Mrs Pun was in Nepal until 2013 and  unwell;  she
    had undergone an operation. It was however Mr  Pun  Senior's  intention
    that once established in the United Kingdom he would apply for both his
    wife and son, the Appellant, to join him.

Submissions

19. Ms Fijiwala relied on the original refusal  letter  of  10th  September
    2013. The wider application of Article 8 ECHR, to which this appeal  is
    directed, is dealt with from  paragraph  26  onwards  in  that  refusal
    letter. Having regard to the five stage test in R - v  -  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department ex-parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27, as stated
    above, it was accepted that the Secretary  of  State's  decision  would
    amount to interference with the existence of the Appellant's  right  to
    respect for his private and family life.

20.  It  was  not  accepted  however  that  such  interference  would  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8. The Secretary of State had  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had a brother who was living and working  in  Nepal.  It  was
    noted that the Appellant had left behind his mother, grandmother, aunt,
    brother, sister-in-law and niece in addition to other  extended  family
    members and had not been concerned about the impact of separation  upon
    them. That was to be contrasted with his period in the  United  Kingdom
    of then less than three years in circumstances in which  the  Appellant
    had not entered the United Kingdom with his father in 2007. There  was,
    it was submitted, "No lasting repercussion". There was, it was said  no
    reason why the Appellant who was academically capable, having secured a
    place at his study in the United Kingdom, could not now return to Nepal
    and adjust to life there leading an independent life.

21. The Secretary of State went on to consider  whether  such  interference
    would be in accordance with the law and if so whether such interference
    in a democratic society could be justified in the interests of national
    security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for
    the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection  of  health  or
    morals, or for the protection of the rights of freedoms of others.  The
    Secretary of State then considered the  matter  of  proportionality  at
    some length and had regard to the guidance  in  the  case  of  Kugathas
    [2002] EWCA Civ 31  but  at  no  point  in  considering  the  issue  of
    proportionality, "put into the mix" the  historical  injustice,  though
    the matter was considered earlier in the  decision  when  consideration
    was given to the relevant immigration Rule relating to Ghurkhas.

22. Ms Fijiwala took me to paragraph 38 in the case of R on the application
    of Sharmilla Gurung and others [2013] EWCA  Civ  8.  That  provides  as
    follows:

         "We accept the submission of Ms McGahey that the historic injustice
         is only one of the factors  to  be  weighed  against  the  need  to
         maintain a firm and fair immigration policy. It is not  necessarily
         determinative. If it were, the application of every adult child  of
         a UK settled Ghurkha who establishes that he has a family life with
         his parent would be bound to succeed...". per  the  Master  of  the
         Rolls.

23. I was the invited to have regard to the head note at paragraphs 4 and 5
    in the case of  Ghising  and  others  (Ghurkhas\BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC) in which the following appears:

         "(4) Accordingly, where it is found that Article 8 is engaged  and,
         but for the historic wrong, the Appellant would have  been  settled
         in the UK long ago, this will ordinarily determine the  outcome  of
         the Article 8 proportionality assessment in the Appellant's favour,
         where the  matters  relied  on  by  the  Secretary  of  State\Entry
         Clearance  Officer  consists  solely  of  the  public  interest  in
         maintaining a firm immigration policy.

         (5)  It can therefore be seen that the appellants in  Ghurkha  (and
         BOC) cases will not necessarily  succeed,  even  though  (i)  their
         family life engages Article 8(1); and (ii) the evidence shows  they
         would have come to the United Kingdom with their  father,  but  for
         the injustice that prevented the latter from settling here earlier.
         If the Respondent can point to matters over and  above  the  public
         interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy, which  argue  in
         favour of removal or the refusal of leave to enter,  these  matters
         must be given appropriate weight in the balance in the Respondent's
         favour. Thus, a bad immigration history and\or  criminal  behaviour
         may still be sufficient to outweigh the powerful factors bearing on
         the Appellant's side of the balance".

24. Ms Fijiwala sought to persuade me that because Sections 117A  and  117B
    were not part of the law when the guiding principles in  the  case  was
    given, rather more weight was to be given to the public  interest.  The
    principles in Section  117B  are  as  follows  (being  public  interest
    considerations applicable in all cases and to which a Court or Tribunal
    is required to take into account.

          1) "The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in  the
             public interest.

          2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particularly  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English,

             (a)  are less of a burden on tax payers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

          3) It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons,

             (a)  are not a burden on tax payers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

          4) Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner

             That is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

          5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

          6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying  child,

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom".

25. Insofar as there is a "but-for" test, Ms Fijiwala submitted  that  this
    was not satisfied because it was not established that  the  Appellant's
    father or the Appellant would have settled in the United Kingdom in the
    1990s. The first enquiries were not made until 2006.  Even  though  the
    Appellant's father may have been deterred because of  the  arrangements
    then in place  which  gave  rise  to  the  "historical  injustice"  the
    Appellant's father could still have applied earlier than he did and  in
    particular in 2004. Ms Fijiwala accepted however that  the  application
    would not have been successful under the Rules so that the Secretary of
    State would have had to exercise her discretion. As to  the  provisions
    in 2004, these are helpfully set out at paragraphs 4 and 5 in the  case
    of Gurung to which I have referred:

         "4.  Accordingly, in October 2004, Immigration Rules 276E to K were
             introduced to enable  Ghurkha  veterans  with  at  least  four
             years'  service,  who  had  been  discharged  from  the  Armed
             Services within the past two years, to apply for settlement in
             the  UK.  But  only  Ghurkhas  who  had  been  discharged   on
             completion of engagement  on  or  after  1st  July  1997  were
             eligible to apply. The rationale for this restriction was that
             in July 1997 the Brigade of Ghurkhas  moved  its  headquarters
             from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom so that after  that  date
             Ghurkhas would have  had  the  opportunity  to  develop  close
             physical ties with the United Kingdom.

         5.   But at the same time, the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
             Department introduced a policy outside the Rules  under  which
             Ghurkhas were permitted to settle in the UK even if  they  had
             been discharged before 1 July 1997 and/or more than two  years
             prior to the date of application, even if  there  were  strong
             reasons why settlement in the United Kingdom  was  appropriate
             in the particular case by reason of the  individuals  existing
             ties with the UK. Entry Clearance guidance  was  contained  in
             the  Diplomatic  Service  Procedures  Chapter   29   para   14
             ("DFB29.14").  This  was  replaced  in  January  2009  by  the
             Settlement  Entry  Clearance  Guidance,  Chapter  12  para  16
             ("SET12.16"). Two  paragraphs  were  in  identical  terms  and
             applied to the dependents of all former members of  HM  Forces
             (including  Ghurkhas).  SET12.16  remained  in   force   until
             September 2010, since when the only relevant  policy  document
             has been the Immigration  Directorate's  instructions  ("IDI")
             referred to at 10 below...".

26. Ms Fijiwala submitted that no enquiries were made  by  the  Appellant's
    father or the Appellant as to whether he might have entered the  United
    Kingdom in 2007 because it was not established  that  any  applications
    would have been made at an earlier time.

27. Ms Fijiwala invited me to have regard to the guidance in  the  case  of
    Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803. She invited me to find that  the  private
    life relied upon by the Appellant, and indeed family  life,  whilst  in
    the United Kingdom was formed at a time when the Appellant's status was
    precarious. Additionally my attention was drawn to the guidance in  the
    same case: Rhuppiah,   to  what  is  said  with  respect  to  financial
    independence. The short point made by Ms Fijiwala was that  the  public
    interest, having regard to  those  factors  in  Section  117B,  in  her
    submission clearly outweighed any individual factors relied upon by the
    Appellant.

28. For the Appellant Mr Howells took me to  paragraphs  3  and  4  of  the
    Appellant's father's witness statement in which he had made clear  that
    had he been permitted to do so he would  have  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom on discharge  from  the  army  and  his  son  would  have  done
    likewise. That evidence, Mr Howells pointed out, was  unchallenged;  Ms
    Fijiwala asked no questions  directed  to  that  issue.  Her  questions
    focussed entirely on why application was not made at some later  stage.
    Still further it was Mr Howells' submission that Ms Fijiwala  erred  in
    her appreciation of the appropriate test to be applied. He took me back
    to the case of Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 and to paragraphs 41 and 42:

         "41. We do not consider this a judgment about the egregiousness  of
             the injustice that was suffered by the  Ghurkhas  as  compared
             with that suffered by the BOCs should be a relevant factor  in
             the balancing exercise. As submitted on behalf of  NR,  Gising
             and KR, the crucial  point  is  that  there  was  an  historic
             injustice in both cases, the consequence  of  which  was  that
             members of both groups were prevented from settling in the UK.
             That is why the historic injustice is such an important factor
             to be taken into account in the balancing exercise and why the
             applicant dependent child of a Ghurkha who is settled  in  the
             UK has such a strong claim to  have  his  Article  8(1)  right
             vindicated, notwithstanding the potency of the  countervailing
             public interest in  the  maintaining  of  a  firm  immigration
             policy. There is no place in the balancing exercise for making
             fine judgments as to whether one injustice is more immoral  or
             worthy of condemnation than  another.  Such  judgments  (which
             would in any event be difficult to weigh) may be  relevant  in
             the political plane. They are not relevant to  the  making  of
             decisions as to whether it is proportionate to interfere  with
             an individual's Article 8(1) rights.

         42.  It follows that we do not accept the submission of Mr  Drabble
             that the weight to be given to the historic injustice  in  the
             Ghurkha cases is just as strong as the weight to be  given  to
             the injustice caused to the BOCs. The fact that the  right  to
             settle enjoyed by Ghurkhas is less secured than  that  enjoyed
             by BOCs is a relevant factor. And it also follows that  we  do
             not agree with the Upper Tribunal that the weight to be  given
             is generally "substantially less" in the Ghurkha cases.  If  a
             Ghurkha can show that, but  for  the  historic  injustice,  he
             would have settled in the UK at  a  time  when  his  dependent
             (now) adult child would have been able to accompany him  as  a
             dependent child under the age of 18, that is a  strong  reason
             for holding that it is proportionate to permit the adult child
             to join his family now. To that extent, the  Ghurkha  and  BOC
             cases are similar. That is why we  cannot  agree  that,  as  a
             general rule, the weight accorded to the injustice  should  be
             substantially different in the two cases".

29. The point relied upon by Mr Howells was that at  paragraph  41  it  was
    appreciated by the Court of Appeal that the case of  a  Ghurkha  was  a
    strong claim repeated at paragraph  42.  With  the  historic  injustice
    being a strong reason to hold in favour of an Appellant on the question
    of proportionality.

30. Mr Howells then took me to the case of UG  (Nepal)  and  others  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 58 at paragraph 19 in which it was said that:

         "The policy  presupposes  that  the  family  unit  will  have  been
         separated with at least the former member of Her  Majesty's  Forces
         settled in the UK and adult dependents applying to  join  him  from
         outside the United Kingdom".

    Mr Howells submitted that the issue of precariousness is  not  relevant
    because the applicant will necessarily be outside the  United  Kingdom.
    What is more because the policy presupposes that  a  child  will  apply
    after the parent the fact that an Appellant did not apply at  the  same
    time as his parent is not a relevant factor either.

31. As to the Rules, as they were  in  2004,  to  which  Ms  Fijiwala  made
    reference and which are set out at paragraph 45 in the case of  Gurung,
    the Rules allowed an  application  to  be  made  within  two  years  of
    discharge. The Appellant's father could not have met  that  requirement
    and in fact did not do so. He eventually did make  application  outside
    the Rules but in the submission of Mr Howells none of this is  relevant
    to the issue. The issue I have to consider  is  whether,  but  for  the
    Rules which were in place in 1990, the Appellant's son would have  made
    application to come to the United Kingdom and  that  is  a  finding  of
    fact. I then have to consider in the context of this  appeal,  confined
    as it is given the agreed parameters following the  decision  of  Judge
    Sani, whether the decision of the Secretary of State is proportionate.

Findings

32. In this matter the burden of proving the primary facts  lies  upon  the
    Appellant. The standard of proof is the civil standard. It is then  for
    the Respondent to justify any interference in the rights established by
    the Appellant.

33. I have no difficulty whatsoever in finding as  a  fact  that  were  the
    Appellant's father permitted, in 1990, to make application to settle in
    the United Kingdom together with his family (including  the  Appellant)
    he would have done so. I was not only impressed by the manner in  which
    the Appellant and his father gave evidence  but by the fact  that  they
    gave evidence which was against their interest  i.e.  that  maintenance
    would continue to be paid by  Mr  Pun  Snr.  were  he,  the  Appellant,
    required to leave the United Kingdom. However as it was, this aspect of
    the evidence went unchallenged.

34. For the avoidance of doubt  I  find  as  a  fact,  as  I  have  already
    indicated,  that  in  1990  the  Appellant's  father  would  have  made
    application for the Appellant to come to the  United  Kingdom  together
    with the rest of the  family.  That  inability  because  of  government
    policy at that time has been recognised as an historical injustice  and
    is not in itself a finding that I need  to  make  other  than  to  have
    regard to it in the context of  the  proportionality  assessment  which
    falls to be considered in this case.

35. I am required to have regard to those factors set out in Section  117B,
    which I have set out above. I accept without reservation the submission
    made by Ms Fijiwala that there is not an automatic entitlement to enter
    the United Kingdom by virtue only of being the child (albeit now adult)
    of a former Ghurkha soldier who might have  made  earlier  application.
    All factors must be considered. It was of note that the  Appellant  who
    has been in the United  Kingdom  for  three  years  gave  his  evidence
    through an interpreter and in giving weight to the public interest  the
    extent to which the Appellant speaks English was not demonstrated.  The
    Appellant further  is  not  financially  independent  but  that  arises
    because of the circumstances in which he finds himself.  He  is  simply
    not allowed to work given his current  status.  He  is  not  however  a
    burden on the state because he is maintained by his father who has  not
    only evidenced his income in excess ï¿½21,000 but also shown  himself  to
    have considerable savings; indeed impressive savings given his history.
    As to the weight that should be given to the private (and family)  life
    established at a time when his immigration  status  was  precarious,  I
    have already dealt with that in the submissions made on the Appellant's
    behalf. I agree that that is an irrelevant consideration in this  case.
    It is abundantly clear from the guiding  principles  in  the  cases  to
    which I have referred that there is a very strong  case  made  for  the
    adult dependents of Ghurkhas. It is right that there are countervailing
    factors which might weigh against an individual, such as the commission
    of a crime or indeed other activities  against  the  interests  of  the
    State, but the Respondent has not adduced any sufficient evidence which
    would enable me to find in  this  case  the  individual  circumstances,
    which necessarily includes the historical injustice, does not  outweigh
    the public interest. In those circumstances, in my judgment, this is  a
    clear case in which the Appellant is entitled to succeed and I so find.



Decision

36. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal already having been  allowed  and  the
    previous decision already having been found to have involved the making
    of an error on a point of law and having been set aside  I  remake  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the appeal in the  First-
    tier Tribunal is allowed. For the avoidance of doubt the  Appellant  is
    entitled to the relief sought.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Though Ms Fijiwala sought to persuade me that I ought  not  to  make  a  fee
award, I do not agree. This was in my judgment a relatively  straightforward
case and in the circumstances I would have made a  fee  award  but  for  the
fact that this matter was exempt and no fee was paid.
