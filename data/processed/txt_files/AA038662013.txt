                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On the 9th August 2013, at a hearing at North Shields, it was found
        that First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes erred in law in proceeding to
        determine this appeal when there was, in law, no jurisdiction to do
        so.  Paragraph 12 of the error of law finding is in  the  following
        terms:


     12.  The difficulty with the above is that it  is  not  clear  on  what
   basis  the  First-              tier   Tribunal   considered   they   had
   jurisdiction.  The  effect  of  section  83  is   to             arguably
   specifically  exclude  by  statute  any  right  of  appeal  against   the
   decision made in this case.  Indeed in the letter granting  a  period  of
          discretionary leave dated 11th April 2013  it  is  clearly  stated
   that the decision            is not an appealable decision.  A  statement
   by  a  party  or  purported                    agreement  cannot   confer
   statutory jurisdiction and the decision of 3 May            cannot confer
   jurisdiction if none exists.


     2. The matter comes before me today for  the  purposes  of  a  resumed
        hearing.



Discussion



     3. The Appellant claimed asylum on 9th November 2011.  His  claim  was
        refused  on  the  26th  March  2013   although   he   was   granted
        discretionary leave until 25th December 2012,  a  period  of  eight
        months. Section 83 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
        2002 applies where a person has made an asylum claim and his  claim
        has been rejected by the Secretary of State but he has been granted
        leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a  period
        exceeding one year or for periods exceeding one year in  aggregate.
        Section 83 (2) states that such a person may appeal to the Tribunal
        against the rejection of  his  asylum  claim.  The  effect  of  the
        statutory provisions is that a person who has a claim rejected  but
        who is granted leave to remain for a period of less than  one  year
        has no right of appeal.


     4. Mr  Selway  submitted  that  notwithstanding  the  above  statutory
        provisions the fact the First-tier Tribunal have made a decision on
        the appeal means the Upper Tribunal cannot say that  Tribunal  does
        not have jurisdiction. I find such a submission has  no  merit.  In
        Virk v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWCA  Civ
        652 it was held that although the SSHD had failed to  raise  before
        the First-tier Tribunal the issue of that  Tribunal's  jurisdiction
        to entertain a family's application for leave to remain, the  Upper
        Tribunal was entitled to dismiss  the  family's  subsequent  appeal
        against the First-tier Tribunal's decision on the  basis  that  the
        First-tier Tribunal had not had jurisdiction, notwithstanding  that
        the point had not been raised below. In Virk it was said "Statutory
        jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver or agreement; or by  the
        failure of the parties or the tribunal to be alive to  the  point".
        It was also said however that if the issue had not previously  been
        raised then fairness required that the parties should be given  the
        opportunity to address it.


     5. In this case the jurisdictional point was taken by the  Respondent,
        as a reading of the papers clearly demonstrates, and  there  is  no
        merit in a claim this is an  issue  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  are
        prevented from considering further. In relation to the challenge by
        Mr Selway that this is not a 'Robinson obvious point' it  is  clear
        from the facts this is an arguable issue and can be  taken  of  the
        Upper Tribunals own motion.


     6. Mr  Selway  refers  in  his  skeleton  argument  to  delay  by  the
        Respondent which he  claims  has  resulted  in  prejudiced  to  his
        client. The Appellant claimed asylum on the 9th November 2011,  was
        assessed by Social Services on 16th April 2012, was interviewed  on
        23rd May 2012, but the decision to refuse was not issued until  the
        26th March 2013 at which point the discretionary leave was granted.
        Mr Selway argues that if the decision had been made earlier, as the
        Appellant's age was accepted, the  period  of  discretionary  leave
        would have exceeded 12 months giving rise to a right of appeal.  He
        argues that section 83 coupled with the principle of prejudice does
        not preclude his client from appealing.


     7. The issue of delay in considering claims by Afghan minors has  been
        considered by the Court of Appeal on a number of occasions  and  in
        relation to other claims within this jurisdiction. I have not  been
        referred to any authority supporting the proposition that  a  right
        of appeal specifically excluded by statute can be conferred in such
        circumstances.     There has been no challenge to the  legality  of
        the decision or refusal to grant  a  right  of  appeal  by  way  of
        judicial  review.  In  relation  to  any  alleged  prejudice,   the
        Appellant has been granted a period of leave, and has  now  applied
        to vary that leave so as to permit him to remain which, if refused,
        will give rise to a statutory right of appeal. Whilst the Applicant
        is not able to appeal this refusal of his asylum claim there is  no
        indication that he will not be able to have the merits of his  case
        considered at a later date by the Tribunal in an appeal against  an
        appealable immigration decision, as confirmed by Mrs Rackstraw.


     8. Mr Selway also relied  upon  an  argument  that  Article  39(2)  is
        relevant as the denial of a right of appeal  under  section  83  is
        incompatible with European Union law, in particular the requirement
        for an effective  remedy  contained  in  Article  39  of  Directive
        2005/85/EC. This issues was considered by the High Court in  R  (on
        the application of  S)  v  First-tier  Tribunal  [2012]  EWHC  1815
        (Admin), decided in July 2012. This  is  a  judicial  review  claim
        which failed. In delivering judgment Mrs Justice Cox stated:
   1. Discussion and Conclusions
   1. The rights of appeal contained in sections 82, 83 and 83A of the  2002
      Act constitute the measures implementing the obligations of the United
      Kingdom under Article 39 of the Procedures Directive. The "immigration
      decisions", listed at paragraphs (a) to (k) of section 82(2),  give  a
      general right of appeal where the decision means that the  person  has
      no legal basis for remaining in the UK, or that they are to be removed
      or deported. Under section 83 a person whose claim for asylum has been
      rejected, but who has been granted leave to remain  on  another  basis
      for a period exceeding one year, may appeal against the  rejection  of
      their asylum claim. Under section 83A an appeal may also be brought by
      a person whose asylum claim has been accepted but who is  subsequently
      the subject of a decision that he/she is not a refugee  and  continues
      to have leave to enter or remain other than as a refugee.  Section  84
      makes specific provision for the grounds of any appeal.
   1. The right of appeal that  Parliament  has  afforded  to  people  whose
      asylum claim has been rejected is therefore not  a  general  right  of
      appeal, but accrues only to those who have been granted leave to enter
      or remain for a period of more than one year in  aggregate.  A  person
      whose claim for asylum is refused, but  who  is  granted  five  months
      discretionary leave to remain, has no right of  appeal  unless  he  is
      granted a further period of leave, which extends beyond the  one  year
      period, although he may bring an application for  judicial  review  to
      challenge the refusal of asylum.
   1. In the case of unaccompanied  children,  the  reason  why  no  removal
      decision is issued at  the  same  time  that  their  asylum  claim  is
      rejected is because of the Secretary of State's policy not  to  remove
      unaccompanied, asylum-seeking children whose claims have been rejected
      until such time as they are no longer under 18 years old, unless there
      are adequate reception arrangements in the country of return.
   1. In this case it is common  ground  that,  following  the  "immigration
      decisions" made on 2  March  2011,  the  Claimant  exercised,  and  is
      continuing to exercise his statutory  right  of  appeal.  It  is  also
      clear, in my view, that notwithstanding the rejection  of  his  asylum
      claim,  any  decision  to  remove  him  during  the  period   of   his
      discretionary leave to remain would afford him a right  of  appeal  in
      respect of both his removal and his underlying claims  for  asylum  or
      humanitarian protection. Section 84(1)(g) specifies, as  a  ground  of
      appeal under section 82(1), the fact that  removal  would  breach  the
      United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention, or would be
      unlawful as being incompatible with the appellant's rights  under  the
      European Convention on Human Rights. The  right  of  appeal  that  the
      Claimant has now exercised is therefore one which is inherent  in  the
      statutory scheme, there having  been  a  decision  to  refuse  him  an
      extension of leave and to remove him.
   1. On this analysis the Claimant's contention, as advanced by  Mr  Jacobs
      on his behalf, is effectively that,  because  he  was  precluded  from
      exercising a statutory right of appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his
      asylum claim  immediately,  and  until  such  time  as  there  was  an
      appealable "immigration decision" made in his case, he has been denied
      an effective remedy as required by Article 39.
   1. Since permission to apply has been granted in this case, I  deal  with
      the claim on the basis that, notwithstanding the fact that it may  now
      be academic, the issues raised are important and merit  consideration.
      However, since permission was granted,  the  issues  have  been  fully
      considered and determined by Lindblom J in TN v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department [2011] EWHC 3296 (Admin), in  which  he  concluded
      that TN (a child)  was  not  denied  an  effective  remedy;  and  that
      sections 82 and 83 are not inconsistent with Article 39, or  with  any
      other provisions of the  Directives  comprising  the  European  asylum
      system. Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal has been given  in
      that case, but the appeal has not yet been heard or decided.
   1. In submitting that Lindblom J was wrong Mr Jacobs  contends  primarily
      that Article 39 requires immediate access  to  a  statutory  right  of
      appeal  against  the  rejection  of  the  Claimant's   asylum   claim.
      Recognition of refugee status is a declaratory act and  any  delay  or
      uncertainty, caused because  a  child  cannot  forthwith  exercise  an
      appeal on the merits of his claim, deprives him  of  important  rights
      under the Refugee Convention. Such delay  and  its  emotional  impact,
      until such time as he can exercise an appeal against what  is  in  any
      event a later, different decision, are not in his best interests as  a
      child.
   1. In any event, he submits, TN is to be distinguished on its  facts.  In
      that case the issue was whether a  child  asylum-seeker  without  more
      than a year's discretionary leave to remain will not have an effective
      remedy unless he has the chance to appeal to the FTT before  the  time
      comes when he  is  no  longer  a  child.  In  the  present  case,  the
      Claimant's entitlement to refugee status is dependent on his ethnicity
      and nationality, in line with Darfurian refugees of all ages. His fear
      of persecution will  therefore  subsist  until  conditions  in  Darfur
      change. He is therefore entitled to a  remedy  which  affords  him  an
      immediate right of appeal on the merits against  the  refusal  of  his
      asylum claim.
   1. I have considered Mr Jacobs'  submissions  with  care,  but  I  cannot
      accept them. I find myself fully in agreement with  the  reasoning  of
      Lindblom J in TN , in concluding as I do  that  the  Claimant  in  the
      present case has not been denied an effective remedy  as  required  by
      Article 39(1).
   1. As is recognised at  recital  27  to  the  Procedures  Directive,  the
      effectiveness  of  the  remedy  provided,  also  with  regard  to  the
      examination of the relevant facts, depends on the  administrative  and
      judicial system  of  each  Member  State  seen  as  a  whole.  Drawing
      attention to this at paragraph 85 of his judgment in  TN,  Lindblom  J
      said as follows:
      "In my judgment, Mr Najib [for the Secretary of State]  was  right  to
      submit that the effectiveness of the remedies afforded under  sections
      82 and 83 of the 2002 Act, both generally and for a  particular  group
      of applicants - in this instance, failed asylum seekers  aged  between
      16� and 17� with a grant of no more than a year's discretionary  leave
      - must be considered not in  isolation  but  in  the  context  of  the
      domestic system of immigration control as a whole.  This  approach  is
      consistent with the jurisprudence of the European  Court  of  Justice,
      seen for example in Peterbroeck Van Campenhout [(1995) ECR 1-4599]. In
      that case, in paragraph 14 of its judgment, the court  held  that  the
      exercise of determining whether a national  role  of  a  Member  State
      renders an EU law impossible or  excessively  difficult  requires  the
      procedure to be viewed as a  whole,  taking  into  consideration  'the
      basic principles of the domestic legislation'."
   1. Taking that approach, he held that the provisions of section 83  could
      not be said to have deprived TN,  or  others  who  are  in  a  similar
      situation to his, of an effective remedy of the kind to which  Article
      39 (1) refers.
   1. Concluding that TN had had an effective remedy throughout, Lindblom  J
      held (at paragraph 84) that the existence of an effective remedy  does
      not depend on an asylum-seeker having either  an  immediate  right  of
      appeal on the merits against the refusal of asylum, or a  status  that
      affords him rights and benefits  equivalent  to  those  enjoyed  by  a
      refugee. Article 39(1) does not stipulate that the  remedy  "before  a
      court or tribunal" must necessarily consist of, or include a right  of
      appeal to a tribunal on  the  merits,  exercisable  when  the  initial
      decision to refuse asylum is made. In deciding  whether  there  is  an
      effective remedy, the fact that such a decision holds  in  prospect  a
      statutory appeal against a  refusal  to  extend  leave  and,  in  that
      appeal, to have the merits  of  the  asylum  claim  fully  considered,
      cannot be ignored. Whilst a remedy, in order to be effective, must  be
      adequate and available to the person who needs it within a  reasonable
      time, a timely remedy is not synonymous with an immediate appeal.
   1. Further, Lindblom J held that, under Article 39,  the  concept  of  an
      effective remedy is not limited to a right of recourse to a  court  or
      tribunal. In  the  circumstances  contemplated  in  Article  39(5)  an
      effective remedy is deemed to exist on  the  basis  of  status  alone.
      Where, during the period of his discretionary leave, a person claiming
      asylum enjoys a status which "offers  the  same  rights  and  benefits
      under national and Community law as the refugee status  by  virtue  of
      [the Qualification Directive]", his status  is  itself,  for  him,  an
      effective remedy.
   1. Acknowledging the significance of refugee status to the person who has
      it, and for as long as he has it,  and  the  valuable  benefits  which
      accompany it, he held that the phrase "the same rights  and  benefits"
      in Article 39(5) does not mean rights and benefits identical in  every
      respect, but those that are in substance the same. In practical terms,
      in his day to day life, he considered that a 17 year  old  child  with
      discretionary leave to remain is at no real disadvantage to a child of
      the same age with refugee status. The length of a person's stay is not
      material in itself. That someone with refugee status can remain for  5
      years, while a child can remain with discretionary leave only until he
      is 17�, does not materially affect the quality of the protection  they
      each enjoy while in the United Kingdom.
   1. Considering that it was unnecessary to go as far as deciding that  the
      grant of discretionary leave to a child asylum-seeker confers  on  him
      rights and protections tantamount to those enjoyed by a  refugee,  and
      which are not such as to fall outside the ambit of Article  39(5),  he
      held that:
      "In my view it is necessarily implicit in the provisions of Article 39
      that, in gauging the effectiveness of  a  remedy  before  a  court  or
      tribunal, one can and should consider the degree to which  the  person
      to whom that remedy is available has a status with rights and benefits
      matching those of a refugee. Although the rights  and  benefits  of  a
      child with discretionary leave and those of a child refugee are not in
      all respect exactly alike, I think the practical similarities  between
      them serve to reinforce my conclusion that in both cases there  is  an
      effective remedy sufficient to satisfy paragraph 1 of  Article  39.  I
      should make it plain, however, that even if I were wrong about this  I
      would still  conclude  that  the  claimant  has  an  effective  remedy
      complying with Article 39(1)."
   1. I agree with these conclusions and with the reasoning which  underpins
      them. The remedies that Lindblom J found to be available to someone in
      TN's position, and to be effective remedies under Article 39, were (a)
      the  statutory  appeals  that  he  would  be  able  to  bring  against
      subsequent "immigration decisions", on an application  to  extend  his
      leave  or  against  subsequent   removal   directions   following   an
      unsuccessful appeal; and (b) an application for judicial review of the
      Secretary of State's decision to reject his asylum claim and grant him
      discretionary leave for a shorter period than that which would  enable
      him to pursue a statutory appeal.
   1. In this context, as is  clear  from  paragraph  92  of  his  judgment,
      Lindblom J considered that judicial review, whilst not  an  appeal  on
      the merits, was nevertheless a remedy with  considerable  range  which
      was available to a disappointed applicant for asylum.
   1.  I  respectfully  agree  with  that  conclusion.  In  principle,   and
      notwithstanding its limitations, as submitted by Mr Jacobs, I consider
      that the availability of judicial review can be relied upon  as  going
      to the provision of an effective remedy. The statutory right of appeal
      cannot be said to be the only means of  giving  effect  to  the  right
      under Article 39. There is certainly nothing in the text of Article 39
      to exclude the possibility of challenging the refusal of asylum by way
      of judicial review.  Consistent  with  recital  27  and  the  need  to
      consider the administrative and judicial system as a whole, the Report
      of the Commission to the European Parliament and the  Council  on  the
      application of Directive 2005/85/EC (COM (2010) 465 final)  refers  in
      this respect, in the case of the United Kingdom, to the role  of  both
      specialist tribunals and courts of general competence, the  latter  by
      reference expressly  to  "decisions  which  can  only  be  subject  to
      judicial review" (see paragraph 5.3.1).
   1. Further, whilst his observations to this effect were obiter, Sedley LJ
      said as follows on this point in HH (Somalia) v SSHD EWCA Civ 426:
      "It appears to  us  that  the  intention  of  the  Qualifications  and
      Procedures Directives is to require a member state to make a  decision
      on entitlement within a reasonable time  of  the  application  and  to
      allow the issues raised in it to be subject to an appeal.  We  do  not
      consider that the fact that an appeal from removal direction is by way
      of judicial review rather than statutory  appeal  is,  of  itself,  an
      insuperable objection."
   1. As Lindblom J pointed out at paragraph 92, judicial review is a remedy
      before a court; and it is one which enables the court to grant  relief
      where the process of decision-making is flawed by an error of  law  or
      procedure, or where the decision to refuse asylum has unreasonably  or
      unlawfully denied the claimant that which he is entitled to by law.  A
      claimant may argue that there has been a failure to act in  accordance
      with the requirements of statute  or  legal  principle,  or  that  the
      policy for handling asylum claims has  been  misconstrued  or  applied
      arbitrarily. Whilst it is not, as Lindblom J rightly acknowledges,  an
      appeal on the merits, its range is nevertheless  considerable.  As  Ms
      Rhee points out, it was conceded on behalf  of  the  claimants  in  FA
      (Iraq) that judicial review was an effective remedy in the context  of
      a challenge to a decision to refuse subsidiary protection status  (see
      paragraph 13 of the judgment of the Supreme Court [2011] UKSC 22).
   1. In the present case, in my view, nothing turns on the  fact  that  the
      Secretary of State  made  no  reference  in  her  decision  letter  to
      judicial review as a route by  which  to  challenge  her  decision  to
      refuse asylum. I do not consider that there is any breach of  Articles
      9 and 10. The question in the present case is not whether the Claimant
      is ever able to challenge the adverse asylum decision and, if so, how.
      Rather, it is whether, in circumstances where he is unable to exercise
      a statutory right  of  appeal  until  there  has  been  an  appealable
      "immigration decision", he can challenge any resulting prejudice which
      may be caused to him in the intervening period, including a  challenge
      by way of judicial review. It seems to me that such a challenge  would
      have been available to this Claimant if he had been denied a  material
      benefit to which he was entitled during that period, for example under
      section 20 of the Children Act 2009.
   1. In general terms, as recital 11 recognises, and in accordance with the
      EU principle of national procedural  autonomy,  whilst  asylum  claims
      should be decided  as  soon  as  possible,  the  organisation  of  the
      processing of such claims should be left to  the  discretion  of  each
      Member  State,  so  that  they  may  prioritise  that  processing   in
      accordance with national needs, taking into account the standards laid
      down in the Directive.
   1. In accordance with that approach I accept Ms  Rhee's  submission  that
      Article 39 does not reflect an  immediate  and  unqualified  right  to
      challenge an adverse asylum decision. In  particular,  whilst  Article
      39(2) requires Member States to make provision for time limits  within
      which applicants must exercise their right  to  an  effective  remedy,
      there is no requirement that the court or tribunal  must  examine  the
      asylum decision within a particular  period.  Article  39(4)  provides
      only that Member States may lay down time  limits  for  the  court  or
      tribunal to examine the decision.
   1. In addition, in the absence of any EU rules of procedure governing the
      matter it is for each Member State to decide which courts or tribunals
      are to  have  jurisdiction  to  establish  detailed  procedural  rules
      governing actions for ensuring the judicial protection  of  individual
      rights under EU law, subject to the EU law requirements of equivalence
      and effectiveness (see Case C-312/93 Peterbroeck van Campenhout &  CIE
      [1995] ECR 1-4599).
   1. The question is therefore  whether  this  Claimant  has  suffered  any
      prejudice, or has been prevented from enjoying any  substantive  right
      protected under EU law as a result  of  being  unable  immediately  to
      exercise a statutory right of appeal  against  the  rejection  of  his
      asylum claim on 10 June 2010.
   1. In submitting that he has, Mr  Jacobs  argues  that  the  Claimant  is
      entitled to refugee status if he is able to  prove  to  the  requisite
      standard that he is a member of the Berti tribe. The denial of a right
      of appeal on the merits, during  the  nine  month  period  before  the
      decision of 2 March 2011, prevented him from being able  to  establish
      his right to recognition as a refugee  under  the  Convention.  It  is
      unnecessary  for  him  to  show  any  particular  prejudice   in   the
      intervening period because this denial  is  in  itself  sufficient  to
      demonstrate prejudice and to constitute an impermissible impediment to
      the enjoyment of a substantive right under both EU  and  international
      law. The effect of reliance on a subsequent decision  as  a  means  of
      providing a merits appeal amounts to a fundamental breach of his right
      to an effective  remedy  under  Article  39,  because  any  subsequent
      decision is by its very  nature  a  different  decision,  which  takes
      different factors into account. The United  Kingdom  is,  he  submits,
      under an obligation to give effect to  the  Refugee  Convention  in  a
      manner which, absent  compelling  policy  considerations,  treats  all
      asylum applicants equally. No such policy considerations exist in this
      case.
   1. The question whether someone has refugee status is, I accept, a matter
      of real importance. Once that status is recognised, all  the  benefits
      of the Refugee Convention  are  immediately  available  to  them.  The
      uncertainty attaching to lack of status will then be replaced  by  all
      the rights and benefits which attach to refugee status. That, as  Lord
      Hope observed in Fornah  (FC)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2006] UKHL 46, is "...a very substantial benefit which  is
      well worth arguing for." Mr  Jacobs  drew  attention  in  addition  to
      similar observations in Adan v SSHD [1997] 1 WLR 1107 (Simon Brown LJ)
      and Saad, Diriye and Osorio v SSHD [2001] EWCA Civ 2008,  [2002]  INLR
      34 (Lord Philips MR).
   1. However, like Lindblom J before me, albeit on different  facts,  I  am
      not persuaded that this Claimant's  inability  to  appeal  immediately
      against the refusal of his asylum claim, until he was  issued  with  a
      decision to remove him, can be said in itself to amount to a breach of
      his right to an effective remedy. Whilst I acknowledge the  importance
      of his right to recognition as a refugee, on the evidence before me in
      this case his inability to appeal against the rejection of  his  claim
      in June 2010 was not causative  of  any  prejudice  in  terms  of  any
      alleged impediment to him in not being able to avail himself of any of
      the benefits of refugee status.
   1. Having been allowed to remain in the United Kingdom until 11  November
      2010 when, on the Secretary of State's assessment,  he  would  be  17�
      years old, he was able to apply to extend his leave,  and  he  did  so
      apply. The decision on that application was an "immigration  decision"
      affording him a statutory right of appeal on the merits, which he  has
      exercised. The Tribunal hearing that appeal considered  the  substance
      of his claims for asylum or humanitarian protection  and  will  do  so
      again when re-considering them following his successful appeal to  the
      Upper Tribunal. As Lindblom J observed at paragraph 93:
      "A remedy in this form is entirely effective for someone  whose  claim
      for asylum has been turned away by the Secretary of State.  It  is  no
      less effective a remedy for the fact that  the  applicant's  right  of
      appeal lies only against  a  further  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
      State."
   1. In my judgment, it is therefore necessary for this  Claimant  to  show
      that he has suffered some particular form of prejudice in being denied
      the right to exercise a statutory right of appeal against the  earlier
      refusal of his claim for asylum.
   1. In this respect I accept that, in cases involving a child, the need to
      have regard to his best interests  means  that  careful  consideration
      must be given to all matters relevant to his care and welfare.  In  ZH
      (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]  2  WLR
      148 ...Supreme Court) Lady Hale said as follows in relation to section
      55 of the 2009 Act:
      "23 For our purposes the  most  relevant  national  and  international
      obligation of the United Kingdom is contained in article  3.1  of  the
      UNCRC: 'in all actions  concerning  children,  whether  undertaken  by
      public  or  private  social  welfare  institutions,  courts  of   law,
      administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the  best  interests
      of the child shall be a primary  consideration.'  This  is  a  binding
      obligation in international law, and the spirit, if  not  the  precise
      language, has also been translated into our national law.  Section  11
      of the Children Act 2004 places a duty upon a  wide  range  of  public
      bodies to carry out their functions  having  regard  to  the  need  to
      safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of  children.  The  immigration
      authorities were at first excused from this duty, because  the  United
      Kingdom had entered a general  reservation  to  the  UNCRC  concerning
      immigration matters. But that reservation was lifted in 2008 and, as a
      result, section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
      2009 now provides that, in relation among other things to immigration,
      asylum or nationality, the Secretary of State must  make  arrangements
      for ensuring that those functions 'are discharged having regard to the
      need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are  in  the
      United Kingdom.'
      24 Miss Carss-Frisk acknowledges that this duty applies, not  only  to
      how children are looked after in this country  while  decisions  about
      immigration, asylum, deportation or removal are being made,  but  also
      to the decisions themselves. This means that  any  decision  which  is
      taken without having regard to the need to safeguard and  promote  the
      welfare of any children involved will not be 'in accordance  with  the
      law' for the purpose of article 8.2. Both the Secretary of  State  and
      the tribunal will therefore have to address this in their decisions.
      25 Further, it  is  clear  from  the  recent  jurisprudence  that  the
      Strasbourg court will expect national authorities to apply article 3.1
      of UNCRC and treat the  best  interests  of  a  child  as  'a  primary
      consideration'. Of course, despite  the  looseness  with  which  these
      terms are sometimes used, 'a primary consideration' is not the same as
      'the primary consideration', still less as 'paramount consideration'."
   1. I accept that the Court should acknowledge, even where it may  not  be
      articulated, some degree of anxiety on the part  of  a  child  of  the
      Claimant's age, as a result of the rejection of his asylum  claim  and
      his inability to pursue an appeal on the merits where he has leave  to
      remain for less  than  one  year.  In  general  terms  delay  prolongs
      uncertainty and is likely to increase anxiety.
   1. Ms Rhee is right, however, to point to the fact  that,  by  virtue  of
      this Claimant's status as a child with discretionary leave to  remain,
      he has throughout been entitled to receive care  and  welfare  support
      from the local authority, as a child in need and irrespective  of  his
      status, under the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Children  Act  1989.
      Further, he was able to take employment, or  set  up  in  business  or
      undertake any professional activity, with or without the help  of  Job
      Centre Plus, as well as apply for a place  on  a  government-sponsored
      training scheme. He could, throughout his period  of  leave,  use  the
      NHS,  social  services  and  other  local  authority  assistance,   as
      necessary; and he could travel  within  the  Common  Travel  Area.  As
      Lindblom J observed, both a Convention travel  document,  to  which  a
      refugee is entitled, and a certificate of travel, which a person  with
      discretionary leave may be  given,  allow  the  recipients  to  travel
      outside the United Kingdom and  to  return,  without  having  to  seek
      further leave.
   1. The decision letter of 10 June 2010 highlighted the  various  benefits
      to which the Claimant would be entitled whilst he had leave to  remain
      in the United Kingdom. It is not legitimate, in  these  circumstances,
      to refer to him as being "in limbo" during this period, as  Mr  Jacobs
      suggested, and there is no evidence showing that there was in fact any
      adverse impact on his emotional state or well-being as a result of his
      inability to appeal to the FTT until there was a decision to refuse an
      extension of his leave and to remove him.
   1. Indeed, Mr Jacobs frankly acknowledges that there is no evidence  that
      this Claimant was in any way prejudiced in relation to  any  of  these
      entitlements, or indeed in any other way, enabling  him  to  point  to
      specific benefits attaching to refugee status which were denied to him
      in the intervening period. On the  contrary,  it  is  clear  that  the
      Claimant has been receiving  appropriate  support  from  the  relevant
      local authority throughout.
   1. Mr Jacobs also accepts that, once he was able to appeal, this Claimant
      was then able to establish his ethnicity before the Tribunal. He  does
      not seek to distinguish TN on the basis of  any  particular  prejudice
      said to have been suffered by this Claimant.
   1. As Ms Rhee points out,  the  position  in  relation  to  unaccompanied
      minors is  distinguishable  from  that  which  governs  adult  asylum-
      seekers. Children  are  carefully  excluded  from  the  ambit  of  the
      provisions in Schedule 3 to the  2002  Act,  removing  various  asylum
      seekers or failed asylum seekers from eligibility  for  support  under
      section 17. This, I agree, is a clear legislative indication that even
      children of failed asylum seekers should be entitled to have access to
      section 17 support (see VC v Newcastle City Council [2011]  EWHC  2673
      (Admin). The cases of Fornah and others, referred to above, and all of
      which were carefully considered in TN, are therefore  distinguishable.
      I do not accept  the  submission  that  the  failure  to  afford  this
      Claimant a right of appeal in June 2010 meant that there was a failure
      to act in his best interests.
   1. Referring to the extracts from Hansard  relating  to  the  passage  of
      section 83, as set out above, Mr Jacobs submits that the justification
      for the exemption in that section, as identified  by  Pill  LJ  in  FA
      (Iraq) v SSHD [2010] 1 WLR 2545, namely that it was "...presumably  to
      ensure that cases which the Secretary of State is, in any event, going
      to reconsider in the near future do not have a right of  appeal  which
      may be ongoing  at  the  same  time  as  the  Secretary  of  State  is
      reconsidering the position" did not apply in the Claimant's case.
   1. He submits that the Secretary of  State  has  consistently  maintained
      that the Claimant is not a member of the Berti tribe and is  therefore
      not entitled to any international protection, as demonstrated  by  her
      refusal to extend leave in March 2011. Thus, there is no policy  based
      justification for withholding this Claimant's  appeal  rights  in  the
      present case. The effect of sections 82 and 83 is  that  the  Claimant
      has been treated differently from any  other  de  facto  refugee  from
      Darfur solely on account of being aged between 16� and 17�  years  old
      on applying for asylum. The failure  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to
      provide the same access to a merits based appeal as any other  refugee
      is disproportionate.
   1.  I  cannot  accept  this  submission.  This   Claimant   was   granted
      discretionary leave to remain for a period of five months until he was
      due to turn 17�, as it was then  believed.  It  was  therefore  highly
      likely that, as in fact transpired, he would apply to extend his leave
      and his case would be reconsidered, or  he  would  be  issued  with  a
      removal decision, at which point he would in any event be  afforded  a
      right of appeal. The rationale underlying section  83  does  therefore
      apply in his case  and  the  attack  on  the  justification  for,  and
      proportionality of, any discriminatory  treatment  in  his  case  must
      fail. In any event section 83 does not, in my view, give rise  to  any
      allegation of discrimination, whether on grounds of age or  any  other
      ground.
   1. Mr Jacobs no  longer  pursues  the  submission  originally  made  that
      section 83(1) breaches the EU principle  of  equivalence.  Rather,  he
      submits that  the  fact  that  the  Claimant's  only  remedy  in  that
      intervening  period,  before  there  was  an  appealable   immigration
      decision, was to apply for judicial review rendered  the  exercise  of
      his rights under EU law excessively difficult. That, however,  is  not
      the right question. The correct question is whether his  enjoyment  of
      his underlying EU rights has been rendered  excessively  difficult  by
      the relevant statutory provisions. For all the reasons set  out  above
      the answer to that question is in the negative.
   1. In my judgment the FTT was entitled to  conclude  that  there  was  no
      exercisable appeal before it on 2 August 2010. The  Claimant  has  not
      been denied an effective remedy but  has,  on  the  contrary,  availed
      himself of his effective remedy in  exercising  his  right  to  appeal
      against the immigration decision of 2 March 2011.  The  provisions  of
      sections 82 and 83 of the 2002 Act are not inconsistent  with  Article
      39, as informed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights; and there is  no
      basis upon which the  statutory  provisions  could  be  said  to  have
      operated in a way which failed to safeguard the best interests of  the
      Claimant as a child seeking asylum. This Claimant has in no  way  been
      discriminated against or unlawfully disadvantaged as a result  of  the
      relevant statutory provisions. His claim for judicial review therefore
      fails.


     9. The Court of Appeal also recently delivered their judgment on  this
        issue in the case of TN (Afghanistan) &  MA  (Afghanistan)  v  SSHD
        [2013] EWCA Civ 1609.  The issues before the Court  of  Appeal  are
        summarised in paragraph 7 of the judgment of Lord  Justice  Maurice
        Kay as follows:


              The grounds of appeal in  these  cases  were  explained  in  a
   series of skeleton arguments              written by Mr  Becket  Bedford,
   the most recent of which is dated 4 October 2013, some                six
   days before the hearing of the appeal. The first and principal ground  of
   appeal is that,              by granting them DLR for less than  a  year,
   the Secretary of State  unlawfully  denied  the            appellants  an
   effective remedy to which they are entitled as a matter of European  law.
   In             other words, it was unlawful  to  create  a  situation  in
   which, by granting DLR for less than          one year, the Secretary  of
   State  ensured  that  there  could  be  no  appeal  to  the   FTT   while
   the  appellants  were  still  under  18  and  protected  by  the  tracing
   obligation and section 55              of  the  Borders  Citizenship  and
   Immigration Act 2009, as explained by the Supreme  Court               in
   ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]  2  WLR
   148.           Secondly, the appellants were not only denied an effective
   remedy by way of appeal.              They were thereby disadvantaged  in
   relation to the remedy  with  which  they  were                  provided
   because of the limitations of judicial review. The third issue is whether
   what is             sometimes called "corrective relief",  emerging  from
   cases such as R (Rashid) v  Secretary           of  State  for  the  Home
   Department  [2005]  EWCA  Civ  744  and  R  (S)  v  Secretary  of   State
   for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 546, is a sufficient  remedy.  In
   this context, Mr              Bedford  invites  us  to  revisit  R  (R  v
   Secretary   of   State   for    the    Home    Department,    ex    parte
   Ravichandran (No.1) [1996] Imm AR 97 and,  if  necessary,  to  refer  the
   point to the Court           of Justice of  the  European  Union  (CJEU).
   Fourthly, the  appellants  seek  to  rely  on  the            Charter  of
   Fundamental Rights of the  European  Union  (the  Charter).  Finally,  he
   invites             us, if appropriate, to remit TN's  damages  claim  to
   the Administrative Court.


    10. On the issue of an effective remedy the Court  found  at  paragraph
        16:


              All this leads me to the clear conclusion that, in the context
   of these appeals, the                 availability of judicial review  as
   a   means   of   challenging    the    initial    rejections    of    the
   appellants' claims meant that there was an effective remedy  such  as  to
   satisfy the                  requirements of Article 39 of the Procedures
   Directive. Whilst it did not share  all  the              features  of  a
   statutory appeal to the FTT - in particular,  the  process  of  a  merits
   decision            following the hearing of oral evidence - there is  no
   requirement in the Procedures                 Directive or elsewhere that
   it  should.  The  judicial  review  procedure  falls  within  the  margin
   of appreciation which is respected by recital (27) and  Article  39.2  of
   the Directive. The           fact that  Parliament  provides  a  two-tier
   appellate system located in specialist tribunals  is              nothing
   to the point. In many ways, they go further than the "minimum  framework"
   (recital            (5)) provided by the Procedures Directive. Parliament
   was entitled to define and restrict           their jurisdiction provided
   that,  where  it  is  excluded,  there  is  still  an  effective   remedy
   elsewhere in the judicial system. I am quite satisfied that there is.


    11. Claims to have suffered disadvantage were rejected [para 17-23]  as
        were all the other argument relied upon by Mr Bedford. Lord Justice
        Beatson, at paragraphs 32 and 33, found:


          32.     I also consider that to regard the right of  appeal  after
   the short delay envisaged in cases            such as these as inadequate
   and    not    an    "effective    remedy"     could     undermine     the
   legislative decision to restrict the right of appeal under section 83  of
   the Nationality,             Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to those who
   have been given leave to enter for more            than 12  months.  That
   policy was not criticised by this court  in  FA  (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 696. It serves  the  useful
   purpose of              helping to avoid  duplication  between  decision-
   making at first instance and on appeal in              cases in which the
   Secretary of State will be reconsidering a person's position in the  near
          future.
          33. It may be the case that  delaying  an  appeal  until  after  a
   person's 18th birthday  would  mean              that  it  would  not  be
   necessary for the best interests of that  person  as  a  child  to  be  a
   primary consideration in the decision-making process pursuant to  section
   55 of the               Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009.
   But such applicants will, in the light of  KA            (Afghanistan)  v
   Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1014,  be
   treated as young people and their whole history will be considered. I  am
   concerned that               to regard the fact that an immediate  appeal
   would be an appeal by a child whereas  an            appeal  within  what
   would  otherwise  be  a  reasonable  period  would  be  an  appeal  by  a
   young adult as a reason for finding the remedy to be inadequate  and  not
   an effective            remedy under Article 39 would be undesirable from
   a policy point of view.  If  it  is  not           appropriate,  for  the
   reasons given in the cases referred to by my  Lord  at  [25],  to  use  a
   principle of "corrective relief" to confer a status which is not merited,
   then it is also                  arguably not appropriate to require  the
   case of a person who will very shortly fall out of a             category
   to be decided before he does  so  when  his  interim  position  is  fully
   protected and           where the result might  be  to  confer  a  status
   which, although warranted for  a  few  months,             would  not  be
   merited thereafter.


    12. I find no merit in the submission that the statutory provisions are
        contrary to European law as they deny the  Appellant  an  effective
        remedy. In this case there has always been a possible remedy by way
        of judicial review of the decision which has never been exercised.


    13. Having considered  the  competing  arguments  and  the  authorities
        relied upon by  the  advocates  I  find  it  not  proved  that  the
        Appellant had a right of appeal on  any  basis  to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal. Accordingly the determination  of  Judge  Holmes  is  set
        aside. There are no preserved findings.  I  substitute  a  decision
        that as there is no  jurisdiction  to  hear  the  appeal  there  is
        nothing for the Upper Tribunal to determine.





Decision

    14. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. As there is no statutory right of appeal there is  nothing
        extant to be determined.


   Anonymity.


    15. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   I
        continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).




Signed.......................................................
Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
Dated the 16th January 2014
