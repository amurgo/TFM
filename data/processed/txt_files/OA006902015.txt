Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal ( Judge Abebrese) dismissing their  appeals  against  the
    decisions made on 27 November  2014  refusing  their  applications  for
    entry clearance as dependent children of their mother  and  sponsor,  a
    British citizen, living in the UK.
2.   Before the First-tier Tribunal the  first  appellant  (the  appellant),
    born on 20 December 2000, was the only named  appellant  as  the  judge
    commented at [23] of his  decision  whereas  his  brother  was  clearly
    affected by the decision  of  the  Tribunal.   It  is  clear  that  the
    representations and the grounds submitted to  support  the  application
    and the appeal were intended  to  cover  both  the  appellant  and  his
    brother, born on 8 November 1999, although it appears that  the  notice
    of appeal was only submitted in the appellant's name.  Both Mr Lam  and
    Mr Tarlow accepted that the appellant's brother should be treated as  a
    party to the appeal and that the decision applied  equally  to  him  as
    well as to the appellant.  Accordingly,  by  consent,  the  appellant's
    brother is added as second appellant in this appeal.

Background

3.   The sponsor arrived in the  UK  in  2001.   She  stated  that  she  was
    Eritrean and made  numerous  unsuccessful  applications  for  leave  to
    remain.  She continued to live in the UK and was  subsequently  granted
    leave to remain and in November 2011 she was naturalised as  a  British
    citizen.  The appellants applied for entry clearance  on  30  September
    2014 but their applications were refused  on  27  November  2014.   The
    respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the   sponsor   had   had   sole
    responsibility for them under para 297(i)(e) of HC 395, that there were
    serious or compelling circumstances making their exclusion  undesirable
    within para 297(i)(f) or that they could be maintained and accommodated
    by the sponsor without recourse to public funds  as  required  by  para
    297(v). The appellants submitted grounds of appeal and the decision was
    reviewed but the refusal was maintained.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

4.   The evidence given by  the  sponsor  at  the  hearing  can  briefly  be
    summarised as follows.  She was born in Eritrea and her former  husband
    was also Eritrean.  They married in 1993 and started living together in
    Ethiopia.  The second appellant was born there but  the  appellant  was
    born in Eritrea.  Following the conflict and the  creation  of  Eritrea
    they were both deported there and put in camps.  Her husband could  not
    work because he had taught in Ethiopia and used the Ethiopian language.
     He could not teach and  therefore  became  unemployed.   In  2001  the
    sponsor left Eritrea to come to the UK where she claimed  asylum  based
    on her persecution and non-acceptance as an Eritrean.

5.   She left the appellants with her husband  and  then  contact  was  lost
    amid the upheaval going on in the area at the time.  However, in  2005,
    with the help of the Red Cross, she managed to trace her  family.   She
    then learnt that her husband had remarried.  She started sending  money
    to her children for their upkeep in 2005.  It was sent  to  her  former
    husband to assist in the care of the children but she said that he  did
    not care for them well.  When she realised that this was the  case  she
    decided to stop sending him money and then started  sending  provisions
    directly to the children by post.  Her former husband did not like  the
    fact that she had stopped sending money.  He threatened  her  and  said
    that he was going to have the children deported to  Ethiopia  and  then
    communication was cut off between them.

6.   The sponsor said that she later learnt that  the  appellants  had  been
    deported to Ethiopia in 2014 as a result of their father  reporting  to
    the police that they had Ethiopian nationality.  She was reunited  with
    her children with the help of the Red Cross on 23 February  2014.   She
    said that since her children arrived in Ethiopia,  her  former  husband
    had played no role in  their  upbringing  and  she  had  been  entirely
    responsible for them.  She referred to letters dated 3 October 2015 and
    27 December 2014 from the Southern Subcity Social  Court  ("the  Social
    Court") setting out the evidence of three witnesses.

7.   When her children first arrived in Ethiopia they were  in  a  camp  for
    three days and then in a hotel.  They then rented  a  flat  where  they
    both lived.  She had employed  a  housemaid  to  look  after  them  and
    travelled regularly to  be  with  them,  having  made  five  visits  to
    Ethiopia, on each visit staying roughly five weeks.  The  children  led
    lonely lives there and were in fear of possible persecution  by  people
    who considered them to be Eritrean.  To alleviate this she had obtained
    Ethiopian passports  for  them  on  the  basis  of  her  own  Ethiopian
    nationality.  The appellants had lost contact with their father whereas
    she was maintaining regular contact with them

8.   The sponsor confirmed that she had dual nationality  of  both  Ethiopia
    and Eritrea and the appellants had obtained their  Ethiopian  passports
    on this basis.  She had lost contact with the children in 2001 but this
    was revived in 2002.  She conceded that she had no evidence of payments
    between 2005 and 2012 and  that  there  had  been  no  contact  between
    herself and the children between 2012  to  2014.   She  said  that  her
    former husband did not have access to travel to Ethiopia because he had
    decided to be Eritrean.

9.   The judge identified as the primary issue in the appeal whether or  not
    the appellants and the sponsor had  provided  a  sufficient  amount  of
    evidence  to  show  that  on  balance  the   sponsor   had   had   sole
    responsibility for them since her departure from Eritrea in  2001.   He
    accepted that there had been difficulty in contact  during  the  period
    2001 to 2005 when the children were with their father  in  Eritrea  and
    that their father had subsequently remarried and was living there  with
    his new family.  He found that with the  help  of  the  Red  Cross  the
    sponsor had been able to regain contact with the  appellants  referring
    to the letter from the British Red Cross dated 15 September 2005.  From
    2005 to 2012 she maintained  contact  but  the  judge  found  that  the
    sponsor had not been able to provide documentary  evidence  to  support
    the claim that she was also supporting the children financially.

10.  The judge found that when the sponsor gained contact with her  children
    in 2005 she had failed to provide sufficient evidence  to  substantiate
    her claim that she was sending them between �100 and �200 per month and
    he did not find that there was evidence to support her claim  that  she
    stopped sending the children money because they were  not  getting  the
    benefit of monies she was sending to her husband and  his  new  family.
    He further found that there was no evidence to support her  claim  that
    from thereon she decided to send provisions to her children as  opposed
    to sending them money.  The judge was  also  not  satisfied  about  the
    evidence in relation to the deportation of the children from Eritrea to
    Ethiopia, not finding this  to  be  credible  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellants' father had maintained  them  since  2001  in  Eritrea,  the
    evidence suggesting that he  had  been  solely  responsible  for  their
    upkeep for the majority of the time starting from 2001.

11.  The judge noted there  was  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  the
    sponsor's claim that her former husband had taken  such  steps  because
    she had stopped sending him money and found that it was  unlikely  that
    the appellants' father had become reliant on such money on the basis of
    the evidence that it was either not sent at all or if the  sponsor  had
    sent money, it  was  on  a  very  irregular  basis.   The  judge  said,
    following on from this, he did not accept that, even if the  appellants
    were residing in Ethiopia, their father was no longer involved in their
    lives.  The judge specifically found that the appellants had failed  to
    show that the sponsor had been solely responsible from  2001  to  2012.
    He accepted  that  she  had  been  sending  money  since  2014  to  the
    appellants but, having considered all the evidence  in  the  round,  he
    found that the appellants' father was also likely  to  be  involved  in
    their lives and that responsibilities were  being  shared  between  the
    sponsor and her former husband.  He found that the appellants could  be
    catered for, as they had been in the last two years by the  sponsor  if
    she continued to send money to them and that the circumstances in which
    they found themselves was neither compelling nor compassionate and,  in
    any event, there were members of the family such as  their  father  who
    were still involved in their lives.  For these reasons the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

The Grounds and Submissions

12.  The appellant's grounds of appeal raise three  issues.   It  is  argued
    firstly that the judge erred by not making it clear whether or  not  he
    accepted that the children were in Ethiopia.  If that was accepted,  it
    was irrational to conclude that their father was playing some  role  in
    their lives because if he was interested in their welfare, there  would
    be no logical reason for him to have allowed them to leave his house to
    live initially in a camp in Ethiopia.  If he did not  accept  that  the
    children were in Ethiopia that also was unreasonable in  the  light  of
    the letter from the Red Cross confirming that the children were  there.
    Secondly, it is argued  that  the  judge  did  not  consider  the  best
    interests of the children. Although s.55 of  the  Borders,  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009 only applied to children in the UK, the spirit
    of the guidance should be  taken  into  account  when  considering  the
    situation of  children  living  abroad:  T  [s.55  BCIA  2009  -  entry
    clearance] Jamaica [2011] UKUT 483.  The grounds argue thirdly that the
    judge further erred by holding that family life with the children could
    continue via modern communication.

13.  Mr Lam submitted that the judge  had  erred  by  not  making  it  clear
    whether he accepted that  the  appellants  were  in  Ethiopia.   Having
    accepted that the sponsor had been  sending  money  to  the  appellants
    since 2014 there was no evidence to contradict they were anywhere  else
    but Ethiopia.  The judge had accepted that there was a letter from  the
    Social Court and no issue was taken about its authenticity.  The  judge
    failed to give reasons why the contents of this official document could
    not be relied on.  Further, the judge had failed to give  any  adequate
    reasons to justify his finding that the appellant's father  was  likely
    to be involved in their lives.  This finding was based on  speculation.
    Further, it is argued that  the  judge's  comment  that  there  was  no
    evidence to support the sponsor's claim that she  had  stopped  sending
    money to the children was irrational because it was impossible for  the
    sponsor to prove a negative.  He submitted that the judge had failed to
    take proper account of the letter from the Red Cross in July 2014 or to
    the letter from the Social Court in Ethiopia.  He had  failed  to  give
    sufficient  reasons  to  enable  the  sponsor  and  the  appellants  to
    understand why they  had  lost  in  accordance  with  the  decision  in
    Budhathoki (Reasons for decision) [2014] UKUT 00341.

14.  Mr Tarlow submitted that the judge's findings  were  properly  open  to
    him for the reasons he gave.  It simply could  not  be  said  that  the
    judge had reached a decision on the issue of sole responsibility  which
    was not open to him on the evidence.  Whilst the judge had not referred
    specifically to s.55 it  was  significant  that  he  had  made  express
    findings that he was not satisfied that the children had been  deported
    from Eritrea. He had been entitled  to  find  that  responsibility  was
    shared between the parents.

Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law

15.  The primary submission made on behalf of the  appellants  is  that  the
    judge erred in law by failing to  make  it  clear  whether  or  not  he
    accepted that the children were in Ethiopia.  However,  the  judge  did
    say at the end of [26]  that  he  did  not  accept  that  even  if  the
    appellant and his brother were residing in Ethiopia that  their  father
    was no longer involved in their lives.  That comment must be looked  at
    in the context of the judge's findings  as  a  whole.   The  judge  had
    accepted that from 2001 to 2014 the appellants were with  their  father
    in Eritrea.  He specifically did not accept  the  evidence  that  their
    father  had  set  in  process  events  which  led  to  the   children's
    deportation from Eritrea.  He found that this was not credible  on  the
    basis that he had maintained the children since  2001  in  Eritrea  and
    there was no documentary evidence to show that the  appellants  had  in
    fact been deported or that it had  been  in  response  to  the  sponsor
    stopping sending him money.  He  found,  in  any  event,  that  it  was
    unlikely that the appellants' father had become reliant on monies  from
    the sponsor which were either not sent at all or on an irregular basis.



16.  I am satisfied that the judge's finding on the  issue  of  whether  the
    appellant and his brother had been deported from Eritrea  was  properly
    open to him for the reasons he gave.  Having rejected the  account  and
    explanation of how the appellants came to be living in Ethiopia, it was
    open to him to take the view that  it  was  likely  that  their  father
    continued to be involved  in  their  lives  in  the  period  from  2014
    onwards.  I am therefore not satisfied that the judge erred in  law  by
    failing to make a specific finding on whether the  appellants  were  in
    Ethiopia.  It is clear that the judge did not accept substantial  parts
    of the evidence and in consequence the appellants failed  to  discharge
    the onus of showing that they could meet the requirements of the Rules.
    The judge has referred at  points  in  his  findings  to  the  lack  of
    substantiation of the claims but when the decision is read as a whole I
    am not  satisfied  that  the  judge  was  requiring  corroboration  but
    commenting, as he was entitled to  do,  on  the  absence  of  evidence,
    particularly in  relation  to  issues  such  as  the  appellants  being
    deported from Eritrea.  The judge was entitled to find that even if the
    appellants were now living in Ethiopia, he was not  satisfied  that  it
    had been shown that the sponsor had sole responsibility for them.

17.  It is also argued that the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    letter from the Social Court but he referred to it  in  [15]  and  this
    document  as  translated  simply  records  the  confirmation  from  the
    witnesses that the appellants were living in Ethiopia.  It adds  little
    of  substance  to  the  issue  of  whether   the   sponsor   had   sole
    responsibility for the children. It was for the judge  to  decide  what
    weight to give to that document in the  light  of  the  evidence  as  a
    whole. The judge was also aware of, and took into account,  the  letter
    from the Red Cross of 23 July 2014.

18.  I was referred to the decision in Budhathoki where  the  Tribunal  said
    that it was generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier Tribunal
    judgments to rehearse every detail and issue raised in a  case  but  it
    was,  however,  necessary  for  judges  to  identify  and  resolve  key
    conflicts in the evidence and explain in clear and  brief  terms  their
    reasons so that the parties could understand why they had won or  lost.
    I am satisfied that the judge did this.  He made it  clear  that  there
    were significant parts of the sponsor's evidence about the  history  of
    responsibility for the children which he did not accept.  He  explained
    why he was not satisfied that the sponsor had shown that  she  had  had
    sole responsibility since 2014.  These were findings properly  open  to
    him for the reasons he gave.

19.  I am not satisfied there is any substance  in  the  argument  that  the
    judge erred by failing to refer to s.55.  The  best  interests  of  the
    children are clearly encompassed by the provisions  of  para  297  and,
    having found that the appellants failed to  meet  the  requirements  of
    that Rule, there was no need for the judge to  deal  specifically  with
    s.55. In any event the judge was not satisfied  that  their  father  no
    longer had any involvement in responsibility for their care.

20.  The  judge's  comment  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  the
    sponsor's claim that she stopped sending money to the children and that
    this finding was irrational as it involved proving a  negative  has  no
    substance.  It was for the judge to assess the evidence and  to  decide
    which evidence he accepted and which he rejected.   There  is  also  no
    substance in the ground criticising the  judge  for  his  finding  that
    family life could continue via modern forms of  communication.  In  the
    light of his findings of fact, he was entitled to comment  that  family
    life could continue as before.

21.  In summary, the onus was on the appellants to show that they  could  to
    meet the requirements of the Rules.  They  failed  to  do  so  for  the
    reasons the judge gave. He reached findings  and  conclusions  properly
    open to him. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the  judge  erred  in
    law.

22.  At the beginning of the hearing Mr Lam made an  application  to  adduce
    further evidence, which had not been before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    It was my view that the application was premature and that the evidence
    sought to be relied on related to issues of fact and could not  support
    an argument that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law on the  basis
    of the  evidence  produced  at  that  hearing.   If  there  is  further
    evidence, which casts a different light on the facts, it is open to the
    appellants to make a further application.

Decision

23.  I am not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law  and  in
    these circumstances its decision stands.  No anonymity order  was  made
    by the First-tier Tribunal.
