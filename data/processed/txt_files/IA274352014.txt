                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  PJM  Hollingworth  on  6
           February 2015 against the decision  and  reasons  of  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Hanley who had allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal
           against the Appellant's decision dated 18 June 2014 to refuse to
           grant the Respondent leave to remain on Article  8  ECHR  family
           and private life grounds outside the Immigration  Rules  and  to
           remove him from the United Kingdom. The decision and reasons was
           promulgated on 17 December 2014.


      2.    The Respondent is a national of Nigeria.  His date of birth  was
           given as 16 November 1979.  He had entered the United Kingdom as
           a student on 25 August 2004, which leave had been extended until
           31 October 2007.  His next application was out of time  and  was
           refused.  An attempted appeal was struck out on 4 February 2010.
            On 12 June 2014 the Respondent made his application  for  leave
           to remain outside the Immigration Rules.  This was refused on 18
           June 2014 when Removal Directions were made.


      3.    Judge Hanley found that  the  Respondent  met  the  relationship
           requirements of Appendix FM through his wife  Mrs  Katie  Akiode
           ("Mrs Akiode"), a  British  Citizen.  He  considered  that  EX.1
           applied and that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
           continuation of family  life  between  the  spouses  in  Nigeria
           because of Mrs Akiode's deep ties to  the  United  Kingdom:  see
           [41] of the decision and reasons.  He allowed the  appeal  under
           the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 ECHR.


      4.    Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
           Appellant  was  granted  by  Judge   Hollingworth   because   he
           considered that it was arguable that the  judge  had  failed  to
           consider Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1  not  free  standing)  [2014]
           UKUT 00063 (IAC), nor had he  considered  whether  it  would  be
           proportionate to require the Respondent to return to Nigeria  to
           make an entry clearance application from there.


      5.    Standard directions were made by the Upper Tribunal.




      Submissions - error of law


      6.    Mr Duffy for the Secretary of State submitted that  this  was  a
           clear case of legal error in relation to Appendix  FM  and  also
           the Article 8 ECHR claim, as the grant of permission  to  appeal
           by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  indicated.  There  was  no  undue
           hardship  in  the  Respondent's  making   an   entry   clearance
           application in the usual way after  returning  to  Nigeria.   No
           exceptional circumstances had been identified by the judge which
           made that an onerous or superfluous requirement.  The judge  had
           not considered VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5 and  the  level  of
           seriousness test, merely matters  of  choice  or  inconvenience.
           His decision and reasons should be set aside and  remade.   (The
           procedural unfairness allegations made in  the  application  for
           permission to appeal were not pursued.)


      7.    Mr  Jibowla  for  the  Respondent  submitted  that  the  judge's
           findings  had  been  open  to  him  and  were   based   on   the
           proportionality assessment which remained  a  requirement.   The
           proposed disruption to the family life of the Respondent and his
           British Citizen wife which would result  from  his  removal  was
           disproportionate  because  there  was  no  public  interest   in
           requiring the Respondent to return to Nigeria to make  an  entry
           clearance application.    The judge had found that  there  would
           be no charge on public funds.  Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 applied.
            The decision and reasons should stand.




      The error of law finding


      8.    At the conclusion of submissions, the tribunal indicated that it
           found that the judge had fallen into material error of law,  for
           the reasons succinctly indicated in the grant of  permission  to
           appeal  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  judge  had  found,
           correctly that the Respondent had been an overstayer since 2007.
            Indeed he was not impressed by the Respondent's evidence as  to
           his immigration history: see [35] of the decision  and  reasons.
           The judge found as fact that  that  the  Respondent's  wife  had
           known that the Respondent had no basis of stay at the outset  of
           their relationship, i.e., that the relationship had been  formed
           in full knowledge of the probable consequences of the absence of
           leave to remain.  There was  no  evidence  that  the  Respondent
           faced any risk on return to Nigeria or would,  for  example,  be
           unable to practise his religion.


      9.    In the light of the judge's plain findings, it is  not  easy  to
           see why the judge gave no consideration at all  to  the  obvious
           possibility that the Respondent (without or  without  his  wife)
           could return to Nigeria to seek entry clearance as a spouse from
           there.  While the judge was entitled to  find  that  Mrs  Akiode
           could not be expected to live in Nigeria against her wishes,  it
           was necessary to examine all  of  the  practical  possibilities.
           The judge omitted to  identify  any  matter  which  justified  a
           departure from the  Immigration  Rules.   No  case  for  special
           treatment of the Respondent and sponsor was identified.  Indeed,
           on the facts as found by him, none existed.  The judge  was  not
           entitled to proceed further.


      10.   Sabir (above) should have been cited to the judge,  which  would
           have avoided  the  misapplication  of  EX.1.   The  claim  under
           Appendix FM had already failed and was not saved  by  EX.1.  The
           proportionality analysis was faulty because  no  undue  hardship
           would result from compliance with Appendix FM. The  decision  of
           the First-tier Tribunal was set aside for material error of law.
            The decision had therefore to be  remade.   Both  parties  were
           willing for the rehearing to proceed immediately.




      The rehearing


      11.   Since the Immigration Rules could not  be  met,  the  only  live
           issue was Article 8 ECHR.  The claim needed to be reheard on the
           basis of the facts as at the date of the  rehearing  before  the
           Upper Tribunal, although for these purposes there  had  been  no
           material changes since the hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal.
           Sections 117 A-D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
           2002 applied. For clarity the tribunal will  now  refer  to  the
           parties by their designations in the First-tier Tribunal.


      12.   No additional submissions were needed as all relevant points had
           been discussed earlier.




      Discussion and fresh decision


      13.   There was no significant dispute of fact in this appeal  and  it
           was accepted that the Appellant and his wife enjoy  family  life
           together.  The tribunal finds that the Appellant  and  his  wife
           are living together and that Mrs Akiode is able to  satisfy  the
           financial requirements of Appendix FM.  The problem is that  the
           Appellant is unable to satisfy the Immigration Rules because  he
           is a long term overstayer who has refused to  leave  the  United
           Kingdom despite the absence of any leave to remain.


      14.   Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) applies  to
           the Appellant's limited private life in the United Kingdom.  His
           intention as a student was to return to Nigeria and it was  only
           meeting his fiancï¿½e/wife  which  changed  that.   There  was  no
           factor in  the  Appellant's  private  life  which  the  tribunal
           considers was such as to  require  the  Secretary  of  State  to
           consider the exercise of her discretion outside the  Immigration
           Rules, as the Appellant can practise his religion in Nigeria.


      15.   The fact that the Appellant meets some of the factors listed  in
           section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
           does not create a right for him to stay in the  United  Kingdom.
           They are merely factors which must be taken into  consideration,
           and the tribunal has done so.  It is plain that the  Appellant's
           family life was created at a time when he had no status  in  the
           United Kingdom, i.e., was "precarious".  There is  no  need  for
           the  tribunal  to  refer  the  Appellant's  claim  back  to  the
           Secretary of State  in  order  to  consider  whether  there  are
           exceptional circumstances which might require the grant of leave
           to remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  because  there  is
           nothing which has such potential, as will be  explained  further
           below.


      16.   While it would in theory be possible for the Appellant's wife to
           accompany him to Nigeria, since there would be no risk  of  harm
           to either of them and it may be safely inferred that there would
           be support available from the Appellant's family,  if  any  such
           stay were prolonged, the wife's work would be interrupted.   She
           would be separated  from  her  family,  although  obviously  the
           Appellant would be separated from  his  if  he  settles  in  the
           United  Kingdom.   There  would,  however,  be  little  if   any
           difficulty in the wife's accompanying the Appellant  to  Nigeria
           for a visit.


      17.   It was argued that the temporary separation of the couple  would
           be  unduly  or  unjustifiably  harsh  and  thus  an  exceptional
           circumstance.  The tribunal disagrees.  If the Appellant chooses
           to return to Nigeria alone they can maintain contact through the
           usual means, including email, Skype and SMS texts.


      18.   If that were a mistaken or incomplete view for any  reason,  the
           live  issue  applying  the  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  tests   is
           proportionality.   The  legitimate  objective   is   immigration
           control, which embraces  many  related  matters.   An  important
           aspect of immigration control for the purposes  of  the  present
           appeal is that  the  decision  as  to  which  non  citizens  are
           permitted to settle in the United Kingdom is  not  a  matter  of
           private choice, whether or not there will be any measurable cost
           or indeed  potential  economic  benefit  from  such  settlement.
           There has to be a rule, democratically determined, which applies
           to all.  Those rules, already strict, were made far stricter  by
           parliament from 9 July 2012 onwards, a process which  continues.




      19.   Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 is inapplicable, because the  Appellant
           is  unable  to  meet  the  Immigration  Rules   and   faces   no
           difficulties in Nigeria.  He has no right to be  in  the  United
           Kingdom.  The requirement for him to leave the United Kingdom is
           not an arid bureaucratic exercise.


      20.   In the tribunal's view, the proportionality balance  is  against
           the  Appellant.   He  is  simply  being  required  to  meet  the
           Immigration Rules which apply to everyone.  His removal  to  his
           home country cannot be regarded  as  unreasonable  nor  will  it
           create consequences which can sensibly be considered  as  unduly
           harsh for him or for his British Citizen spouse.


      21.   Thus, however the Appellant's appeal is analysed, it must fail.


      22.   There was no application for  an  anonymity  direction  and  the
           tribunal sees no need for one.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision involved the making  of  an  error
on    a point of law.  The tribunal allows the onwards appeal to  the  Upper
Tribunal,  sets  aside  the  original  decision  and  remakes  the  original
decision    as follows:

      The appeal is dismissed

      Signed                                 Dated


      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell


      TO THE RESPONDENT
      FEE AWARD


      The appeal was dismissed and so there can be no fee award


      Signed                                  Dated


      Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell
