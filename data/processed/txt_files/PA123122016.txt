Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Odair (counsel for Schneider Goldstein
Immigration Law)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, appeals against the  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal of 2 December 2016 dismissing his  appeal,
       itself brought against the refusal of his asylum claim on 21  October
       2016.


    2. The Appellant was previously refused entry  clearance  as  a  working
       holidaymaker; the appeal he  brought  from  abroad  succeeded,  Judge
       Blandy finding on 28 April 2009 that he had provided cogent  evidence
       as to maintenance and  accommodation,  and  had  sufficient  ties  in
       Bangladesh including family and work that his intention to remain  in
       the UK temporarily was a credible one.


    3. The Appellant took advantage of the visa subsequently issued  to  him
       and entered the UK on 23 August  2009.  However,  he  did  not  claim
       asylum until 25 April 2016. His asylum claim is outlined in the  Home
       Office  refusal  letter  and  the   First-tier   Tribunal   decision.
       Essentially his evidence is that he joined Jamaat-e-Islami  in  2007,
       and attended  a  demonstration  on  15  July  2008,  during  which  a
       disturbance ensued: he and several others were arrested and detained.
       He spent some 15 days in detention and  thereafter  was  required  to
       report to the authorities regularly. He did not openly support Jamaat-
       e-Islami after his release; he left the country on  23  August  2009,
       after the Awami League had come  to  power  leading  him,  like  many
       others, to flee the country to avoid the possibility  of  arrest  and
       mistreatment.


    4. In his interview he stated (questions 91ff) that he  had  attended  a
       demonstration  protesting  against  the  arrests  of  Jamaat-e-Islami
       leaders who had been publicly blamed for the country's troubles,  and
       against police corruption; the leader of the Sylhet branch of  Jamaat
       was in the course of giving a  speech  about  these  issues  and  the
       importance of taking a stand  against  them  when  the  Awami  League
       attacked  them.  There  were  some  30-35  people  present   at   the
       demonstration. He was attacked and "involved in the fighting". He was
       arrested and taken away to the Central Police station of Dorga  Gate,
       Sylhet. He was detained for 15 days, the first two of  which  he  was
       remanded in custody and thereafter kept in prison. He was beaten  and
       since then had feared the police. Whilst detained he was asked why he
       supported Jamaat and why he had been involved in the fighting.


    5. The Home Office refused the asylum application because his  knowledge
       of Jamaat was vague and he had been unable to  describe  the  group's
       flag or locate  its  headquarters;  additionally,  in  his  screening
       interview  he  had  recounted  arrest  and  detention  for  15   days
       notwithstanding that he had previously asserted himself to have  been
       of good character generally when he had applied for further leave. He
       had left Bangladesh using his own documents and his  family  appeared
       not to have suffered problems since his departure. His  asylum  claim
       was made unjustifiably late. He did not qualify for leave  under  the
       Rules giving effect to private and family life connections with  this
       country and had no compelling case for leave outside them.


    6. In his witness statement for the appeal, the  Appellant  stated  that
       when he sought legal advice from a named advisor he was told that  he
       was liable to detention in the Detained Fast Track process  in  which
       he understood that 99% of claims were refused. He  did  not  want  to
       take such a risk regarding his own asylum claim,  and  so  sought  to
       bring his concerns as to his safety in Bangladesh to the attention of
       the Home Office via  an  application  for  further  leave  to  remain
       outside  the  Rules.  In  the  application  of  25  July  2011,   the
       Appellant's representatives state that "as a result of the  political
       situation in Bangladesh [our client]  is  wanted  by  the  police  in
       Bangladesh for his political  affiliation  with  the  Jamaat-e-Islami
       party. Our client maintains he  is  innocent  and  has  done  nothing
       wrong"; the letter went on to state that their client  feared  arrest
       and torture in violation of Article 3 of the ECHR.


    7. His witness statement also sets out his  evidence  that  in  November
       2014 his brother informed him that his case had now gone to trial and
       on 11 November 2014 he had been sentenced in absentia to  four  years
       imprisonment. He retained fears about  the  DFT  but  claimed  asylum
       having heard that the system had been identified as unlawful.


    8. The First-tier Tribunal heard the Appellant's  appeal  and  dismissed
       it. As to the Appellant's credibility, it stated that he had  pursued
       a working holidaymaker appeal on the basis of maintaining that he had
       close relatives and friends in the UK that he wished to visit  whilst
       casually working here, and had represented to the  Tribunal  that  he
       had economic and social ties in Sylhet where he had worked for a long
       time. There was no indication therein  of  any  problems  that  might
       motivate an asylum claim. His asylum claim was made very late and his
       fears about the fast track procedure did not amount to a satisfactory
       explanation for not seeking asylum on an earlier occasion. It  viewed
       the documents from Bangladesh with a "high degree of  scepticism"  as
       they had been provided in the context of "Knowing that his  claim  to
       have been involved with Jamaat-e-Islami was in issue."


    9. He was not detained for a lengthy period and his claim to  have  been
       badly treated by the authorities was inconsistent with the  reporting
       regime to which he was subsequently  subject.  The  sentence  he  had
       subsequently received for the offence and failing to comply with  his
       bail  conditions  was  not  persecutory  behaviour  so  much  as   an
       appropriate punishment for participation in  a  violent  outburst  in
       2008. Had he been of significant adverse interest to the  authorities
       they had ample opportunity to visit harm upon him thereafter: but  no
       adverse actions were thereafter taken against him.


   10. At one point, the First-tier Tribunal stated that the  Appellant  was
       meant to have said that he did not want Jamaat-e-Islami to  establish
       Islamic law in the country but then added "I liked the way they  want
       to establish Islamic law in the country."


   11. The grounds for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal alleged


      a. The Appellant had given an explanation for claiming asylum late
         which was inadequately addressed given its centrality to the
         thinking of the First-tier Tribunal;
      b. The Appellant's supporting evidence included a volume of documents
         said to be original FIR, charge sheet, judgment and arrest
         warrant, which were apparently treated as genuine: yet there was
         no clear reasoning as to why the Appellant was found to be fleeing
         prosecution rather than persecution;
      c. The Judge below had erred in overlooking the challenge made in the
         grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, which had raised
         problems with interpretation at interview and asserted that it was
         procedurally improper to have made a decision on the asylum claim
         without having given the five days publicised in the Home Office
         interview policy for the making of submissions regarding errors
         and omissions in the interview record.


   12. Judge Baker granted permission to appeal for the First-tier  Tribunal
       on 30 March 2017 on the basis that the treatment of the  late  asylum
       claim was arguably erroneous particularly given the 2011  application
       had raised Article 3 issues.


   13. Before me Mr Odair argued  that  there  was  material  unfairness  in
       failing  to  address  the  allegation  of  interpreter  problems   at
       interview given the confused evidence at one point  recorded  in  the
       decision, and that the delay in claiming asylum had assumed excessive
       importance: the Appellant's proffered explanation had  been  rejected
       without adequate reasons. His account was plausible when read in  the
       light of the country evidence generally and he should have been given
       positive credit for that feature of his case.


   14. For the Respondent Mr Staunton argued that ample reasons  were  given
       for rejecting the Appellant's credibility and the  appeal  inevitably
       failed given those findings.


      Findings and reasons


   15. I reserved my decision. Having now considered the matter with care, I
       have  concluded  that  the  decision  of  the   First-tier   Tribunal
       represents an inadequate determination of the issues that were before
       it.


   16. As cited in the grounds of appeal, Swinton-Thomas LJ  stated  in  the
       unreported Court of Appeal decision of Wakene (IATRF 98/0113 CMS4;  1
       May 1998):


           "... care should be taken before  placing  undue  weight  on  an
           untruth told at the point of entry in order  to  get  into  this
           country. There may in certain cases be good reasons for  telling
           that untruth. Cases will vary depending on their facts  and  the
           personality involved. Some people arriving in this  country  may
           be in fear or may have very  little  understanding  of  what  is
           required of them."


   17. That enjoinder is consistent with other material sources of guidance.
       For example, UNHCR state in Beyond Proof - Credibility Assessment  in
       EU Asylum Systems, in the  section  addressing  Behaviour  Considered
       Indicative of the Applicant's Lack of Fear  of  Persecution,  at  2.1
       addressing Delay in applying for asylum:


           "The foremost concern of a person  in  need  of  protection  may
           understandably be to enter the Member State safely and securely.
           Therefore, it should not be assumed that a failure to apply  for
           protection at the port of entry or upon arrival is indicative of
           a lack of credibility. ...
           The  decision-maker  should  consider  whether  the  applicant's
           failure to apply for international protection  at  the  earliest
           opportunity was due to a  desire  to  achieve  security,  albeit
           temporary and in an irregular manner. ...
           UNHCR wishes to emphasize that an applicant should not be  found
           lacking in credibility merely on the ground that he or  she  did
           not apply for international protection at the earliest  possible
           time. Neither should a delay in application constitute a  ground
           to increase the threshold of credibility for the applicant."


   18. Delay in certain circumstances is  expressly  placed  on  a  decision
       maker's  agenda  by  section  8(5)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
       (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act  2004,  which  states  that  "This
       section also applies to failure by the claimant  to  make  an  asylum
       claim or human rights claim before being notified of  an  immigration
       decision, unless the claim relies wholly on matters arising after the
       notification." As recognised by the authorities interpreting  section
       8, the reasonableness of any explanation must  always  be  considered
       before a matter specified therein is held against an asylum seeker.


   19. It is accordingly clear that the relevance of delay is essentially  a
       question of fact for the decision maker  assessing  credibility,  and
       that the precise explanation  for  delay  must  be  addressed  as  to
       whether it is itself plausible. Here the Appellant  stated  that  the
       delay was down to legal advice as to  the  prospects  of  having  his
       asylum claim processed in the Detained Fast Track process,  in  which
       he was told that he would have had a low prospect of vindicating  his
       application.  His  advisor's  lack  of  confidence  in   the   status
       determination system may be depressing, but it is hardly inconsistent
       with the statement of the Master of the Rolls in The Lord  Chancellor
       v Detention Action [2015] EWCA Civ 840 �38 that


           "in view of (i) the complex and difficult nature of  the  issues
           that  are  often  raised;  (ii)  the  problems  faced  by  legal
           representatives of obtaining instructions from  individuals  who
           are in detention; and (iii) the  considerable  number  of  tasks
           that they have to perform ... the timetable for the  conduct  of
           these  appeals  is  so  tight  that  it  is  inevitable  that  a
           significant  number  of  appellants  will  be  denied   a   fair
           opportunity to present their cases under the FTR regime."


   20. Whilst that was said in the context  of  the  2014  Procedure  Rules,
       subsequently the earlier system was found to exhibit similar failings
       by Ouseley J in TN  (Vietnam)  [2017]  EWHC  59  (Admin).  Given  the
       consistency of  the  advice  with  these  judicial  findings  it  was
       incumbent on the First-tier Tribunal to carefully consider whether it
       was plausible that the advice and the Appellant's  reliance  upon  it
       might have justified a failure to claim asylum  sooner.  It  was  not
       open for the First-tier Tribunal simply to reject the explanation out
       of hand.


   21. The documents from Bangladesh received very little consideration  for
       the First-tier Tribunal. It appeared to discount them simply  because
       the truthfulness of the facts asserted therein was in issue. However,
       that appears  to  represent  just  the  line  of  thinking  that  was
       criticised in SS [2017] UKUT 164 (IAC) �30:


           "The expression 'self-serving' is, to a large extent, a protean
           one. The expression itself tells us little or nothing. What is
           needed is a reason, however brief, for that designation. For
           example, a letter from a third party may be "self-serving"
           because it bears the hallmarks of being written to order, in
           circumstances where the applicant's case is that the letter was
           a spontaneous warning."


   22. Once again, rather more detailed reasoning was required in order  for
       the claim to be determined with  the  anxious  scrutiny  that  asylum
       appeals demand.


   23.  Furthermore,  it  does  seem  that  there  were  problems  with  the
       interpretation at the original asylum interview, and that these  were
       sought to be drawn to the attention of the First-tier Tribunal in the
       grounds of appeal that launched the appeal before  it:  however  this
       was overlooked in the decision below. Given that  at  one  point  the
       First-tier Tribunal believed that Appellant  had  given  inconsistent
       evidence at interview as to his view as to the desirability of Jamaat
       establishing Islamic law  in  Bangladesh  where  a  somewhat  garbled
       answer is recorded at interview, this required express treatment.


   24. This is not an appeal where there are meaningful findings upon  which
       the Upper Tribunal can build, and thus it is allowed  to  the  extent
       that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

Decision

Remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House for hearing  afresh:  to
any Judge except Judge Cockerill.

ANONYMITY ORDER

I note  that  the  Appellant's  case  has  previously  been  subject  to  an
anonymity order. I consider it appropriate to follow that  approach.  Unless
and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
