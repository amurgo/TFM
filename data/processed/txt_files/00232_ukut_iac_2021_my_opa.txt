Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant claims to  be  a  citizen  of  the  Occupied  Palestinian
    Authority (OPA).  His date of birth is 1 January 1992.

 2. It is the practice of the Tribunal that an anonymity order is  made  in
    all appeals raising asylum or international  protection  claims.[1]  We
    see no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  direction  to  anonymise  the
    Appellant made by UTJ Pitt on 28 October 2020.

The background

 3. The Secretary of State seeks to deport  the  Appellant  pursuant  to  a
    deportation order dated 27 May  2015.  This  followed  the  Appellant's
    conviction on 10 July 2014 at Southwark Crown  Court  for  robbery  and
    assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was sentenced to 22
    months' imprisonment. The Appellant made an  application  to  have  the
    deportation order revoked. The Secretary of State refused to revoke the
    deportation order in a decision dated  16  March  2016.  The  Appellant
    appealed against this decision of the Secretary of State on the grounds
    that deportation breaches the United Kingdom's obligations  under  1951
    UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees ('Refugee Convention')
    and his rights under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of 1950 European Convention on
    Human Rights ('ECHR'). His  appeal  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge  Myers)  in  a  decision  that  was
    promulgated on 5 September 2016, following a hearing on 22 August 2016.



 4. The Appellant was refused permission to appeal against the decision  of
    Judge  Myers  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    However, he sought a judicial review of  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision
    refusing him leave by way  of  a  Cart  challenge[2].   Permission  was
    refused in the Administrative Court.  The Appellant  sought  permission
    to appeal this refusal to the Court of Appeal and eventually permission
    was  granted  by  Hickinbotton  LJ  on  17  March  2018.  In   granting
    permission, Hickinbotton LJ stated as follows:

         "In the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate course is to
         grant permission to proceed with the judicial review, and remit the
         matter to the Administrative Court.  The  Secretary  of  State  may
         wish to consider whether to concede the judicial  review,  so  that
         the matter is  remitted  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  which  might  be
         regarded as the most appropriate forum for the issue of whether the
         First-tier Tribunal determination is wrong  to  be  considered  and
         determined."

 5. A consent order was subsequently approved in the  Administrative  Court
    whereby the decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal  refusing  permission  to
    appeal against the First-tier Tribunal was quashed following the  grant
    of permission to apply for judicial review.

The "Error of Law" decision

 6. The matter came before Upper Tribunal Judge Craig on 19 September 2019.
    He found that the judge materially erred and  set  aside  Judge  Myers'
    decision in a decision dated 22 May 2020.  The  salient  parts  of  the
    error of law decision read as follows:-

         "28.     Since  the  hearing,  as  had  been  anticipated  when  AM
             (Zimbabwe) had  been  argued  in  the  Court  of  Appeal,  the
             applicant in that case had appealed  further  to  the  Supreme
             Court and his appeal was heard on 4 December last year.

         29.  Judgment in that case has only very recently been given (on 29
             April 2020) and the Supreme Court's decision  as  set  out  at
             paragraph 34 was that 'in the light of  the  decision  in  the
             Paposhvili case, it is from the decision of the House of Lords
             in the N case that we should depart today'.

         30.  In the judgment  of  this  Tribunal  now,  the  jurisdictional
             background under which  this  Appellant's  case  falls  to  be
             determined is  potentially  very  different  from  that  which
             applied when Judge Myers reached her decision.   Although  she
             was obliged to apply the law as it was believed to be  at  the
             time she made her decision (as was the Court of Appeal  in  AM
             (Zimbabwe)), the Supreme  Court  decision  in  AM  (Zimbabwe),
             having  regard  to  the  ECtHR  decision  in  Paposhvili,  has
             retrospect effect the consequences  of  which  is  that  Judge
             Myers' decision in this case was  not  reached  after  careful
             analysis of the law which,  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court
             decision in AM (Zimbabwe) applied.  While it may be that  even
             applying the most recent authority the Appellant's appeal will
             still not succeed, he is at least entitled to  have  the  case
             considered in light of the most recent  authority,  which  may
             include consideration of whether, and if so to what extent the
             decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  J  is  compatible  with
             Paposhvili  as  considered  by  the  Supreme   Court   in   AM
             (Zimbabwe).

         31.  One of the reasons why Judge Myers may not have  analysed  the
             Sprakab Report more fully is  because  in  the  light  of  the
             jurisprudence it was then believed  to  be,  as  she  observed
             (e.g. at paragraph 32),  even  if  the  Appellant  was  to  be
             returned to the Palestinian territories he still would not  be
             able to succeed under Article 3;  however,  in  light  of  the
             Supreme Court's decision  in  AM  (Zimbabwe)  this  might  not
             continue to be the case, because there has been no analysis as
             to the availability of treatment  which  the  Appellant  might
             require, let alone with regard to the suicide risk itself.

         32.  It follows that, although the judge was bound  to  follow  the
             jurisprudence such as existed at the  time  of  her  decision,
             technically her failure to have regard to decisions which  had
             not  been  made  by  that  time  was  an  error  of  law,  and
             accordingly her decision must be set aside and remade.

         33.  Accordingly, I make the following directions:-

         Directions

         1.   The appeal will  be  relisted  for  a  hearing  in  the  Upper
             Tribunal.

         2.   Consideration will be given as to whether the appeal should be
             reheard by a panel, and further directions will  be  given  to
             the parties in due course".

 7. On  28  October  2020  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Pitt  issued  directions
    following a case management hearing. She refused the Appellant leave to
    obtain an expert report  on  health  provision  available  in  OPA  and
    Morocco given the delay and cost that  this  would  require  and  where
    material on these matters will be available from other sources.

The Grounds of Appeal

 8. The Appellant appeals against the decision  of  the  Respondent  of  16
    March 2016 on the basis that return to OPA would mean he was at a  risk
    of treatment such as  would  breach  the  UK's  obligations  under  the
    Refugee Convention  and  his  rights  under  Articles  2  and  3  ECHR.
    Additionally, he submits that removal to either Morocco  or  OPA  would
    breach his rights under Article 3 ECHR (on health grounds) and  Article
    8 ECHR.

The issues

 9. We have to determine the following questions of fact;-

      a) Whether the Appellant is excluded from protection  of  the  Refugee
         Convention: Article 33(2) of the  Refugee  Convention  and  Article
         14(5)  of  the  Council   Directive   (2004/83/EC)   (Qualification
         Directive) with reference  to  s.72  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.

      b) Whether the Appellant is a citizen of Morocco or OPA.

      c) Whether the Appellant is at risk of persecution under  the  Refugee
         Convention on return to the  country  of  his  nationality  or  (if
         excluded from protection of the Refugee Convention) he is  at  risk
         of treatment including torture or "inhuman or  degrading  treatment
         or punishment" breaching his rights under Articles 2 and 3 ECHR.

      d) Whether returning the Appellant to OPA or Morocco will  breach  his
         rights under Article 3 ECHR on the  grounds  that  because  of  his
         mental illness he would face a real risk  of  being  exposed  to  a
         serious, rapid and irreversible decline  in  his  state  of  health
         resulting  in  intense  suffering  and   a   significant,   meaning
         substantial,  reduction  in  life  expectancy  ('Article  3  health
         grounds'). If not, whether the decision  breaches  the  Appellant's
         rights under Article 8 ECHR.

10. The final question involves a question of law, arising from submissions
    advanced by Ms Isherwood concerning the application of Y (Sri Lanka)  v
    SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 362 and J v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 629;  [2005]  Imm
    AR 409 following Paposhvili v Belgium 2016 ECHR 41738/10; [2017] Imm AR
    867  and AM (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2020] UKSC 17; [2020] Imm AR 1167.

The law

11. For the reasons we go on to explain, this  appeal  is  allowed  on  the
    Article 3 health grounds. We will start with setting  out  the  law  in
    respect of Article 3 health cases because, in our  view,  this  is  the
    determinative issue in this appeal.

12. The Grand Chamber in Paposhvili  recast  the  test  to  be  applied  in
    Article 3 health cases.  It expressed the view in  paragraph  182  that
    the approach to health cases  should  be  clarified.   The  court  then
    stated as follows:-

         "183.    The Court  considers  that  the  "other  very  exceptional
         cases" within the meaning of the  judgment  in  N.  v.  the  United
         Kingdom (� 43) which may raise an issue under Article 3  should  be
         understood to refer  to  situations  involving  the  removal  of  a
         seriously ill person in which substantial grounds have  been  shown
         for believing that he or she, although  not  at  imminent  risk  of
         dying, would face a  real  risk,  on  account  of  the  absence  of
         appropriate treatment in the  receiving  country  or  the  lack  of
         access to such treatment, of being exposed to a serious, rapid  and
         irreversible decline in his or her state  of  health  resulting  in
         intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy.
         The Court points out that these situations  correspond  to  a  high
         threshold for the application of Article 3  of  the  Convention  in
         cases concerning the  removal  of  aliens  suffering  from  serious
         illness."

13. The Court of Appeal analysed the effect of Paposhvili (AM (Zimbabwe)  v
    SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 64; [2018] Imm AR 737). It was  the  court's  view
    that the decision relaxed the N test (N  v  United  Kingdom  2008  ECHR
    26565/05; [2008] Imm AR 657) for violation of Article 3 in the case  of
    a foreign national with a medical condition  "only  to  a  very  modest
    extent". On appeal, the Supreme  Court  in  AM  in  explaining  why  it
    disagreed with the Court of Appeal's approach stated as follows:

         29.      The criticism of the above passage made by  the  appellant
             and by the AIRE Centre largely relates to the second sentence.
             In relation, however, to  the  first  sentence,  they  suggest
             that, irrespective of the precise meaning, in context,  of  "a
             significant reduction in life expectancy" in para 183  (as  to
             which see para 31 below), the paraphrase of  "death  within  a
             short time" favoured  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  may  not  be
             entirely accurate. In relation to the second  sentence,  their
             criticism is directed  to  the  words  "the  imminence  (i.e.,
             likely 'rapid' experience)  of  ...  death  in  the  receiving
             state" attributable to the non-availability of treatment. They
             point out that the Grand Chamber was addressing exposure "to a
             serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or her state of
             health resulting in intense  suffering  or  to  a  significant
             reduction in life expectancy"  (italics  supplied);  and  they
             contend that the Court  of  Appeal  has  misinterpreted  those
             words so as to refer to  a  serious,  rapid  and  irreversible
             decline in his or her state of  health  resulting  in  intense
             suffering or in a significant reduction  in  life  expectancy.
             The Secretary of State, for her part, rejects their  criticism
             as narrow and syntactical, apt perhaps to the construction  of
             a statute but inapt  to  the  present  context  in  which  the
             meaning of para 183  should  be  informed  by  "case  law  and
             realism". Her reference  to  case  law  turns  out  to  be  an
             indorsement of the questionable conclusion  of  the  Court  of
             Appeal that in the Paposhvili case the Grand Chamber  approved
             its decision in the N case. What  remains  is  her  reference,
             rather undeveloped, to realism.

         30.  There is,  so  I  am  driven  to  conclude,  validity  in  the
             criticism of the Court of Appeal's interpretation of  the  new
             criterion. In its first sentence the reference  by  the  Grand
             Chamber to "a significant reduction  in  life  expectancy"  is
             interpreted as "death within a short time". But then,  in  the
             second  sentence,  the  interpretation   develops   into   the
             "imminence ... of ... death"; and,  as  is  correctly  pointed
             out, this is achieved by  attributing  the  words  "rapid  ...
             decline" to life expectancy when, as written, they apply  only
             to "intense suffering". The result is that in two sentences  a
             significant reduction in life expectancy has become translated
             as the imminence of death. It is too much of a leap.

         31.  It remains, however, to consider what the  Grand  Chamber  did
             mean by its reference to a  "significant"  reduction  in  life
             expectancy in para 183 of its judgment in the Paposhvili case.
             Like the skin of a chameleon, the adjective takes a  different
             colour so as to suit a different  context.  Here  the  general
             context is inhuman treatment; and the  particular  context  is
             that the alternative  to  "a  significant  reduction  in  life
             expectancy" is "a serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in
             ...  health  resulting  in  intense  suffering".  From   these
             contexts  the   adjective   takes   its   colour.   The   word
             "significant"  often  means  something  less  than  the   word
             "substantial". In context, however, it must in  my  view  mean
             substantial. Indeed, were a reduction in life expectancy to be
             less than substantial, it would not attain the  minimum  level
             of severity which article 3  requires.  Surely  the  Court  of
             Appeal was correct to suggest, albeit in  words  too  extreme,
             that a reduction in life  expectancy  to  death  in  the  near
             future is  more  likely  to  be  significant  than  any  other
             reduction. But even a reduction to death in  the  near  future
             might be significant for one person but not for another.  Take
             a person aged 74, with an expectancy of life normal  for  that
             age. Were that person's expectancy be  reduced  to,  say,  two
             years, the reduction might well - in this  context  -  not  be
             significant. But compare that person with one aged 24 with  an
             expectancy of life normal  for  that  age.  Were  his  or  her
             expectancy to be reduced to two  years,  the  reduction  might
             well be significant.

         32.  The Grand Chamber's  pronouncements  in  the  Paposhvili  case
             about the procedural requirements of article 3, summarised  in
             para  23  above,  can  on  no  view  be   regarded   as   mere
             clarification of what the court had previously  said;  and  we
             may expect that, when it gives judgment in  the  Savran  case,
             the Grand Chamber  will  shed  light  on  the  extent  of  the
             requirements. Yet observations on them may even  now  be  made
             with reasonable confidence. The basic principle  is  that,  if
             you allege a breach of your rights, it is for you to establish
             it. But "Convention proceedings  do  not  in  all  cases  lend
             themselves to a rigorous application of [that] principle ...":
             DH v Czech Republic (2008) 47 EHRR 3, para 179.  It  is  clear
             that, in application to  claims  under  article  3  to  resist
             return by reference  to  ill-health,  the  Grand  Chamber  has
             indeed modified that principle. The threshold, set out in para
             23(a) above, is for the applicant to adduce evidence  "capable
             of  demonstrating  that  there  are  substantial  grounds  for
             believing" that article 3  would  be  violated.  It  may  make
             formidable  intellectual  demands   on   decision-makers   who
             conclude that the evidence  does  not  establish  "substantial
             grounds" to have to proceed to consider  whether  nevertheless
             it is "capable of demonstrating" them.  But,  irrespective  of
             the perhaps unnecessary complexity of the  test,  let  no  one
             imagine that it represents an  undemanding  threshold  for  an
             applicant to cross. For the requisite capacity of the evidence
             adduced by  the  applicant  is  to  demonstrate  "substantial"
             grounds for believing that it is  a  "very  exceptional"  case
             because of a "real" risk of subjection to "inhuman" treatment.
             All three parties accept that Sales LJ was  correct,  in  para
             16, to describe the threshold as an obligation on an applicant
             to raise a "prima facie case"  of  potential  infringement  of
             article 3. This means a  case  which,  if  not  challenged  or
             countered, would establish the infringement: see para 112 of a
             useful analysis in the Determination of the President  of  the
             Upper Tribunal and two of its senior judges in AXB v Secretary
             of State for  the  Home  Department  [2019]  UKUT  397  (IAC).
             Indeed, as the tribunal proceeded to explain in para 123,  the
             arrangements in the UK are such that the decisions whether the
             applicant has adduced evidence to the requisite standard  and,
             if so, whether it has been successfully countered fall  to  be
             taken initially by the Secretary of State and, in the event of
             an appeal, again by the First-tier Tribunal.

14. The above cases concerned appellants with physical  health  conditions.
    On 1 October 2019, in the Savran  v  Denmark  2019  ECHR  57467/15  the
    European Court of Human Rights applied the  Paposhvili  test  in  cases
    involving the expulsion of a criminal  with  a  psychiatric  condition.
    Richards LJ supported the application of  the  N  test  in  psychiatric
    cases in RA (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 1210; [2009] Imm AR  320
    at [50].  This was endorsed by the same court in Y, which approved  the
    six-part test in J, in suicide cases.

15. Brooke LJ in J said it was possible from the case law  to  amplify  the
    test and made 6 points. The fifth point was reformulated in Y.

16. The J test, as formulated at [26] to [32] notes: -

         "First the test requires an assessment to be made of  the  severity
         of the treatment which it is said that the applicant will suffer if
         removed.  This must attain a minimum level of severity.  The  court
         has said on a number  of  occasions  that  the  assessment  of  its
         severity depends on all the circumstances of the case.  But the ill-
         treatment must 'necessarily be serious such that it is 'an  affront
         to fundamental humanitarian principles to remove an individual to a
         country where he is at risk of serious  ill-treatment':  see  Ullah
         paras [38]-[39].

         Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between the  act  or
         threatened act of removal or expulsion and  the  inhuman  treatment
         relied on as violating the applicant's Article 3 rights.  Thus,  in
         Soering at para [91], the court said:

             'Insofar as any liability under the Convention is  or  may  be
             incurred,  it  is  liability  incurred  by   the   extraditing
             contracting state by reason of its having taken  action  which
             has as a direct consequence the exposure of an  individual  to
             proscribed ill-treatment' (emphasis added).

         See also  [108]  of  Vilvarajah  where  the  court  said  that  the
         examination of the Article 3 issue 'must focus on  the  foreseeable
         consequences of the removal of the applicants to Sri Lanka ...'

         Thirdly, in the context of foreign cases, the Article  3  threshold
         is particularly high simply because it is a foreign case.   And  it
         is even higher where the  alleged  inhuman  treatment  is  not  the
         direct or indirect responsibility of the public authorities of  the
         receiving state, but results from some naturally occurring illness,
         whether physical or mental.  This is made clear in para [49]  of  D
         and para [40] of Bensaid.

         Fourthly, an Article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a  suicide
         case (para [37] of Bensaid).

         Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a real risk of  a  breach  of
         Article 3 in a suicide case, a question of  importance  is  whether
         the applicant's fear of ill-treatment in the receiving  state  upon
         which the risk of suicide is said to be based is objectively  well-
         founded.  If the fear is not well-founded, that will tend to  weigh
         against there being a real risk that the removal will be in  breach
         of Article 3.

         Sixthly, a further question of considerable  relevance  is  whether
         the removing and/or the receiving state has effective mechanisms to
         reduce the risk of suicide. If there are effective mechanisms, that
         too will weigh heavily against the applicant's claim  that  removal
         will violate his or her Article 3 rights".

17. In Y the Court of Appeal stated: -

         "15. ... The corollary of the final sentence of �30 of J is that in
         the  absence  of  an  objective  foundation  for  the   fear   some
         independent basis for it must be established if  weight  is  to  be
         given to it. Such an independent basis may lie in trauma  inflicted
         in the past on the appellant in (or, as  here,  by)  the  receiving
         state: someone who has been  tortured  and  raped  by  his  or  her
         captors may be  terrified  of  returning  to  the  place  where  it
         happened,  especially  if  the  same  authorities  are  in  charge,
         notwithstanding that the objective risk of recurrence has gone.

         16. One can accordingly add to the fifth principle in J  that  what
         may nevertheless be of equal importance is whether any genuine fear
         which the appellant may  establish,  albeit  without  an  objective
         foundation, is such as to create a risk of suicide if there  is  an
         enforced return."

18. The fifth point was reformulated as follows: -

         "[...] whether any genuine fear which the appellant may  establish,
         albeit without an objective foundation, is such as to create a risk
         of suicide if there is an enforced return. [15]"

19.  Sir Duncan Ouseley in R (Carlos) v SSHD [2021] EWHC 986 (Admin) stated
    at [159]:

         "Article 3 and  suicide  risk:  this  is  another  facet  to  which
         Paposhvili and AM (Zimbabwe) apply.  It is for EC to establish  the
         real risk of a completed act of suicide.  Of course, the risk  must
         stem, not from a voluntary act, but from impulses which he  is  not
         able to control because of his mental state".

20.  Insofar as the judgment in AXB v SSHD [2019] UKUT 397  relates  to  the
    procedural aspects arising from Paposhvili, what  is  stated  at  [112]
    (replicated at paragraph 3 of the headnote) was endorsed by the Supreme
    Court in AM:-

         "The burden is on the individual appellant to establish that, if he
         is removed, there is a real risk of a breach of Article 3  ECHR  to
         the standard and threshold which apply.  If the appellant  provides
         evidence which is capable of proving his case to the standard which
         applies, the Secretary of State will be precluded from removing the
         appellant unless she is able to  provide  evidence  countering  the
         appellant's  evidence  or  dispelling  doubts  arising  from   that
         evidence.  Depending on the particular circumstances of  the  case,
         such evidence might include  general  evidence,  specific  evidence
         from the Receiving State following  enquiries  made  or  assurances
         from the Receiving State concerning the treatment of the  appellant
         following return."

21.  In respect of the obligations on the Respondent  following  Paposhvili,
    the Supreme Court stated at [33] as follows:-

         "In the event that the applicant presents evidence to the  standard
         addressed above, the returning  state  can  seek  to  challenge  or
         counter it in the manner helpfully outlined in the judgment in  the
         Paposhvili case at paras 187 to 191 and summarised at para 23(b) to
         (e) above. The premise behind the guidance, surely  reasonable,  is
         that, while it is for the applicant to adduce evidence about his or
         her medical condition,  current  treatment  (including  the  likely
         suitability of any other treatment) and the effect on him or her of
         inability to access it, the  returning  state  is  better  able  to
         collect  evidence  about  the  availability  and  accessibility  of
         suitable treatment in the receiving state. What will most  surprise
         the first-time reader  of  the  Grand  Chamber's  judgment  is  the
         reference in para 187 to the suggested obligation on the  returning
         state to dispel "any" doubts raised by  the  applicant's  evidence.
         But, when the reader reaches para 191 and notes the  reference,  in
         precisely the same context, to "serious doubts",  he  will  realise
         that "any" doubts in para 187 means any serious doubts. For  proof,
         or in this case disproof, beyond all doubt  is  a  concept  rightly
         unknown to the Convention."

The Appellant's immigration history

22. The Appellant claims to have entered the UK in 2006.  The Secretary  of
    State does not have a record of his entry.  In 2011 the  Appellant  was
    arrested for  attempted  theft.   He  was  remanded  in  Feltham  Young
    Offenders Institute (YOI).  He applied for asylum on 22 June 2011.   On
    14 September  2011  he  was  convicted  of  attempted  theft.   He  was
    sentenced to nine months in a YOI.

23. On 11 November 2011 his claim for asylum was refused.   On  5  December
    2011 the Appellant lodged  an  appeal  against  this  decision.  On  19
    December 2011 the decision was withdrawn by the Secretary of State. The
    application was again refused by the Secretary of  State  on  20  April
    2012.

24. The Respondent listed the Appellant as an absconder  from  27  February
    2013 until 19 March 2014.  On 10 July 2014 the Appellant was  convicted
    of robbery and ABH.  On 29 August 2014 he was sentenced to  22  months'
    imprisonment.  A deportation order of 27 May 2015  was  served  on  the
    Appellant on 5 June 2015.  The Appellant made submissions  on  23  July
    2015 asserting that returning to the OPA would breach his rights  under
    Articles 2, and 3 of the 1950 ECHR.

25. On 25 November 2015 the Appellant made further representations  seeking
    to revoke the deportation order. He relied on a medical report from  Dr
    Elizabeth Clark of 18 November 2015 (AB/114-136).  He submitted that he
    was a victim of torture and that inconsistencies in his account can  be
    explained by medical evidence.

26. At the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal the  Appellant  relied  on
    the evidence of Dr Clarke and Dr Arthur Anderson  dated  6  April  2016
    (AB/95-113). Before us the Appellant relied on a psychiatric assessment
    by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Galappathie  dated  30  December
    2020  (AB/12-47)  and  a  report  concerning  the  background  evidence
    prepared by Professor Joff� dated 2 January 2021 (AB/48-94).

The basis of the Appellant's protection claim

27. The Appellant's claim, in a nutshell, is that he fears  return  to  the
    OPA because of imputed political opinion.   His father was shot by  the
    Israeli defence force because he was a spy for  the  Palestinians.  The
    Appellant left Palestine when he was aged 11 and travelled to Egypt  by
    lorry.  He then travelled from  Egypt  to  Turkey.  In  Turkey  he  was
    pursued by the people responsible  for  killing  his  family.  He  then
    travelled to Malta before coming to the UK by lorry.



The Respondent's decision

28. The Respondent's case is that the Appellant is not credible. He is  not
    from OPA. He is a national of Morocco.   The  Respondent  relies  on  a
    linguistic analysis interview that was conducted on 4 November 2011 and
    dated 7 November 2011 (the Sprakab Report) and inconsistencies  in  the
    accounts given by the Appellant specifically in his asylum interview.

29. The Respondent relies on s.8 of the Asylum and  Immigration  (Treatment
    of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 concerning  the  delay  in  the  Appellant
    having made a claim on protection grounds. The  Appellant  is  excluded
    from  protection  of  the  Refugee  Convention/grant  of   humanitarian
    protection because there are serious reasons for  considering  that  he
    constitutes a danger to the community.

30. The Respondent acknowledges that the health system in the OPA is not  a
    on par with that in western countries; however, there are organisations
    that  the  Appellant  could  approach  there  for  help,  support   and
    assistance.  In respect of Morocco, the Respondent's position  is  that
    the Appellant would be able to  receive  sufficient  medical  treatment
    there.  As will be seen below, the Respondent changed her  position  in
    post- hearing submissions. It is now conceded that if the Appellant  is
    a citizen of the OPA, his claim should succeed under Article 3  (health
    grounds).

The hearing

31. At the start of the hearing Mr Fullbrook indicated that  the  Appellant
    was able to give evidence in English, however it was decided  that  the
    interpreter would  remain  at  the  hearing  to  assist,  if  and  when
    necessary.  Ms Isherwood had not prepared a skeleton argument. We  were
    surprised that in a case of such complexity,  the  Respondent  had  not
    thought it necessary to prepare a skeleton argument.  What we had  from
    the  Respondent  was  an  email  with  links  to  documents  containing
    background evidence.

32. During submissions we wanted Ms  Isherwood  to  specify  parts  of  the
    background evidence relied on and  explain  its  relevance  as  regards
    health care in both  OPA  and  Morocco.    However,  this  put  her  in
    difficulty and the information was not readily  forthcoming.  This  was
    frustrating for us. We thought it would  assist  us  to  give  her  the
    opportunity to do this in writing after the  hearing  and  to  give  Mr
    Fullbrook the opportunity to respond.

33. What we received in response were full written  submissions  presenting
    the Respondent's case in a way which bears little, if any,  resemblance
    to the oral submissions we heard. It goes well beyond  the  information
    we sought. It is a blatant attempt to re-argue the case.  It is obvious
    that the document should have been prepared for the  oral  hearing.  To
    seek to rely  on  it  after  the  hearing  potentially  undermines  the
    function of the UT.

34. There are two significant submissions now made that put the case  on  a
    different footing. Firstly, Ms Isherwood now concedes that the test  in
    Paposhvili applies to mental health cases.  She  denied  this  in  oral
    submissions. There is now  a  concession  that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed under Article 3, if the Appellant is found to be from the  OPA.
    In oral argument she  sought  to  persuade  us  otherwise.  It  is  not
    accepted that there is a lack of medical treatment. The  concession  is
    made on the  basis  of  "uncertainty  surrounding  UNSC's  most  recent
    recommendation at this current time." Secondly,  submissions  are  made
    for the first time about how the approach in J should  be  reformulated
    following Paposhvili and AM.

35. In response to Ms Isherwood's written submissions,  the  Appellant  has
    made  further  written  submissions.   It   is   submitted   that   the
    Respondent's written submissions  go  well  beyond  the  scope  of  the
    Tribunal's direction and amount essentially to an attempt  to  re-argue
    the case.  There is no reason why these submissions could not have been
    made at the substantive hearing.  There is also no reason why the legal
    submissions contained therein could not have been made  in  a  skeleton
    argument submitted before the hearing.  The Appellant submits  that  it
    would be procedurally improper and unfair to  the  Appellant  to  admit
    these submissions since to do so  (a)  frustrates  and  undermines  the
    purpose of oral arguments, and (b) creates additional costs contrary to
    the overriding objective.

36. We take on board  that  Ms  Isherwood  was  placed  in  the  unenviable
    position of advancing a case which had  not  been  prepared,  and  thus
    struggled to make submissions; however, the Respondent did not have the
    permission  of  the  Tribunal  to  make  full  written   post   hearing
    submissions. They are significantly different to oral submissions. They
    rely on legal argument which Mr Fullbrook has not had  the  opportunity
    to respond to orally.

37. It is incumbent on the parties to be ready to proceed to conclusion  on
    the hearing date in furtherance of the overriding objective.   Skeleton
    arguments should be produced prior  to  the  hearing.   There  must  be
    finality in litigation and the parties have a duty to be fully ready to
    conclude the hearing on the  hearing  date.  Failure  to  be  ready  is
    contrary to Rule 2 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 ("the 2008 Procedure  Rules"),  with  reference  to  the  parties'
    obligations to help further the overriding objective.[3] It is contrary
    to the principle  of  finality  in  litigation  and  raises  issues  of
    fairness, wasted costs and potentially  wastes  judicial  time.   If  a
    party is not ready, any attempt to rely on post-  hearing  submissions,
    without the permission of the  UT,  should  be  resisted.    It  is  an
    unsatisfactory way to conduct litigation.

38. We deprecate the approach taken by the Secretary of State in this case.
    However, having considered the written submissions  de  bene  esse,  we
    note (i) they contain concessions in favour of the Appellant (ii)  they
    contain for the first time coherent submissions on key issues  we  need
    to resolve (iii) Mr Fullbrook has been  able  to  respond  as  outlined
    below and (iv) for the reasons set out below they do not  result  in  a
    finding adverse to the  Appellant.  For  those  reasons  we  have  been
    prepared to consider the submissions and do not find  it  necessary  to
    reconvene the hearing.

The evidence

The Sprakab Report of 7 November 2011

39. The conclusions of the linguist who assessed the  Appellant's  language
    is that there is a very high certainty that his  linguistic  background
    is assessed to be north African, Moroccan.  The following is stated  in
    the summary of findings:-

         "The speaker masters Arabic to the level of a mother  tongue.   The
         speaker does not speak any  Palestinian  variety  of  Arabic.   The
         speaker's linguistic background is  with  a  very  high  degree  of
         certainty  assessed  to  be  in  north  Africa,  in  Morocco.   The
         speaker's stated linguistic background is assessed to have  a  very
         low degree of probability".

40. The Appellant was said to speak "grammatically correct Arabic according
    to a variety spoken in Morocco".  He uses words and expressions typical
    of north African Arabic in Morocco and examples of this are given.  His
    language usage displays phonological features typical of a  variety  of
    north African Arabic spoken in Morocco; again examples are given.

The Appellant's evidence

41. The Appellant was unable to remember the contents of  his  two  witness
    statements dated 22 August 2016 and 27 January  2021.  The  interpreter
    kindly agreed to assist the Tribunal by translating  them  to  him.  He
    then adopted the evidence as his evidence-in-chief.

42. The Appellant's most recent witness statement is in  similar  terms  to
    the earlier one. The Appellant was  extensively  cross-examined  by  Ms
    Isherwood.  He initially answered questions and then said he could  not
    remember in response to further questioning.

43. The Appellant's evidence is that he was born on 1 January 1992 in Gaza.
    His father worked for the Israeli government.    When  he  was  12  his
    parents and sister were shot and killed in their  home.  The  Appellant
    witnessed this but successfully hid so that he was not discovered.   He
    then ran to a neighbour's house. His grandfather  was  contacted.   His
    grandfather  took  him  to  another  town  and  then  to  Turkey.   His
    grandfather left him with a family that he knew and told  him  that  he
    could not return to Palestine.  He remained in Turkey for a few months.
    He cannot recall how many.  The people who killed  his  family  tracked
    him down in Turkey. He does not know how the  perpetrators  found  him.
    The Appellant had to leave Turkey. He escaped by bus and  travelled  to
    Malta.  When in Malta he was able to travel to Italy.  He  remained  in
    Italy for almost two  years.   During  this  time  life  was  difficult
    because he did not have a home, family and he was  destitute.   He  was
    attacked and shot in the leg.  He still has scars from this.

44. The Appellant came to the UK in 2006.  He did not claim asylum  because
    he was scared,  he  did  not  know  what  to  do.   The  Appellant  has
    difficulty remembering dates.

45. The Appellant has not had contact with his grandfather  since  he  left
    OPA.  He does not know if he is still alive.  Should he return  to  OPA
    he would be completely alone and have nothing.

46. He hears voices which tell him  to  harm  himself.   He  has  attempted
    suicide multiple times whilst in prison and after being  released.   He
    received some antidepressant medication in prison. It  did  not  always
    help.  He constantly felt depressed and anxious. The  voices  continued
    and got worse.

47. When he left OPA he was very young and all the Arabic speakers that  he
    has spoken to have been from North Africa. He thinks he may have picked
    up an accent.  He cannot remember much about his childhood and life  in
    OPA because of his mental health problems and  the  difficulty  he  has
    concentrating. He does not know who killed his father, all he does know
    is that his family were killed because of his father's  work  with  the
    Israeli government.

48. It is difficult for him to recall parts of his past and information was
    muddled in his head. When he was homeless, he did not have a GP and was
    not able to receive medication.  When he was interviewed  in  2011,  he
    was not receiving medication for schizophrenia. He was very confused.

49. The Appellant has not fabricated a story. He is sorry  for  the  crimes
    that he has committed here in the UK.  When he  was  arrested,  he  was
    homeless and not receiving medication.  Since he has started to receive
    proper treatment he now realises that his mental health  problems  made
    him unstable and contributed to his behaviour.

50. The Appellant was cross-examined.  He was asked whether he had  thought
    of going to the Red Cross to look for family members and he  said  that
    he had not. He said that he was frightened of everything and  has  been
    for years.  He does not know whether his grandfather is still alive, he
    does not know his grandfather's name.  His grandfather  told  him  that
    his father was a spy.   He  has  never  thought  about  approaching  an
    organisation to get death certificates for his family.  He is not  sure
    when his mental health problems started but he did hear  voices  before
    he left OPA. He did not agree with Ms Isherwood's  suggestion  that  it
    was the voices that he hears in his head which account  for  the  story
    about what happened to his family.  His response was that the voices do
    not produce stories but encourage suicidal thoughts.

51. The Appellant does not remember how  he  travelled  to  Turkey  or  the
    family with whom he stayed.  He said he does not  remember  his  claim,
    despite the fact that his witness statements had been read back to  him
    at the hearing.  He denied  being  from  Morocco  and  stated  that  he
    remembers his family being killed.  He did not  claim  asylum  when  he
    arrived, he did not know what it was. He was afraid.

52. There was no re-examination.

Dr Clark's evidence

53. Dr Clark examined the Appellant and identified  the  following  factors
    which she states are important in assessing risk of suicide  and  which
    are recognised as increasing a patient's suicide  risk  (see  paragraph
    6.11) and she listed them as follows:-

         ".   He has a clinical picture of severe depression  and  may  also
             have PTSD.

         .    He has reported having suffered significant loss events as his
             parents and sister were killed.

         .    He states that he has no family,  no  friends  and  no  social
             support.

         .    He has expressed hopelessness about the future as he  said  he
             has  no  future  (research  on  hopelessness  has   identified
             hopeless thoughts as the biggest  risk  factor  in  predicting
             suicidal behaviour in individuals with depression).

         .    He has reported a past history of attempted suicide by hanging
             (a previous attempt is a recognised important factor, and  use
             of a potentially effective method of suicide, such as hanging,
             is also suggestive of higher risk  of  future  attempts).   He
             also has  evidence  of  self-harming  (scarring  on  his  left
             forearm).

         .    He has features of psychotic  depression  or  other  psychotic
             illness (although this needs further  assessment)  and  it  is
             known that risk of suicide  is  much  higher  in  people  with
             depression  and  psychotic  symptoms  than  in  those  without
             psychosis, and also in people with schizophrenia."

54. In the same paragraph, the expert expresses concern that:

         "... [the Appellant] is at significant risk of  suicide,  and  that
         this could worsen if knew he (sic) were to be removed from the  UK.
         It is relevant that he has  said  that  the  voices  he  hears  are
         telling him to harm himself, which he might feel unable  to  resist
         if they become increasingly prominent when he is stressed.   It  is
         recognised in working with survivors of  abuse  that  a  subjective
         fear of further persecution tends to act as a 'stressor' and  as  a
         'retraumatising' factor."

    She states as follows:

         "Since [MY] has expressed a subjective belief that others  want  to
         kill him, I am concerned that if removed from the  UK,  his  mental
         state could deteriorate significantly.   His  depression,  possible
         PTSD and psychotic symptoms could become more florid, and  together
         with his hopelessness for the future could place him at significant
         risk of suicide.   Should  his  removal  become  imminent  I  would
         recommend a reassessment of his mental state and suicide risk".

55. Dr Clark comments extensively on the Appellant's inconsistencies in the
    accounts that he has given and she states at paragraph  6.12  that  the
    Appellant during the interview  she  had  with  him  demonstrated  some
    cognitive impairment.  She said that there are a number of reasons  why
    the  Appellant  may  have  reduced  cognition  and  poor  memory.   She
    identifies the following:-

         "(a)     His stated history identifies a lack of education, and his
             current and previous  level  of  intellectual  functioning  is
             difficult to determine.  He  has  apparently  not  learned  to
             speak English since arriving in the UK nine years ago (he said
             that he  had  some  English  lessons  in  Wandsworth  Prison),
             although this may be because of his social isolation.

         (b)   Psychotic  illness  itself  can  lead  to  poor  intellectual
             function e.g. due to distraction from hearing voices  and  due
             to negative symptoms of lack of motivation.  Additionally poor
             concentration and variable or  poor  memory  are  features  of
             depression and PTSD.  It is known that memory can be  variable
             and fluctuate with the severity of  current  mental  symptoms,
             whether these are symptoms of  depression  or  trauma  related
             symptoms and also symptoms of psychosis.

         (c)  Theory and research suggests that very high levels of  arousal
             are   inhibitory   in   the   encoding   and   retrieval    of
             autobiographical  memory  of  distressing   events   ...   the
             assumption that inconsistency of recall  means  that  accounts
             have poor  credibility  is  questionable.   Discrepancies  are
             likely to occur in repeated interviews.

         (d)   Another  possible  cause  of  his  memory  difficulties   and
             impairment of thinking is head injury.  In his stated  history
             he described being repeatedly beaten, including being  hit  on
             the head in Ostend when he was unconscious and had a  hospital
             stay of three days.  He may have had a traumatic brain injury.
              Brain injury may have long-term effects on memory, difficulty
             processing information and emotional effects  such  as  anger,
             which would accord with other symptoms he has  described.   As
             the Istanbul Protocol points  out,  it  can  be  difficult  to
             separate  out  the   effects   of   head   injury   from   the
             symptomatology of major  depression  and  PTSD  (see  Istanbul
             Protocol chapter VI, para 249 - see note 5)".

56. Dr Clark concludes that in her opinion it is "clinically plausible that
    difficulty in giving a consistent, detailed and chronologically ordered
    account may in [MY's] case be  due  to  the  effects  of  his  reported
    traumatic experiences and his mental state" (see paragraph 6.13).

57. Dr Clark  at  paragraph  6.14  considered  whether  the  Appellant  was
    feigning symptoms and stated:--

         "... Found nothing to suggest that he was trying to  exaggerate  or
         feign any psychological distress.  Additionally if  someone  wanted
         to fake serious psychiatric illness, I would expect them to put  on
         more obviously bizarre behaviour rather than remaining calm and not
         agitated as [MY] did".

58. It is Dr Clark's opinion (see paragraph 6.16) that the Appellant  needs
    a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to establish a diagnosis for his
    psychotic symptoms.  He is more likely to  receive  comprehensive  care
    for his mental health under community  psychiatric  services  where  he
    could be assessed, monitored and treated by a  service  such  as  "home
    treatment team" which could visit him frequently.  In her opinion  (see
    paragraph 6.17) the Appellant needs  further  assessment  of  his  PTSD
    symptoms and if he is diagnosed with this treatment which according  to
    NICE  guidance   involves   comprehensive   assessment   with   initial
    stabilisation  and  symptoms  control  followed  by   trauma   focussed
    treatment with an experienced clinician.

Dr Anderson's evidence

59. Dr Anderson  is  a  Registered  Consultant  Clinical  Psychologist.  He
    recorded the results of psychological testing which we  summarise.  The
    Appellant has PTSD and schizophrenia., elevated levels of  anxiety  and
    consistent with witnessing the death of his  family.   He  states  that
    "his deterioration in mental state, his symptom constellation, and  his
    avoidant behaviours in the presence of what  appears  to  be  a  formal
    thought disorder with paranoid delusions and self-  harming  tendencies
    are classic symptoms of schizophrenia".  His main risk  is  related  to
    schizophrenia and PTSD. As stress increases the effect of medication is
    reduced and symptoms return. This has drive him to live  rough  on  the
    streets and contributed towards is acquisitive and  violent  behaviour.
    With appropriate medication and oversight his risk can be manged in the
    community. With sufficient medication and one to one counselling and/or
    psychotherapy, he will be more capable of coping.

60. He was assessed as being at  high  risk  of  violence  to  himself  and
    moderate  to  others.   "If  managed  appropriately   with   adequately
    supervised housing, psychiatric intervention, and an  appropriate  plan
    for a patient who suffers from two major mental health  disorders,  his
    symptoms and overall risk level should diminish rapidly."

61. There is no possibility of the Appellant falsifying  his  responses  to
    the tests conducted.

Dr Galappathie's Evidence

62. Dr Galappathie is a consultant forensic psychiatrist. He  conducted  an
    examination of the Appellant on 24 November 2020. He took a  record  of
    the Appellant's history from what the Appellant said in his  interview,
    past psychiatric  history  and  information  from  health  records  and
    reports.

63. He made an assessment of the Appellant's  recent  progress  and  mental
    health at paragraphs 64 to 68.   He commented on the Appellant's mental
    state at paragraph 71-73.

64. He expressed his opinion in answer to the specific questions  asked  of
    him by the Appellant's solicitors.  His conclusions can  be  summarised
    as follows.

65. He  presented  as  an  individual  suffering  from  severe  depression,
    generalised anxiety disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
    paranoid schizophrenia/psychosis. It is likely that his  mental  health
    problems as directly caused by his experiences of trauma  within  Gaza.
    He is likely to  have  developed  PTSD  as  result  of  witnessing  his
    parent's and sister being killed exacerbated by periods  in  detention.
    His  mental  health  problems  are  consistent  with  his  account   of
    mistreatment.  He requires treatment in the United  Kingdom.  He  would
    benefit from ongoing follow up with his GP, anti-depressant medication,
    specialist psychological therapy. He will need stable accommodation and
    no fear of return to OPA in  order  to  meaningfully  engage  with  the
    therapy.

66. The prognosis depends on whether he can remain in  the  United  Kingdom
    and is able to access treatment he requires. It is, however, limited by
    the severity and long-standing nature of his mental health problems and
    underlying psychotic illness. His symptoms are chronic.

67.  His  prognosis  would  be  improved  by  his   willingness   to   take
    antidepressant medication, the provision of stable  accommodation,  the
    availability of treatment and the ability to engage in that  treatment.



68. Aggravating features in his case  would  be  an  uncertain  immigration
    status, fear of being returned to OPA (or Morocco)  and  his  psychotic
    illness which may  impact  upon  his  insight,  motivation  levels  and
    ability to engage with Mental Health Services at  times.   Homelessness
    is also likely to be a significant factor that would  adversely  affect
    his mental health and prognosis.

69.  Presently  the  Appellant  is  receiving  treatment  in  the  form  of
    sertraline 50 milligrams per day,  Zalwon  XL  50  milligrams  per  day
    (antipsychotic  medication   containing   quetiapine   slow   release),
    omeprazole  twenty  milligrams  per  day  (anti-acid  medication)   and
    inhalers for asthma.

70. Inconsistencies in the Appellant's account could be explained  by  past
    trauma. PTSD is likely to have "significantly affected his  memory  and
    that any absence of information or inconsistencies in his history could
    be related  to  the  trauma  of  the  events  that  he  outlines  ...".
    Psychotic  illness  by  way  of  possible  paranoid  schizophrenia   or
    underlying psychosis may impact on his ability to provide a  consistent
    account. It is likely that his mental health problems have also had  an
    adverse impact on his memory and ability to recall past  event.  It  is
    undertstandable that the Appellant has  signifcant  problems  with  his
    memory and recall for past events.

71. The Appellant has reported thoughts about self-harm and  suicide  on  a
    daily basis and thinks about cutting himself or  ending  his  life.  He
    reported a past history of self harm by way of cutting his abdomen with
    a piece of glass and attempting to hang himself while in prison (health
    records indicate  that  he  reported  suicidal  thoughts  in  2014  and
    attempted suicide in 2011 in HMP Wandsworth).  It is  likely  that  his
    suicidal thoughts are in relation  to  this  past  history  of  trauma,
    underling psychological distress and current mental health problems. It
    is likely that his fear of being removed to OPA or Morocco  is  causing
    him to have self-harm/suicidal thoughts. Such thoughts are  exacerbated
    by his uncertain immigration status, worsening mental health  problems,
    homelessness when  this  has  occurred,  isolation,  lack  of  support,
    worsening mental health and fear of removal.  The  Appellant  "presents
    with a high risk of self- harm and suicide" (see paragraph 128). He has
    a high number of risk  factors  (depression,  anxiety,  PTSD,  paranoid
    schizophrenia or psychosis, history of trauma, homelessness, difficulty
    engaging with mental health services, past history of self-harm and  on
    - going thoughts about self- harm).

72. If forcibly removed to OPA or Morocco, this is  likely  to  lead  to  a
    worsening of his mental health problems by way of  depression,  anxiety
    and PTSD and will increase his  risk  of  self-harm  and  suicide  (see
    paragraph 130).

Professor Joff�'s Evidence

73. Professor Joff� makes "three caveats to interpreting [the  Appellant's]
    narrative, given the reservations that have been recorded with  respect
    to it by the Secretary of State and an Immigration Judge".

74. He notes the evidence as to  the  Appellant's  mental  health  and  the
    impact on his ability to recall detail.  He  also  indicates  that  the
    Appellant appears not to have any schooling at all  and  is  presumably
    illiterate as a result.   He  says  that  this  is  surprising  because
    Palestinians are generally amongst the most literate populations in the
    Arab world, pre-schooling starts at 4 years old and formal schooling at
    6.  He opines that in Morocco pre-schooling starts at 4 and  compulsory
    schooling begins at 6 years old.  Thirdly he states  that  despite  the
    repeated contradictions in the  various  accounts  of  the  Appellant's
    claims, some elements have  remained  consistent.   He  has  repeatedly
    claimed that he was born on 1 January 1992 and  lived  in  the  refugee
    camp at Rafah in the Gaza Strip.  He has also claimed that  his  father
    was killed by unknown assailants, together with his mother and  younger
    sister,  [S],  because  his  father  was  accused  of  having  been   a
    collaborator with the Israeli forces in 2004.  He was  rescued  by  his
    grandfather after the shooting who took him for safety  to  Turkey  but
    from where he eventually  fled  as  the  persons  responsible  for  his
    parents and sister's deaths traced him there, so he travelled to  Malta
    instead.

75. In relation to the Sprakab Report the assessment is that  with  a  high
    degree of certainty the Appellant  speaks  Darija,  the  north  African
    dialect of Arabic and not the Palestinian dialect as  would  have  been
    expected had he come as he claims from the Gaza Strip.   The  Appellant
    has claimed in response that during  his  residence  in  Malta  he  was
    predominantly in the company of north Africans.  Mr Joff� concedes that
    he  has  no  grounds  to  dispute  the  conclusions  of  the   language
    assessment,  however  he  says  that  he  wonders  if  the  Appellant's
    counterclaim should be summarily dismissed as he was after all only  12
    or 13 years old and illiterate when he claimed to have  been  in  Malta
    and children do tend to mould their linguistic  styles  to  the  social
    environment in which they are located.

76. At paragraph 121 he considers the Appellant's situation.  He  considers
    the Gazan health system at paragraphs 92 to 95.   He  considers  health
    services  in  Morocco  at  paragraphs  99  to  106   and   specifically
    psychiatric and psychological facilities at paragraph 107 to  110.   He
    deals with psychosis and bipolar at paragraph 117 to 119.

77.  In  the  light  of  the  Respondent's   position   following   written
    submissions, it is not necessary for us to consider health services  in
    OPA.  Professor Joff� engages  with  the  health  services  in  Morocco
    (Appellant's bundle 76/84). His evidence can be summarised.

78. He doubts that the Appellant would be in a position to receive anything
    approaching the same level of appropriate treatment that  he  has  been
    receiving here.  There are serious social implications associated  with
    illnesses that should be taken into account.

79. Relying on an old Country of  Origin  Information  Report  (COI)  of  9
    November 2010, Professor Joff�  states  that  the  general  picture  of
    health  provision  is  that  adequate  medical  care  is  available  in
    Morocco's largest cities particularly Rabat and  Casa  Blanca  although
    not  all  facilities  meet  high  quality  standards.   Most   ordinary
    prescription and over  the  counter  medicines  are  widely  available.
    There are wide disparities between the public and private sectors.  The
    state sector provides healthcare free at the point of delivery although
    hotelling charges were introduced in the 1980s.  It consists  of  basic
    healthcare.  The Appellant would not be eligible for  funded  treatment
    in the state sector unless he were in employment  and  would  therefore
    have to pay for whatever treatment he  received  from  its  facilities.
    State provision is inadequate.  The situation  has  worsened  over  the
    past decade.  Mental health provision is  far  more  limited.  Moroccan
    families are particularly badly provided for.

80. In relation to psychosis and bipolar disorder  Professor  Joff�  states
    that there is very limited information available  on  these  disorders.
    In the public sector there is a critical shortage of  psychiatrists  or
    mental health workers, there is not  an  adequate  infrastructure  with
    only three centres capable of providing treatment  in  Casablanca,  the
    country's most popular city, and only 30%  to  40%  of  all  physicians
    trained  to  respond  to  mental  health  issues.    Often   antiquated
    facilities have closed and have not been replaced.

81. The Appellant could not expect to access in Morocco the drug regime  to
    which he is now habituated. He could not anticipate anything similar to
    the kind of hospital treatment and care that has been available to him.
     He could not afford the cost of the  private  sector.   State-provided
    medical services in Morocco are rudimentary by  British  standards  and
    social  services  are  extremely  limited  too.   The  only   treatment
    available to the Appellant would be recourse to the traditional medical
    sector which still plays a dominant role in Morocco.

Submissions

82. Ms Isherwood did not provide a skeleton argument or written submissions
    until after hearing. Mr Fullbrook relied on a skeleton argument at  the
    hearing. He has submitted further written argument, in response to  the
    Respondent's post hearing submissions.

83. We will seek to summarise the main points made by the parties. This was
    not as straight forward as it should have been because the Respondent's
    written submissions were different to the oral submissions on  material
    matters.

84. In oral submissions, Ms Isherwood relied on  exclusion.   She  did  not
    make detailed oral submissions and  did  not  refer  to  the  issue  in
    written argument.

85. In respect of the test to be applied, Ms Isherwood's  oral  submissions
    sought to persuade us that Paposhvili and AM do  not  apply  to  mental
    health cases and  that  the  N  test  applied.   However,  her  written
    submissions concern how AM should  be  considered  in  the  context  of
    Article 3 in mental health cases, emphasising that the  court  did  not
    accept that the meaning of "a significant reduction in life expectancy"
    could be anything but "substantial".  Neither did the court accept that
    there was  a  strict  requirement  on  the  SSHD  to  prove  that  such
    medication in the receiving state would be available.  The burden to do
    so remains on the Appellant to prove that it would not.

86. In written submissions the Secretary of State asserts that it is  clear
    that while Y, J and Bensaid v United Kingdom 2001 ECHR 44599/98  relied
    on the application of the N threshold as opposed to  the  now  modestly
    extended protection of AM, nonetheless in psychiatric cases  the  focus
    has always been on the treatment or lack of it in the receiving country
    and the impact that would have on the person.  J and Y test remain good
    law. This was touched upon in oral submissions; however, a  wholly  new
    argument was advanced in written submissions. Ms Isherwood proposed the
    following reformulation of  the  sixth  part  of  the  J  test  in  the
    following way: -

         "Whether the removing and/or  the  receiving  state  has  effective
         mechanisms to reduce the risk  of  psychotic  relapse  which  could
         expose the person to serious, rapid  and  irreversible  decline  in
         their  state  of  health  resulting  in  intense  suffering  and/or
         substantial harm to themselves or to others".

87. A further  issue  raised  for  the  first  time  in  the  post  hearing
    submissions is the endorsement of a seventh principle  to  include  the
    guidance provided by the Upper Tribunal in  AXB  at  [123]-  [125],  as
    reflected in [112]-[117] of the same; endorsed by the Supreme Court  in
    AM at [32].

88. The Secretary of State summarises its  position  in  the  post  hearing
    submissions in this way: -

      a) The obligation is on the applicant to raise a "prima facie case" of
         potential infringement of Article 3.  The burden being on  them  to
         prove that there are  substantial  grounds  for  considering,  that
         theirs is a very  exceptional  case  because  of  a  real  risk  of
         subjection   to   treatment,   resulting   from   the   foreseeable
         consequences of the removal [AM  at [32]; [108] of  Vilvarajah  and
         Others v United Kingdom 1991 ECHR 13163/87].

      b) The obligation on the authorities of a returning state dealing with
         a health case is  primarily  one  of  examining  the  fears  of  an
         applicant as to what will occur following return and assessing  the
         evidence [AXB at [123]].

      c) There is no freestanding obligation on a returning  state  to  make
         enquiries to the receiving state  concerning  treatment  or  obtain
         assurances in that regard [AXB at [124]].  Once a prima facie  case
         is established that in accordance with AM at [33] the Secretary  of
         State  is  not  obliged  to  dispel  "any  doubts"  raised  by  the
         applicant's evidence.

89. In respect of  the  Sprakab  evidence,  Ms  Isherwood  brought  to  our
    attention to the fact that the Appellant had not requested a transcript
    of the Sprakab interview.  She urged us to attach weight to the Sprakab
    Report.  In respect of Dr Joff� evidence, she said that  he  is  not  a
    language expert or  analyst.   In  written  submissions,  Ms  Isherwood
    develops this point referring to the  Appellant's  continued  assertion
    that the findings in the Sprakab Report results  from  his  interaction
    with friends who are  of  Algerian  descent.  The  Secretary  of  State
    submits  that  this  does  not  plausibly  address  the  report   which
    specifically points to a Moroccan dialect and not Algerian.   Secondly,
    the  lack  of  supporting  evidence  from   friends   supporting   this
    contention, is a clear indication that it is  not  a  credible  reason.
    This is further undermined by the ample opportunities the Appellant has
    had to provide such  evidence  given  the  length  of  time  since  the
    Respondent's first decision asserting the nationality dispute  and  the
    extensive appeal process resulting.

90. She submitted that the Appellant was evasive when giving  evidence.  He
    did not  answer  the  questions  posed  by  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative and merely relied on his inability to recall events  due
    to the passage of time.  He said he could not remember what was in  his
    witness statements although he had just had  them  read  to  him.   She
    submitted that the Appellant is from Morocco.   There  is  no  evidence
    that the Appellant has current  treatment  for  mental  health  issues.
    There are inconsistencies in the Appellant's account.  He was unable to
    answer questions before the Upper Tribunal,  however  he  was  able  to
    answer questions when interviewed and to various experts.

91. Ms Isherwood noted that Dr Galappathie's  evidence  is  silent  on  the
    impact of the Appellant's mental  ailments  on  his  long-term  memory,
    preferring  to  support  the  contention  that  his  short-term  memory
    capacity is "good" [AB/27 at 71].  Neither does the report suggest that
    the trauma suffered, or his mental health more generally are capable of
    negating his ability to give evidence.  It is not unreasonable for  the
    Secretary of State to expect the Appellant to have given  less  evasive
    evidence.   While  evasiveness  on  its  own   does   not   amount   to
    implausibility, looking at the evidence in the round, notably; the lack
    of reasoning for not explaining  the  Sprakab  findings  and  why  they
    should not be followed along with the  Appellant's  alleged  illiteracy
    being  at  odds  with  the  external  evidence  from  Professor   Joff�
    undermines the Appellant's evidence [AB/52 at  1].    It  is  submitted
    that on the balance of probabilities the Appellant  is  a  national  of
    Morocco and not from the OPA.

92. A concession is made for the first time in the written submissions.  At
    the hearing before us, Ms Isherwood  argued  that  treatment  would  be
    available to the Appellant in OPA and to  return  the  Appellant  there
    would not breach the United Kingdom's obligation under Article  3.  She
    had  difficultly  in  drawing  our  attention  to  specific  background
    evidence. The issue is now otiose. In written submissions,  it  is  now
    conceded that that  "in  this  instance,  considering  the  uncertainty
    surrounding UNSC's most recent recommendation  at  this  current  time,
    that returning MY to Gaza would amount to a breach of the Secretary  of
    State's obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human
    Rights".  There is no clear and detailed explanation given of the basis
    of the concession. However, this is not an  issue  we  need  to  engage
    with.

93. In oral submissions, Ms Isherwood drew our attention to  paragraph  126
    of Dr Galappathie's report which  says  that  there  is  a  significant
    history of self-harm, however, she said that there are no details given
    (in written submission it is  conceded  that  the  Appellant  has  made
    suicide attempts in the past).  She referred to Dr Clark's report.  She
    said that it represents the overall position in 2015 and therefore  not
    much weight can be given to it.   However, she then accepted  that  she
    could not get around what Dr Galappathie says  about  suicide  attempts
    and the Appellant's rapid decline.

94. In written  submissions,  the  Secretary  of  State  accepts  that  the
    Appellant is  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  and  that  he  has  PTSD.
    However, it is submitted that the Appellant has failed  to  demonstrate
    that the severity of the treatment would lead to  serious  irreversible
    harm. While the Secretary of State does not dispute  attempted  suicide
    in the past or that the risk of suicide would increase if  he  knew  he
    was going to be removed, the medical  reports  from  Dr  Clark  and  Dr
    Anderson are said to show that the Appellant's condition  will  improve
    if he were to access the cognitive therapy recommended and the  reports
    further  submit  that  his  mental  health  will  stabilise  with   the
    assistance of medication.

95. In the written  submissions  it  is  accepted  that  the  Appellant  is
    receiving medication; however, there is no evidence to support that  he
    has accessed treatment advised by specialists. This, according  to  the
    Respondent, demonstrates that his mental health is stable and  that  he
    has  not  suffered  a  psychotic  relapse  and/or  heightened  suicidal
    ideation and that medication has enabled him to carry on with  everyday
    activities despite  the  additional  treatment  or  therapy.   This  is
    significant as immigration  uncertainty  can  often  be  a  key  factor
    impacting a person's mental health.  Therefore, it cannot be said  that
    his current mental health meets the seriousness threshold of J and Y.

96. In written  submissions,  reference  is  made  to  background  evidence
    concerning Morocco and submissions made relating to it.  It  is  argued
    that the Appellant has not provided the Tribunal or  the  Secretary  of
    State with an explanation why he would be in genuine fear of  returning
    to Morocco.  There are clearly adequate  medical  care  and  facilities
    capable of treating and addressing the Appellant's medical condition in
    Morocco, this includes access to psychiatrists, mental health hospitals
    and provincial medical centres (see Professor  Joff�s  report  at  101,
    107, 110 and 116).  This is further supported  by  IOM's  2016  country
    fact sheet (Response to an Information Request Morocco:  Treatment  for
    mental health, dated 1 November 2018) which notes: -

         "The Moroccan health system is generally well  developed  and  well
         run in the cities, while the countryside  is  less  well  equipped.
         Cities also have private hospitals offering high quality  services.
         The  facilities  in  Moroccan  hospitals  outside  the  cities  are
         generally basic and old fashioned.  However, the medical care is of
         quality.  Since recently Moroccan  hospitals  are  modernising  and
         purchasing specialised equipment to be  able  to  provide  superior
         treatment".

97. In addition to that the MA MedCOI response, reference BMA 9581 dated 17
    May 2017  confirms  that  there  are  short-term  psychiatric  clinical
    treatments available.  This  includes  both  outpatient  and  inpatient
    facilities which can be accessed in both private and public  hospitals.
    The  report  further  confirms  the   availability   of   non-voluntary
    admissions to the Ar Razi, Rue Ibn  Rochd  Sal�  Hospital  which  is  a
    public facility.

98. It is accepted that due to the COVID pandemic, health services globally
    have been strained by the increased admissions  of  patients  requiring
    ICU assistance.  However, the Secretary of State avers that there is no
    evidence to suggest that this has depreciated Morocco's  capability  of
    treating psychiatric illness.

99. The  Appellant  has  stabilised  his  health  with  the  assistance  of
    sertraline, Zalwon and  omeprazole,  which  are  available  in  Morocco
    according to the MedCOI reference BMA 9581, dated 17 May 2017.

100. In oral submissions, Ms Isherwood stated that in relation to Article  8
    that there was no evidence of private life. She  did  not  accept  that
    Article 8(1) was engaged. In written submission, the Secretary of State
    avers support for the Court of Appeal's position in GS (India)  v  SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 40; [2015] Imm AR 608.  It  cannot  be  said  that  the
    Appellant is someone whose condition has been partially  stabilised  by
    the external factors existing in his private or family life established
    in the UK.  Neither can it be said that his condition incapacitates his
    ability to engage with  the  wider  community  or  to  form  and  enjoy
    relationships.

101. Mr Fullbrook relied on  his  skeleton  argument  at  the  hearing.   We
    indicated at the start of his submissions that we were  satisfied  that
    the Appellant should not be excluded from the  Refugee  Convention.  He
    did not need to address us on that point.

102. The Appellant relies on AM (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1123;
    [2017] Imm AR 6.  Ryder LJ set out a ("not  exhaustive  or  immutable")
    list of principles for  the  determination  of  asylum  and  protection
    claims (see [21]).  He drew our attention to these.[4]

103. In respect of  the  Sprakab  Report  the  Appellant  submits  that  the
    negative assessment of his credibility is misplaced for  the  following
    reasons: -

      1) The Appellant suffers from  severe  depression,  PTSD,  generalised
         anxiety disorder and paranoid schizophrenia.   Consultant  forensic
         psychiatrist Dr Galappathie has  confirmed  that  these  conditions
         would have an impact on  the  Appellant's  memory  and  ability  to
         recall  past  events,  especially  traumatic  ones.   Careful   and
         specific attention should be paid to every aspect of  such  medical
         reports, see Ibrahim v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
         [1998] INLR 511.

      2) The Sprakab Report results are  inconclusive.   The  Appellant  has
         explained he may have picked up a North African accent  because  he
         has spent time with North Africans from  a  young  age.   Professor
         Joffe  has  also  provided  helpful  observations  of  the  report.
         Furthermore, the Supreme Court in N v Advocate General for Scotland
         [2014] UKSC 30; [2014] Imm AR  981  warned  against  assuming  that
         Sprakab Reports provide certainty and stress the  need  to  examine
         them critically in the context of all the available evidence.

      3) The Appellant's account is supported by Dr Galappathie  who  states
         that his symptoms are likely to have been directly  caused  by  the
         Appellant's past experiences of trauma and are consistent with  his
         account of mistreatment.  The Appellant has explained that he  will
         be killed if he returns to  OPA.   His  fears  continue  to  deeply
         affect him.  The Appellant has also explained that the  people  who
         killed his family tried to find him and kill  him  in  Turkey.   If
         this is the case, then the Appellant plainly will not benefit  from
         sufficient protection in the  Gaza  Strip  particularly  given  his
         family's alleged association with the Israeli state and the general
         lack of protection there indicated in the Respondent's own guidance
         (CPIN December 2018).

104. He drew our attention  to  Savran  v  Denmark  in  which  the  majority
    decided that the decision in Paposhvili applies to mental health  cases
    and nothing in AM (would suggest otherwise.  He also relied on the case
    of R (Carlos) v SSHD.  There is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant  is
    feigning illness, he is at a high risk of suicide and the test in AM is
    met.  He relied on the evidence of Professor Joffe about the  state  of
    mental health services in OPA.  The Appellant's current treatment  here
    is  medication,  he  has  follow-up  appointments  with   his   general
    practitioner. The test is as set out in Paposhvili and confirmed by the
    Supreme Court in AM.

105. The Tribunal must ask itself whether the Appellant would  face  a  real
    risk, on account  of  the  absence  of  appropriate  treatment  in  the
    receiving state or the lack of  access  to  such  treatment,  of  being
    exposed to (i) a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in  his  state
    of health resulting  in  intense  suffering,  or  (ii)  a  significant,
    meaning substantial, reduction in life expectancy.  That this  judgment
    applies to cases involving mental illness and risk of suicide has  been
    confirmed by Sir Duncan Ouseley in R (Carlos) v SSHD.  It  is  for  the
    Appellant  to  demonstrate  that  there  are  substantial  grounds  for
    believing that such a risk exists; after that point, the  burden  falls
    to the Secretary of State to "dispel any doubts raised by it".

106. He drew our attention  to  paragraph  72  of  Dr  Galappathie's  report
    evidence and paragraph 9 of  Dr  Clark's  report.   He  relied  on  the
    Appellant's consistency in his evidence in relation to what he fears on
    return to OPA, namely the people who killed his family.  Dr Galappathie
    has found that he currently presents with "a high risk of self-harm and
    suicide" and that, if returned either to  Morocco  or  the  OPA  he  is
    likely to present with "an immediate and  high  risk  of  self-harm  or
    suicide".  It is clear that this risk will arise as  a  result  of  his
    removal and regardless of the availability  of  any  treatment  in  the
    receiving states. The Appellant has  plainly  demonstrated  substantial
    grounds in this case.

107. Even if the availability  of  treatment  were  relevant,  Mr  Fullbrook
    submits it is  clear  that  such  treatment  will  be  insufficient  to
    alleviate the risk of death  or  intense  suffering  arising  from  the
    Appellant's mental  illness.   Professor  Joff�  has  described  mental
    health treatment in the OPA as  "dire"  and  pointed  to  "a  desperate
    shortage of mental  health  specialists".   Professor  Joff�  has  also
    described the availability of public health facilities for  individuals
    with  the  Appellant's  serious  mental  health  disabilities   to   be
    "inadequate" and private facilities would not be affordable.

108. Mr Fullbrook's overarching submission is that deporting  the  Appellant
    to the OPA would lead to death or serious injury at the hands of  those
    who killed his family which would contravene Articles 2 and 3 ECHR, and
    that returning him to Morocco or the OPA would result in breach of  his
    Article 3 ECHR rights on health grounds which would serve as a  bar  to
    removal regardless of whether the Tribunal  finds  his  account  to  be
    credible or not.

109. In his written submissions in response to Ms Isherwood's  post  hearing
    submissions, Mr Fullbrook's primary submission is  that  they  are  not
    admissible. However, in the alternative, they are rejected.  He submits
    the correct test for mental health/suicide cases is now as set  out  in
    Paposhvili and confirmed by the Supreme Court in AM. This test, adapted
    to this particular context is whether there are substantial grounds for
    believing that the Appellant would face a real risk on account  of  the
    absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving state or the lack  of
    access to such treatment, of being exposed to:

      i) a serious, rapid and irreversible  decline  in  his  state  of  his
         mental health resulting in intense suffering, or

     ii)  a  significant,  meaning  substantial,  reduction  in   his   life
         expectancy arising from a completed act of suicide.

110. In support of this submission, Mr  Fullbrook  makes  reference  to  the
    Supreme Court in AM having  made  no  distinction  between  mental  and
    physical cases.  No principled distinction exists:  RA.  The  Appellant
    relies on Savran v Denmark and Carlos and on the fact that the  Supreme
    Court endorsed  AXB  in  terms  of  the  Tribunal's  treatment  of  the
    procedural requirements of Article 3, not in  terms  of  the  threshold
    test applied.  Once  the  Appellant  has  established  the  substantial
    grounds then it is for the Respondent to dispel  "any  serious  doubts"
    (see AM [33]).

111. He reiterated his submissions that it  is  of  no  surprise  given  the
    unchallenged medical evidence before the Tribunal  that  the  Appellant
    struggled to respond to questions put to him about his  past  during  a
    lengthy cross-examination.  The Tribunal  is  invited  to  find,  as  a
    matter of fact the Appellant is from OPA.

112. The  Appellant  cannot  be  returned  to  Morocco  because  he  is  not
    Moroccan.  Notwithstanding this, Mr Fullbrook highlights the fact that,
    contrary to what is  asserted  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  written
    submissions, Dr Galappathie findings are that the  Appellant  currently
    presents with "a high risk of self-harm and suicide" [A/40]  and  that,
    if returned either to Morocco or  OPA he is likely to present with  "an
    immediate and high risk of self-harm or suicide" [A/41]  regardless  of
    the availability of  any  treatment  in  the  receiving  states.   This
    evidence plainly demonstrates the "substantial grounds" test.

113. To  the  extent  to  which  the  Tribunal  considers  evidence  of  the
    availability of treatment in the receiving states to be  relevant,  the
    evidence upon which  the  Respondent  relies  is  said  to  be  plainly
    inadequate.  It is out of date and predates the  outbreak  of  COVID-19
    which will (as the Respondent acknowledges) have a material effect.  It
    does  not  dispel  "any  serious  doubts".  For  instance,  a  document
    submitted by the Respondent entitled Response to an Information Request
    Morocco: Treatment for mental health, is dated 01.11.18 and is based on
    reports from as long ago as 2017.  In discussing  the  availability  of
    health treatment, the document mentions (see  4.1.1)  just  one  public
    facility (Hospital Ar Razi, Rue Ibn Rochd) and concedes (in the  MedCOI
    disclaimer) that "it does not provide information on the  accessibility
    of treatment".  The document also concedes (see  3.1.1)  that  it  "can
    only  provide  limited  information  on  the  cost  of  healthcare   or
    medication".

114.  In  contrast,  the  Appellant  relies  on  the  up-to-date  report  of
    Professor Joff� who has described the  availability  of  public  health
    facilities for individuals in  Morocco  with  the  Appellant's  serious
    mental health disabilities to be "inadequate" and stated  that  private
    facilities would not be affordable.  The Tribunal is  invited  to  read
    the evidence in full.

115. It is conceded that return to OPA would  breach  the  UK's  obligations
    under Article 3.  However, it is not correct to say that there  is  "no
    evidence to suggest that general healthcare provisions in OPA  are  not
    adequate".  There is considerable evidence of this in Professor Joffe's
    report [see, for example, A/74].  Indeed,  even  the  Respondent's  own
    evidence entitled  Report  of  the  Home  Office  Fact-Finding  Mission
    Occupied Palestinian Territories: Freedom  of  movement,  security  and
    human rights situation, describes  mental  health  in  OPA  as  "a  big
    concern" ([see 4.24.8]  and  as  having  "severe  capacity  gaps"  [see
    4.24.14].

116. The Appellant has given evidence of a private life in the UK.   He  has
    learnt to speak English and has established  a  number  of  friendships
    including with  an  individual  who  supported  him  in  attending  the
    hearing.

Discussion

117. The test to be applied in Article 3  health  cases  is  that  found  at
    [183] in Paposhvili as explained by the Supreme Court  in  AM  at  [29]
    -31]; namely, whether the Appellant would face a real risk, on  account
    of the absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving state  or  the
    lack of access to such treatment, of being exposed to  (i)  a  serious,
    rapid and irreversible decline in his  state  of  health  resulting  in
    intense  suffering,  or  (ii)  a  significant,   meaning   substantial,
    reduction in life expectancy.

118. There is nothing in European  or  domestic  case  law  to  support  any
    contention that Paposhvili does not apply to suicide cases. Contrary to
    her oral submission, Ms Isherwood in  written  submissions  accepts  it
    applies.  That Paposhovili applies to cases  involving  mental  illness
    and risk of suicide, was  confirmed  in  Savran  v  Denmark  and  again
    recently by Sir Duncan Ouseley in Carlos.

119. The Respondent relies on Y and J.  The  Respondent  submits  that  they
    still apply but proposes a modified sixth point. Mr  Fullbrook  in  his
    response states that the correct test is  set  out  in  Paposhvili  and
    confirmed in AM.  We agree.  However, in our view, insofar as J  and  Y
    concern subjective fear on return, we find that the guidance  is  still
    valid. There is nothing controversial about points 1-4. What is  stated
    therein has not been overtaken by AM.

120. We reject Ms Isherwood's submission that there is a threshold  test  in
    either J or Y.  The 6 points made are not a test. They amplify the test
    set under Article 3 in the light of N ('the N test'). Furthermore,  the
    Secretary of State now  accepts  that  the  correct  test  is  that  in
    Paposhvili and AM. In so far as  Ms  Isherwood  seeks  to  introduce  a
    further burden or test  on  the  Appellant  arising  from  Y  or  J  by
    reformulating point 6, we reject this.    Ms Isherwood's  reformulation
    of point 6 is an attempt to create a threshold test which has no  basis
    in law.

121. Points 5 and 6 give guidance on  how  to  deal  with  subjective  fear.
    While the guidance specifically refers to suicide  cases,  this  simply
    reflects the N test.  In  order  to  reflect  properly  the  applicable
    Paposhvili test, the guidance should now apply to mental  health  cases
    generally where fear is unfounded.

122. Moreover, the final sentence of point 5 is not  an  attempt  to  create
    any extra burden on the Appellant in a suicide (or mental health) case.
    The point made by the Court of  Appeal  in  J  must  be  considered  in
    context.  The  Appellant  in  that  case  did  not  have  psychosis  or
    schizophrenia. He had PTSD from what had happened to him in Sri  Lanka.
    There was treatment available in Sri Lanka to which the Appellant would
    have access because he had the support of family members.  Moreover, in
    Y, the Court of  Appeal  added  to  point  5  something  of  particular
    relevance to this appeal, namely that what may be of  equal  importance
    is whether any genuine fear which the appellant may  establish,  albeit
    without an objective foundation, is such as to create a risk of suicide
    if there is an enforced return.

123. The six points in J apply to mental health cases post Paposhvili.  They
    do not impose a test or a burden on an appellant. They are guidance  on
    how to deal with subjective fear.

124. The Appellant must adduce evidence capable of demonstrating that  there
    are substantial grounds for believing that Article 3 will be  violated.
    This can be explained as raising a prima facie case which means a  case
    which in the absence of challenge would establish infringement.  It  is
    a demanding threshold.  It is for the  Appellant  to  demonstrate  that
    there are substantial grounds for believing that such  a  risk  exists;
    after that point, the burden falls to the Secretary of State to  dispel
    any serious doubts raised by it (AM [33].)  We  reject  Ms  Isherwood's
    submission on the point on her proposed suggestion of a seventh  point.
    While the Supreme Court  rejected  the  submission  that  there  is  an
    obligation to dispel any doubts, they interpreted the decision  of  the
    Grand Chamber as intending to oblige the Respondent to  dispel  serious
    doubts. In  any  event,  this  is  another  attempt  to  introduce  and
    threshold test, which is unnecessary. The test is set out in Paposhvili
    and AM.

Findings and reasons

125. We communicated our decision in respect of the exclusion point  at  the
    hearing, having heard Ms Isherwood's  very  brief  submissions  on  the
    issue.  We find  that  the  Appellant  has  not  been  convicted  of  a
    particularly serious crime and he does not constitute a danger  to  the
    community. The presumption does not apply in his case  because  he  has
    not been convicted of a sentence of imprisonment of two years or  more.



126. There is no meaningful challenge to the  medical  evidence  before  us.
    The Appellant has a history of significant mental illness. In  2015  he
    was assessed by Dr Clark as presenting a significant  risk  of  suicide
    and as having a subjective belief that others want to kill him. A  year
    later the Appellant was assessed by Dr Anderson who assessed him to  be
    at high risk of violence to himself. He said that  his  symptoms  would
    diminish rapidly if managed appropriately.   The  most  recent  medical
    evidence confirms diagnoses of severe depressive  episode,  generalised
    anxiety disorder, PTSD and paranoid schizophrenia/psychosis and  states
    that he is at high risk of self-harm.  His symptoms  are  chronic.   He
    has a history of self-harm and takes medication.  In  the  most  recent
    medical evidence, Dr Galappthie expresses a  more  pessimistic  outlook
    than Dr Anderson about the Appellant's prognosis even if he is  allowed
    to remain here (prospects for improvement are limited by  the  severity
    and long- standing nature of his mental health problems and  underlying
    psychotic illness).

127. We attach  weight  to  all  the  medical  evidence.   We  consider  the
    evidence applying the Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of 2010 and
    what the Court  of  Appeal  stated  in  AM  (Afghanistan).  [5]    This
    Appellant is vulnerable and credibility should be assessed with this in
    mind.

128. Much was made  of  the  Appellant  being  evasive  when  cross-examined
    suggesting that this undermined his credibility. We take  into  account
    that Dr Galappathie has stated that  the  Appellant  has  a  reasonable
    short-term memory; however, at paragraphs 114 and 115 of his report  he
    stated  that  inconsistencies  in  the  Appellant's  account  could  be
    explained by past trauma and that it is likely that his  mental  health
    problems have had an adverse impact on his memory and ability to recall
    events. The Appellant did not answer questions when  cross-examined  by
    Ms Isherwood.  He said that he could not remember, having just had  his
    witness statements read back to him.  On the face of it, this does  not
    sit particularly well with  his  ability  to  give  Dr  Galappathie  an
    account in December 2020 and to other experts.   However,  we  bear  in
    mind the Appellant's  medical  conditions  and  vulnerability.  He  was
    extensively cross-examined by Ms Isherwood. It was put to him that  the
    murder of his family may be a  delusion.   In  any  event,  we  do  not
    consider   evasiveness   under   cross-examination    undermines    his
    credibility. Indeed, considering the medical evidence, we are surprised
    that he gave live evidence. We also take into account that most of  the
    evidence in his witness statements set out the Appellant's  immigration
    history, a factual background which appears to have  been  lifted  from
    the decision letter.

129. We accept that there are significant  discrepancies  in  his  evidence,
    with particular reference to what the Appellant said when  interviewed.
    He has been inconsistent about who was responsible for  atrocities  and
    for whom his father worked.  We accept that the Appellant's  memory  is
    impaired for the reasons identified in the medical evidence. We  accept
    considering the medical evidence and that events happened some time ago
    when the Appellant  was  a  child,  it  would  be  surprising  if  this
    Appellant gave a detailed and  coherent  account.   What  the  evidence
    before us does clearly establish is that this Appellant has been deeply
    traumatised by an event/events in his  lifetime.  He  has  always  been
    consistent about having witnessed the murder of his family.  We  accept
    this aspect of his evidence. The medical evidence establishes  a  clear
    link between past trauma/mistreatment and his mental illness.

130. The main problem with the Appellant's evidence is that  it  is  lacking
    in detail. We accept that there are very good reasons why the Appellant
    has not given a detailed or consistent account.  However,  taking  into
    account the evidence as a whole, including the Sprakab report, properly
    applying the lower standard of proof we find that there is insufficient
    evidence that he is from OPA.  We find that the Appellant is  Moroccan.
    He may well have been in OPA at some stage in his early life. We accept
    that he may believe that he is from OPA. However,  in  respect  of  the
    issue of the Appellant's nationality, taking into  account  his  mental
    health conditions, his age and vulnerability  and  the  evidence  as  a
    whole, we find that he has not established that he is from OPA. We find
    that he is not a reliable witness and that  the  account  that  he  has
    given about his nationality is not credible. Taking  into  account  his
    serious mental health problems, he may not have intended to mislead the
    Tribunal, but the evidence he has given is not sufficient to  discharge
    the  burden  of  proof.    However,  if  the  Appellant  is   knowingly
    misleading the Upper Tribunal about his  nationality,  we  accept  that
    ultimately this is not fatal to his claim to be at risk on  removal  to
    Morocco on Article 3 health grounds.  However,  the  Appellant's  claim
    appeal on protection grounds is dismissed.

131. In reaching conclusions about the Appellant's  nationality,  we  attach
    weight to the Sprakab report. It is not  determinative  of  the  issue;
    however, our attention was not drawn to anything capable of undermining
    the conclusions in a meaningful way. We do not  attach  weight  to  the
    Appellant's lack of knowledge of Gaza  considering  the  young  age  he
    states that he left.  However, the author of  the  Sprakab  Report  was
    aware that the Appellant's claim is that he left Gaza at  a  young  age
    (he stated to her that he left aged 9). We reasonably  infer  that  the
    conclusions  reached  by  the  expert  take  this  into  account.   Her
    conclusions are unequivocal.

132. We have taken on board  what  Professor  Joffe  has  stated  about  the
    Appellant mixing with North Africans and having left Gaza at  an  early
    age, however Professor Joff� is not  a  linguist.  In  so  far  as  his
    evidence concerns the Sprakab report, we attach limited weight  to  it.
    We have no evidence explaining how and to  what  extent,  if  any,  the
    evidence of the  Appellant  having  mixed  with  North  Africans  would
    undermine the conclusions in the Sprakab report.  The author was  aware
    that on the Appellant's own account he had not been  in  OPA  for  some
    time.   The  Appellant,  who  has  been  represented   throughout   the
    protracted proceedings, has not instructed a linguist.  The  author  of
    the Sprakab report was aware of the history  concerning  the  Appellant
    having left OPA at an early age (he told her that he was aged 9). While
    there is no requirement for corroboration, we take  into  account  that
    the Appellant  has  instructed  a  number  of  experts  throughout  the
    proceedings, and it was open to him to instruct a  linguist  to  assess
    his language and to comment on  the  Sprakab  report.  Considering  the
    totality of the evidence, we conclude that it is reasonably likely that
    this Appellant is  Moroccan.      We  accept  that  the  Appellant  may
    believe his own account, but we are unable on the  evidence  to  accept
    everything that he says.

133. We attach significant weight to the Appellant having been a child  when
    he witnessed the traumatic event/events and fled his home country.   We
    find that he has no clear recollection of events.   His recollection is
    further undermined by his mental health problems.  The evidence  points
    to him having witnessed traumatic events, not only the  murder  of  his
    family, but as someone who has been destitute and homeless with  mental
    health problems.  We  note  that  he  had  a  head  injury  from  being
    assaulted in Ostend, which may according to Dr Clark have been caused a
    brain injury.

134. The Appellant has given an account of travelling to Turkey and  through
    Europe.  While, we do not necessarily accept  the  route,  we  have  no
    reason to disbelieve his account of a lengthy  and  protracted  journey
    passing through several countries.

135. We accept that he does not have family who are in a  position  to  help
    him in Morocco or anywhere.  The evidence points to the Appellant being
    very much alone in the world. He mentioned a grandfather who helped him
    to travel to Turkey.  However, we are satisfied that he does  not  have
    contact with any member of his family who is  able  to  offer  him  any
    meaningful support.  We  take  into  account  that  the  Appellant  has
    endured destitution, serious mental  illness  and  ill-treatment  since
    leaving his home country.  This would support that  he  either  has  no
    family or there is no family member able and willing to help him.

136. We do not accept that the perpetrators of the crime against his  family
    have any interest in  pursuing  the  Appellant.  However,  the  medical
    evidence leads us to conclude that the Appellant has a  genuine  belief
    that they pursued him and located his whereabouts when  in  Turkey.  We
    find that the Appellant has  a  subjective  fear  that  those  who  are
    responsible for killing his family pursued him to Turkey  and  continue
    to pursue him.

137. The Appellant is assessed as presenting a high risk  of  self-harm  and
    suicide (see paragraph 128 of Dr Galappathie's report) and that  should
    he be forcibly removed to OPA or Morocco this is likely to  lead  to  a
    worsening of his mental health and  increased  risk  of  self-harm  and
    suicide (see paragraph 30 of  Dr  Galappathie's  report).  The  medical
    evidence is that detention would lead to an  acute  psychotic  relapse.
    On return to OPA or Morocco the Appellant  is  likely  to  suffer  from
    worsening psychotic symptoms and present with  an  immediate  and  high
    risk of self-harm and suicide.   It is  significant  that  the  medical
    evidence makes no distinction between risk on return to OPA or Morocco.
     We accept this because the Appellant  believes  that  he  is  actively
    being pursued by those who killed his family  and  therefore  the  fear
    exists wherever. Moreover, the evidence is that the Appellant struggles
    to engage with health services when he is homeless. We accept that  the
    Appellant as a result  of  trauma  and  psychosis/schizophrenia,  hears
    voices telling him to kill himself.

138. We do not accept that the Appellant has  not  explained  why  he  fears
    return to Morocco as asserted  by  Ms  Isherwood.    This  ignores  the
    medical evidence. The Appellant's case has been advanced on  the  basis
    that he believes that he is being  pursued  by  those  who  killed  his
    parents. He believes that they pursued him to Turkey.  He  is  at  high
    risk of suicide. Moreover, he would not in our view be able  to  engage
    with the limited health care available in Morocco to allay his fears.

139. Although he is at present not receiving  treatment  recommended  by  Dr
    Galappathie save medication that  may  be  available  (or  similar)  in
    Morocco, he has from time to time had access to treatment and sees  his
    GP. We do not accept the submission that his condition can be described
    as medically stable. He is  at  high  risk  of  self  -  harm  and  his
    condition is chronic.  His condition will  deteriorate  on  removal  to
    Morocco because the Appellant has a subjective fear that  he  is  being
    pursued by the people responsible for  his  family's  death  and  hears
    voices telling him to kill himself.   We are satisfied that he will  be
    arrive in Morocco alone, without support. He is likely to be destitute.
    He believes he is being  pursued.   This  must  be  considered  in  the
    context of him already presenting a high risk of self-harm.

140. The medication he receives here and visits to  his  GP  have  no  doubt
    prevented the Appellant from making any  recent  attempts  on  his  own
    life. Having accommodation is a feature that has helped him engage with
    mental health services. In respect of availability of medical treatment
    in Morocco, we attach weight to Professor Joff�'s clarification of  the
    background  evidence  relied  on  by  the  Respondent.  There  was   no
    meaningful challenge to this. While  we  accept  that  there  are  some
    medical facilities in Morocco which if accessed are capable of offering
    some treatment, we attach weight to the  evidence  of  Professor  Joff�
    that mental health facilities are likely to  be  inadequate.   We  find
    that private facilities would not be affordable to  the  Appellant.  We
    find that the medical evidence establishes that  the  Appellant  is  at
    risk of self-harm or suicide which we find would materialise as soon as
    he arrives in Morocco because there will be no support to enable him to
    access the limited facilities available (though there is no requirement
    for imminent death properly applying the Paposhvili test).

141. The evidence does not establish that medical facilities  and  treatment
    in Morocco will   alleviate the immediate and high risk of self-harm or
    suicide that the Appellant presents. To the extent that treatment might
    be available, it would certainly not be accessible to  this  Appellant.
    We take into account that destitution and poverty are factors that have
    exacerbated the Appellant's mental health problems in the past and have
    also hindered his ability to access medical help in the United Kingdom.
    His engagement with health services here  has  been  haphazard.  It  is
    reasonably likely that he will face destitution and poverty in Morocco.
    At present the Appellant has  accommodation  here  and  there  is  some
    engagement  with  health  services.     Without  any  kind  of  support
    network, family or accommodation, it is unlikely that he will  be  able
    to access any kind of health care, state provision of private.

142. We do not  accept  the  Appellant's  case  that  medical  provision  is
    irrelevant because although he has a high risk of suicide here, he  has
    not made recent attempts because he has some support from  his  GP  and
    the  availability  of  medication  is  very  accessible.  When  he   is
    accommodated and supported, he is at  less  risk  of  harming  himself,
    albeit the risk is high.  With the  relatively  low  level  of  support
    here, the risk remains high. It will be critical  with  limited  health
    services and no support to help him access these.

143. We take into account the high risk of suicide, daily suicidal  thoughts
    and attempts on his life as documented  by  Dr  Galappthie.  We  attach
    weight to the  fact  that  the  Appellant  hears  voices.    While  the
    uncertainty of removal is not helping him and is a factor affecting his
    mental health it is not the key factor. The Appellant  has  established
    that he has a genuine fear, albeit  without  an  objective  foundation.
    That fear is such as to create  a  risk  of  suicide  if  there  is  an
    enforced return to Morocco.

144. We are in no doubt that the evidence before us  raises  a  prima  facie
    case  of  potential  infringement  of  Article  3.  Properly   applying
    Paposhvili, the Respondent's background evidence  relating  to  Morocco
    and health care provision does not dispel serious doubts raised by  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant has established that  there  are  substantial
    grounds for considering that this is an exceptional case because  of  a
    real risk  of  subjection  to  inhuman  treatment  resulting  from  the
    foreseeable consequences of his removal.  He would face a real risk, on
    account of the absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving  state
    or the lack of access to such treatment, of being exposed to a serious,
    rapid and irreversible decline in his  state  of  health  resulting  in
    intense suffering and a significant, meaning substantial, reduction  in
    life expectancy.

145. For all the above reasons we find that  removal  of  the  Appellant  to
    Morocco would breach the UK's obligations under Article 3 of  the  1950
    Convention on Human Rights. There is no need for us consider Article  8
    and to engage with application of GS post Paposhvili.

146. The appeal is dismissed on protection grounds.

147. The appeal is allowed on Article 3 grounds.

  (1)    The overriding objective of these Rules is to enable the Upper
  Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.
  (2)    Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes-

    costs and the resources of the parties;
    (b)  avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility in the

    (d)  using any special expertise of the Upper Tribunal effectively; and
    (e)  avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of
    the issues.

[4]  Paragraph 21 of AM (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1123  reads  as
follows:-
  21.    It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the  agreed  basis
  for allowing the appeal on the merits reflects core principles of  asylum
  law and practice which have particular importance in claims from children
  and other vulnerable persons namely:
 a. given the gravity of the consequences of a decision on asylum and  the
    accepted inherent difficulties in establishing the facts of  the  claim
    as well as future risks, there is a lower standard of proof,  expressed
    as 'a reasonable chance', 'substantial  grounds  for  thinking'  or  'a
    serious possibility';
 b. while an assessment of personal credibility may be a critical aspect of
    some claims, particularly in  the  absence  of  independent  supporting
    evidence, it  is  not  an  end  in  itself  or  a  substitute  for  the
    application  of  the  criteria  for  refugee  status  which   must   be
    holistically assessed;
 c. the findings of medical experts must be treated as part of the holistic
    assessment:  they are not to be treated as an 'add-on' and rejected as
    a result of an adverse credibility assessment or finding made prior  to
    and without regard to the medical evidence;
 d. expert medical evidence can be critical in  providing  explanation  for
    difficulties in giving a coherent and consistent account of past events
    and  for  identifying  any  relevant  safeguards   required   to   meet
    vulnerabilities that can lead  to  disadvantage  in  the  determination
    process, for example, in the ability to give oral testimony  and  under
    what conditions (see the Guidance Note below and JL (medical reports  -
    credibility) (China) [2013] UKUT 00145 (IAC), at [26] to [27]);
 e. an appellant's account of his or her fears and  the  assessment  of  an
    appellant's credibility must also be judged in the context of the known
    objective circumstances and practices of the state in  question  and  a
    failure to do so can constitute an error of law; and
 f. in  making  asylum  decisions,  the  highest  standards  of  procedural
    fairness are required.
