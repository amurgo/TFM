For the respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, KF, date of birth 5.8.97, is a citizen of Albania.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ross promulgated 2.10.15, dismissing on all grounds his appeal  against
    the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  his   asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 14.9.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lambert  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.1.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Ross to be set aside.

 6. In summary, the grounds argue  failures  and  inadequate  reasoning  in
    assessing evidence as to risk, relocation and article 8.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Lambert noted only  that,  "The
    relatively brief findings and reasoning, limited  to  paragraphs  21-22
    (risk/relocation) and 27 (Article  8)  of  the  decision,  renders  the
    grounds arguable. There is therefore an arguable error of law disclosed
    by the application."

 8. That the findings and reasoning are relatively brief is not, in and  of
    itself, an arguable error of law.

 9. The primary ground of appeal is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    failed to take into account expert and other evidence in assessing risk
    on return to Albania, internal relocation and  the  proportionality  of
    refusal with reference to article 8 ECHR.

10. The judge considered risk on return from �20 onwards of  the  decision,
    correctly stating that the issue was whether the appellant  who  is  no
    longer a child and would  not  have  to  live  with  his  father  would
    nevertheless be at risk on account of his age, lack of  family  support
    and the animosity of his father. Within �21 the judge explained why the
    conclusion was reached that the appellant  could  relocate  to  another
    part of Albania and did not accept  that  his  father  would  have  any
    interest in pursing him  if  he  returned.  The  judge  considered  the
    evidence but was not persuaded that the father would target  him,  even
    if he did find out he had returned and where he was living.

11. Ms Foot submitted that the findings of fact of the First-tier  Tribunal
    were not sustainable on the evidence, in particular that of the  expert
    who suggested that the appellant would remain at risk from his  father,
    whose honour had been insulted and had the means to trace him. Although
    this is not a blood feud case, it is  suggested  that  the  father  has
    complete control of wife and children in  Albanian  society  and  would
    want to pursue him. However, within �21 the judge concluded that  there
    is no evidence that the father, who used to  beat  the  appellant  when
    drunk, had any hostility towards him when sober and that he  would  not
    be at risk from him if he did not live with him.

12. In relation to relocation, Ms Foot again submits that the judge ignored
    the expert evidence, stating that there was no evidence that the father
    would have any way of knowing of his return if that return  were  to  a
    different  part  of  the  country.  She  also  submitted  that  it  was
    irrational for the judge to suggest the appellant could be assisted  by
    his (maternal) grandparents (�21), as they live in the same area as the
    father.  However,  that  does  not  prevent  them  from  assisting  the
    appellant to relocate or when living in a different area.

13. It is further submitted that the judge entirely omitted to consider the
    evidence of a  risk  of  trafficking  and  destitution,  and  that  the
    appellant would be seen as dishonourable, an outcast and a criminal.

14. Ms Foot also submitted that the judge ignored the social work  evidence
    (A15-19) and the oral evidence of Louise Drammeh to the effect that the
    appellant had remained with his foster family despite  turning  18  and
    was not yet capable of independent living and had not left the home  to
    seek employment or further education.

15. Finally it was submitted that the article 8 assessment  was  flawed  in
    that the conclusion that the  appellant  would  be  able  to  fend  for
    himself cannot be sustained on the evidence. Reliance was placed on  JS
    (former unaccompanied child - durable  solution)  (Afghanistan)  [2013]
    UKUT 00568, to the effect that the Tribunal should  take  into  account
    the appellant's age, background, length of residence in the UK,  family
    and  general  circumstances,  and  any  particular  vulnerability,  and
    whether he would have any family or other adult support on return.

16. That the decision is relatively short is not in itself an error of law.
    Neither was it necessary for the judge to address every single issue of
    every single piece of evidence.

17. For the Secretary of State, Ms Kotas pointed out that this was  a  very
    straightforward case where it is suggested that  the  appellant  cannot
    return to Albania because his father had beaten him  when  drunk.  Very
    little is factually in dispute.

18. I agree with Ms Kotas' submission that on the facts  of  this  case  it
    would be artificial to divorce the issues of relocation  from  risk  on
    return; they are bound up together. In that regard it is clear from �20
    that the judge accepted that the  appellant  had  been  abused  by  his
    father and addressed his mind to the correct issues.   The  judge  also
    considered the report of Dr Young, as is clear from the summary at  �17
    of the decision, referencing the view that there is a  risk  that  word
    would reach the father that the appellant had returned, as well as  the
    risk of trafficking. The  judge  also  summarised  the  oral  evidence,
    including that of Louise Drammeh, social worker.

19. I am satisfied that all the findings at �20 and �21 on risk  on  return
    and internal relocation are sustainable. The judge considered  and  has
    had regard to the evidence, including the expert evidence  but  reached
    the conclusion as he was entitled, that there is no real reason for the
    father to pursue the appellant on his return  and  that  there  was  no
    reason why the  appellant  now  an  adult  could  not  relocate  within
    Albania, essential out of reach of his father.  There  is  no  evidence
    that the father would necessarily find out about his return. The expert
    evidence was only to the effect that there was a risk that  word  would
    somehow reach his father that he had returned. There appears to  be  no
    cogent evidence to justify such speculation. The fact of the matter  is
    that the judge considered all the evidence and then  made  findings  of
    fact on the primary basis that the father is an alcohol who had  beaten
    his son when drunk. It is open to the maternal grandparents and/or  his
    uncle to provide assistance and there is no reason why they  would  not
    do so. As to the appellant's alleged vulnerability, the  judge  pointed
    out that he had travelled to the UK at age 15, unaccompanied and hidden
    in a lorry, demonstrating his resilience.

20. In effect, the grounds  of  appeal  in  this  case  are  no  more  than
    disagreements with the findings of the judge.  It  is  clear  from  the
    decision that the judge was fully aware of all  the  relevant  evidence
    and has taken it into account.

21. Reliance is placed on the alleged risk of destitution, exploitation and
    trafficking contained within Dr Young's  report.  On  considering  that
    report, these appear to be no more than  unsupported  speculation.  For
    example at A41, the author states,  "Who  can  account  for  his  moral
    standing? With no one to vouch for  him,  he  would  be  vulnerable  to
    kidnapping (kidnappers/traffickers look for young people to  carry  out
    their illegal work in order to transfer the risk of being  caught);  or
    for sexual exploitation." At A42 it is stated, "Living in poverty would
    expose him to vulnerability to  trafficking.  Those  most  at  risk  of
    trafficking in Albania are those who have  no  safe  place  to  go,  no
    supportive family. There is no safe place for them to go  in  Albania."
    Finally, at A46 the expert states, "Should (the appellant) be  returned
    to  Albania,  he  could  be  destitute  and  extremely  vulnerable   to
    trafficking." One searches in vain for hard evidence on this issue.

22. There is very little evidence in  this  report  to  substantiate  these
    assertions and scant explanation as to why this  appellant  would  face
    such risks. The case was never put to the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
    basis of trafficking; even Ms Foot's skeleton argument  barely  touches
    on trafficking. In her reply on this issue she accepted that  this  was
    not a trafficking claim but  suggested  that  it  was  illustrative  of
    various risks that the appellant  might  face  on  return  to  Albania,
    independently of the claimed risk of harm from his father. However,  it
    is clear that the judge was aware of the trafficking and  vulnerability
    suggestion, but in reality there is such little  credible  evidence  on
    this issue that even if the judge had dealt more fully with  the  issue
    there was insufficient to justify a risk on  return  on  the  basis  of
    destitution, exploitation or trafficking.

23. In relation to article 8 I am satisfied that the judge  considered  all
    relevant issues and made sustainable findings  with  cogent  reasoning.
    The conclusions reached in �27 were entirely open to the judge  on  the
    available  evidence  and  there  were  no  exceptional  or   compelling
    circumstances.

Conclusion & Decision:

24. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order Given the circumstances, however, I  make  an
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
