                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Upper Tribunal was  due  to  re-make  this  appeal  which  concerns
    whether the appellant qualifies for a residence  card  showing  him  to
    have retained residence rights as the former spouse of an EEA  national
    exercising Treaty rights.

 2. The respondent indicates in a letter dated  8  May  2018  that,  having
    reviewed the evidence, she  intends  to  issue  the  appellant  with  a
    residence card.

   3. The respondent also proposed in the letter of 8 May 2018  to  withdraw
      her case before the Upper Tribunal by way of ending this  matter.  The
      case before the Upper Tribunal was brought by the appellant,  however,
      not the respondent. The respondent has no "case" to withdraw.



   4. The respondent's position, really,  is  that  she  concedes  that  the
      appeal should be allowed as she accepts that the appellant is entitled
      to a residence card. On that basis, the appeal is  allowed  under  the
      Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.


Notice of Decision

The appeal  is  allowed  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2006.
