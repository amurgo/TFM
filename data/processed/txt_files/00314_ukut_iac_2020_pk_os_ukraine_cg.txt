                    Legal Department

1.   Acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct

        a. Where a  person  faces  punishment  for  a  refusal  to  perform
           military service that would or might involve  acts  contrary  to
           the basic rules of human conduct, that is capable  of  amounting
           to "being persecuted" on grounds of political  opinion  for  the
           purposes of the Refugee Convention.

        b. The term "acts contrary to the basic  rules  of  human  conduct"
           refers to the core  of  humanitarian  norms  generally  accepted
           between  nations  as  necessary  and   applicable   to   protect
           individuals  in  war  or  armed  conflict  and,  in   particular
           civilians, the wounded and prisoners of war.  It  includes,  but
           is not limited to, the indicative examples listed  in  Krotov  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 69 at
           [30] to [36].

        c. In order to  engage  the  Refugee  Convention,  the  conduct  in
           question must be committed on a systematic basis, as the  result
           of deliberate policy or official indifference to the  widespread
           actions of a brutal military.  In practice, the term conveys  an
           elevated threshold.

        d. It is not necessary  for  there  to  be  specific  international
           condemnation of the conflict in question for the conduct of  the
           military to be categorised as engaging in acts contrary  to  the
           basic rules of human conduct.  The  international  community  of
           states as  a  whole  has  already  condemned  conduct  which  is
           contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct  through  its
           recognition of the existence of international norms  from  which
           no  derogation  is  possible,  and  through  the   adoption   of
           international legal  instruments  recognising  the  prohibitions
           against such conduct.

        e. However, where there is specific international  condemnation  of
           such acts, that is likely to provide  an  evidential  basis  for
           concluding that it is reasonably likely that the military  force
           in question is engaging in acts contrary to the basic  rules  of
           human conduct on a widespread and systemic basis.

        f. The individual concerned must demonstrate that it is  reasonably
           likely that their military service would involve the  commission
           of acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, or that it
           is reasonably likely that, by the performance  of  their  tasks,
           they would provide indispensable support to the  preparation  or
           execution of such acts.

        g. The political opinion of the person concerned must be to  oppose
           the commission of acts contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human
           conduct.  In practice, it is unlikely  to  be  necessary  for  a
           person to  adduce  significant  evidence  that  their  political
           opinion is to oppose such conduct.  It is only  where  there  is
           evidence to the contrary that any real doubt is likely to arise,
           for  example  where  there  is  evidence  that  the   individual
           concerned has previously and voluntarily  been  responsible  for
           acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct.   Such  an
           individual may well fall foul of the exclusion  clauses  in  the
           Refugee Convention in any event.

        h. There must be no  other  way  to  avoid  military  service,  for
           example through the individual concerned availing him or herself
           of a conscientious objector process.

        i. Where a causal link exists between the likely military  role  of
           the conscript or  mobilised  reservist,  the  commission  of  or
           participation in acts contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
           conduct, and the punishment to be imposed, punishment  including
           a fine or a non-custodial sentence will be sufficient to  amount
           to  "being  persecuted"  for  the  purposes   of   the   Refugee
           Convention, provided it is more than negligible.



2.   Country  guidance:  the  conduct  of  the  Ukrainian  military  in  the
conflict in the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone ("the ATO")

        a. Elements of  the  Ukrainian  military  engage  in  the  unlawful
           capture and detention of civilians with  no  legal  or  military
           justification.   The  detention  of  some  detainees   will   be
           justified by military necessity or otherwise  permissible  under
           international humanitarian law ("IHL"), but a  large  number  of
           detentions feature no such justification and  are  motivated  by
           the need for "currency" for prisoner exchanges  with  the  armed
           groups.

        b.  There  is  systemic  mistreatment  of  those  detained  by  the
           Ukrainian military in the conflict in the ATO, which is  in  the
           east of the country.  This involves torture  and  other  conduct
           that is cruel, inhumane  and  degrading  treatment  contrary  to
           Article 3 of the ECHR.  Even where such detainees are eventually
           transferred into the judicial detention process, there is likely
           to be  official  indifference  to  the  mistreatment  they  have
           received.

        c. There is an  attitude  and  atmosphere  of  impunity  for  those
           involved in mistreating detainees.  No one has been  brought  to
           justice.  Pro-Kyiv militia have been rewarded for their work  by
           formal incorporation into the military.  Lawyers are  afraid  of
           taking on cases due to the risk of retribution.

        d. The systemic and widespread detention practices of the Ukrainian
           military and law enforcement  officials  involving  torture  and
           Article 3 mistreatment amount to  acts  contrary  to  the  basic
           rules of human conduct.

        e. The Ukrainian military has had to engage with armed groups  that
           have  embedded  themselves  in  towns,  residential  areas,  and
           civilian  installations  along  the  contact  line.   Legitimate
           military  targets  are  often  in  close  proximity  to   areas,
           buildings or people protected by IHL.  The Ukrainian  military's
           adherence to  the  principles  of  distinction,  precaution  and
           proportionality when engaging with such targets has  been  poor,
           despite that being a task which calls  for  surgical  precision,
           especially in the context of  a  conflict  in  which  legitimate
           military targets  have  been  embedded  within  civilian  areas,
           properties and installations.  The widespread civilian  loss  of
           life and the extensive destruction of residential property which
           has occurred in the conflict will, in part, be  attributable  to
           poorly targeted and disproportionate attacks carried out by  the
           Ukrainian military, but the evidence does not suggest that it is
           reasonably likely that there was targeting  of  civilians  on  a
           deliberate, systemic and widespread basis.

        f. Water installations have been a particular and  repeated  target
           by Ukrainian armed  forces,  despite  civilian  maintenance  and
           transport vehicles being  clearly  marked  and  there  being  an
           established practice of negotiating "windows of silence" on some
           occasions, and despite the protected status  such  installations
           enjoy under IHL.  The background materials suggest  a  continued
           focus on water  and  similar  civilian  installations,  but  the
           evidence does not demonstrate  that  those  targeting  decisions
           were part of a policy  and  system.   Often  such  installations
           serve both sides of the contact  line,  militating  against  the
           conclusion that government forces sought to deprive armed  group
           territory of basic  services  through  the  prosecution  of  the
           strikes and attacks.

        g. Most civilian casualties have been  from  indirect  fire  rather
           than specific targeting.

        h. Civilian casualties continue to fall.

        i. Damage to schools appears to have been collateral or  accidental
           rather than intentional.

        j. It is not clear whether Ukraine was responsible for  laying  any
           of  the  anti-personnel  mines  documented  in  the   background
           materials.  Mines are no longer deployed  by  either  side,  and
           Ukraine is committed to complying with its  international  legal
           obligations under the Ottawa Convention to clear mines that  are
           in areas under its jurisdiction.

        k. While regrettable, we  do  not  consider  the  use  of  civilian
           property without payment or reparation, or looting, to amount to
           acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.

        l. Ukraine has begun steps  to  establish  a  register  of  missing
           persons.  It is not an act (or omission) contrary to  the  basic
           rules of human conduct not to  have  established  that  register
           with greater success or resolve.

        m. There is no evidence that the Ukrainian military is  engaged  in
           the forced movement of civilians.

3.   Country guidance: conscripts and mobilised reservists in Ukraine

        a. The Ukrainian military relies upon professional soldiers in  its
           conflict with Russia-backed armed groups  in  the  east  of  the
           country, in  the  Anti-Terrorist  Operation  zone  ("the  ATO").
           Forced conscripts or mobilised reservists are not sent to  serve
           on the contact line in the ATO and play no part in the  conflict
           there.  It is not reasonably likely that conscripts or mobilised
           reservists would  provide  indirect  support  to  the  Ukrainian
           military effort in the ATO, for example through  working  in  an
           arsenal.

        b. It remains the case  that,  at  the  current  time,  it  is  not
           reasonably likely that a draft evader avoiding  conscription  or
           mobilisation in Ukraine would face  criminal  or  administrative
           proceedings for that act.  The guidance given by VB and  Another
           (draft evaders and prison conditions)  Ukraine  CG  [2017]  UKUT
           00079 (IAC) remains in force.

        c. Although the Ukrainian criminal code provides  at  Articles  335
           and  336  respectively  for  sentences   of   imprisonment   for
           conscripts and reservists who have unlawfully  avoided  military
           service, absent some special factor, it is highly unlikely  that
           a person convicted of such an offence will  be  sentenced  to  a
           period of imprisonment.

        d. It is  not  reasonably  likely  that  conscripts  and  mobilised
           reservists who have avoided military service would be identified
           as such at the border.  Where a person has  been  convicted  and
           sentenced in absentia, the guidance given in VB concerning their
           likely treatment at the border remains applicable.

        e. It is possible to defer  military  service  as  a  conscript  on
           grounds of ill health, under Article 14 of the 1992 law,  or  on
           one of the bases set out in Article 17 of the 1992 law.  Whether
           those exceptions would be available as a fact-specific question.

        f. There is no evidence that it is reasonably likely  that  the  ID
           card system introduced in 2016 will lead to an increased risk in
           a draft evader or mobilised reservist being prosecuted.

        g. It is highly unlikely that a  draft  evader  would  be  detained
           pending trial at the border, given that the enforcement focus is
           on fines, rather than custody.

INTRODUCTION

 1. These appeals have been heard as country guidance  cases.   The  agreed
    questions for us to address are as follows:

         1.  Whether military service by the appellants in Ukraine would  or
         might involve acts which are contrary to the basic rules  of  human
         conduct?

         2. If the answer to issue (1) is "yes", whether the appellants, who
         are draft-evaders, are refugees for that reason alone?

         3. If the answer to issue (2) is "no", whether:

         a)       the appellants, on return to Ukraine, would  be  subjected
             to prosecution for draft evasion?

         b)   if so, whether the appellants  would  receive  any  punishment
             following  that  prosecution,  such   as,   fine,   probation,
             suspended sentence or a custodial sentence?

         c)   whether the prospect of that prosecution or  punishment  means
             that the appellants are refugees?

 2. The appellants  are  citizens  of  Ukraine.   They  are  obliged  under
    Ukrainian law to serve in the Ukrainian military.   They  have  claimed
    asylum on the basis that the Ukrainian armed forces engage in  systemic
    and widespread "acts contrary to the basic  rules  of  human  conduct",
    with  which  they  would  be  associated  or  otherwise   required   to
    participate.  Any punishment in Ukraine  for  draft  evasion  in  those
    circumstances would amount to persecution on grounds of their political
    opinion, they submit.  They also claim to be at risk of cruel, inhumane
    or degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention
    on Human Rights ("ECHR") in the event  of  their  detention  for  draft
    evasion upon their return.  We set out the details of each  appellant's
    case, including our application of the country guidance  principles  to
    each, in Part I.  In the case of PK, his case has been remitted to  the
    Upper Tribunal by the Court of Appeal, having previously had his appeal
    dismissed by the Upper Tribunal: see PK v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1751, which set aside PK (Draft evader;
    punishment; minimum severity) Ukraine [2018] UKUT 241 (IAC).

PART A: PREVIOUS RELEVANT COUNTRY GUIDANCE

 3. In PS (prison conditions; military service)  Ukraine  CG  [2006]  UKAIT
    00016, the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  considered  whether  the
    conditions of military service in Ukraine gave rise to a real  risk  of
    Article  3  ECHR  ill-treatment,  specifically  with  reference  to  an
    informal initiation practice known as  "dedovshchina".   It  held  that
    there was insufficient evidence to establish that  conscripts  and  new
    recruits would be at a real  risk  of  the  practice.   This  issue  is
    outside the scope of the country guidance issues for  consideration  in
    the present matter.

 4. In VB and Another (draft evaders  and  prison  conditions)  Ukraine  CG
    [2017] UKUT 00079  (IAC),  following  hearings  on  31  October  and  1
    November 2016, the following country guidance was issued:

       1. At the current time it is not reasonably  likely  that  a  draft-
          evader avoiding conscription or  mobilisation  in  Ukraine  would
          face  criminal  or  administrative  proceedings  for  that   act,
          although if a draft-evader did face prosecution  proceedings  the
          Criminal Code of Ukraine does provide, in Articles 335,  336  and
          409, for a prison sentence for such an offence.  It  would  be  a
          matter for any Tribunal to consider, in the light  of  developing
          evidence, whether there were aggravating matters which might lead
          to imposition of an immediate custodial sentence, rather  than  a
          suspended sentence or the matter proceeding as an  administrative
          offence and a fine being sought by a prosecutor.

       2. There is a real risk of anyone being returned  to  Ukraine  as  a
          convicted criminal sentenced to a term of  imprisonment  in  that
          country being detained on arrival, although anyone  convicted  in
          absentia would probably be entitled thereafter to  a  retrial  in
          accordance with Article 412 of the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  of
          Ukraine.

       3. There is a  real  risk  that  the  conditions  of  detention  and
          imprisonment in Ukraine would subject a  person  returned  to  be
          detained or imprisoned to a breach of Article 3 ECHR.

 5. In VB, one of the issues that had initially been identified for country
    guidance was whether a draft evader who had been  imprisoned  would  be
    required to  perform  post-imprisonment  military  service  upon  their
    release from custody and, if so, what would be the conditions  of  such
    military  service?   Paragraph  [7]  of  the  decision  explains  that,
    embedded  within  the  concept  of  "conditions"  to  which   a   post-
    imprisonment military conscript would be exposed, was consideration  of
    "whether those conscripted or mobilised into the Ukrainian army were at
    real risk of being required to commit acts  contrary  to  international
    humanitarian law."  The Upper Tribunal, using the  term  "international
    humanitarian law" as a proxy for acts contrary to the  basic  rules  of
    human conduct, did not address that issue, as  there  was  insufficient
    country of origin material before it.  It is precisely that issue which
    lies at the heart of these proceedings.

PART B: LEGAL FRAMEWORK

Introduction

 6. Since the country guidance questions identified for resolution  require
    us to assess the conduct of the  Ukrainian  armed  forces  against  the
    standard of "the basic rules of human conduct", it will be necessary to
    address what is meant by that term.  We will approach that issue in the
    context of refugee law, returning initially to first principles.

 7.  The  1951  Convention  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees   ("the
    Convention"), as amended by the  1967  Protocol,  provides  at  Article
    1A(2) that a "refugee" is a person who:

         "owing to well-founded fear of  being  persecuted  for  reasons  of
         race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social
         group  or  political  opinion,  is  outside  the  country  of   his
         nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is  unwilling  to
         avail himself of the protection of that country..."

 8. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards  for
    the qualification and status of third country  nationals  or  stateless
    persons as refugees or as  persons  who  otherwise  need  international
    protection  and  the  content   of   the   protection   granted   ("the
    Qualification  Directive")  makes  provision   to   define   "acts   of
    persecution".  Article 9(1) provides:

         "Acts of persecution within the meaning of Article 1A of the Geneva
         Convention must:

             (a) be sufficiently serious by their nature or  repetition  as
             to constitute a severe violation of  basic  human  rights,  in
             particular the rights from which  derogation  cannot  be  made
             under  Article  15(2)  of  the  European  Convention  for  the
             Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; or

             (b)  be  an  accumulation  of  various   measures,   including
             violations of human rights which is sufficiently severe as  to
             affect an individual in a similar manner as mentioned in (a)."

 9. The directive provides indicative, non-exhaustive examples of  acts  of
    persecution at Article 9(2):

         "2. Acts of persecution as qualified in  paragraph  1,  can,  inter
         alia, take the form of:

             (a) acts of physical or mental  violence,  including  acts  of
             sexual violence;

             (b) legal, administrative, police,  and/or  judicial  measures
             which  are  in  themselves   discriminatory   or   which   are
             implemented in a discriminatory manner;

             (c) prosecution or punishment, which  is  disproportionate  or
             discriminatory;

             (d) denial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate
             or discriminatory punishment;

             (e) prosecution or punishment for refusal to perform  military
             service in a conflict, where performing military service would
             include crimes or acts falling under the exclusion clauses  as
             set out in Article 12(2);

             (f) acts of a gender-specific or child-specific nature."

10. At the heart of the definition of "refugee" in  Article  1A(2)  of  the
    Convention is persecution ("being persecuted").  It is, as Lord Bingham
    noted in Sepet and Bulbul v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2003] UKHIL 15 at [7], a "strong word".  In  Horvath  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2001] 1 AC 489  at  495,  Lord  Hope  of
    Craighead relied on the definition of the term in Professor  Hathaway's
    1991 edition of The Law of Refugee Status, which summarised the concept
    in these terms, at page 112:

           "In  sum,  persecution  is  most  appropriately  defined  as  the
         sustained or systemic failure of state protection  in  relation  to
         one of the core entitlements  which  has  been  recognised  by  the
         international community."

11. Accordingly, the scope  of  the  Convention  is  defined,  and  thereby
    limited, to those who have a well-founded fear of being persecuted  for
    one of the five Convention reasons  (or  "core  entitlements",  in  the
    words of Professor Hathaway).  There will be other  well-founded  fears
    which an individual may suffer, such as an epidemic,  natural  disaster
    or famine, but such fears are not capable of giving rise to a  fear  of
    being persecuted on a Convention ground.

12. The scope of the Convention is further limited by Article 1F:

         "The provisions of this Convention shall not apply  to  any  person
         with respect to whom there  are  serious  reasons  for  considering
         that:

             (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or  a
             crime  against  humanity,  as  defined  in  the  international
             instruments drawn up to make  provision  in  respect  of  such
             crimes;

                  (b)  he  has  committed  a  serious  non-political  crime
             outside the country of refuge prior to his admission  to  that
             country as a refugee;

             (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to  the  purposes  and
             principles of the United Nations."

13. The conduct encapsulated by Article 1F is anathema to the  humanitarian
    principles espoused by the Convention, and  those  who  have  committed
    such crimes, or are guilty of such acts, do not enjoy the ability to be
    recognised as refugees, even if they otherwise  meet  the  criteria  in
    Article 1A(2).

14. Exclusion clauses in similar terms feature  in  Article  12(2)  of  the
    Qualification Directive,  which  appear  to  correspond  directly  with
    Article 1F (albeit with the inclusion of  some  additional  conduct  in
    Article 12(2)(b)):

         "2. A third country national or a stateless person is excluded from
         being a refugee where there are  serious  reasons  for  considering
         that:

         (a) he or she has committed a crime against peace, a war crime,  or
         a  crime  against  humanity,  as  defined  in   the   international
         instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;

         (b) he or she has committed a serious non-political  crime  outside
         the country of refuge prior to his or her admission as  a  refugee;
         which means the time of issuing a residence  permit  based  on  the
         granting of refugee status; particularly  cruel  actions,  even  if
         committed with an allegedly political objective, may be  classified
         as serious non-political crimes;

         (c) he or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes  and
         principles of the United Nations as set out  in  the  Preamble  and
         Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations."

Application of the Convention to draft evasion

15. In many countries, military service is compulsory, and  non-performance
    of compulsory military service is punishable  by  law,  either  through
    administrative or criminal proceedings.  Even where military service is
    not compulsory, desertion by those who have voluntarily enlisted in the
    military is nevertheless often an offence.

16. The  question  then  arises  as  to  when,  if  at  all,  those  facing
    prosecution and  possible  punishment  under  those  circumstances  are
    entitled to refugee status, particularly when their refusal to  perform
    military service was attributable  to  a  conscientious  objection,  or
    political opinion, to adopt the terminology of the Convention.

17. A distinction must be drawn between prosecution and persecution.  While
    prosecution,  or  other  sanctions  for  non-compliance  with  the  law
    relating to the draft, or desertion, may amount to persecution  if  the
    Convention criteria are met, without more, the mere fact of prosecution
    for  draft  evasion  or  desertion  does  not  amount  to  persecution.
    Situations where a refusal to perform  military  service  may  lead  to
    persecution include scenarios where the punishment  for  draft  evasion
    would be grossly disproportionate or  excessive,  or  if  the  military
    conditions  themselves  would  amount   to   persecution.    In   those
    circumstances, the criteria for recognition as a refugee are likely  to
    be satisfied, provided a nexus to a Convention reason exists.

18. There is a further potential basis upon  which  an  individual  may  be
    recognised as a refugee having evaded military service, and it is  this
    issue which lies at the heart of the first question identified for  our
    resolution in  these  proceedings:  where  the  individual  objects  to
    performing military service on  the  basis  that  it  "would  or  might
    involve acts which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct".

Acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct

19. The conduct encapsulated by the term "acts contrary to the basic  rules
    of human conduct",  and  its  relation  to  refugee  status,  has  been
    summarised  and  paraphrased   in   different   ways   throughout   the
    authorities, with different emphases.

20. The most senior domestic judicial consideration of the concept  remains
    that contained in Sepet (quoted at paragraph 9, above).  The  House  of
    Lords considered whether the appellants, Turkish  citizens  of  Kurdish
    origin, faced being persecuted on account of their refusal  to  perform
    compulsory military service.  Both  appellants  disagreed  in  profound
    terms with the Turkish government's policies towards the Kurdish people
    and feared that they would be required to engage in military atrocities
    against them; that was the basis of their conscientious objection.   In
    unchallenged findings of fact, the special adjudicator found that those
    views were genuinely held, but that it was not reasonably  likely  that
    either would be required to engage in,  or  be  associated  with,  acts
    offending against the basic rules of human conduct.   Both,  found  the
    adjudicator, would face charges  and  likely  imprisonment  upon  their
    return, and would be required to perform their military service in  any
    event.  The  agreed  facts  were  that  the  punishment  would  not  be
    disproportionate or excessive, and that draft evaders  in  Turkey  were
    liable to  prosecution  and  punishment  irrespective  of  the  reasons
    prompting their refusal: see [4].  There was  no  suggestion  that  the
    punishment would be more severe on account of the  appellants'  Kurdish
    ethnicity.

21. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that where an  individual,
    motivated by genuine conscientious grounds, refused to  undertake  such
    military service, and the state offered no  civilian  or  non-combative
    alternative, the prospect of that individual's punishment  for  evading
    the draft would, if carried out, amount to persecution for a Convention
    reason within Article 1A(2).   The  House  found  no  support  for  the
    appellants' core contention that there was a recognised human right  to
    conscientious objection: see [11] to [20].  The appeals were dismissed.
      As such, the focus of the operative part of the judgment in Sepet was
    whether there existed,  under  international  law,  a  fundamental  and
    internationally  recognised  right  to  refuse  to  undertake  military
    service on grounds of conscience, in circumstances were  there  was  no
    risk of engagement in  acts  contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct.

22. Of significance in Sepet is the  following  obiter  extract  from  Lord
    Bingham's opinion, at [8]:

         "There is compelling support  for  the  view  that  refugee  status
         should be accorded to one who has refused to  undertake  compulsory
         military service on the grounds that such service  would  or  might
         require him to commit atrocities or gross human  rights  abuses  or
         participate in a conflict condemned by the international community,
         or  where  refusal  to  serve  would  earn  grossly  excessive   or
         disproportionate punishment: see,  for  example, Zolfagharkhani  v
         Canada  (Minister  of  Employment  and  Immigration)  [1993]  3  FC
         540 ; Ciric v Canada (Minister  of  Employment  and  Immigration)
         [1994] 2 FC 65 ; Canas-Segovia v Immigration  and  Naturalization
         Service (1990) 902 F 2d 717 ; UNHCR Handbook  on  Procedures  and
         Criteria for Determining Refugee Status , paras 169, 171. But  the
         applicants cannot, on the facts as found, bring  themselves  within
         any of these categories..." (emphasis added)

23. Lord Bingham's terminology ("would  or  might  require  him  to  commit
    atrocities or gross human rights abuses or participate  in  a  conflict
    condemned  by  the   international   community")   features   different
    constituent elements: (i) "would or might require him to commit";  (ii)
    "atrocities or  human  rights  abuses";  (iii)  "or  participate  in  a
    conflict"; (iv) "condemned by the international community".

24. We recall that there was no question that the appellants in Sepet would
    be required to engage in such conduct,  and  that  the  House  did  not
    explore this issue in depth.  Caution is  required,  therefore,  before
    attempting to parse Lord Bingham's opinion as one would construe  black
    letter law.   It  appears  that  by  referring  to  the  commission  of
    "atrocities" or "gross human rights abuses", or the participation in an
    internationally condemned conflict, His Lordship was  paraphrasing  the
    "basic rules of human conduct" test, given he referred to  the  concept
    throughout his opinion, and  the  term  had  featured  heavily  in  the
    decisions below.  At [3], he noted that  the  special  adjudicator  had
    reached findings of fact that there was no reasonable  likelihood  that
    the first appellant would be required  to  engage  in  military  action
    contrary to the basic rules of  human  conduct.   In  relation  to  the
    second appellant, he noted, at [4], that the  special  adjudicator  had
    reached similar findings.

25. At [12], Lord Bingham quoted extensively from the United  Nations  High
    Commissioner for Refugee's Handbook  on  Procedures  and  Criteria  for
    Determining Refugee Status under  the  1951  Convention  and  the  1967
    Protocol relating to the Status of  Refugees  (HCR/IP/4/Eng/REV.1,  re-
    edited January 1992).  Paragraph 171 provides, with emphasis added:

         "170. There are, however, also cases where the necessity to perform
         military service may be the sole ground  for  a  claim  to  refugee
         status, i.e. when  a  person  can  show  that  the  performance  of
         military service would have required his participation in  military
         action contrary  to  his  genuine  political,  religious  or  moral
         convictions, or to valid reasons of conscience.

         171.  Not  every  conviction,  genuine  though  it  may  be,   will
         constitute a sufficient reason for claiming  refugee  status  after
         desertion or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be  in
         disagreement  with   his   government   regarding   the   political
         justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the
         type of military action, with which an individual does not wish  to
         be associated, is  condemned  by  the  international  community  as
         contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for  desertion
         or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other  requirements  of
         the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution."

The basic rules of human conduct: international condemnation?

26. In paragraph 171 of the Handbook, and at [8] of Sepet, there appears to
    be a qualification to the above principle, namely that the  conduct  of
    the military must  be  accompanied  by  an  element  of  some  form  of
    international condemnation, in order to reach the Convention threshold.
     The second limb of Lord Bingham's summary of the  view  for  which  he
    considered there was compelling  international  support  was  that  the
    putative refugee would  be  required  to  "participate  in  a  conflict
    condemned by the international community".  In  paragraph  171  of  the
    Handbook, the "military action" must be "condemned by the international
    community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct".

27. The international condemnation requirement was considered in  Krotov  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004]  EWCA  Civ  69.   The
    case concerned whether a Russian deserter who objected to  the  conduct
    of the Russian military in the Chechnyan conflict in the late 1990s was
    entitled to refugee status.  The adjudicator held  that  there  was  no
    evidence  that  the  Chechnyan  conduct  had  been  condemned  by   the
    international community, as would be required for the appellant to have
    succeeded.   The  Court  of  Appeal   held   that   the   international
    condemnation element was satisfied by the conduct in  question  falling
    foul of  the  requirements  of  international  law,  in  the  sense  of
    amounting  to  crimes  recognised  and   thereby   condemned   by   the
    international community or amounting other gross human  rights  abuses.
    The international community condemned the conduct by its recognition of
    the minimum  standards  of  behaviour  from  which  no  derogation  was
    possible.  There  was  no  need,  as  had  wrongly  been  held  by  the
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal below, for there to have been separate  and
    specific international condemnation of the conduct or military campaign
    in question.  The applicability of the 1951 Refugee Convention was  not
    conditional  upon  the  vagaries   and   responsiveness   of   shifting
    international alliances and diplomacy.

28. The court in Krotov cited the Immigration Appeal Tribunal's judgment in
    B v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (reported  as  VB
    (Desertion-Chechnya  War-Hamilton)  Russia  CG  [2003]   UKIAT   00020)
    extensively, with approval: see  [26].   Included  within  the  extract
    cited was [45] of B:

         "...the reference to 'the basic  rules  of  human  conduct'  has  a
         distinct legal meaning within  international  law  governing  armed
         conflicts: see e.g. L.C.  Green, The  Contemporary  Law  of  Armed
         Conflict (1996) p. 16;  C  Greenwood,  'Scope  of  Application  of
         Humanitarian  Law'  in Handbook  of  Humanitarian  Law  in  Armed
         Conflicts, C Dieter Fleck (ed) 1995. Used interchangeably with  ius
         cogens the term has been identified to mean  'principles  that  the
         legal  conscience  of  mankind  deem(s)  absolutely  essential   to
         coexistence in the international community' (UN Conference  on  the
         Law of Treaties, Summary Records of the Plenary Meetings and of the
         Subcommittee of the Whole at  294:  UN  doc.  A/CONF./39/11  (1969)
         (statement of Mr Suarez (Mexico))."

29. We observe that the UN document A/CONF./39/11 forms part of the travaux
    pr�paratoires to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, and
    the discussion referred to by the IAT  in  B  was  an  extract  of  the
    negotiations  concerning  what  was  originally  Article  50   of   the
    International Law Commission's Draft Articles on the Law  of  Treaties.
    Article 50 was amended during negotiations and became Article 53 in the
    Final Act (A/CONF. /39/11).  Article 53 of the 1969 Treaty provides:

         "Article 53.

         TREATIES  CONFLICTING   WITH   A   PEREMPTORY   NORM   OF   GENERAL
         INTERNATIONAL LAW ("JUS COGENS")

         A treaty is void if, at the time of its  conclusion,  it  conflicts
         with a peremptory  norm  of  general  international  law.  For  the
         purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory  norm  of  general
         international  law  is  a  norm  accepted  and  recognized  by  the
         international community of States as a whole as a norm  from  which
         no derogation is permitted and which can  be  modified  only  by  a
         subsequent norm  of  general  international  law  having  the  same
         character."

30. The UN Conference noted that  the  draft  article  did  not  feature  a
    definition of jus cogens.  And nor did the Final Act; the statement  of
    the Mexican delegate highlighted by the  IAT  in  B  observed,  in  the
    preceding paragraph of his speech to that quoted by the Court of Appeal
    in Krotov, that:

         "Although no  criterion  was  laid  down  in  article  50  for  the
         determination  of  the  substantive  norms  which   possessed   the
         character of jus cogens-the matter being left to State practice and
         to the case law of  international  courts-the  character  of  those
         norms was beyond doubt." (UN doc. A/CONF./39/11  (1969)  (statement
         of Mr Suarez (Mexico), page 294 at [6])

31. It follows, therefore, that the discussion of what is actually meant by
    conduct which falls foul of the "basic rules of human conduct" must  be
    approached in light of the Vienna Convention's approach to jus  cogens,
    albeit while recognising that the conferences of UN Member States which
    led to the Treaty chose not to define jus cogens norms,  on  the  basis
    that their character was "beyond  doubt".   As  the  Vienna  Convention
    states:

         "a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm  accepted
         and recognized by the international community of States as a  whole
         as a norm from which no derogation is permitted".

32. At [30] of  Krotov,  the  Court  of  Appeal  then  summarised  what  it
    considered the conduct captured by the concept of "basic rules of human
    conduct" to include, in these terms:

         "In this respect, there is a core of humanitarian  norms  generally
         accepted between nations as necessary  and  applicable  to  protect
         individuals in war or armed conflict and, in particular, civilians,
         the wounded and prisoners of war. They  prohibit  actions  such  as
         genocide, the deliberate killing  and  targeting  of  the  civilian
         population, rape,  torture,  the  execution  and  ill-treatment  of
         prisoners and the taking of civilian hostages."

    At [31] to [36],  the  court  outlined  a  series  of  instruments  and
    materials concerning international humanitarian law  ("IHL")  which  it
    considered to articulate, in concrete terms, what is included in  "acts
    contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct".   They  included  the
    following.

        a. Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions of  1949,  concerning
           the humane treatment of those taking  no  active  part  in  non-
           international armed conflict, including prohibition of  violence
           to  life  and  person,  including  murder,   mutilation,   cruel
           treatment and torture; hostage taking;  outrages  upon  personal
           dignity, including humiliating  and  degrading  treatment.   See
           [32].

        b. Article 147 of Convention (IV), which prohibits wilful  killing,
           torture or inhuman treatment, including biological  experiments,
           wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury  to  body  or
           health, unlawful deportation, transfer or  unlawful  confinement
           of protected persons,  the  taking  of  hostages  and  extensive
           destruction  and  appropriate  of  property  not  justified   by
           military necessity and carried out unlawfully.  See [33].

        c. Article IV of the Additional Protocol  II  of  the  1949  Geneva
           Convention  relating  to  the  Protection  of  Victims  of  Non-
           International  Armed  Conflicts,  under  the   heading   "Humane
           Treatment", which concerns the respect for, and humane treatment
           of, those not taking direct part  in  hostilities,  and  imposes
           similar prohibitions to those imposed by Common Article 3 to the
           1949 Conventions.  See [34].

        d. The decision of the International Court of Justice in  the  Case
           Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in  and  Against
           Nicaragua (Nicar v U.S.) (Merits) 1986 I.C.J Report 14, at paras
           218-220, which referred to some of the obligations contained  in
           the   Geneva   Conventions   as   "fundamental   principles   of
           humanitarian law", applicable to  international  conflicts.   At
           [218], the ICJ categorised the  prohibitions  that  featured  in
           Common Article 3 as a "minimum yardstick", recalling that it had
           previously held in the Corfu Channel case (ICJ Reports, 1949, 4)
           that the rules reflect "elementary considerations of  humanity".
           See [35].

        e. In Prosecutor v Tadi?, 2 October 1995[1], the Appeals Chamber of
           the  International  Tribunal  for  the  Prosecution  of  Persons
           Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian
           Law Committed in the Territory of  Former  Yugoslavia  (commonly
           referred to as  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  the
           former Yugoslavia, or "ICTY"), adopted the approach taken by the
           ICJ in Nicar v U.S., at [93] to [98].  See [36].

33. At [37] of Krotov, the Court of Appeal added that:

         "...the crimes listed above, if committed on a systemic basis as an
         aspect  of  deliberate  policy,  or  as  a   result   of   official
         indifference to  the  widespread  actions  of  a  brutal  military,
         qualify as acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct  in
         respect of which punishment  for  a  refusal  to  participate  will
         constitute persecution within  the  ambit  of  the  1951  [Refugee]
         Convention..."

34. Accordingly, the "international condemnation" requirement is  reflected
    the international community's prior condemnation of conduct having  the
    character of the crimes outlined above, rather than  any  specific  and
    additional requirement  for  there  to  be  contemporary  international
    consensus condemning the conflict in question.  As Rix LJ noted in  his
    concurring judgment at [58], international condemnation of the conflict
    in  question  may  assist  in  providing  the  necessarily   evidential
    confirmation that acts contrary to the basic  rules  of  human  conduct
    have taken place.  Specific international condemnation may form part of
    the evidential landscape but  is  not  a  constituent  element  of  the
    threshold to be met for recognition as a refugee on this basis.

35. In BE (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2008]  EWCA
    Civ 540, the Court of Appeal considered the extent to which IHL,  which
    applies in a conflict paradigm, was capable of informing the  standards
    applicable in peacetime.  The appellant deserted the  Iranian  army  on
    account of being required to  lay  anti-personnel  landmines  close  to
    densely populated civilian areas in the Baneh area of  Kurdistan.   The
    placement of the mines appeared to be such as indiscriminately to  kill
    and maim civilians, with no apparent military justification.  There was
    no state of war or insurgency in Iranian Kurdistan at the time, but the
    government was said to deploy the mines as a border protection measure,
    and to protect from terrorists and smugglers.  Iran was not a signatory
    to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of  the  Use,  Stockpiling,
    Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and  their  Destruction
    ("the Ottawa Convention" or the  "Mine  Ban  Treaty")  outlawing  anti-
    personnel mines, and their use was not prohibited  under  its  domestic
    law.

36. The court noted the widespread condemnation, by  many  members  of  the
    international community, of the  use  of  anti-personnel  mines;  three
    quarters of the world's states  had  signed  and  ratified  the  Ottawa
    Convention.  In 2005, Iran itself had claimed no longer to be using  or
    making mines, although it did not sign the Ottawa Convention.   It  was
    common ground that, had Iran  been  engaged  in  a  conflict  to  which
    international humanitarian law would apply, the  use  of  such  devices
    could readily have contravened many of the provisions of  international
    law cited in Krotov.  The prohibition against the use of anti-personnel
    mines was described by the Court of Appeal as  an  "emerging"  norm  of
    international law (see [29]).  That it was an emerging, as opposed to a
    settled, norm of international law was significant, for it  meant  that
    customary  international  law  could  not  form  the  source   of   any
    prohibition against their indiscriminate use.

37. The court recalled the ICJ's Corfu Channel  case,  observing  that  the
    requirements  of  "elementary  considerations  of  humanity"  had  been
    described by the ICJ as "even more exacting in peace  than  in  war..."
    There was no reason why the law of war  could  not  have  at  least  an
    analogical bearing, held the court: [31].

38. Against that background, the Court of Appeal noted at [33], Iran signed
    and ratified the International Covenant on Civil and  Political  Rights
    ("the ICCPR") in 1968 and 1975 respectively.  By Article 6, the  states
    parties guaranteed every  human  being  the  right  to  life,  and  the
    prohibition against the arbitrary deprivation of  the  right  to  life.
    Article 7 forbids cruel  or  inhuman  treatment,  with  no  derogations
    permitted.

39. The court noted  that  nothing  could  be  more  "arbitrary"  than  the
    deprivation of  life  through  indiscriminate,  recklessly  laid,  non-
    militarily justified anti-personnel mines laid during  peacetime.   The
    court found that the orders to the appellant  to  lay  mines  in  these
    circumstances amounted to a "grave violation of  human  rights",  which
    the court was prepared to  categorise  as  "gross"  if  necessary  (see
    [35]).

40. In BE (Iran), the court concluded at [40] that:

         "...once it  is  established  that  the  individual  concerned  has
         deserted rather than commit a sufficiently  grave  abuse  of  human
         rights, whatever punishment or reprisal consequently faces him will
         establish  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  for  reasons  of
         political opinion."

41. A theme that emerges from the  above  authorities'  approach  to  "acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct" in conflict scenarios  is
    the articulation of the concept by reference to specific provisions  of
    key IHL instruments relating to gross breaches of international  norms,
    such as the prohibition of violence to life and person, hostage taking,
    outrages upon personal dignity, and  other  humiliating  and  degrading
    treatment, or the incorporation of the approach  of  the  International
    Court  of  Justice  to  broader  concepts  such  as  the   "fundamental
    principles of humanitarian law" or the  "elementary  considerations  of
    humanity", as in the Nicaragua and Corfu  cases.  See  the  summary  at
    paragraph [32], above. Significantly, the Court of Appeal  and  Supreme
    Court, and indeed the International Court of Justice and the  ICTY,  do
    not appear to have approached the concept of "the basic rules of  human
    conduct" (or the equivalent concept, differently defined) by  reference
    to "simple" breaches of the central requirements of IHL.

42.  The  requirements  of  IHL  relating  to  the  use  of  force   within
    international  and   non-international   armed   conflicts,   such   as
    precaution, distinction and proportionality (which form part of the jus
    in bello), are not the focus of the discussion in the authorities cited
    to  us,  although  the  some  of  the  background  materials,  and  the
    appellants' submissions, do  address  such  requirements.   IHL  is  an
    extensive and complex body of law and we do not  purport  to  summarise
    the  full  spectrum  of  its  requirements  here.   However,  the   IHL
    principles relied upon by the appellants include:

        a. Distinction, whereby the parties to a conflict are  required  to
           distinguish between the civilian population and combatants,  and
           civilian objects and military objects, and accordingly to direct
           their operations only against military objectives  (see  Article
           48 of the Additional Protocol to the Geneva  Conventions  of  12
           August  1949,  relating  to  the  Protection   of   Victims   of
           International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8  June  1977;  "the
           Additional Protocol").

        b. Proportionality, which would be breached where an  attack  which
           may be expected to  cause  incidental  loss  of  civilian  life,
           injury  to  civilians,  damage  to  civilian   objects,   or   a
           combination of the above, would be excessive in relation to  the
           concrete and direct military advantage anticipated (see  Article
           51(5)(b) of the Additional Protocol).

        c. Precaution, whereby  in  the  conduct  of  military  operations,
           constant care must be taken to spare  the  civilian  population,
           civilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions must be
           taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of
           civilian life,  injury  to  civilians  and  damage  to  civilian
           objects.

43. Breaches of the above principles may amount to  acts  contrary  to  the
    basic rules of human conduct, if committed on a systemic  basis  as  an
    aspect of deliberate policy or official indifference to the  widespread
    actions of a brutal military.

44. When considering whether the threshold of acts contrary  to  the  basic
    rules of human conduct has been met, we consider that  some  evidential
    difficulties can arise.  It may be difficult  to  extrapolate  from  an
    examination of the  consequences  of  particular  military  action  the
    conclusion that the attack entailed breaches of the principles of,  for
    example, precaution, distinction  and  proportionality.   Knowing  what
    took place is distinct from knowing why something took place, and  with
    IHL, the why question is as relevant as the what question.

45. The Court of Appeal had to engage with similar  issues  in  R  (on  the
    application of the Campaign Against the  Arms  Trade)  v  Secretary  of
    State for International Trade [2019] EWCA Civ 1020 when considering the
    lawfulness of a decision to grant arms export  licences  in  favour  of
    Saudi Arabia.  Central to the lawfulness of the export licence was  the
    likely compliance by Saudi Arabia with IHL in its military campaign  in
    Yemen, the assessment of which involved a retrospective analysis of its
    past compliance.  The Court of Appeal  outlined  significant  IHL-based
    concerns  arising  from  certain  incidents  in  which  civilians   and
    hospitals appeared to have been  targeted.   A  significant  amount  of
    detailed information was available to the court, including from some of
    the same NGOs which have produced the background materials relied  upon
    by  the  appellants  in  these  proceedings   (for   example,   Amnesty
    International), from the Secretary of State, and from  a  UN  Panel  of
    Experts.  Significantly for present purposes, the court said at [134]:

         "In the very crudest terms, the NGO and  UN  Panel  evidence  often
         establishes what happened, but the further information available to
         the Secretary of State could assist as to why events of concern had
         happened. Both may of  course  be  highly  relevant  to  whether  a
         violation of IHL  had  taken  place  and  to  the  risk  of  future
         violations." (Emphasis added)

    In the context of those proceedings, through  diplomatic  and  military
    cooperation channels, the Secretary  of  State  had  available  to  him
    detailed information about the Saudi campaign which,  held  the  court,
    cast some light on why such events had taken place.  In many protection
    claims, no such detail will be available.  Only what happened is  often
    all that is available.  That is the position in these proceedings.

46. Accordingly, when considering  whether  an  appellant  is  at  risk  of
    engaging in, being associated with, or being required to perform  "acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct", it may be  more  helpful
    to focus on grave  breaches  of  international  humanitarian  law,  for
    example by reference to the provisions summarised  at  paragraph  [32],
    above, rather than isolated instances of events which  appear  to  have
    fallen foul of the jus in bello.  While breaches  of  those  principles
    could form part of the evidential landscape when determining whether  a
    military force engages in acts contrary to the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct, examples, even a pattern of examples, of collateral damage to,
    for example, civilian infrastructure, will not  necessarily  reach  the
    elevated threshold.  Regrettably, even examples of civilian deaths will
    not automatically call for the conclusion that  acts  contrary  to  the
    basic  rules  of  human  conduct  have  taken   place.    International
    humanitarian law reluctantly tolerates the loss to  civilian  life  and
    property, provided the striking force  sought  to  distinguish  between
    those directly participating in hostilities and  those  who  were  not,
    used proportionate force, and all feasible precautions  were  taken  to
    minimise the loss to civilian life and  infrastructure.   It  does  not
    necessarily follow that military action resulting  in  civilian  deaths
    amounts to a breach of IHL, still less to an act contrary to the  basic
    rules of human conduct.

47. Even where there have been breaches of those key IHL principles, it  is
    only where it may be said that there have been widespread breaches as a
    result of a policy and system that the possibility of categorising such
    breaches as acts contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct  arises:
    see Krotov. For military service potentially to entitle  an  individual
    to refugee status on the basis  that  such  service  would  entail  the
    commission of or participation in acts contrary to the basic  rules  of
    human conduct, there is, in practice, an  elevated  threshold,  in  the
    sense that "simple" breaches of certain obligations imposed by IHL will
    be insufficient to be categorised as acts contrary to the  basic  rules
    of human conduct, unless there is evidence of a  policy  or  system  to
    deploy such tactics on a widespread basis, or  they  are  permitted  to
    occur as the result of official indifference.

48. Of course, a persistent pattern of (for example)  direct  targeting  of
    occupied residential  dwellings,  with  no  warnings  and  no  apparent
    military justification, may lead to the conclusion,  particularly  when
    assessed to the  lower  standard  of  proof  applicable  to  protection
    proceedings, that a party has engaged in breaches of IHL pursuant to  a
    policy and system to do so on a widespread basis.  There  may  also  be
    specific  condemnation  from  the  international  community,  and  such
    condemnation can assist with the evidential question as to whether  the
    armed forces engaged in acts contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct, as observed by  Lord  Justice  Rix  in  Krotov.   The  overall
    attitude of a party to compliance with international legal  obligations
    may be a relevant factor; absent other facts, flagrant breaches of  the
    requirements of international law in area (e.g. detention) may  suggest
    that other apparent breaches were, in fact, actual breaches of IHL.  In
    such circumstances, the policy and system of the attacking  forces  may
    well demonstrate that the gross  and  wilful  disregard  for  the  core
    principles of jus in bello amounts to acts contrary to the basic  rules
    of human conduct.  Even so, in  such  circumstances,  scrutiny  of  the
    conduct of the attacking forces pursuant  to  the  Krotov  approach  to
    analysing the international legal obligations  summarised  at  [32]  is
    likely to be more helpful.

49. In contrast to the difficulties that  arise  when  considering  whether
    breaches of the jus in bello amount to acts contrary to the basic rules
    of human conduct, where the conduct in question involves "genocide, the
    deliberate killing and targeting  of  the  civilian  population,  rape,
    torture, the execution and ill-treatment of prisoners and the taking of
    civilian hostages" (c.f. Krotov at [30]), a conclusion that there  have
    been acts contrary to the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct  will  more
    readily follow.

50. Support for the elevated threshold  approach  is  provided  by  Article
    9(2)(e) of the Qualification Directive, which provides that prosecution
    for a refusal to perform military service in a conflict, where doing so
    would "include crimes or acts falling under the exclusion  clauses  set
    out in Article 12(2)."

51. The exclusion clauses contained in Article 12(2), which  is  quoted  at
    [12], above, correspond to Article 1F of the Convention  itself.    The
    wording of the Convention and the Qualification Directive are in unison
    on this point.  Significantly for  present  purposes,  the  "crimes  or
    acts" set out in the exclusion clauses are referred to as "a war crime,
    or  a  crime  against  humanity,  as  defined  in   the   international
    instruments drawn up to make provision in respect  of  such  crimes..."
    Neither instrument frames the relevant conduct by reference to straying
    beyond the principles of precaution, distinction  and  proportionality,
    or other similar concepts.  As set out  above,  while  we  accept  that
    where there are widespread and systemic breaches of those and other jus
    in bello principles, it is likely that such conduct will amount to acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, it is necessary to recall
    the approach of the  Qualification  Directive,  and  the  domestic  and
    international  authorities,  to  articulating  what  amounts  to   acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.

52. In light of  the  above  discussion,  for  a  working,  non-exhaustive,
    definition, we rely on that adopted by the Court of Appeal at  [30]  of
    Krotov: see [32], above.

53. The Krotov question of whether there is a "policy  or  system"  of  the
    armed forces to engage in conduct of this nature is both a  substantive
    and an evidential question. Whether there is a such a policy or  system
    in force is one  consideration  that  goes  to  the  issue  of  whether
    military service by the conscript  or  mobilised  reservist  "would  or
    might" involve acts contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct.
    Widespread commission by a military force of acts contrary to the basic
    rules of human conduct tends to suggest  that  there  is  a  policy  or
    system of deploying such tactics.   In  turn,  the  existence  of  such
    policy or system is one factor to consider when looking  ahead  to  the
    likely role of the conscript or mobilised reservist.  Without  evidence
    of the policy or system, or official indifference, the claim must fail.
     But if there is policy or system, that is not the end of the equation.
     Much turns on the likely profile and role, within the military, of the
    individual concerned,  which  brings  us  to  the  next  stage  of  our
    analysis.

The role of the conscript or mobilised reservist

54. Just as the "basic rules of human  conduct"  test  has  been  expressed
    differently by the authorities, so too has the  criterion  relating  to
    the role of the individual conscript or mobilised reservist within  the
    military's commission of such acts, in order  to  qualify  for  refugee
    status.

55. The first country guidance question formulated  for  our  consideration
    asks if the appellants' military service "would or might involve"  acts
    which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.   By  contrast,
    paragraph 171 of the UNHCR Handbook uses the  terminology  of  military
    action "with which an individual does not wish to be associated".

56. In dismissing the appeals in Sepet, the House of Lords upheld the Court
    of Appeal's judgment.  At [61], Laws LJ had expressed the role  of  the
    conscript or mobilised reservist in  terms  which  correlate  with  the
    UNHCR Handbook:

         "Next I should emphasise that it is  plain  (indeed  uncontentious)
         that there are circumstances in which a conscientious objector  may
         rightly claim that punishment for draft  evasion  would  amount  to
         persecution: where the military  service  to  which  he  is  called
         involves acts, with which he may be associated, which are  contrary
         to basic rules of human conduct; where the conditions  of  military
         service are themselves so harsh as to amount to persecution on  the
         facts; where the punishment in question is disproportionately harsh
         or severe. I am here  addressing  the  case  where  none  of  these
         additional factors is present." (Emphasis added)

57. In Sepet, Lord Bingham spoke in terms of the individual being  required
    to "commit atrocities" or "participate in a conflict...".  This appears
    to be a more stringent test  than  the  mere  "association"  with  such
    conduct, which is a concept that could be used to describe a number  of
    different scenarios not including direct commission,  participation  or
    support.

58.   In   Shepherd   v   Bundesrepublik   Deutschland   (Case    C-472/13)
    ECLI:EU:C:2015:117,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European   Union
    underlined the need for there to be a causal nexus, in the  context  of
    Article 9(2)(e) of the  Qualification  Directive,  between  the  likely
    military role of the asylum seeker and the "acts which  constitute  war
    crimes".  It said, at [38]:

         "...although the  enjoyment  of  international  protection  is  not
         limited to those who could be led to commit acts  which  constitute
         war crimes personally, such as combat troops, that  protection  can
         be  extended  only  to  those  other  persons  whose  tasks  could,
         sufficiently  directly  and  reasonably  plausibly,  lead  them  to
         participate in such acts."

59. For those who do not "commit" such acts directly, the requirement  that
    protection can only be extended  to  those  whose  roles  "sufficiently
    directly and reasonably plausibly" lead them  to  participate  in  such
    acts appears to reflect the fact that not all conscripts  or  mobilised
    reservists will be assigned tasks which could lead them to  participate
    in acts contrary to the basic  roles  of  human  conduct.   A  forward-
    looking assessment must be conducted  to  assess  the  likely  military
    activities  of  the  person  concerned.   Advocate  General   Sharpston
    observed at [44] of her opinion that the assessment to be performed:


         "...is difficult because it requires those authorities to  consider
         acts and the consequences of actions that have not yet taken place.
         The question then becomes, is it plausible that  the  acts  of  the
         person concerned would make  it  possible  for  war  crimes  to  be
         committed?" (Emphasis supplied)

60. The court expressed its conclusions in  the  following  terms,  in  the
    operative part of the judgment, and also at [46].  It held that Article
    9(2)(e) of the Qualification Directive must be interpreted  as  meaning
    that:

         "...it covers  all  military  personnel,  including  logistical  or
    support personnel;

          -  it  concerns  the  situation  in  which  the  military  service
            performed would itself include, in a  particular  conflict,  the
            commission of war crimes,  including  situations  in  which  the
            applicant for refugee status would participate  only  indirectly
            in the commission of such crimes  if  it  is  reasonably  likely
            that,  by  the  performance  of  his  tasks,  he  would  provide
            indispensable support to the preparation or execution  of  those
            crimes;"

         [...]

          - the factual assessment which it is for the national  authorities
            alone to carry out, under the  supervision  of  the  courts,  in
            order  to  determine  the  situation  of  the  military  service
            concerned, must be based  on  a  body  of  evidence  capable  of
            establishing, in view of all  the  circumstances  of  the  case,
            particularly those concerning the relevant facts as they  relate
            to the country of origin at the time of taking a decision on the
            application  and  to  the  individual  position   and   personal
            circumstances of the applicant, that the situation  in  question
            makes  it  credible  that  the  alleged  war  crimes  would   be
            committed;"

         [...]

          - the refusal to perform military service must constitute the only
            means by which the applicant  for  refugee  status  could  avoid
            participating in the alleged war crimes, and,  consequently,  if
            he  did  not  avail  himself  of  a  procedure   for   obtaining
            conscientious objector  status,  any  protection  under  Article
            9(2)(e) of Directive 2004/83 is excluded, unless that  applicant
            proves  that  no  procedure  of  that  nature  would  have  been
            available to him in his specific situation." (Emphasis added)

61. Accordingly, it must be reasonably likely that the individual concerned
    would make an essential material contribution  ("provide  indispensable
    support") to the acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct,  if
    not involved in the commission of such acts directly.  Mere  membership
    of armed  forces  which,  elsewhere  and  separately,  engage  in  acts
    contrary to the rules of human conduct  with  which  the  conscript  or
    mobilised reservist would not be involved would not  be  sufficient  to
    meet this threshold.

Convention nexus

62. It is unlikely to be necessary for a person seeking  recognition  as  a
    refugee on  this  basis  to  adduce  significant  evidence  that  their
    "political opinion" is to oppose acts contrary to the  basic  rules  of
    human conduct, where there is evidence that there is a  widespread  and
    systemic recourse to acts contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct
    by the military force in question which they too would be  required  to
    commit or provide indispensable support to.  By their very nature,  the
    basic rules of human conduct are values that many, if  not  most,  will
    hold.  Pursuant to Article 10(1)(e) of the Qualification Directive,  it
    is not necessary for an individual to have  acted  upon  those  beliefs
    previously.   The  catalyst  for  manifesting  political  opinion  that
    opposes acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct may  well  be
    the requirement to  perform  military  service  which  would  or  might
    involve conduct contrary to such basic rules.

63. Although not binding upon us, we note that Advocate  General  Sharpston
    delivered an opinion in EZ v Federal Republic of  Germany,  represented
    by the Bundesamt f�r Migration und Fl�chtlinge Case C-238/19 on 28  May
    2020, concerning  the  need  for  a  causal  link  between  an  act  of
    persecution under Article 9(2)(e) and the reasons for persecution under
    Article 10(1)(e) of the recast Qualification Directive 2011/95/EU.  The
    United Kingdom does not participate in that directive but the  material
    provisions for present purposes are identical to the 2004 Qualification
    Directive,  meaning  that  the  Advocate  General's  analysis   is   of
    persuasive force.  She said at [78]:

         "If the applicant's home country is actively engaged in  conducting
         a war and there is - as here - evidence that the war is  prosecuted
         in breach of international humanitarian law and involves systematic
         and repeated  incidents  of  war  crimes  documented  by  reputable
         sources, that is powerful objective material in support of a  claim
         for refugee status based on Article 10(1)(e)."

64. We add that we consider that it is only likely to  be  where  there  is
    evidence to the contrary that any real doubt will arise as  to  whether
    such a  person  genuinely  opposes  the  military  commission  of  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, for example, where  there
    is  evidence  that  the  individual  concerned   has   previously   and
    voluntarily been responsible for such  acts.   In  practice,  those  in
    relation to whom there are likely to be such doubts may well fall  foul
    of the exclusion clauses, with the result that the Convention (and  the
    analysis to be conduct pursuant to it) is not capable of being  engaged
    in the first place.  See, for example, R (on the application of MBT)  v
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (restricted  leave;  ILR;
    disability discrimination) [2019] UKUT 414 (IAC) at [24].

65. Similarly, the refusal of the individual concerned to perform  military
    service must be the only means available to them to avoid participating
    in or providing support to acts contrary to the basic  rules  of  human
    conduct.  If,  for  example,  there  is  a  procedure   for   obtaining
    conscientious  objector  status  which  would  enable  the   individual
    concerned to avoid military service that would or  might  involve  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of  human  conduct,  a  failure  to  obtain
    objector status under  that  procedure  will  negate  the  causal  link
    between the refusal to perform military service and persecution  for  a
    Convention reason.  See Shepherd at [45].

Punishment threshold

66. We must determine whether there is a minimum  threshold  of  punishment
    which must be passed in order for an  obligation  to  perform  military
    service which would or might involve the commission of or participation
    in acts contrary to the basic rules of  human  conduct.   In  remitting
    PK's case back to this tribunal, the Court of Appeal observed  at  [31]
    that,

         "The  question  whether  a  draft  evader  facing  a  non-custodial
         punishment for failing to serve in an army which regularly  commits
         acts contrary to IHL is entitled  to  refugee  status,  is  one  of
         overarching importance."

    The court added at [32] that:

         "This question has not received proper analysis."

67. In light of Shepherd at [38], and  the  Court  of  Justice's  operative
    conclusions, the Court of Appeal in PK at [31] must have been referring
    to a draft evader in relation to whom it could properly  be  said  that
    the tasks they would  be  assigned,  if  they  were  to  perform  their
    military  service,  could   "sufficiently   directly   and   reasonably
    plausibly" lead them to participate in such  acts.   Additionally,  the
    court must have assumed, as we do,  that  such  a  person's  "political
    opinion" would be in  opposition  to  engaging  in  such  conduct.   By
    definition, the question of "overarching importance" identified by  the
    Court of Appeal does not arise in the case of a conscript or  mobilised
    reservist where it is not reasonably likely that they would be required
    to engage in such acts, or where,  if  it  is  reasonably  likely,  the
    individual concerned does not object to engaging in such conduct.

68. We assume for the analysis that follows that such a link  exists.    We
    also assume that it would be  reasonably  likely  that  the  individual
    concerned would face some form of prosecution and  eventual  punishment
    on their return.  Those are, of course, fact-specific questions, to  be
    addressed in light of the country guidance we give in Part F.

69. In his closing submissions, Mr Malik sought to draw an analogy with the
    approach taken by refugee law to those seeking  asylum  on  grounds  of
    their sexual orientation.  He submitted that, just as it  is  necessary
    for those seeking recognition as refugees on account  of  their  sexual
    orientation to demonstrate that the law prohibiting such conduct  would
    be enforced, so too it is necessary for  those  evading  the  draft  to
    demonstrate that they would be reasonably likely  to  be  punished,  by
    sanctions of sufficient severity.

70. Mr Malik also submitted that the Court of Appeal  had  not  "disturbed"
    the conclusions of this tribunal in PK's case in its  earlier  reported
    decision, cited at [1], above, when it was set aside by that court.  In
    the impugned decision, a different constitution of this  tribunal  held
    in the judicial headnote as follows:


         "(i) A legal requirement for conscription and a mechanism  for  the
         prosecution  or  punishment  of  a  person  refusing  to  undertake
         military service is  not  sufficient  to  entitle  that  person  to
         refugee protection if there is no real risk that the person will be
         subjected to prosecution or punishment.


          (ii)    A person will only be entitled to  refugee  protection  if
         there is a real risk that the prosecution or punishment  they  face
         for refusing to perform military service in  a  conflict  that  may
         associate them with acts that are contrary to basic rules of  human
         conduct reaches a minimum threshold of severity."

71. Resisting Mr Malik's submissions, Mr Metzer for the  appellants  sought
    to draw a distinction between a compulsion to engage in  acts  contrary
    to the basic rules of human conduct, and  the  prohibition  of  certain
    sexual activity.  He put the matter in  these  terms,  in  his  written
    closing submissions:


         "...sexual activity or indeed the absence of it  is  not  something
         which could reasonably cause serious  mental  anguish  which  would
         amount to persecution. Compulsion to lend one's hand, against one's
         conscience, to a military  breaching  IHL,  is  where  we  say  the
         persecution lies, and it will be submitted in due course that  this
         is the only compatible reading of Shepherd..."

    It is beyond the scope  of  this  decision  to  determine  whether  the
    absence of sexual  activity  "could  reasonably  cause  serious  mental
    anguish which would amount to persecution", other than to observe  that
    this broad brush statement appears to  be  at  odds  with  settled  law
    concerning  asylum  claims  based  on  sexual  orientation,  where  the
    modification of sexual behaviour to avoid persecution  is  accepted  as
    falling squarely within the Convention.  However, we consider there  to
    be some merit in the distinction Mr Metzer seeks to draw  arising  from
    the nature of the conduct at issue, and the character of the underlying
    legal obligations and norms that would be  infringed  by  the  putative
    persecution.

72. We recall that the situation facing the putative refugee is one whereby
    he or she will be subject to a positive legal obligation to  engage  in
    conduct which is anathema to the broad  humanitarian  objectives  which
    lie at the heart of the Convention, and the norms of international  law
    from which no derogation is possible.  So much is clear from the  terms
    of the Convention itself.  The  Convention  does  not  apply  to  those
    caught  by  the  exclusion  clauses  in  Article  1F,  reflecting   its
    abhorrence at such conduct.  The Convention was drafted and agreed as a
    response  to  the  international  condemnation   which   followed   the
    atrocities of the Second World War, where there was widespread practice
    of "acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct".

73. While  it  is  well  established  that  there  are  no  hierarchies  of
    protection  amongst  the  Convention  reasons  for  persecution,   when
    determining the level and nature of the conduct  which  may  amount  to
    persecution, the assessment is necessarily context-specific.   So  much
    is clear from Minister voor Immigratie en Asiel v XYZ  (United  Nations
    High Commissioner for Refugees intervening) (Joined Cases C-199/12 to C-
    201/12) which considered whether refugee status should be  accorded  on
    the basis of sexual orientation in circumstances  where  there  was  no
    risk of enforcement of the criminal law prohibiting such conduct in the
    country from which protection is sought.

74. The issues in XYZ related primarily to whether there needs to be a real
    risk  of  the  criminal  law  prohibiting  homosexual  activity   being
    enforced.  The CJEU held that the mere  criminalisation  of  homosexual
    activity was insufficient.  But  where  a  term  of  imprisonment  "was
    actually applied", that would amount to  persecution.  See  the  second
    operative paragraph of the judgment:


         "Article 9(1) of [the Qualification Directive], read together  with
         article 9(2)(c) thereof, must be interpreted as  meaning  that  the
         criminalisation of homosexual acts per se does  not  constitute  an
         act of persecution. However, a term of imprisonment which sanctions
         homosexual acts and which is actually applied  in  the  country  of
         origin which adopted such legislation must be regarded as  being  a
         punishment which is disproportionate  or  discriminatory  and  thus
         constitutes an act of persecution."

    This appears to be the line of authority Mr Malik seeks to rely  on  to
    establish the parallels he sought to draw.

75. The CJEU noted at [51] of XYZ that Article 9(1)(a)  requires  "acts  of
    persecution" to be "sufficiently serious" by their nature or repetition
    "so as to constitute a severe  violation  of  basic  human  rights,  in
    particular  the  rights  from  which  derogation  cannot  be   made..."
    (emphasis added).  That the court highlighted that there was  a  subset
    of human rights, "basic human rights",  from  which  no  derogation  is
    possible pursuant to  Article  15(2)  of  the  ECHR,  was  significant.
    Article 15 of the ECHR concerns derogations  from  that  convention  in
    times of emergency.  Paragraph (2)  provides  that  there  are  certain
    obligations under the ECHR from which no derogation is  possible,  even
    in times of emergency:


         "No  derogation  from  Article  2,  except  in  respect  of  deaths
         resulting from lawful acts of war, or from Articles 3, 4 (paragraph
         1) and 7 shall be made under this provision."

    The only permissible derogation from Article 2 relates to  lawful  acts
    of war.  By definition, the acts of war with which we are concerned  in
    this decision are not lawful, with the effect  that  the  non-derogable
    character of the underlying human rights remains relevant.

76. Against that background, the court held  that  not  all  violations  of
    human rights would be sufficient to cross  the  threshold  of  severity
    inherent to Article 9(1); see [53]:

         "Therefore, not all violations of fundamental rights suffered by  a
         homosexual asylum seeker  will  necessarily  reach  that  level  of
         seriousness."

77. The significance of the above analysis of the CJEU is twofold.

78. First, by commencing  its  analysis  with  the  caveat  that  "not  all
    violations of fundamental rights" will cross the threshold of severity,
    the court was nevertheless  recognising  that  the  mere  existence  of
    legislation criminalising  homosexual  activity  was,  as  a  state  of
    affairs, a violation of the fundamental human rights of those  targeted
    by the legislation, albeit an insufficient violation to lead to refugee
    status, when taken in isolation.  It  is  hardly  surprising  that  the
    court considered the mere  existence  of  legislation  attaching  penal
    sanctions to homosexual activity to be a violation of some  fundamental
    rights.  A legal prohibition targeting the sexual identity, orientation
    and expression of certain persons plainly interferes with their  rights
    to private and  family  life  and  non-discrimination,  whether  viewed
    through the lens of the ECHR, or the Charter of Fundamental  Rights  of
    the European Union, even where it is not enforced.  A person caught  by
    such legislation would know that conduct which they consider  as  going
    to the heart of their identity is, in fact, criminalised by the  state.
    The existence of such condemnatory legislation could fuel and endorse a
    range of discriminatory behaviour to  which  the  individual  concerned
    would be subject in many different facets  of  their  life.   The  list
    could go on.

79. That the mere existence of such legislation can amount to  a  violation
    of a fundamental right is significant because it goes to the  issue  of
    whether the existence of a legal obligation  prohibiting  or  mandating
    certain conduct may itself be sufficient to constitute a violation of a
    fundamental right (albeit, in the context of  asylum  claims  based  on
    sexual orientation with no risk of  enforcement,  a  violation  at  the
    lesser end of the spectrum of severity).  Applied by analogy to a legal
    obligation mandating an individual to  perform  military  service  that
    would or might involve acts  contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct, the mere existence of such an  obligation  is,  in  principle,
    sufficient to amount to a violation of a fundamental right.

80. The second reason the approach of the CJEU  to  "sufficiently  serious"
    violations was significant is as follows: drawing on Article 9(1)(a) of
    the Qualification Directive,  the  court  drew  a  distinction  between
    violations of fundamental rights from which a derogation was  possible,
    on the one hand, and those from which there may be  no  derogation,  on
    the other.  It held at [54]:


         "...it must be stated at the outset  that  the  fundamental  rights
         specifically linked to the sexual orientation concerned in each  of
         the cases in the main proceedings, such as the right to respect for
         private and family life, which is protected by  article  8  of  the
         Human Rights Convention  ,  to  which  article  7  of  the  Charter
         corresponds, read together, where necessary, with article 14 of the
         Human Rights Convention, on which article 21(1) of the  Charter  is
         based, is not among the fundamental  human  rights  from  which  no
         derogation is possible."

81.  It  is  significant  in  sexual  orientation  asylum  cases  that  the
    underlying fundamental and  human  rights  (Articles  8  and  14  ECHR;
    Article 7 and 21(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) infringed  by
    discriminatory or persecutory behaviour are of  capable  of  being  the
    subject of a derogation.  So much is clear from  the  approach  of  the
    CJEU at [55], with emphasis added:


         "In  those  circumstances,  the  mere  existence   of   legislation
         criminalising  homosexual  acts  cannot  be  regarded  as  an   act
         affecting the applicant in a manner so significant that it  reaches
         the  level  of  seriousness  necessary  for  a  finding   that   it
         constitutes persecution within the meaning of Article 9(1)  of  the
         [Qualification Directive]."

    The "circumstances" referred to by the court related to  the  derogable
    nature  of  the  underlying  fundamental  rights  at  play   in   those
    proceedings.  In that context, for there to  be  an  interference  with
    "basic human rights" (to adopt the CJEU's  terminology)  sufficient  to
    amount to persecution, there must  be  a  corresponding  risk  of  some
    enforcement and punishment.

82. That is in stark contrast to the fundamental  human  rights  and  norms
    which underpin the international prohibition against engaging  in  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, which is the paradigm  of
    the present matter.  Where, as here, no derogation is possible from the
    underlying norms of  international  law  which  govern  the  elementary
    considerations of humanity (Nicar v. U.S.),  and  which  prohibit  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, different  considerations
    apply  when  determining  what  amounts  to  a  "sufficiently  serious"
    violation of fundamental rights.

83. Transposed to the questions we must address, the approach of the  Court
    of Justice suggests that the mere existence  of  legislation  which  is
    offensive to a person's identity and protected characteristics  is,  in
    principle, capable of amounting to a violation of  fundamental  rights.
    That is not to say that there need not be any prospect  of  punishment,
    even in a military case, but it is a factor which informs the threshold
    which such punishment should or  could  pass  in  order  to  amount  to
    persecution, especially where the violations of  "basic  human  rights"
    would be concerned.  We consider that the nature of the  conduct  under
    consideration calibrates the threshold of punishment which must be  met
    in order to amount to the individual concerned "being persecuted".

84. Against that background, we note that the indicative examples  of  acts
    of persecution given in Article 9(2)  of  the  Qualification  Directive
    draw  a  distinction  between  "prosecution  or  punishment,  which  is
    disproportionate or discriminatory" (Article 9(2)(c)), on the one hand,
    and "prosecution or punishment" for refusal to perform military service
    in a conflict for acts which would fall within Article  12(2)  (Article
    9(2)(e)), on the other.  Under Article 9(2)(e), there is no requirement
    that prosecution or punishment be disproportionate  or  discriminatory,
    and there is no indication of a threshold of punishment, in contrast to
    the  position  with  prosecution  or  punishment  for  other  types  of
    offences, which must be disproportionate or discriminatory in order  to
    be categorised as an act of persecution.

85. While we recall that Article 9(1) requires acts of persecution  to  "be
    sufficiently serious by their nature or repetition as to  constitute  a
    severe violation of basic human rights...", we  do  not  consider  that
    that provision, when viewed in the purposive  context  of  the  Refugee
    Convention,  excludes  the  possibility  that  any  legal   requirement
    enforced by penal or  other  punitive  sanctions  to  perform  military
    service which would or might involve the commission or participation of
    acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct  could  amount  to
    "sufficiently serious" persecution.

86. Returning to Shepherd, in its discussion of the engagement  of  Article
    9(2)(e) of the Qualification Directive from [30] to [46], the CJEU  did
    not import into its analysis any consideration of a  minimum  threshold
    for punishment.  That is in stark  contrast  to  the  court's  separate
    consideration of the eighth question  posed  by  the  referring  court,
    which concerned the circumstances in which punishment for  the  evasion
    of military service would engage Article 9(2)(b) of  the  Qualification
    Directive (legal,  administrative,  police,  and/or  judicial  measures
    which are in themselves discriminatory or which are  implemented  in  a
    discriminatory manner) and 9(2)(c) (disproportionate or  discriminatory
    prosecution or punishment).  The court addressed  this  question  after
    identifying the need for a causal nexus between the military service of
    the individual concerned and the likelihood of engaging in  war  crimes
    from [30] to [46].  It  said,  at  [48],  that  by  asking  the  eighth
    question:


         "...the referring court must be regarded  as  linking  the  present
         question only to  the  hypothesis  that  the  national  authorities
         responsible for examining the application for refugee status of the
         applicant  in  the  main  proceedings  consider  that  it  is   not
         established that the military service he refuses to  perform  would
         include the commission of war crimes."

    Put another way, it was  only  when  there  was  no  prospect  of  "the
    commission of war crimes" that questions relating to  the  severity  of
    punishment were engaged.

87. We are reinforced in this approach by that of Lord  Bingham  in  Sepet,
    who, at [8], did not suggest that there was a punishment  threshold  in
    order for refugee status to be accorded  to  one  who  has  refused  to
    undertake compulsory military service on the grounds that such  service
    would or might require him to commit atrocities or gross  human  rights
    abuses.

88. In Krotov, the Court of Appeal appeared to adopt  a  similar  approach.
    At [51], it held:


         "If a court or tribunal is satisfied (a) that the level and  nature
         of the conflict, and the  attitude  of  the  relevant  governmental
         authority towards it, has reached a position where  combatants  are
         or may be required on a sufficiently widespread  basis  to  act  in
         breach of the basic rules of human conduct generally recognised  by
         the international community, (b) that they  will  be  punished  for
         refusing to do so and (c) that disapproval of such methods and fear
         of such punishment is the genuine reason motivating the refusal  of
         an asylum seeker to serve in the relevant conflict, then it  should
         find that a Convention ground has been established."

    We note that the reference to "punishment" is not  accompanied  by  any
    threshold of minimum severity, although the appellant in that case  was
    a deserter who fled battle in Grozny, Chechnya, in January 2000  during
    live conflict, and so would have been  likely  to  face  a  significant
    custodial sentence.

89. We were taken to the Scottish case of Davidov v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department 2005 1 S.C. 540,  which  considered  the  Court  of
    Appeal's approach in Krotov.  At [17], Lord Hamilton, giving  the  lead
    opinion on behalf of the First Division of the Inner House held:


          "...it is plain, in particular from Krotov  (para  51),  that,  if
         condition (a) is satisfied, condition (b) requires only that  there
         should be punishment for refusal to act, not  that  the  punishment
         should itself be grossly excessive or disproportionate or otherwise
         constitute persecution or infringement of  the  individual's  human
         rights. That is, where condition (a) is satisfied,  punishment  for
         refusal to serve itself constitutes persecution for the purposes of
         the Convention..."

90. In his closing submissions, Mr  Malik  submitted  that  we  should  not
    follow the Davidov approach.  It is not binding on  this  tribunal,  he
    submitted, and is  at  odds  with  the  minimum  persecutory  threshold
    inherent to refugee law, as reflected by the Qualification  Directive's
    requirement that acts of persecution be sufficiently severe.  That  was
    a different approach to that set out in his  skeleton  argument,  which
    stated at [56], that "The UT can safely  conclude  that  Lord  Hamilton
    could not have intended to say any punishment (a reprimand, caution  or
    fine) would be sufficient."

91. We accept that punishment or prosecution must be  sufficiently  serious
    in order to amount to persecution for the purposes of  the  Convention.
    Everything turns on what amounts  to  "sufficiently  serious"  in  this
    unique context. We have set out above how the thresholds which must  be
    met for punishment to amount  to  persecution  vary  according  to  the
    purpose and context of the punishment, and the nature of the underlying
    fundamental rights engaged by the circumstances in which the punishment
    will be imposed.

92. In the case of military  service  that  would  or  might  involve  acts
    contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct,  an  individual  faces
    punishment for the prospect of  refusing  to  comply  with  a  positive
    obligation to engage in conduct from which no derogations are possible,
    and which offends the elementary considerations  of  humanity.   It  is
    difficult to imagine a more offensive and abhorrent legal obligation to
    be subject to.  Where a person's  "political  opinion"  (to  adopt  the
    Convention terminology) is to object to such  conduct  by  refusing  to
    perform the military service which  would  or  might  involve  it,  any
    punishment that is more than negligible will amount to persecution.  It
    would be anathema to the humanitarian objectives of the  Convention  to
    expel an individual to a country  which  would  subject  them  to  that
    obligation, on pain of any punishment.

93. In the present context, the character of the persecution is  the  legal
    obligation, imposed by the conscripting or  mobilising  state,  upon  a
    person to engage in military conduct that would involve the  commission
    of, or be reasonably likely to provide indispensable  support  to,  the
    preparation or execution of acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human
    conduct.  The mere prospect of any punishment  for  failure  to  comply
    with a legal obligation imposed by the State to engage in such  conduct
    amounts to persecution.  There is no minimum threshold,  provided  that
    the punishment is  causally  linked  to  the  individual's  refusal  to
    perform military service which itself would involve the  commission  of
    or participation in acts contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct.



94. Ancillary administrative or criminal punishments  are  unlikely  to  be
    sufficient unless discriminatory or  disproportionate,  for  they  will
    lack the necessary causal link to the underlying obligation  to  engage
    in acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.  If, for example,
    the punishment would be limited to an administrative fine for a failure
    to report to a draft office, with no reasonable likelihood  of  further
    punishment such as a criminal sanction for refusing to perform military
    service, a persecution scenario is less likely to be present.

95. However, where the punishment is anchored to the refusal or failure  to
    engage in military service, even a fine  or  a  non-custodial  sentence
    would place the individual concerned at odds with the  conscripting  or
    mobilising state, potentially for the rest  of  their  lives.   Such  a
    punishment would be a formal sanction from the state  for  refusing  to
    engage in conduct which would be anathema to the Convention.  It  could
    affect the individual's employment  prospects,  eligibility  for  state
    assistance, as well as have an external impact, such as  having  to  be
    declared to other states in, for example, a visa application.

96. Just as the Convention does not expect  people  to  lie  to  the  state
    authorities about, for example, their  sur  place  or  other  political
    activities when questioned at the border upon their return, so  too  we
    cannot see how it expects a putative refugee to be returned to  a  life
    of defiance in the face of a positive legal  obligation  to  engage  in
    conduct which is contrary to international  norms  and  from  which  no
    derogation is possible, with the likely ensuing consequences,  even  if
    those consequences "only" entail a suspended sentence or similar.   The
    applicant for asylum would be returned to face the invidious choice  of
    performing military service that would or might involve  acts  contrary
    to the basic rules of human conduct, or, alternatively,  submitting  to
    punishment and all that that would entail for refusing to do so.

97. In Krotov at [39], the Court of Appeal spoke of such a person returning
    with  "no  choice"  but  to  perform  military  service  entailing  the
    commission of international crimes.  The court cannot have  meant  that
    there would literally be  no  choice,  for  it  was  not  addressing  a
    situation whereby recruits would be detained and forcibly  conveyed  to
    the battlefield.  The context  of  the  discussion  was  an  individual
    facing punishment for the refusal to engage in such conduct.  Thus  the
    individual faced with "no choice" at [39] of Krotov is, in reality, the
    same individual faced with what we have termed the  "invidious  choice"
    of responding to the call-up or  mobilisation,  on  the  one  hand,  or
    facing punishment for refusing to do so, on  the  other.   Whether  the
    individual is described as facing "no choice" or facing  an  "invidious
    choice", it would be a state of affairs which would, in  our  judgment,
    amount to persecution.

98. We consider this approach to be  consistent  with  that  taken  by  the
    respondent in her Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine: Military
    Service, version 6.0, March 2020.   In  the  "policy"  section  of  the
    document, under the  heading  Basis  of  claim,  the  note  states,  at
    [1.1.1]:

         "Fear of persecution or serious harm by the state because of:

             (a) the general treatment and/or conditions likely to be faced
             by the  person  during  compulsory  military  service  duties;
             and/or

             (b) a person being required to perform military service during
             emergency   mobilisation,   despite   their   stance   as    a
             conscientious objector; and/or

             (c)  treatment  likely  to  be  faced  by  the  person  during
             compulsory  military  service  due  to  the  person's   sexual
             orientation; and/or

             (d) the penalties likely to be faced by the  person's  refusal
             to  undertake,  or  their  desertion  from,  military  service
             duties; and/or

             (e) prison conditions if a draft evader convicted in  absentia
             is held in detention on return to Ukraine."

    As may  be  seen,  in  the  respondent's  own  guidance,  there  is  no
    requirement for punishment of a minimum threshold.   Sub-paragraph  (b)
    of the policy focusses on the requirement to perform military  service,
    rather than the punishment for non-compliance with the requirement.

99. We consider that, in practical terms, the punishment must be  real  and
    must relate  to  the  individual's  refusal  to  perform  the  military
    service.  If the "punishment" is so negligible so as to  amount  to  no
    punishment at all, it cannot be said to amount to persecution.  Even if
    punishment is not negligible, if it is imposed for  some  other  reason
    than the individual's refusal to perform military service,  or  if  the
    individual failed to avail him or herself of a  conscientious  objector
    procedure that was otherwise available, the punishment  will  lack  the
    necessary nexus to persecution being for a Convention reason.

100. We reiterate that this conclusion applies only  in  relation  to  those
    whose personal conduct would either  involve  the  commission  of  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, or those in  relation  to
    whom it is reasonably likely that, by the performance of  their  tasks,
    they  would  provide  indispensable  support  to  the  preparation   or
    execution of acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.   Where
    there is no such likelihood, it would be necessary for  the  punishment
    to be disproportionate or discriminatory.

101. In the  Ukraine  context,  as  we  demonstrate  below,  the  background
    materials  and  the  expert  evidence  demonstrates  that  it  is   not
    reasonably likely that a  conscript  or  a  mobilised  reservist  would
    engage in acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct,  absent
    some case-specific reason why the individual concerned would be exposed
    to duties of that nature.  In turn, the prospect of a common or  garden
    draft evader being punished for refusing to perform military service in
    circumstances where it may properly be said that  the  reason  for  the
    punishment is the individual's  refusal  to  be  associated  with  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, is very low.

102. While every case will be fact-specific,  in  the  Ukraine  context,  in
    light of our findings below that conscripts or mobilised reservists are
    not sent to the front line, we consider there would  have  to  be  some
    special factor, perhaps due to the  prior  qualifications  or  military
    experience of the individual concerned, in order  to  merit  a  finding
    that the individual would engage in acts contrary to the basic rules of
    human conduct, were they to perform their military service.   In  turn,
    such  a  person  would,  if  prosecuted,  be  more  likely  to  receive
    punishment of a more severe nature than a fine or  suspended  sentence,
    as it is likely  that  such  an  individual  would  have  some  special
    characteristic, such as enhanced military  skills,  training  or  prior
    experience, which would amount  to  an  aggravating  feature:  see  VB,
    Headnote (1).

103. It follows that the prospect of an individual  being  recognised  as  a
    refugee as a result of the prospect  of  a  non-custodial  criminal  or
    administrative disposal is correspondingly very low and is  a  scenario
    that is likely to arise more in theory than in practice.

Summary of legal conclusions

104. Drawing together the above analysis:

        a. Where a  person  faces  punishment  for  a  refusal  to  perform
           military service that would or might involve  acts  contrary  to
           the basic rules of human conduct, that is capable  of  amounting
           to "being persecuted" on grounds of political  opinion  for  the
           purposes of the Refugee Convention.

        b. The term "acts contrary to the basic  rules  of  human  conduct"
           refers to the core  of  humanitarian  norms  generally  accepted
           between  nations  as  necessary  and   applicable   to   protect
           individuals  in  war  or  armed  conflict  and,  in   particular
           civilians, the wounded and prisoners of war.  It  includes,  but
           is not limited to, the indicative examples listed  in  Krotov  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 69 at
           [30] to [36].

        c. In order to  engage  the  Refugee  Convention,  the  conduct  in
           question must be committed on a systematic basis, as the  result
           of deliberate policy or official indifference to the  widespread
           actions of a brutal military.  In practice, the term conveys  an
           elevated threshold.

        d. It is not necessary  for  there  to  be  specific  international
           condemnation of the conflict in question for the conduct of  the
           military to be categorised as engaging in acts contrary  to  the
           basic rules of human conduct.  The  international  community  of
           states as  a  whole  has  already  condemned  conduct  which  is
           contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct  through  its
           recognition of the existence of international norms  from  which
           no derogation is possible, and  the  adoption  of  international
           legal instruments  recognising  the  prohibitions  against  such
           conduct.

        e. However, where there is specific international  condemnation  of
           such acts, that is likely to provide  an  evidential  basis  for
           concluding that it is reasonably likely that the military  force
           in question is engaging in acts contrary to the basic  rules  of
           human conduct on a widespread and systemic basis.

        f. The individual concerned must demonstrate that it is  reasonably
           likely that their military service would involve the  commission
           of acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, or that it
           is reasonably likely that, by the performance  of  their  tasks,
           they would provide indispensable support to the  preparation  or
           execution of such acts.

        g. The political opinion of the person concerned must be to  oppose
           the commission of acts contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human
           conduct.  In practice, it is unlikely  to  be  necessary  for  a
           person to  adduce  significant  evidence  that  their  political
           opinion is to oppose such conduct.  It is only  where  there  is
           evidence to the contrary that any real doubt is likely to arise,
           for  example  where  there  is  evidence  that  the   individual
           concerned has previously and voluntarily  been  responsible  for
           acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct.   Such  an
           individual may well fall foul of the exclusion  clauses  in  the
           Refugee Convention in any event.

        h. There must be no  other  way  to  avoid  military  service,  for
           example through the individual concerned availing him or herself
           of a conscientious objector process.

        i. Where a causal link exists between the likely military  role  of
           the conscript or  mobilised  reservist,  the  commission  of  or
           participation in acts contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
           conduct, and the punishment to be imposed, punishment  including
           a fine or a non-custodial sentence will be sufficient to  amount
           to  "being  persecuted"  for  the  purposes   of   the   Refugee
           Convention, provided it is more than negligible.



PART C: BACKGROUND MATERIALS AND EXPERT EVIDENCE

Terms defined

105. The Ukrainian government has termed the conflict region in the east  of
    the country "the Anti-Terrorist Operation zone", or "ATO".  It  is  the
    term Professor Bowring used in his reports.  By contrast, many  of  the
    background materials refer to the conflict in the east of the  country.
    In this decision, we refer to the ATO and the conflict in the  east  of
    the country interchangeably.  The focus of hostilities is also referred
    to as the "contact line", particularly by the OHCHR.

106. Where we refer to the "Ukrainian military", we  are  referring  to  all
    Ukrainian armed forces, and the institutions that support them.   Where
    the context  requires,  references  simply  to  "Ukraine"  are  to  the
    Ukrainian side in the conflict, encompassing the Ukrainian military and
    supporting infrastructure.

The expert evidence and background materials

107. The  appellants  relied  on  several  background  materials,  plus  the
    reports and oral evidence of Professor William Bowring, a barrister and
    professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London, and an  established
    expert in matters relating to Russia and Ukraine.  Professor  Bowring's
    evidence has been accepted as authoritative  in  a  number  of  matters
    before  the  courts  concerning  matters  in  the   region,   and   was
    instrumental in the previous country guidance, VB.   Professor  Bowring
    authored two expert reports, dated 8 and 28 April 2020, and  gave  oral
    evidence before us.

108. The background materials included in the appellants'  and  respondent's
    bundles are listed in Annex A to this  decision.   We  have  considered
    those materials in their entirety.

109. In addition, during Professor  Bowring's  evidence  on  3  June,  those
    representing the appellants appeared to conduct some additional  online
    research, in Russian,  the  product  of  which  Professor  Bowring  was
    invited to comment upon (and in one  case,  interpret)  after  a  short
    adjournment.  We have listed the new documents  at  paragraph  228  and
    following.  Very fairly, Mr Malik was content for us to admit  the  new
    documents into evidence, despite the lateness of the hour, on the basis
    that he was concerned to ensure that we had available to  us  the  most
    comprehensive selection of background materials, lest it be  said  that
    our decision  had  been  reached  without  consideration  of  otherwise
    relevant documents.

Ukraine - the political and security situation

110. Before addressing the specific issues for consideration,  we  must  set
    out the background context within which our analysis must take place.

111. The recent  history  of  Ukraine  has  been  dominated  by  significant
    disruption.  In November 2013, in what was widely perceived at the time
    to be a sudden and unexpected move, the government of Ukraine announced
    that it was suspending negotiations concerning  the  conclusion  of  an
    Association Agreement with the European Union.  Negotiations were at  a
    relatively advanced stage, and the agreement was hoped by some to be  a
    precursor to a formal roadmap for Ukraine's eventual accession  to  the
    European Union. Commentators attributed the  government's  decision  to
    pressure from neighbouring Russia, which was said to be  reluctant  for
    Ukraine to conclude a formal alliance with the European Union,  at  the
    cost of a potential loss of Russian influence.  The abandonment of  the
    negotiations  triggered  widespread  citizens'  protests  against   the
    government, and a subsequent crackdown by the authorities  against  the
    unrest.  The focal point of the  anti-government  protests  was  Kyiv's
    Independence Square.  The movement catalysed  by  the  protests  became
    known as the "Euromaidan" or "Maidan" protests or movement.

112. The Euromaidan protests  also  demonstrated  against  the  government's
    adoption of "anti-protest" laws, on 16  January  2014.   Demonstrations
    continued and the clashes between government forces  and  demonstrators
    escalated.  Several unarmed protestors were killed by sniper fire,  for
    which responsibility is yet to be established.  The then Prime Minister
    resigned.  President Yanukovych claimed to have  reached  an  agreement
    with  the  opposition  to  secure   some   political   resolution   and
    reconciliation, yet fled shortly afterwards, eventually  for  exile  in
    southern Russia.  The Ukrainian parliament voted to remove him from his
    post on 22 February 2014, and 25 May was set as a date  for  a  special
    election to identify his replacement.  A warrant was  also  issued  for
    the (by now) former president's arrest, accusing him of  "mass  killing
    of civilians".  Professor Bowring opines at [14] of  his  first  report
    that these events had major political consequences,  arising  from  the
    emergence of a political vacuum and transition of power at the  highest
    levels.

113. In parallel to the domestic unrest caused by the  Euromaidan  movement,
    the Russian Federation annexed the  Crimean  Peninsula,  following  its
    occupation by Russian forces.   Fighting  broke  out  in  the  east  of
    Ukraine between the Ukrainian government and  self-declared  separatist
    territories in Donetsk, Luhansk and other locations.  Opponents of  the
    new   Kyiv   government   occupied   buildings   belonging   to   local
    administrations and law enforcement, demanding increased local autonomy
    or independence from Ukraine, and closer ties with Russia.  The  newly-
    formed  armed  separatist  groups,  which  many  in  the  international
    community consider to be backed by Russia (see, e.g., "You don't exist"
    - Arbitrary Detentions, Enforced Disappearances, and Torture in Eastern
    Ukraine, page 10; United States Department of  State  ("USDS")  Ukraine
    2017 Human Rights Report at page 14; Office of the  Prosecutor  of  the
    International  Criminal  Court,  Report  on   Preliminary   Examination
    Activities for 2019 at  [277]),  justified  their  actions  by  raising
    concerns about the rights of the region's minority of  Russian-speaking
    residents.  Russia-backed  separatists  continue  to  hold  substantial
    territory in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, with the  areas  in  question
    now purporting to be the "Donetsk people's republic"  and  the  Luhansk
    people's republic."

114. An initial peace agreement was signed  in  2014,  in  Minsk.   Fighting
    continued, and a  further  ceasefire  agreement  was  agreed  in  2015.
    Again, fighting continued.  At a conference held in Paris  attended  by
    France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, a further agreement  was  reached,
    under which the parties agreed to implement the ceasefire in  full  and
    disengage military forces in three additional regions  by  the  end  of
    March 2020.

115. At [26] of his first report, Professor Bowring writes that:

         "Armed conflict continues, but not on  the  scale  of  the  earlier
         years. Ukraine now has a much more professional and  capable  army,
         which is gradually making inroads into separatist held territory.

116. Professor Bowring goes on to explain that  Russian-led  forces  mounted
    ten attacks on Ukrainian positions in Donbas on  21  March  2020.   One
    Ukrainian soldier was wounded in action.  However, since 23 March 2020,
    Russian  invaders  had  been  observing  the  ceasefire  and  no   army
    casualties had been reported since then, he writes.

117. The government response to the protests, and the  conflict  in  eastern
    Ukraine and Crimea has led  to  well-documented  allegations  of  human
    rights  abuses,  breaches  of  international  humanitarian   law,   and
    allegations of war crimes by all participants  to  the  conflict.   The
    allegations include cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture
    during  detention,  extra-judicial  killing,  and   breaches   of   the
    principles  of  distinction,  precaution  and   proportionality   under
    international humanitarian law.

118. The strain on the military from the ongoing conflict  has  thrown  into
    sharp relief the Ukrainian law and practice concerning  the  compulsory
    conscription of new recruits, and the mobilisation of reservists.

Unrest and hostilities: international reaction

119. In Resolution 1988 (2014), the Parliamentary Assembly  of  the  Council
    of Europe said that it "deeply regrets" the events  of  the  Euromaidan
    protests, stating that the "unprecedented escalation of  violence"  was
    "largely the resulted of the increasingly hard-handed approach  of  the
    authorities".  The resolution condemned the use  of  snipers  and  live
    ammunition against the protesters, stating that there should be a  full
    and effective investigation, and there could be no impunity  for  human
    rights abuses, regardless of who committed them.

120. On 27 March 2014, the UN General  Assembly  adopted  Resolution  68/262
    titled the "Territorial  integrity  of  Ukraine",  which  recalled  the
    prohibition under international law against the forced  acquisition  of
    territory from one state by another.  The operative provisions  of  the
    resolution affirmed the internationally recognised borders  of  Ukraine
    and called upon states not to recognise any alteration of the status of
    Crimea from part of Ukrainian sovereign territory.  The resolution also
    called for all States to desist and refrain from actions aimed  at  the
    partial or total disruption  of  the  national  unity  and  territorial
    integrity of  Ukraine,  including  any  attempts  to  modify  Ukraine's
    borders through the threat or use of force or other unlawful means.

Background materials: conduct of the Ukrainian military

121.  Professor  Bowring's  first  report  drew  heavily  on  many  of   the
    background materials listed in Annex A concerning the  conduct  of  the
    Ukrainian armed forces in the ATO, and the ongoing conflict, as well as
    outlining his opinion on various matters.  We are grateful to Professor
    Bowring for drawing our attention  to  those  materials,  and  for  his
    commentary upon  them.   We  will  turn  to  Professor  Bowring's  oral
    evidence, and the additional documents upon which  he  was  invited  to
    comment by Mr Metzer, once  we  have  surveyed  the  landscape  of  the
    background materials relied upon in his reports, and by the respondent.



122. The background materials we have been taken to are  from  a  number  of
    respected and independent non-governmental organisations, the Office of
    the United Nations High Commissioner for Human  Rights  ("OHCHR"),  the
    USDS, the respondent's own Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine:
    Military Service, and her Response to an Information  Request  Ukraine:
    Military service, 11/19-034, 15 November 2019.

123. The methodology adopted by the authors of OHCHR reports  entails  field
    visits to territory controlled by the government or  separatist  forces
    (although access to the latter  is  typically  denied).   The  earliest
    OHCHR report we were invited to consider was its Report  on  the  human
    rights situation in Ukraine 16 August to 15 November 2017.  The  report
    is based on information collected by the UN's Human  Rights  Monitoring
    Mission Ukraine ("HRMMU") through interviews with  victims,  witnesses,
    lawyers, government representatives and others.  For that  report,  290
    such interviews were conducted, and site visits were made to  territory
    held by both sides of the conflict.  The OHCHR and HRMMU appear to have
    enjoyed much greater access to government-controlled territory than  to
    rebel-held territory, with the consequence that,  in  relation  to  the
    reports'  conclusions  concerning  government-held  territory,  we  can
    necessarily have a high level of confidence.

124. The standard  of  proof  adopted  by  the  authors  of  the  report  is
    described as the "reasonable grounds to believe" standard.   That  term
    is defined at [16] of the Report  on  the  human  rights  situation  in
    Ukraine 16 November 2019 to 15 February 2020 as being a situation:

          "where, based on a body of  verified  information,  an  ordinarily
         prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that  the
         facts took place as  described  and  where  legal  conclusions  are
         drawn, that these facts meet all the elements of a violation..."

125. In that report, the authors conducted 52 field visits,  which  included
    15 places of  detention,  118  trial  hearings,  eight  assemblies  and
    interviews with 129  victims  or  witnesses  of  alleged  human  rights
    violations,  their  relatives,  lawyers,  government   representatives,
    members of civil society and other interlocutors.   The  authors  state
    that they draw on information obtained  from  court  records,  official
    records, open sources, and other relevant material.

126. The methodology adopted by the OHCHR in the November 2019  to  February
    2020 report is typical of  that  it  adopts  in  each  of  its  regular
    reports.  The respondent herself relies on the OHCHR's findings in  her
    Country Policy and Information Note Ukraine: Military Service,  and  in
    the Response to an Information Request Ukraine: Military service, 11/19-
    034, 15 November 2019.  We readily accept  that  the  OHCHR's  findings
    carry weight. We do not understand the respondent to  contend  anything
    other than the findings and analysis of all  OHCHR  reports  should  be
    treated with similar respect.

127. We pause to observe that, although the terminology is  similar  to  the
    "reasonable likelihood" standard applicable in protection  proceedings,
    elements of the OHCHR's "reasonable grounds" standard appear to  impose
    a higher, more stringent standard than what is understood as the  lower
    standard domestically.  For  example,  there  is  no  requirement  when
    substantiating a protection  claim  to  provide  a  "body  of  verified
    information", given the absence of any  requirement  for  corroboration
    under international law.

Acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct

128. Before considering whether the appellants "would or might" be  involved
    in acts contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct,  we  must  first
    determine whether the Ukrainian armed forces engage in  such  activity.
    To do this  we  will  examine  the  background  materials  collated  by
    Professor Bowring,  as  well  as  his  oral  evidence,  and  all  other
    background materials to which our attention has been drawn.

129. In following the thematic approach adopted by the appellants  in  their
    presentation of the background materials, we have  necessarily  had  to
    refer to some of the materials more than once, where  they  are  relied
    upon to establish two separate propositions.  On other  occasions,  the
    same incident is relied upon by the appellants to demonstrate different
    facets of the misconduct of the Ukrainian  military,  for  example,  to
    demonstrate   disregard   for   both   civilian   life   and   civilian
    installations.  This, of  course,  reflects  the  fact  that  the  same
    incident may raise concerns on a number of different fronts; collateral
    damage to civilian infrastructure,  civilian  deaths,  interruption  to
    basic services, etc.

Arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment of conflict detainees

130. Amnesty International's May 2015 report, Breaking Bodies:  Torture  and
    Summary Killings in Eastern  Ukraine  outlines  the  detailed  accounts
    given by those detained by  Ukrainian  and  separatist  forces  in  the
    conflict in the east of the  country  concerning  arbitrary  detention,
    torture and extra-judicial  killing.   Reports  of  torture  and  other
    cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment characterise  the  experiences
    of those featured in the report.  At page 5, the authors state:

         "The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that both  Ukrainian  forces
         and pro-Kyiv militia on the one side and separatist forces  on  the
         other have committed the war crime of torture on persons  in  their
         custody."

    The report highlights a particular feature  of  the  Ukraine  conflict,
    namely the use - by both sides - of irregular militia  groups,  aligned
    with either the Ukrainian or separatist sides.   There  is  "compelling
    evidence" suggesting that prisoner abuse was frequent  and  widespread,
    the report states (page 6).  The misconduct  was  not  limited  to  any
    particular police or military unit, separatist force or irregular armed
    group, although the authors note  that  certain  groups,  namely  those
    outside the official or de facto  chains  of  command  on  both  sides,
    appear to be more lawless and violent in their treatment  of  prisoners
    of war than others.  The evidence suggested that those held by pro-Kyiv
    forces were "eventually" brought before a  judge  and  moved  into  the
    regular criminal justice system.   Even  in  those  cases,  the  report
    states, the responses of judges to clear signs of  prisoner  abuse  had
    been disappointing.  Prisoners reportedly showing clear signs of abuse,
    such as bruised faces, split lips and  black  eyes,  did  not  lead  to
    judicial concern or investigation.

131. By May 2016,  matters  had  not  improved,  Amnesty  reported.   In  an
    article entitled No justice for eastern Ukraine's  victims  of  torture
    originally published in Newsweek, Amnesty's Senior Director of Research
    recounted in vivid detail an account she had been given by  a  survivor
    of Ukrainian detention and torture.  The detainee, a 55  year  old  gas
    board employee, recounted how Ukrainian forces raided her home situated
    20 kilometres from Donetsk.  She was dragged away and beaten  severely,
    on account  of  being  a  suspected  radio  operator  and  spotter  for
    separatist forces.  She was beaten with a rubber hammer, thrown against
    walls, not fed, not allowed to go to the toilet, and  kept  on  a  bare
    concrete floor for two weeks.  She suffered  a  broken  nose,  jaw  and
    cheekbones, her medical records confirmed.  Her  experience,  said  the
    article, was "far from unique".  Accounts of this nature  are  peppered
    throughout the background materials;  this  is  far  from  an  isolated
    occasion.

132. In their joint 2016 report, "You don't exist" -  Arbitrary  Detentions,
    Enforced  Disappearances,  and  Torture  in  Eastern  Ukraine,  Amnesty
    International and Human Rights Watch  ("HRW")  outline  nine  real-life
    case studies  involving  arbitrary  detentions  at  the  hands  of  the
    Ukrainian authorities.  In most cases, pro-government forces  conducted
    the initial detention, before handing  the  detainee  to  the  Security
    Service of Ukraine ("the SBU")  for  a  further  period  of  detention.
    There was usually an onward transmission of the detainee to the regular
    criminal justice system.   The  examples  record  the  SBU  as  holding
    detainees for periods ranging from six weeks to 15 months.

133. The report comments on the  phenomenon  of  prisoner  exchanges,  which
    have been said by the HRMMU to accompany many  of  the  allegations  of
    arbitrary detention and torture.  The practice  of  prisoner  exchanges
    was sanctioned by the  Minsk  II  peace  agreement,  primarily  on  the
    assumption that combatants would be exchanged.  However,  the  practice
    has catalysed further detentions.  The parties  to  the  conflict,  and
    their  proxy  actors,  are  incentivised  into   capturing   additional
    detainees, in order to provide bargaining capital for the  exchange  of
    prisoners held  by  the  other  side  at  a  later  date.    Many  such
    detentions by are recorded the HRMMU as having taken place without  any
    form of due process, with no official record or legal  oversight.   For
    the detaining authority or military force, the prospect of releasing an
    individual within the confines of the murky world of prisoner exchanges
    presents an attractive prospect when compared with the paper trail that
    would have to  be  established  in  the  event  that  the  individual's
    detention were maintained  through  official  channels.   The  practice
    fuels clandestine detention without authority and oversight.

134. Impunity is another theme that emerges from the  background  materials.
    In the Breaking Bodies report and the No Justice article, accounts  are
    given of how volunteer militia loyal to both sides were able to  commit
    such atrocities with impunity.  In many cases, militia responsible  for
    such  conduct  were  formally  incorporated  into  military   and   law
    enforcement structures.  Seeking redress was  said  to  be  risky;  few
    lawyers wanted to take on the cases, fearing retaliation themselves.

135. The OHCHR report covering May  to  August  2019  states  the  following
    concerning impunity, at [8] of the Executive Summary:

         "The Government failed  to  conduct  effective  investigations  and
         prosecutions  of  members  of  Ukrainian  forces  alleged  to  have
         perpetrated grave human rights violations, undermining the victims'
         right to effective remedy. Accountability for killings and  violent
         deaths during the Maidan protests and in Odesa on 2 May  2014  also
         remains outstanding, more than five years after the events."

136. The reports outlined above do not  document  isolated  incidents.   The
    theme of torture coupled with impunity is underlined by  OHCHR  reports
    from the outset of the conflict to the present day.

137. Against that background, the  November  2019  to  February  2020  OHCHR
    report states at [49] that, "[c]ases of  arbitrary  detention,  torture
    and  ill-treatment  continued  to  be  documented  by  OHCHR,  both  in
    Government-controlled territory and in territory controlled by the self-
    proclaimed 'republics'."  In relation to Ukrainian territory,  the  SBU
    appears to be the main culprit  of  arbitrary  detention,  torture  and
    mistreatment, often "taking over" detention following an initial period
    of detention (and mistreatment) at the hands of unidentified actors.

138. At [128], the November 2019 to February 2020 OHCHR report  records  its
    global conclusions on this topic.  Here one finds confirmation that the
    practice of arbitrary detention and  torture  is  a  systemic  problem,
    which, despite repeatedly being highlighted and condemned by the OHCHR,
    persisted: "OHCHR notes that a number of concerns highlighted  in  past
    reports have not been  addressed.  This  includes  the  impact  of  the
    conflict on economic  and  social  rights,  such  as  access  to  basic
    services, reports of arbitrary detention and torture..."   Annex  1  to
    the report specifically addresses the topic of arbitrary  detention  of
    conflict-related   detainees,   "as    exemplified    by    individuals
    simultaneously released under  the  Minsk  agreements  on  29  December
    2019", and thus provides a  recent  and  contemporary  picture  of  the
    continuing practice of arbitrary detention  and  punishment.   At  [4],
    responsibility was primarily attributed to the SBU.   Mis-treatment  in
    detention included sexual  violence,  threats  of  violence,  beatings,
    asphyxiation, electric shocks, positional torture,  food  deprivations,
    and mock executions.

Alleged breaches of international humanitarian  law  concerning  in-conflict
conduct

139. The appellants  contend  that  the  Ukrainian  military  regularly  and
    systemically breaches the principles  of  distinction,  proportionality
    and precaution, and in doing so, engages in acts contrary to the  basic
    rules of human conduct.  It does so, Mr Metzer submits, through placing
    civilians in the line of fire, and by positioning  military  objectives
    near to water facilities,  schools  and  residential  areas,  and  near
    objects otherwise protected by IHL, when engaging in conflict with  the
    Russia-backed separatist militia in the east of the country.   Civilian
    property is requisitioned and  used  for  military  objectives  without
    compensation or reparation.   Large  numbers  of  civilians  have  been
    killed. The appellants cite background  materials  which  they  contend
    demonstrate  that  the  Ukrainian  military  has  additionally:  looted
    property with impunity; denied  civilians  access  to  basic  services,
    including electricity and water; refused to give  account  for  missing
    persons in violation of customary international legal norms;  continues
    to engage in the use of landmines,  and  other  booby  traps;  violated
    ceasefires in civilian areas; and engaged in  the  forced  movement  of
    civilians, in prohibition of international law.

140. At [19] of his first report, Professor  Bowring  quotes  the  following
    extract from the Human Rights Watch World Report for 2020

         "2019 saw  a  significant  decrease  in  civilian  casualties.  The
         leading causes [of  the  remaining  casualties]  were  shelling  by
         artillery and mortars, fire  from  light  weapons,  landmines,  and
         explosive remnants of war.

         Between January and May 2019, attacks on schools on both  sides  of
         the contact line tripled compared with the  same  period  in  2018.
         Throughout six years of conflict, 147 children were killed."

    Although this extract does not engage with  the  source  materials,  or
    details concerning attacks on schools, we accept  that  this  respected
    human rights organisation's summary of attacks "on"  schools,  and  the
    overall number of children killed, gives rise to cause for concern.

141. In its Ukraine 2017 Human Rights Report, the USDS commented at page  15
    that:

         "In its September  report,  the  HRMMU  noted,  'the  placement  of
         military objectives in densely  populated  areas  through  military
         occupation and use of civilian property continued to  heighten  the
         risk of [sic] civilian lives on both sides of the  contact  line.'"
         (emphasis added)

142. The appellants also rely  on  the  Report  on  Preliminary  Examination
    Activities 2019 of the Office of the Prosecutor  at  the  International
    Criminal Court.  The Office of the Prosecutor summarised its own  views
    about the conflict in these terms:

         "279.    Based on  its  preliminary  assessment  of  subject-matter
         jurisdiction,  the  Office  has  concluded  that  the   information
         available provides a reasonable  basis  to  believe  that,  in  the
         period from 30 April 2014  onwards,  at  least  the  following  war
         crimes were committed in the  context  of  the  armed  conflict  in
         eastern Ukraine: intentionally directing attacks against  civilians
         and  civilian  objects,  pursuant  to  article  8(2)(b)(i)-(ii)  or
         8(2)(e)(i);  intentionally  directing  attacks  against   protected
         buildings, pursuant to  article  8(2)(b)(ix)  or  8(2)(iv);  wilful
         killing/murder,  pursuant  to   article   8(2)(a)(i)   or   article
         8(2)(c)(i);  torture  and  inhuman/cruel  treatment,  pursuant   to
         article 8(2)(a)(ii) or article 8(2)(c)(i)); outrages upon  personal
         dignity, pursuant to article 8(2)(b)(xxi) or  article  8(2)(c)(ii);
         rape and other  forms  of  sexual  violence,  pursuant  to  article
         8(2)(b)(xxii) or article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute.

         280.      In  addition,  if  the  conflict  was  international   in
         character,  there  is  a  reasonable  basis  to  believe  that  the
         following  war  crimes  were  committed:  intentionally   launching
         attacks that resulted in harm to  civilians  and  civilian  objects
         that was clearly excessive in relation to  the  military  advantage
         anticipated  (disproportionate  attacks),   pursuant   to   article
         8(2)(b)(iv);  and  unlawful  confinement,   pursuant   to   article
         8(2)(a)(vii) of the Statute."

143. At [288] of the report,  the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  states  that
    during 2020 it will finalise its assessment  of  the  admissibility  of
    potential cases that would likely be the focus of any investigation, in
    order to assist a determination under Article 15(3) of the Rome Statute
    of the International Criminal Court.

144. Article 15(3) of the Rome Statute  provides  that,  if  the  Prosecutor
    concludes  that  there  is  a  reasonable  basis  to  proceed  with  an
    investigation, he or she must submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request
    for authorisation  of  an  investigation.   The  process  requires  any
    supporting  material  gathered  by  the  prosecutor  during  the   pre-
    investigation phase to be provided to the Pre-Trial Chamber, and  there
    is a process to accommodate any representations made  by  victims.   If
    the Pre-Trial Chamber considers that there is  a  reasonable  basis  to
    proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within
    the jurisdiction of the Court, it, according to  Article  15(4),  shall
    authorise the commencement of the investigation.

Placing civilians in the line of  fire,  disregard  for  the  principles  of
distinction, precaution and proportionality

145. In its February to May 2019 report, the OHCHR report recorded  at  [23]
    that civilian property and critical civilian  infrastructure  continued
    to be "damaged, often in disregard for the principles  of  distinction,
    proportionality and precaution."  At [24], the  report  said  that  the
    "placement" of military positions in and near  residential  areas  puts
    civilians and civilian objects at "increased risk"  of  being  affected
    and "may" amount to a violation of IHL.  The November 2018 to  February
    2019 report recorded at [18] that exchanges of fire across the  contact
    line continued to impact residential areas, with  continued  damage  of
    the sort outlined above, attributable  to  the  placement  of  military
    positions  in  immediate  proximity  to  residential  areas,  and   the
    decreasing distances between the  positions  of  Ukrainian  forces  and
    armed groups.

146. At [21] of the November 2018 to February 2019 OHCHR report, an  account
    is set out of three workers of the Voda Donbasa water  pumping  station
    receiving injuries when their vehicle was hit by a shell, en  route  to
    or having arrived at (it is not  clear)  the  Vasylivka  water  pumping
    station in January 2019.  The pumping station was located near a region
    controlled by armed groups.

147. At [36] of the August to  November  2018  OHCHR  report,  concerns  are
    recorded that civilians continued to be subject to "heightened risk" as
    government forces and armed  groups  continued  to  advance  along  the
    contact line.  That lead to a division of villages,  and  the  use  and
    damage of civilian property and displacement.  On the  same  page,  the
    report gives an example of forces from both sides  advancing  into  the
    Zolate-4 area, dividing it.  Armed groups from  the  "Luhansk  people's
    republic" (i.e. armed militia opposing the government) forcibly evicted
    13 families from their homes, without  adopting  measures  to  minimise
    their displacement and its adverse effects.

148. At [18] to [28] of the February  to  May  2018  OHCHR  report,  further
    accounts of incidents involving civilians are provided.  At  [19],  the
    report states:

         "While most civilian casualties from  shelling  -  and  shooting  -
         appeared  to  occur   indirectly  in   incidents   that   did   not
         specifically target civilians, the conflict's civilian toll remains
         a serious concern."

    Continued  damage  to  civilian  homes,  civilian  infrastructure   and
    educational facilities is noted at [20].

149. In its February to May 2018 report, the OHCHR records at [22] its  deep
    concerns at  four  instances  where  small  arms  fire  emanating  from
    government controlled territory appeared to target civilian workers  in
    clearly-marked Voda Donbasa water pumping station vehicles, leading  to
    a suspension of water pumping for five days while  security  guarantees
    were sought for civilian staff.  The OHCHR categorises this  attack  as
    intentional.  The pumping station serves both sides  of  the  conflict.
    The report said that,  "OHCHR  emphasizes  that  both  the  intentional
    targeting  of  civilians  and  indiscriminate   attacks   are   serious
    violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes."

150. The May to August 2018 OHCHR  report  records,  at  [22]  to  [24]  the
    civilian casualty toll during that reporting period, noting  that  50.5
    per cent of those casualties, all of which were caused by  shelling  or
    light weapons fire, were attributable to the government.  All incidents
    occurred in residential neighbourhoods, including the victims'  houses,
    or other areas regularly frequented by  civilians.   Two  examples  are
    given at [23].    A teenage girl was struck by shrapnel  and  instantly
    killed outside a residential home in  government-controlled  territory.
    Secondly, a  shell  landed  next  to  a  civilian  bus  as  it  entered
    Holubivske village, which is located in the rebel-held Luhansk  region.
    Seven people were injured.

151. At [21] of the summary of the  August  to  November  2017  report,  the
    OHCHR records the documentation by the Special  Monitoring  Mission  of
    the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  of  the
    "repeated use" of weapons with a wide impact area,  such  as  artillery
    and mortars, or those with the capacity to deliver  multiple  munitions
    over a wide area, such as multiple rocket launch systems.  We have  not
    been provided with the OSCE source report.  Footnote 11 on  page  4  of
    the report records multiple rocket launch systems  being  moved  within
    government-controlled territory on 15 September 2017.  The OHCHR opines
    that the use of such weapons in densely populated civilian areas:

         "can be considered incompatible with the principle  of  distinction
         and may amount to a violation of [IHL] due  to  the  likelihood  of
         indiscriminate  effects.   During  the  reporting   period,   HRMMU
         documented civilian casualties  and  damage  to  civilian  property
         caused by heavy weapons."

152. At [22], the report states:

         "The risk to civilian lives has  been  further  heightened  by  the
         contamination of highly-frequented areas with mines  and  IEDs,  as
         well as the presence  of  ERW  [explosive  remnants  of  war].  The
         parties to the conflict continued the practice of placement of IEDs
         and anti-personnel mines in populated areas  and  near  objects  of
         civilian infrastructure. OHCHR notes that placement of such victim-
         activated  explosive  devices,  which,  by  their  nature,   cannot
         differentiate  between  civilians  and   combatants,   in   densely
         populated areas and areas  frequently  attended  by  civilians  may
         amount to an indiscriminate attack in violation of the principle of
         distinction enshrined in international humanitarian  law.  Further,
         OHCHR  recalls  that  parties  to  a   conflict   must   take   all
         precautionary measures to avoid  or  minimize  incidental  loss  of
         civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects."

153. At [28] of that report, the OHCHR records the use of a  "self-modified"
    commercial drone  deployed  over  a  rebel-controlled  village  in  the
    Donetsk region.  Two civilians were injured.  The  report  urged  drone
    operators  to   abide   strictly   by   the   rules   of   distinction,
    proportionality and precaution.

Landmines and similar munitions

154. Landmines have clearly been used in the conflict.   The  November  2019
    to February 2020 OHCHR Report records  at  [24]  that  there  were  ten
    civilian casualties from mines and explosive remnants of war during the
    reporting period, including one death and four injuries in  government-
    controlled territory.

155. The August to November 2019 OHCHR report records at  [26]  four  deaths
    in government-controlled territory  during  the  reporting  period.   A
    total of 20 casualties on both sides were recorded during that  period.
    Not all deaths and casualties reported resulted from mines; some deaths
    were recorded through the inadvertent triggering of, for example,  hand
    grenades, or other unidentified explosives: see  [27].   At  [30],  the
    OHCHR said that it recorded 58 civilian casualties from 1 January to 15
    November 2019, with 17 killed and 41 injured.  It  observed  that  that
    was a 51.3 per cent decrease compared with the same period in 2018,  in
    which  34  were  killed  and  85  injured,  and  noted  that  "mine/ERW
    [explosive remnant of war] clearance and education in the conflict zone
    is still necessary."

156. The May to August 2019 report  records  at  [24]  that  there  were  12
    civilian casualties during the reporting period; three  civilians  were
    killed, and the remainder were injured.  One of the deaths and four  of
    the injuries  were  recorded  as  having  taken  place  in  government-
    controlled territories.  We observe that these figures must  have  been
    included in the 1 January to 15 November 2019 figures reviewed  by  the
    OHCHR at [30] of the  August  to  November  2019  report:  58  civilian
    casualties; 17 killed, 41 injured from mine-related incidents  and  ERW
    handling.

157. At [26] of its  November  2018  to  February  2019  report,  the  OHCHR
    recorded 119 civilian casualties (34 killed and 85  injured)  resulting
    from mine-related incidents and the handling of explosive  remnants  of
    war.  The report observed that that was a 50 per cent decrease compared
    with 2017 when 238 civilian casualties (64 killed and 174 injured) were
    recorded as being attributable to mine-related incidents and ERW.

158. At [25] of its August 2018 to November 2018 report, the  OHCHR  records
    that mine-related incidents accounted  for  34  per  cent  of  civilian
    casualties during the reporting period;  17  killed,  and  11  injured.
    Most of those incidents occurred in the proximity of the contact  line.
    Some casualties were of those attempting to repair a broken electricity
    line in "no man's land" or maintain water facilities connecting  rebel-
    held Horlivka with government-controlled Toretsk, both of which are  in
    the Donetsk region.

159. At  [26]  of  the  above  report,  the  OHCHR  records  as  a  positive
    development the fact that Ukraine submitted a request for an  extension
    under Article 5(3) of the  Ottawa  Convention.   Article  5(1)  of  the
    Convention concerns the undertakings by State parties to the Convention
    to destroy or ensure the destruction of  all  anti-personnel  mines  in
    mined areas under their jurisdiction, within ten years after the  entry
    into force of the  Convention  for  that  State  party.   Article  5(3)
    permits State parties to request an extension of the time within  which
    to comply with their Article 5(1) undertakings, if the state  "believes
    that it will be unable to destroy or ensure the destruction of all anti-
    personnel mines referred to in  paragraph 1 within that time period..."
    The extension may be for a further period of ten years.  This  is  what
    the OHCHR said in relation to that extension request:

         "On 1 November, Ukraine submitted a  request  for  extension  under
         Article 5.3 of the  Convention  on  the  Prohibition  of  the  Use,
         Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
         Their Destruction. OHCHR welcomes this step as  helping  to  comply
         with Ukraine's obligations under the Convention.  Another  positive
         development was the adoption in the first reading of the draft law,
         which would create the legal framework  for  enhanced  mine  action
         activities in Ukraine."

160. In the May to August 2018 report, at  [25],  the  OHCHR  recorded  that
    mine-related incidents accounted for 13.3 per cent  of  all  casualties
    recorded during the reporting period (3 killed, 11 injured).   Handling
    of ERW accounted for 26.7 per cent of civilian casualties (1 killed; 27
    injured).

161. In its February to May 2018 report at [25],  the  OHCHR  recorded  that
    mines and ERW account for 13 deaths and  19  injured  civilians,  which
    comprised 39.5 per cent of all civilian casualties during the reporting
    period.  Ten casualties resulted from mines specifically, which  was  a
    significant increase on the previous  reporting  period,  during  which
    only 2 casualties were recorded.  However, overall, there  was  a  79.2
    per cent decrease when compared with the same period in 2017.  At [26],
    the OHCHR said that it remained concerned about  the  risk  of  further
    civilian  casualties  in  the  future  due  to  remaining  mines,   ERW
    (particularly unexploded ordinance), and victim-activated booby traps.

162. At [17] of its November 2017 to February 2018 report, the  OHCHR  noted
    that, of the 73 conflict-related civilian casualties during the period,
    there had been an overall 16 per cent decrease when compared  with  the
    previous reporting period, when 87 casualties were recorded.  It  noted
    that the decrease  was  due  to  fewer  civilian  deaths  and  injuries
    resulting from mine-related incidents and incautious handling  of  ERW.
    However, at [21], the report noted  that  there  were  more  fatalities
    caused by "leftover devices" than shelling during the reporting period.
     The detonation of booby traps had injured three male civilians  during
    the reporting period.  While there were signs warning of  the  presence
    of such mines, the OHCHR considered that they did  not  always  clearly
    indicate where the mines were and were not considered reliable  by  the
    local population: [22].

163. In the same report, the OHCHR  recorded  concerns  about  the  risk  to
    civilian lives arising from  the  contamination  of  highly  frequented
    areas with mines and IEDs, as well as the presence of ERW.  During  the
    reporting period, the  parties  to  the  conflict  continued  in  their
    placement of IEDs and anti-personnel mines in populated areas and  near
    objects of civilian infrastructure.  The OHCHR expressed  concern  that
    such  devices  are  unable  to  differentiate  between  civilians   and
    combatants, and may, therefore, violate the principles  of  distinction
    and precaution: see [22].

164. At [95] of the August  to  November  2017  report,  the  OHCHR  records
    security incidents at or in the vicinity of the crossing points used by
    civilians  to  transit  between  government-controlled  and  rebel-held
    areas.  Many mines had been laid near the crossing points, which  posed
    a "serious threat" to many civilians who used the crossing points on  a
    regular basis.  Some of the crossing points themselves  are  dangerous,
    such as the dilapidated wooden bridge which  forms  the  sole  crossing
    point into part of the Luhansk region.  While many elderly or  disabled
    people reluctantly  choose  not  to  cross  into  government-controlled
    territory (often forgoing  their  pensions  or  disability  allowances,
    which  must  be  claimed  in  person   in   the   government-controlled
    territory), others attempt to cross at other points.  Other  areas  are
    likely to be mined, as demonstrated by the instant death of a  man  who
    attempted such a crossing in November 2017 when he activated a mine.

Positioning military objectives  near  to  water  facilities,  schools,  and
residential areas

165. In its August to November 2019 report, the OHCHR records  its  concerns
    that ongoing hostilities "continue to affect educational establishments
    located in close proximity to military  positions  and/or  the  contact
    line"  (see  [25]).   At  least  four  functioning  schools   and   two
    functioning kindergartens were damaged by small arms and light  weapons
    fire.  All incidents  occurred  when  no  children  or  personnel  were
    present, and the damage was moderate, mostly damaged windows.

166. The preceding May to August 2019 report noted  at  [19]  that  civilian
    objects,  including  educational  facilities  and   private   property,
    "continued to be damaged".  The report noted that a recommitment to the
    "unlimited" ceasefire from 21  July  2019,  agreed  by  the  Trilateral
    Contact Group in Minsk, resulted in a decrease  of  hostilities  and  a
    substantial reduction in civilian casualties.  The  same  report  gives
    more (and consistent) detail at [28].

167. In its February  to  May  2019  report  at  [23],  the  OHCHR  recorded
    observations of trenches being dug approximately  15  meters  from  the
    nearest inhabited house.  This "may" amount  to  a  violation  of  IHL,
    noted the report.  Concerns are recorded  that  civilian  property  and
    critical infrastructure continues to be damaged,  "often  in  disregard
    for the principles of  distinction,  proportionality  and  precaution".
    This, understandably, is  relied  upon  by  the  appellants.   But  the
    authors of the report do not address the basis upon which it  concludes
    that those military  operations  were  conducted  in  defiance  of  the
    applicable principles of IHL; as authoritative as  the  OHCHR  is,  the
    mere assertion at  the  heart  of  this  paragraph  is  unsupported  by
    analysis  of  the  sort  necessary  to  merit  the  conclusion   drawn.
    Paragraph [24] offers a more nuanced approach, noting that the military
    activity described "may amount to a violation of [IHL]".

168. In its November 2018  to  February  2019  report  at  [18],  the  OHCHR
    records that exchanges of fire across the  contact  line  continued  to
    impact residential areas and resulted in civilian  casualties,  causing
    damage to civilian property and infrastructure.  That, said the report,
    subjected civilian residents to heightened  risk  and  disrupted  their
    ways and means of coping with the effects of conflict on  their  lives.
    During the reporting period, approximately  36  per  cent  of  civilian
    casualties were attributable to Ukrainian forces,  having  occurred  on
    rebel-held territory.  At [24], the report gives further detail on  the
    deaths and injuries that took place; a mother and daughter killed by  a
    mortar shell in rebel-controlled Zolote-5;  a  male  inmate  killed  by
    shelling while held in  an  rebel-controlled  detention  facility,  the
    first such death since August 2016.

169. At [18] of the same report,  the  OHCHR  records  the  consequences  of
    exchanges of fire between both sides to the conflict, and the impact of
    the decreasing distance between the two advancing sides.

170. In the executive summary of its August to  November  2018  report,  the
    OHCHR records at [6] that  civilian  casualties  continued  to  decline
    during the reporting period, "in keeping with the established trend  in
    2018..."  Nevertheless, noted the report at [7], "clashes and localised
    exchanges of fire contributed to enduring insecurity."  The practice of
    both parties to the conflict of positioning  themselves  and  advancing
    within populated areas continued, the report noted.

171. At [30] of its May to August 2018 report, the  OHCHR  records  that  it
    documented seven incidents of shelling of schools resulting  in  damage
    to the facilities between mid-May and the end of June that  year.   The
    examples given in the report include an attack on an occupied school in
    government-controlled  territory,  and  a  boarding  school  in   rebel
    territory that was damaged by shelling in late June 2018.  As a result,
    the school management and parents cancelled the  summer  programme  and
    closed the school.

172. At [20] of its November 2017 to February 2018 report, the  OHCHR  again
    underlined its concerns that the parties to  the  conflict  were  using
    indirect weapons, or those with wide area affects,  such  as  "multiple
    launch  rocket  systems"  (MLRS),  in  areas  populated  and  used   by
    civilians.  This raised the prospect of breaches  of  IHL,  the  report
    noted, recalling events in December 2017  in  which  shelling  hit  the
    central area of Novoluhanske, a town in government-controlled territory
    of nearly 3,500 residents.  Two shells landed close to a school and the
    third in a school yard, while 20 children were present.  Another hit an
    empty kindergarten.  Both  educational  facilities  were  situated  120
    meters from a dormitory used by the Ukrainian armed forces.

173. Also in December 2017, records  the  November  2017  to  February  2018
    report, the Donetsk Filtration Station came  under  shelling  on  eight
    occasions.  There were delays in negotiating "windows of  silence"  for
    repairs and maintenance.  One shelling episode lasted  24  hours,  with
    heavy machine gun fire.  At  the  same  time,  the  Russian  Federation
    withdrew its representatives from the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and
    Coordination, which was a vehicle for the negotiation  of  "windows  of
    silence".  See [24] and [108] of the November  2017  to  February  2018
    report.   These paragraphs of this report are also relied upon  by  the
    appellants as evidence of denial of access to basic facilities such  as
    water and electricity.

174. Paragraph 24 of the November 2017 to February 2018 report  records  ten
    incidents  affecting  water  facilities  in  conflict-affected   areas.
    Several pumping stations, including  those  serving  the  South  Donbas
    water   pipelines,   the   Donetsk   Filtration   Station,   and    the
    Verkhnokalmiuska Filtration Station, appeared to  have  been  targeted.
    As well as each of the latter two pumping stations serving hundreds  of
    thousands of civilians, the pumping stations stored hundreds of tons of
    chlorine gas.  Had chlorine been present, "it could have had 'devasting
    consequences'  for  the  population  in  Donetsk  city,  Makiivka   and
    Avdiivka", said the OHCHR, in  reliance  upon  an  assessment  from  UN
    experts (see footnote 26 at page 6 of the report).

175. As well as the concerns over possible breaches  of  the  principles  of
    distinction, precaution and proportionality  summarised  at  [150]  and
    following, above, the August to November 2017 OHCHR report records,  at
    [23], that the parties maintained their heavy  military  presences,  on
    both sides of the contact line, in densely  populated  civilian  areas.
    The report added that,

         "Locating  military  positions  and  equipment   within   or   near
         residential areas and objects indispensable for the survival of the
         civilian population falls short of taking  all  feasible  steps  to
         separate  military  objectives  from   the   civilian   population,
         contravention to international humanitarian law.  OHCHR notes  that
         where such presence is justified due  to  military  necessity,  the
         parties must protect the resident civilian population, including by
         providing alternative accommodation.

Denial of access to basic facilities

176. The appellants highlight the OHCHR's reports of  basic  services  being
    withheld from civilians, or otherwise interrupted.

177. The OHCHR report for August to  November  2019  records  at  [41]  that
    approximately 18 residents in the  village  of  Novooleksandrivka  have
    lost access to basic services.  Electricity to the village has been cut
    off since the beginning  of  the  conflict  and  the  roads  have  been
    blocked.   Ambulances  cannot  reach  the  village  and  there  are  no
    hospitals, pharmacies, or public transport in the village.

178. The  November  2018  to  February  2019  OHCHR  report  summarises  the
    widespread humanitarian impact of the conflict:  see  [7].   Over  five
    million people have been  affected  in  total,  including  1.3  million
    registered internally displaced persons  (IDPs).    The  hardship  they
    endure, considers the report, is exacerbated by the lack of  access  to
    basic services, social support, as well as remedies and reparations for
    injured persons  and  relatives  of  those  killed  and  for  destroyed
    property.  During the harsh  Ukrainian  winters,  a  lack  of  adequate
    heating is one of the main challenges for civilians,  especially  those
    living along the contact line.  Further detail is provided at [42].

179. The government has failed to implement court  decisions  in  favour  of
    individuals who have lost access to their  pensions  and  continues  to
    link access to pensions to IDP registration.  Those  living  in  rebel-
    held areas have to attend government premises in  government-controlled
    territory in order to do so, necessitating long queues  at  checkpoints
    when leaving and re-entering the self-declared republics.  See [7]  and
    [35] and following of the November 2018 to February 2019 report.

180. Paragraph [40] of the August to November 2018 OHCHR report records  the
    difficulties civilians experience when exercising freedom  of  movement
    within Ukraine.  During the reporting period, there  had  been  over  a
    million crossings of  the  contact  line  through  the  five  available
    routes, one of which was the "dilapidated wooden footbridge that is the
    only crossing route in Luhansk region" referred to  above.   The  OHCHR
    noted that both sides  had  undertaken  actions  to  expand  access  to
    shelter, sanitation and heating at the entry-exit checkpoints along the
    crossing routes, however, as  at  15  November  2018,  the  Cabinet  of
    Ministers was yet to adopt a draft resolution concerning  the  movement
    of persons and the transfer of goods  across  the  contact  line.   The
    Ukrainian "Joint Forces Operation" had also  taken  steps  to  minimise
    cross-border training, which "may have a negative impact on  access  to
    markets and food..."  The OHCHR considered at [41] that those  measures
    that both sides had taken were, "fundamentally insufficient to  address
    the disproportionate restrictions on freedom of movement and the  needs
    of individuals to access their  social  entitlements,  pensions,  visit
    relatives, and look after their property, further  isolating  residents
    of armed group-controlled territory and risking to antagonise them..."

181. The August to November 2017 OHCHR report, as well  as  documenting  the
    impact of shelling on key civilian infrastructure (see  [173],  above),
    gives further details concerning the impact upon living  conditions  of
    people living in conflict-affected areas.  See [111] to  [113]  of  the
    report.  Electricity and gas supplies have been  severely  affected  by
    the conflict.  Many homes relied on gas for their heating  needs,  with
    electric heaters as a backup.  In the absence of both forms of  energy,
    civilians were forced to rely on  limited  humanitarian  assistance  in
    order to secure other forms of  heating.   In  addition  to  the  well-
    documented  conflict-related   difficulties   with   water   filtration
    stations, [113] of  the  report  notes  that  much  of  the  key  water
    infrastructure is located  in  "no  man's  land",  where  the  security
    situation poses serious obstacles for the  performance  of  maintenance
    and repairs.

Information to account for missing persons

182. The August to November 2019 OHCHR report records,  at  [55],  that  the
    Commission on Persons Missing due to Special Circumstances, established
    in April 2019, was yet to launch its work.  There had been, however,  a
    "step forward" in ensuring the implementation of  the  law  on  missing
    persons, in the form of an approval by the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  in
    August 2019, of a regulation on  the  management  of  the  register  of
    missing  persons,  although  the  regulation  itself  was  yet  to   be
    implemented by the Ministry of Justice.

183. The context for the above developments was  set  out  at  [31]  of  the
    August to November 2017 report, which recorded that the draft  law  "On
    the legal status of missing persons", which foresaw  the  establishment
    of  the  Commission  on  Persons  Missing,  was  still  pending  before
    Parliament.  The report recorded at [32] and [33] that  there  remained
    large numbers of missing persons.  While many were presumed  dead,  the
    OHCHR noted  that  it  "cannot  exclude  [the  possibility]  that  some
    individuals reported missing may currently be held incommunicado either
    by the Government or by armed groups..." The report added  that  access
    by independent monitors to  detention  facilities,  particularly  those
    controlled by armed groups, was crucial.

Use of civilian property

184. At [42] of its  November  2019  to  February  2020  report,  the  OHCHR
    records that there was extended military  use  of  civilian  properties
    without lease agreements and/or compensation.  Such use  has  generated
    utility bills which had been received by  the  properties'  owners.   A
    similar account is provided at [34] of the preceding OHCHR report,  for
    August to November 2019.  However, in that report it is  recorded  that
    the Ukrainian government  had  provided  compensation  and/or  adequate
    housing on a temporary basis through local  authorities  to  a  limited
    number of affected families.  It had not been  done  in  a  regular  or
    consistent manner.  The Cabinet of Ministers made a  commitment,  which
    was welcomed by the OHCHR, to amend a 2013 resolution  to  improve  the
    access of affected  members  of  the  population  to  compensation.   A
    comprehensive, and non-discriminatory State policy of  restitution  and
    compensation for damaged and destroyed housing and property was  "still
    lacking", noted the report.

185. The May to August 2019 OHCHR report records  at  [19]  that,  "civilian
    objects, including educational facilities and private property continue
    to be damaged..."

Ceasefires in civilian areas

186. In the November 2019 to February 2020 report, the OHCHR  noted  that  a
    ceasefire agreed between the parties on 21 July 2019,  for  which  they
    reiterated their concern on 29 December 2019, was not  the  subject  of
    full  compliance:  see  [20].   However,  the  OHCHR  noted  that  "the
    reporting period was marked by an overall decrease  in  the  number  of
    ceasefire violations if compared with the previous  reporting  period."
    On 20 November 2019, Ukraine joined  the  "Safe  Schools  Declaration",
    which notes the OHCHR at footnote 12:

         "By  [participating  in  the  Safe  Schools  Declaration],  Ukraine
         engages  itself  to,  inter  alia,  collect  data  on  attacks   on
         educational facilities and related victims and on military  use  of
         schools and universities, to provide assistance to victims in a non-
         discriminatory manner,  to  seek  to  ensure  the  continuation  of
         education during armed conflict, to support the re-establishment of
         educational facilities and to facilitate international  cooperation
         and assistance to programmes  working  to  prevent  or  respond  to
         attacks on education."

187. At [18] of its November 2018 to February 2019 report, the  OHCHR  notes
    that  the  OSCE  Special  Monitoring  Mission  to  Ukraine  recorded  a
    decreasing number of ceasefire violations during the reporting  period.
    There remained exchanges of fire across the contact line, which  caused
    civilian casualties and damaged civilian  property  and  infrastructure
    referred to above: see [168], above.

188. At [15] of the February to May 2018 report, the OHCHR records  concerns
    that the parties persisted in their violation of the Minsk  agreements,
    including through the use of indirect and/or explosive weapons.   There
    had been a 9 per cent increase in casualties  when  compared  with  the
    previous reporting period, but a 59.7 per cent decrease  when  compared
    with the same period in 2017.

189. In its August to November 2017 report at [6], the  OHCHR  "repeats  its
    call for all parties to the  conflict  to  immediately  adhere  to  the
    ceasefire and to implement all other obligations committed  to  in  the
    Minsk  agreements,  including  the  withdrawal  of  heavy  weapons  and
    disengagement of forces and  hardware..."   The  report  recalled  that
    during the previous reporting period (the details of which we have  not
    been taken to and did not feature in the background materials  provided
    to us), a renewed ceasefire commitment, termed the "harvest ceasefire",
    resulted in a decrease in ceasefire violations and a  notable  decrease
    in civilian casualties.

Forced movement of civilians

190. The appellants have drawn our attention to [51] to [53] of  the  August
    to November 2019 OHCHR report (page 235  of  the  background  materials
    bundle) as authority for the proposition that  the  Ukrainian  military
    engages in the forced movement of civilians.   The  examples  given  in
    that extract of the report relate to the unlawful abduction,  detention
    and  movement  of  civilians  by  the  Russia-backed  federal  militia,
    sometimes on the basis that the  individual  concerned  had  cooperated
    with the SBU, the Ukrainian Security Service:  see  [52].   We  see  no
    basis for concluding, on the basis of these materials,  that  there  is
    any risk of forced movement in contravention of IHL on the part of  the
    Ukrainian  military  or  government.   As  such,  this  aspect  of  the
    background materials to which the appellants have invited  us  to  have
    regard need not play any further role in our analysis.

PART D: COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN UKRAINE

Compulsory military service in Ukraine

191. The following summary is taken primarily from the reports of  Professor
    Bowring and the description of compulsory military service in VB.

192. There are two categories  of  persons  in  Ukraine  liable  to  perform
    compulsory military service, and a distinction must  be  drawn  between
    them.  There are those who are conscripted into  the  military,  mainly
    based  on  their  age,  which  is  currently  20  to  27   years   old.
    Alternatively, there are military  reservists  who  may  be  mobilised.
    Reservists are, according to the oral evidence  of  Professor  Bowring,
    those who have served as officers  previously  and  remain  on  reserve
    lists, and thus are liable to be  recalled  into  the  military.   Both
    conscripts and reservists enjoy the ability  to  defer  their  military
    service, but on different grounds.

193. Conscription in Ukraine features in Article 65 of the Constitution.   A
    1999 law provides for the length of military service to be  18  months;
    unless service is in the navy, in which case  it  is  24  months.   The
    length of service is reduced to 12 months for those who have  completed
    higher education.   Conscription  takes  place  in  distinct  waves  or
    phases. In response to the conflict in the east  of  the  country,  the
    Ukrainian military reinstated a general draft,  which  applied  to  men
    aged between 20 and 27.

194. According to the May 2017 report of the  Austrian  Federal  Office  for
    Immigration and Asylum, Fact Finding Mission Report - Ukraine,  Article
    35  of  the  1996  Constitution  of   Ukraine   makes   provision   for
    conscientious  objectors  to  military  service  to   be   offered   an
    alternative, non-military duty:

         "If performance of military service is contrary  to  the  religious
         beliefs of a  citizen,  the  performance  of  this  duty  shall  be
         replaced by alternative (non-military) duty."

195. There has been a pattern of each wave failing  to  secure  the  desired
    response, by a significant margin.  At  [69]  of  VB,  the  failure  to
    answer call-up papers was described as "historically a major  problem".
    For example, in September 2014,  the  authorities  stated  that  during
    partial mobilisations in 13 regions, over 85,000 of those summonsed did
    not report: see [30] of the first Bowring report.

Relevant Sections of the Penal Code and Administrative Code

196. The criminal code provides that conscripts who avoid the draft  may  be
    punished by up to three years'  imprisonment  (Article  335),  and  the
    avoidance of mobilisation is punishable  for  a  term  of  imprisonment
    between two and five years long (Article 336).

197. The Code of Administrative Offences of Ukraine at Article 210  provides
    for administrative fines to be levied for the discreet act  of  failing
    to attend the reporting office.

198. We have taken the following extract of the legal  framework  from  [30]
    and following of VB; the parties did not submit that  the  criminal  or
    administrative  legal  framework  for  draft  evasion  has  since  been
    amended.

       The Code of Administrative Offences of Ukraine
        Article 210. The violations of the law by military service staff  or
       subjects on general Military Duty and Military Service.
        - For failing to appear in the military recruitment  office  without
       good reason or late submission of information on change of residence,
       education, employment, position, and also violations of the order  of
       educational meetings (sessions) are punishable by a  fine  of  85-119
       UAH.

    Article  210  of  the  Administrative  Code   concerns   the   discrete
    administrative offence of a person subject to mobilisation requirements
    failing to attend the recruitment office.

199. In May 2014, the Administrative Code was supplemented by an  aggravated
    administrative   offence   of    violating    legislation    concerning
    mobilisation, with much higher fines.


       "Article 210-1. Violation  of  legislation  on  defence  mobilization
       preparation and mobilization:
       - Violation of legislation on defence  mobilization  preparation  and
       mobilization entails a fine of up 170-510 UAH, and  for  officials  -
       510-1700 UAH. If the violation is repeated within  a  year  then  the
       penalty increases to 510-1700 UAH for citizens and for  officials  to
       1700-5100 UAH."

200.  At  the  time  of  writing,  1  Ukrainian  Hryvnia  (UAH)   is   worth
    approximately �0.02689.  The maximum fine of 5100UAH is the  equivalent
    of around �137.14.

201. Article 14(10) of the Law of Ukraine "On  military  duty  and  military
    service" of 1992 ("the 1992 law") provides:

       "10. According to the results of medical examination of a citizen of
       Ukraine and taking into account the  level  of  his/her  educational
       training, personal qualities, type of activity  and  specialty,  the
       commission on registration may make one of the following decisions:

           . fit for military service and previously assigned to service  in
             the Armed Forces of Ukraine or other military unit;

           . temporarily unfit for military  service,  in  need  of  medical
             treatment;

           . to be referred for additional medical examination and  repeated
             medical examination (indicating the date of the examination);

           . unfit for military service in peacetime, restricted in wartime,
             subject to military registration;

           .  unfit  for  military  service  with  exclusion  from  military
             registration, subject to exclusion from military  registration;
             be subjected to the  military  registration  of  servicemen  as
             previously convicted to  imprisonment,  restraint  of  liberty,
             arrest, correctional labour for committing a crime of small  or
             medium gravity, including with release from serving a sentence;

           . shall be subject to exclusion  from  military  registration  as
             having been previously sentenced to imprisonment for a  serious
             or particularly serious crime."

202. Article 17 of the  Law  of  Ukraine  "On  military  duty  and  military
    service" of 1992 provides:

         "Article 17. Deferment of conscription for military service

         1.  Deferment of conscription for military service is  provided  to
         conscripts by decision of  the  district  (municipal)  conscription
         commission in accordance with this Law due to family circumstances,
         for health reasons,  in  order  to  enter  education  and  continue
         professional activity.

         2. Deferment of conscription for military  service  due  to  family
         circumstances is granted, at their request, to conscripts who have:

             1) a disabled father and mother or single disabled father  (or
             mother),   or   disabled   individuals    who    were    under
             guardianship   or   dependency   of    the    conscript,    or
             individuals  over  whom  the  conscript  is  responsible   for
             guardianship or care, and if they  do  not  have  other  able-
             bodied individuals  who  are  Ukrainian  citizens  obliged  in
             accordance with the legislation of Ukraine  to  support  them.
             Disability of these individuals is determined  in  the  manner
             prescribed by legislation;

             2) underage siblings, (full or half) brothers and sisters,  or
             disabled (full or half) brothers and  sisters,  regardless  of
             their age, if they do not have other  able-bodied  individuals
             besides  the  conscript  obliged  in   accordance   with   the
             legislation of Ukraine to support them;

             3) a single father or mother with two or more dependent  minor
             children, until the oldest child  comes  of  age,  subject  to
             official employment of the conscript;

             accordance with the Law Act No. 116-VIII of 15.01.2015]

             4) a child under the age of three or a child older than  three
             years who is  being  brought  up  without  his/her  mother  in

             [Clause  7  of  Part  2  of  Article  17   as   amended     by
             the  Law Act  No.2581-VIII  of 02.10.2018]

             8) a pregnant wife.

         3. Deferment of conscription for military  service  due  to  family
         circumstances may be granted, at their request, to a conscript  who
         is an orphan or a child deprived of parental care.

         [Clause 3 of Article 17 with amendments made in accordance with the
         Law Act No.116-VIII of 12.08.2014]"

     The italicised words  in  square  brackets  featured  in  the  original
    translation provided to us.

203. During Professor Bowring's re-examination, Mr Metzer sought to rely  on
    Articles 22 and 23 of the same law, which deal with the mobilisation of
    reserve officers.

204. Paragraph [5] of Prof Bowring's second report proffered  the  following
    partial translation of Article 23:

         "Article 23. Terms of military service

         1. The terms of conscription in the calendar calculation  shall  be
         established:

            . for soldiers and sailors, sergeants and sergeants  undergoing
              conscripts in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other  military
              formations, up to 18 months;

            . for persons who  hold  a  Master's  degree  at  the  time  of
              conscription, up to 12 months..."

205. It is unfortunate that the parties did  not  provide  us  with  a  full
    translation of all relevant provisions.   The  best  evidence  we  have
    concerning the entirety of those articles may be found in the  Austrian
    Fact Finding  Mission  Report,  referred  to  above,  which  summarises
    Article 22 and 23 at page 26 and following.

206. According to the Austrian report, there are four  different  levels  of
    mobilisation:

         "At  the  lowest  and  first  stage,  are  summoned  to  the  army:
         'volunteers; reserve officers and sergeants that served in the army
         or other force structures and who have  military  specialties  that
         are currently in demand; as well as reserve regular  soldiers  with
         wartime experience'. Are summoned during the second stage: 'reserve
         officers and sergeants of all military  specialties  are  summoned;
         the regular reserve  army  of  all  military  specializations  with
         military  experiences;  the  higher  officers   of   all   military
         specialties'; during third stage: '18-year-old soldiers, women  who
         may serve (field doctors, nurses, technical specialists);  as  well
         as those who have  not  served  but  have  no  'white  ticket'  are
         mobilized. The fourth and last stage, which can only be implemented
         if fierce war has been underway for a long time,  amounts  to  full
         mobilization, with all those capable of holding weapons joining the
         army"

207. Page 32 of the report summarises Article 22 in the following terms:

         "Part IV, Article 22, of the Law on  Mobilization  Preparation  and
         Mobilization provides that: 'Citizens who are in  the  reserve  are
         pre-registered  with  military  units  (appointed)  to  carry   out
         military service in wartime or are employed in the Armed Forces  or
         other military formations'. According to the White Book 2015 of the
         Ministry of Defense [sic] of Ukraine, reservists are posted to  the
         positions in those military units where they served.

         In June 2016 representatives of the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine
         asserted that the French military provided expertise for setting up
         the procedure for reserve service. They pointed out that 'it was  a
         pity to see a great number of men with  combat  experience  leaving
         the armed forces' and that 'people with good  experience  and  good
         reputation were enlisted in the reserve'; according  to  them,  the
         latter will be the first to be mobilized in case of hard times.

         According to the military advisor of the European Union  Delegation
         in Ukraine,  'mobilized  personnel  who  were  dismissed  from  the
         mobilization go back to the reserves'; those 'with  experience  and
         good conduct are enlisted in the first line of the reserves,  which
         means that, in case of need, they would be the  first  ones  to  be
         mobilized again". According to Part IV, Article 22, of the  Law  of
         Ukraine  on  Mobilization  Preparation  and  Mobilization,  'During
         mobilization and wartime, those who "have the  reserve  status  and
         were not called  for  military  duty,  can  be  recruited  for  the
         execution of defense [sic] work'."

208.  At page 27, the report states:

         "Article 23 of the Law also provides that the following  categories
         will not be subject to a call up during mobilization:  those  among
         the persons predisposed for military service who are 'reserved  for
         a period of mobilization and wartime for the Executive, Local Self-
         Government,  as   well   as   for   companies,   institutions   and
         organizations in accordance with the procedure established  by  the
         Cabinet'; 'Men with five or more children younger than 16 years old
         (these men can volunteer for call up and  shall  serve  near  their
         household)'; 'Women with children younger than 16 years old  (these
         women can  volunteer  for  call  up  and  shall  serve  near  their
         household)'; 'Citizens who take care of persons requiring  constant
         care according to the legislation of Ukraine - in case there is  no
         substitution for them'; 'Citizens who are Deputies of the Verkhovna
         Rada of Ukraine and the Verkhovna Rada of the  Autonomous  Republic
         of Crimea'; 'Other persons predisposed'"




    The next unnumbered paragraph continues:

         "On 24 July 2015, the relevant legislation was amended  to  include
         "full-time students and  students  pursuing  postgraduate  degrees,
         teaching  and  research  staff  at  universities   and   scientific
         institutions who have post-graduate degrees and teaching  staff  at
         other educational  institutions  such  as  high  school  teachers".
         Failing to appear without valid  reasons  is  considered  as  draft
         evasion and punishable as a crime, in application of Article 336 of
         the Criminal Code of Ukraine... Contrary to  regular  conscription,
         conscientious objection and alternative service is not foreseen  by
         the Ukrainian  legal  framework  for  individuals  drafted  through
         emergency mobilization."

Enforcement of draft evasion

209. In his first report, Professor Bowring provided the  following  summary
    of the enforcement of conscription and mobilisation:

        a. A 2015 Guardian article reported that Ukrainian men aged between
           25-60 were eligible for conscription.  75,000  had  been  called
           up, of which approximately 60  per  cent  would  enter  service.
           Preference  was  given  to  men  with  military  experience.   A
           government decree regulated foreign travel for those subject  to
           mobilisation, meaning people could be arrested  at  the  border,
           with those guilty of draft-dodging facing up to  five  years  in
           prison.  Another article published in 2015 quoted  a  practising
           lawyer as stating that, for convictions under Article 336 of the
           Criminal Code, the court might impose a sentence of  two  years'
           imprisonment with a year's probation,  and  in  the  absence  of
           aggravating circumstances, a suspended  sentence,  or  a  single
           year's probation and no further punishment. [31]

        b. An August 2016 Kyiv Post article reported that the  most  recent
           draft at the time, the sixth, had been controversial because  it
           was the first time people with no military experience  had  been
           eligible to serve.  Only 60 per  cent  of  those  targeted  were
           successfully conscripted.  Of those called up, 26,800 had failed
           to report for service.   Nearly  1,500  criminal  investigations
           were opened. [32]

        c. An April 2016 news report said that in 2015 military prosecutors
           had investigated 14,894 criminal cases relating to 18,731  draft
           dodgers, of which 2,500 had been  "sent  to  court".   Only  337
           people had been apprehended. [33]

        d. Reports in May 2016 suggested that 17,000  young  men  would  be
           called up.  Those called up would not be required in to serve in
           the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. [34]

        e. On 25 June  2016,  the  then  president,  President  Poroshenko,
           announced that to an increasing extent, contracted  professional
           soldiers would take the place of conscripts. [35]

        f. An August 2019 news report stated that, "only military  contract
           service personnel are at the front..." [43]

        g. In January 2020, it was reported  that  President  Zelensky  had
           signed a degree to reduce the call-up age to 18.  The 2020 draft
           campaign will last from April  to  June,  and  from  October  to
           December.  The age ceiling remains at 27 for conscription.  [36]

        h. A March 2020 article addressed the position of  reservists.   It
           suggested that those under the age of 43 who "did not serve  but
           have graduated from the military departments would be  subjected
           to conscription..."  The article added that "there is no  reason
           for panic either because the reserve officers are  not  involved
           in the Joint Force operation.  Unless, of course,  they  sign  a
           contract."  [41]

210. Addressing the  likely  military  service  of  the  appellants  in  the
    present matter, at [21] of his first report, Professor Bowring states:

         "Since June 2016, as I show below, Ukraine has  increasingly  moved
         away from sending conscripts to the war zone  (ATO  [Anti-Terrorist
         Operation Zone] as it is known  in  Ukraine)  and  instead  sending
         professional, contracted, soldiers."

    He continues, at [26]:

         "Armed conflict continues, but not on  the  scale  of  the  earlier
         years. Ukraine now has a much more professional and  capable  army,
         which is gradually making inroads into separatist held territory."

211. At [41] of his first report, Professor Bowring quoted an  article  from
    the 112.international website entitled Reserve officers would be called
    up for military service: what does that mean for Ukraine?  The  article
    addresses the ongoing  attempts  by  the  government  and  military  in
    Ukraine to improve the response to the draft. It outlines the  position
    of both conscripts and reserve officers stating, "In any case, there is
    no reason for panic... Because the reserve officers are not involved in
    the Joint Force operation."

212. At [44] of his  first  report,  Professor  Bowring  addresses  specific
    questions that he had been instructed to answer.

213. Question (a) was whether military service by the appellants in  Ukraine
    would or might involve being associated with acts which are contrary to
    the basic rules of human conduct?  The answer given was:

         "As I have shown above it is highly unlikely that the Appellants if
         they returned to Ukraine and answered the call-up or  were  obliged
         to do so, would be sent into the combat zone, the "line of contact"
         (OSCE), or Anti Terrorist Operation (ATO). In any event, the  armed
         conflict now has a rather different nature, not least because  only
         professional soldiers are now sent into action."

214. In his supplementary evidence in chief, Professor Bowring was asked  by
    Mr Metzer whether the appellants would be sent to the  ATO,  where  the
    conflict in the east of Ukraine is focussed, or an arsenal.   Professor
    Bowring  said  that  the  appellants,  as   conscripts   or   mobilised
    reservists, would not be sent either to  the  ATO,  or  to  an  arsenal
    within the ATO, but that they could be sent anywhere else in Ukraine.

215. Under cross-examination from Mr Malik, Professor Bowring said  that  it
    would be "extremely unlikely" that the appellants would be sent to  the
    combat zone.  When asked  specifically  whether  that  meant  that  the
    appellants would not be required to engage  in  acts  contrary  to  the
    basic rules of human conduct, Professor  Bowring  agreed,  adding  once
    again that the appellants would not be  in  active  combat.   Professor
    Bowring struggled (to adopt the terminology of Mr Metzer's intervention
    at the time) to answer a question from  Mr  Malik  as  to  whether  the
    appellants would be required  to  participate  in  activity  that  goes
    against the Charter of the UN and its purposes.  Professor Bowring said
    that he had been asked to speak to the basic rules  of  human  conduct,
    not the UN Charter.

216. Question (b) addressed by  Professor  Bowring  at  [44]  of  his  first
    report concerned whether the appellants, upon their return to  Ukraine,
    could be subjected to prosecution for draft evasion,  and  whether,  if
    so, either could receive any punishment following the prosecution, such
    as a fine, suspended sentence or a custodial sentence.

217. At [44.b], Professor Bowring said there was a "real  possibility"  that
    the appellants could be prosecuted, and that the most likely punishment
    would be  a  fine.   He  added  that  a  prison  sentence  would  be  a
    possibility, given both appellants fled Ukraine soon after  the  Maiden
    events of 2014; the reaction of the court could not be  predicted  with
    any certainty.  The judicial system was in chaos.  There was  a  new  -
    and very  controversial  -  chief  prosecutor.   In  cross-examination,
    Professor Bowring expanded upon what he meant by describing  the  chief
    prosecutor as controversial; she had never been  a  prosecutor  before,
    although was a lawyer by training.  She had been a  parliamentarian  in
    the same party as the president.  In 2015,  she  made  an  unsuccessful
    application to the Supreme Court.  Professor Bowring was not  aware  of
    anything the new chief prosecutor had said  or  done  concerning  draft
    evasion.  The Professor's suggestion that prison  was  a  "possibility"
    for these appellants  must  be  read  alongside  the  contents  of  the
    preceding paragraph of his first report, [43], in which he referred  to
    the prospect of imprisonment for  these  appellants  as  being  "highly
    unlikely".

218. At [44.c], Professor  Bowring  addressed  whether  a  new  computerised
    system at the border would identify draft evaders at port.  He wrote:

         "I have no evidence that this has happened, but it  is  well  known
         that Ukraine now has sophisticated modern data systems  and  it  is
         likely in my opinion that draft evasion would be one matter  to  be
         flagged at border control."

219. As to whether, if identified as a draft evader at port, the  appellants
    would be detained, and if so, for how  long,  the  Professor  wrote  at
    [44.d]:

         "I do not want to speculate. I do not have  evidence  or  examples.
         But it is likely, in view of the Appellants' previous  flight  from
         Ukraine, that they might be  held  pending  trial  in  a  SIZO,  or
         pretrial detention prison. On the other hand the relatively lenient
         punishments could mean release on  bail,  perhaps  with  electronic
         tagging."

220. At [44.e], Professor Bowring addressed  whether  there  is  a  propiska
    registration system in Ukraine.  Propiska, explained the Professor, was
    the Soviet system of internal passports, "designed to prevent  peasants
    from leaving their villages."  There is now a system of  compulsory  ID
    cards, which holds the data that would previously have been held by the
    old propiska system  of  internal  ID  cards.   Carrying  ID  cards  is
    compulsoryhe said, and an ID card is needed to access a wide  range  of
    state services.  The first ID cards were issued from  1  January  2016;
    280,000 were issued in 2016, 1.1 million on 2017, 1.3 million  in  2018
    and almost 1.6 million in 2019, he wrote.

221. This, opined Professor Bowring, "makes it  much  harder  to  evade  the
    draft".  In response to a question from the  Bench,  Professor  Bowring
    said that the ID cards, and the state  databases  that  they  link  to,
    meant that he would "be surprised if  previous  draft  evasion  is  not
    present" in the state databases associated with  the  bearers  of  such
    cards.  Professor Bowring stressed that that was his opinion, and  that
    he could not point to evidence.  As to why the new ID card  system  had
    not led to more draft evaders being prosecuted, Professor Bowring  said
    that he would be surprised if the vast majority of  draft  evaders  had
    not been conscripted when they would have  faced  death  on  the  front
    line.  "People may well have sought to evade the draft then", he  said,
    adding that ID cards have been introduced subsequent to the first waves
    of call-up notices being issued and that, putting the two together, "it
    is not an unreasonable conclusion that there are fewer  people  seeking
    to evade the draft."

222. At  [44.f],  Professor  Bowring  addressed  the  punishment  for  draft
    evasion the appellants would  be  likely  to  face,  in  the  event  of
    prosecution.  He considered that the most likely  penalty  would  be  a
    fine;  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  would  be  unlikely.   In  cross-
    examination, when asked to expand on the reasons for his  opinion,  the
    Professor referred to the information available in 2016 (when  he  gave
    evidence in VB), and to the  materials  cited  at  [40]  of  his  first
    report, in which, in reliance on a report on a news  website,  he  said
    that the fine likely to  be  imposed  for  draft  evasion  would  be  a
    multiplier of between five and seven, or 10 to 15 times  the  "tax-free
    minimum incomes of citizens".

223. Professor Bowring's second report addressed a number  of  supplementary
    questions raised by the respondent.  He was asked to address whether it
    is open to an individual to avoid military service in  Ukraine  on  the
    grounds of ill-health or disability, and to outline  the  circumstances
    under which a person may avoid military service on those  grounds.   At
    [3] of his second report, Professor Bowring outlined Article 14 of  the
    1992 Ukrainian law quoted above, noting that military  service  may  be
    avoided depending on the result of the medical examination.   He  noted
    that Article 16 of the 1992 law made provision for an Appeal Commission
    but noted that the commission's proceedings and determinations are not,
    to his knowledge, published.

224. At [4] of his second report, Professor Bowring  opined  that,  even  in
    cases of disability, it is likely that there would  be  a  penalty  for
    failing to answer  the  call-up.   Only  a  medical  examination  could
    determine whether a medical condition or disability was such to trigger
    an exemption or deferment under Article 14.

225. The Professor confirmed under cross-examination that, in  reaching  his
    written opinion that there was a "real possibility" that the appellants
    would be prosecuted (first report,  [44.b]),  he  had  not  taken  into
    account the health conditions of PK.  Those details had not been in his
    instructions, he said, adding that everything of relevance that he  had
    been alerted to was highlighted in his reports.  He had been  asked  to
    opine in his second report on the potential impact of  an  individual's
    disability, but had not been asked to do so in the context of  specific
    concerns about the health of either appellant.

226. In  cross-examination,  Professor  Bowring  was  asked  to  comment  on
    Article 17 of the 1992 law, which sets out additional circumstances  in
    which a person may defer their military service.  Paragraph  (2)  makes
    provision for deferment on the grounds of  family  circumstances.   The
    Professor was unable to go into detail on this article, as, he  stated,
    it was not what he had been asked to opine on  in  either  report.   He
    stressed that he had only  been  asked  to  opine  on  exemptions  from
    military service on grounds of ill health or disability,  and  that  it
    was the first time he had been asked about the question.   He  had  not
    considered Article 17(2) when drafting  his  reports.   When  Mr  Malik
    highlighted the fact that each of the appellants in  these  proceedings
    has two children each, Professor Bowring said that all  he  knew  about
    the appellants is what he had outlined in paragraphs [2] to [4] of  his
    first report.   Those  paragraphs  are  silent  as  to  whether  either
    appellant has children.  Eventually, when pressed by Mr Malik to engage
    with the terms of the  article  that  was  before  him,  the  Professor
    accepted that "clearly" the article provides that having  two  or  more
    children is a ground for deferment.

227.  Professor  Bowring  had  not  found  any  evidence  since   VB   which
    demonstrated that prosecutions were now more likely; Mr  Malik  pressed
    him on this point, and he confirmed that he had not found any materials
    which demonstrated that prosecutions for draft evasion  were  now  more
    likely.  The Professor maintained that was because the media report  on
    more serious allegations.  Although he knew of Ukrainian draft  evaders
    in this country, he was not aware of any prosecutions for draft evasion
    in Ukraine.

228. As  indicated  at  paragraph  109,  above,  during  Mr  Malik's  cross-
    examination, those representing  the  appellants  conducted  additional
    research online, and found five articles which,  Mr  Metzer  contended,
    appeared to suggest that some prosecutions for draft  evasion  had  and
    would take place, despite  Professor  Bowring  having  emphasised  only
    moments earlier that his own research had been unable to  discover  any
    examples.  We were a little surprised at this development and  consider
    it to reflect a lacklustre approach to the procedural  rigour  required
    in this tribunal.  Nevertheless, adopting the realistic approach of  Mr
    Malik, we too were  concerned  to  ensure  there  was  no  material  of
    potential relevance that we did not consider, even  if  it  did  entail
    allowing the appellants to ambush the tribunal (not  to  mention  their
    own expert) part way through the hearing.

229. As such, Professor Bowring was asked by  Mr  Metzer  asked  to  comment
    upon, and where relevant, translate the articles into English.  We were
    subsequently provided with electronic copies of the articles, and  with
    what appears to be an automated English translation of at least one  of
    them.   We  understand  that  the  article  titled,  For   evasion   of
    conscription a man is before the court, 12 July 2019, from the  website
    unn.com.ua, was in Russian.  The  translated  version  provided  to  us
    retained the original formatting and photographs of  the  original  web
    page, in a way which, in our experience, rarely if ever features  in  a
    certified  translation.   Secondly,  there  is  no  reference  on   the
    translated  document  to  the  identity  of  the  translator,  nor  any
    indication as to their skills, experience or  qualifications,  nor  any
    certification as to the accuracy of the translation.  Nevertheless,  as
    we have had the benefit of Professor Bowring acting as translator,  and
    have been able to verify his account of contents of the documents  with
    the English versions subsequently presented to us, we  are  content  to
    treat the translations as being of sufficient accuracy to allow  us  to
    consider the contents of the documents, putting to one side the  clunky
    turns of phrase in some of the articles.  We do not know  whether  more
    of the articles were in Russian originally, or whether only the article
    referred to above was in Russian.

230. The first  article,  Seven  residents  of  Lviv  region  face  criminal
    liability for evading conscription,  is  dated  29  November  2018  and
    published by a website called zaxid.net.  A  named  official  from  the
    Lviv Regional Commissariat is quoted as stating that 800  citizens  had
    evaded military service; 38  had  been  sent  to  alternative  military
    service.   According  to  the   article,   seven   criminal   and   400
    administrative cases had been registered in response.

231. Although Professor Bowring did not translate the following sentence  in
    his oral evidence, the translated version we were later  provided  with
    also stated:

         "Citizens whose doctrine does not allow them to take  up  arms  and
         who have collected the relevant documents three months  before  the
         call-up, service twice as long as usual (in  housing  and  communal
         services and hospitals)."

232. The second article, Since the beginning of  the  year,  more  than  300
    evasion proceedings have been registered, is dated 12 July 2019, and is
    from the website unn.com.ua.  It states that, since  the  beginning  of
    2019, 342 criminal proceedings have been registered  in  Ukraine  under
    draft evasion provisions.  It then appears to state that a total of 460
    proceedings were  brought,  of  which  118  were  "closed".   Professor
    Bowring provided the figure of 460 in his oral evidence; the figure  is
    obscured in the post-hearing digital version provided to us.   In  five
    years, 1940 criminal proceedings for draft evasion were commenced.  The
    translation states, "Drafted and sent troops to 17 thousand. 370 people
    [sic]"[2], adding that the plan for the spring draft  was  18,752.   It
    appears that the  article  sought  to  convey  that  17,  370  military
    conscripts reported for duty.

233. The third  article,  A  man  will  stand  trial  for  evading  military
    service, 12 July 2019, gives an account of a man being  prosecuted  for
    failing to report to the Chernigov Joint  City  Military  Commissariat.
    The article adds, without referencing, that "since the beginning of the
    year, more than 300 draft evasion proceedings have already  been  taken
    into account."

234. The fourth article is titled How  many  Ukrainians  were  punished  for
    evading the army in 2019, 22 December 2019.   The  root  website  which
    features at the foot of the page  is  mi100.info.   We  have  not  been
    provided with any additional information about the  provenance  of  the
    website.  It states:

         "According to the Opendatabot platform, 280 convictions for evading
         conscription were handed down in the last year.  For  evasion  from
         military registration or special fees - 129 people  and  12  -  for
         evasion from mobilisation... Some of  those  who  evade  are  still
         wanted.   Most of them evade the mobilisation call - 45 people.

         Sanctions  are  applied  as  an  administrative  penalty  for  non-
         appearance at the military registration and  enlistment  office:  a
         fine of 85 to 119 hryvnias for the first violation, a fine of  170-
         255 hryvnias for repeated violations."

     We have not been provided with  any  further  evidence  concerning  the
    "Opendatabot" platform which reportedly was the  source  of  the  data.
    At paragraph 3 of his second  report,  Professor  Bowring  states  that
    Article 16 of the 1992 Law provides for an  Appeal  Commission,  adding
    that, "the proceedings and determinations of Appeal Commissions are not
    published as far as I know.  Certainly not online."

235. The fifth article, Zelensky proposes to  fine  Ukrainians  for  evading
    mobilization, is dated "29 May", without a year.  It was published on a
    website called glavcom.ua.  It reports that a  draft  law  proposes  to
    increase the fine for "non-arrival" at the "place  of  collection"  for
    mobilization training from 1700 to 5100UAH.  It records that a call has
    been issued for reservists, and that reserve officers under the age  of
    43 will be called up from the reserve for military service  within  two
    months.  The conscription age will be lowered to include those aged  18
    to 19.

236. Mr Malik asked Professor Bowring whether any  of  the  articles  stated
    that any persons had  actually  been  prosecuted  and  convicted.   The
    Professor replied that it was characteristic of Ukrainian media reports
    to "tell you lots of things, but not what you want".  He  said  he  was
    unable to offer a view as to whether, in the vast  majority  of  cases,
    draft evaders are  not  prosecuted.   When  Mr  Malik  highlighted  the
    conclusions of VB that the  "overwhelming  majority"  of  over  100,000
    draft evaders had appeared to face no consequences for their actions at
    all", Professor Bowring said that "the authors of these  articles  seem
    to have different sources".  He added that he would need to look  again
    at the reports he prepared for VB, but said that "the draft has changed
    completely since then, so that nobody who is drafted  is  sent  to  the
    front."

PART E: ANALYSIS OF BACKGROUND  MATERIALS  AND  THE  EVIDENCE  OF  PROFESSOR
BOWRING

237. We did not reach the following findings  until  having  considered  the
    entirety of the materials provided to us, in the round,  to  the  lower
    standard.  Although we have approached the allegations  levied  against
    the Ukrainian military by the appellants on  the  same  thematic  basis
    adopted by the appellants in the presentation of their  case,  we  have
    considered the allegations holistically.

Conduct of the Ukrainian military

238. Arbitrary detention, torture and extra-judicial killing: In the  round,
    the above materials provide a compelling basis for us to conclude  that
    those elements of the Ukrainian military and security services involved
    in military operations in the east of the country targeting  the  self-
    declared, suspected  Russia-backed,  separatist  "republics"  regularly
    engage in arbitrary detention, and subsequently use torture and  engage
    in other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment against those in their
    detention.  This is a systemic problem which has been condemned by  the
    OHCHR and other members of the international community since monitoring
    began in light of the conflict.

239. Significantly, despite regular and detailed criticism in  the  form  of
    the  quarterly  OHCHR  reports,  each  of   which   provides   specific
    recommendations for the Ukrainian authorities  to  adopt  in  order  to
    stamp out the practice, progress has been slow.   There  is  a  general
    downward trajectory  in  the  Ukrainian  authorities'  use  of  torture
    against conflict detainees, but the  practice  has  by  no  means  been
    eliminated, nor has it diminished to the extent that it may  no  longer
    be regarded as systemic.  Prisoner exchanges  continue  to  provide  an
    incentive for both sides to  the  conflict  to  bring  many  more  into
    detention than operationally necessary or permitted  by  the  law,  for
    detainees have become the currency of choice to release those  detained
    by  the  opposing  party.   The  systemic  pattern  of  detentions  and
    exchanges suggests that many are detained simply to secure the  release
    of those on the other side who themselves have been  detained  for  the
    purposes of similar prisoner exchanges.  There  has  been  a  mutually-
    assured rise in detentions on all sides.   The  clandestine  nature  of
    unofficial detentions has fuelled an atmosphere of impunity.  Not  only
    has there been no  accountability  for  those  on  the  Ukrainian  side
    involved in the practice, the practice is sanctioned by  the  executive
    and, through its acquiescence, the judiciary.

240. Accordingly, we find that the torture, mistreatment and  extra-judicial
    killing of those detained by or for the Ukrainian armed forces  amounts
    to acts contrary to the basic rules  of  human  conduct.   We  have  no
    reason to  doubt  the  compelling  and  detailed  background  materials
    concerning this issue, as outlined previously in this  decision.   Such
    conduct falls within the prohibitions listed at [32], above.

241. We  recall  at  this  point  that  non-military  prison  and  detention
    conditions are not within the scope of the country  guidance  questions
    identified for our consideration, and  that  the  position  remains  as
    identified by the tribunal in VB.  We were invited by the respondent to
    consider a decision of the UN Human Rights Committee, Decision  adopted
    by the Committee under the Optional Protocol, concerning  communication
    No. 2570/2015, in which a Ukrainian citizen resident in Italy sought to
    challenge his extradition to Ukraine for an offence of robbery, on  the
    basis that  conditions  of  detention  in  Ukraine  would  violate  the
    International Covenant on Civil and  Political  Rights  ("the  ICCPR").
    The Committee declared the complaint to be inadmissible under Article 2
    of the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.  We consider the decision of the
    Committee to shed minimal light on the issues  for  our  consideration.
    It simply demonstrates that the materials relied upon by the author  of
    the "communication" to the Committee  did  not  demonstrate,  with  the
    required  specificity,  a  risk  of  irreparable  harm  such  as   that
    contemplated by Article 7 of the  ICCPR,  which  corresponds  in  broad
    terms to  Article  3  of  the  ECHR.   It  is  not  authority  for  any
    proposition that prison conditions in  Ukraine  are  satisfactory,  nor
    that they have dropped to sub-VB levels, as Mr Metzer  suggested.   The
    conclusions of VB concerning conditions of detention  and  imprisonment
    remain untouched.

242. Alleged breaches  of  international  humanitarian  law  concerning  in-
    conflict conduct (e.g., distinction, proportionality  and  precaution):
    We recall that it is necessary for there to be a "policy or system"  on
    the part  of  the  Ukrainian  military  or  government,  or  widespread
    official indifference, concerning disregard of the  principles  of  IHL
    such that they may properly be said, to the lower  standard  applicable
    to these proceedings, to amount to acts contrary to the basic rules  of
    human conduct.

243. By way of a preliminary observation in our analysis of this  issue,  we
    consider that it is  necessary  to  have  regard  to  the  geographical
    context in which the Ukraine conflict takes place.  In this respect, we
    adopt the summary at footnote 17  in  the  May  to  August  2018  OHCHR
    report:

         "Due to the geographic location of the contact line, areas adjacent
         to  it  in  territory  controlled  by  armed  groups  are  built-up
         residential and urban areas in many places, whereas areas  adjacent
         to the contact line in territory controlled by the  Government  are
         mainly fields and smaller villages."

    This was a footnote to the following sentence, which  features  in  the
    context of recording the total number of  civilian  casualties  in  the
    reporting period:

         "All of  the  incidents  occurred  in  residential  neighbourhoods,
         including the victims' houses, or other areas regularly  frequented
         by civilians."

244. The Russia-backed separatist militia have occupied towns and cities  by
    force as part of their continued establishment of  the  self-proclaimed
    Donetsk people's republic  and  the  Luhansk  people's  republic.   The
    nature of the ongoing conflict means that legitimate  military  targets
    will, by definition,  exist  adjacent  to,  or  even  within,  civilian
    installations and residential areas, as recognised by the two quotes in
    the preceding paragraph, and the geographical reality of the  conflict.
    While that  reality  cannot  have  the  effect  of  negating  Ukrainian
    responsibility  for  targeting  errors  or  indiscipline,  nor  can  it
    diminish the importance of the principles  of  distinction,  precaution
    and proportionality (on the contrary: the need for compliance with such
    principles is  reinforced  in  this  context),  it  does  provide  some
    explanation  for  the  proximity  of  military  targets  to   otherwise
    protected locations and civilians.

245. We accept that some of the targeting decisions  which  appear  to  have
    been taken by the Ukrainian  military  are  highly  questionable,  when
    viewed alongside its use of wide-impact  weapons  as  recorded  by  the
    OSCE, in the context of the large numbers of  civilian  casualties  and
    deaths throughout  the  conflict.   In  his  oral  evidence,  Professor
    Bowring told us that an article  in  the  Kyiv  Post  on  23  May  2020
    reported that there had been 3,079 civilian deaths since  the  outbreak
    of the conflict.  The OHCHR reported in its  August  to  November  2019
    report that some 50,000 homes had been destroyed: see [5] and [34].

246. Put in the crudest terms, unless the Ukrainian military and  government
    are to acquiesce in the internationally  condemned  invasion  of  their
    territory by armed militia sponsored by Russia, there will  necessarily
    need to be a degree of targeting of the armed groups in built up areas.
     There will necessarily be targeting  errors  in  a  conflict  of  this
    character; the issue for our analysis as set out above is to determine,
    knowing what happened, why it happened, and whether there were breaches
    of IHL such that they amounted to acts contrary to the basic  rules  of
    human conduct.

247. Against that background, we turn to the specific incidents set  out  in
    the background materials and drawn to our attention by the  appellants.



248. We are not privy to the tactical  justifications  relied  upon  by  the
    Ukrainian military.  And we remind ourselves that the objective of  IHL
    is to minimise the loss of life to civilians, rather  than  prohibiting
    the loss of civilian life altogether, as regrettable and tragic as such
    losses are.  We make this  observation  not  to  shroud  the  Ukrainian
    military in a cloak of impunity, nor to justify the extensive  civilian
    casualties of which we were reminded by Professor Bowring,  but  simply
    to highlight the difficulties inherent in the task that lies  ahead  of
    us.

249. We note the concerns of  organisations  such  as  the  OHCHR  and  OSCE
    concerning breaches of the principles of  distinction,  precaution  and
    proportionality by the Ukrainian military arising from the presence  of
    heavy artillery on both sides of the conflict.  See, for  example,  the
    concerns raised in the August to November 2017 OHCHR report surrounding
    the use of wide  area  impact  munitions  and  multiple  rocket  launch
    systems.  We also note that during the same period the HRMMU documented
    civilian  casualties  and  damage  to  civilian   property   that   was
    attributable  to  heavy  weapons.   While  recalling  the  geographical
    realities of conflict along the contact line, we accept that the use of
    heavy artillery, in populated residential areas, does give rise to some
    cause for concern.  But we do not consider that the mere  presence  and
    use of heavy artillery  necessarily  merits  the  conclusion  that  the
    Ukrainian military engage in acts contrary to the basic rules of  human
    conduct on the necessary widespread and systemic  basis.   It  has  not
    been suggested by the appellants that such weaponry could never feature
    as part of the full spectrum  of  military  capabilities  that  Ukraine
    would be entitled to rely on in the conflict.

250. We also accept that the sheer magnitude of  the  civilian  death  toll,
    which stood at 3,079 on 23 May 2020  according  to  Professor  Bowring,
    tends to suggest that there has been disregard for life on all sides of
    the conflict.  But we do not consider that all the  examples  given  by
    the background  materials  merit  the  conclusion  that  the  Ukrainian
    military breached the principles of  distinction,  proportionality  and
    precaution.

251. For example, some of the OHCHR reports assume that certain events  must
    have lacked military objective or justification, but in our  view,  for
    many of the incidents it is difficult to draw such conclusions, and the
    reasoning given by the OHCHR lacks substance.  In  its  May  to  August
    2018 report, the OHCHR documented injuries caused by  a  shell  landing
    next to a civilian bus.  At [23], the report recorded that  over  1,000
    civilians reside in the  village  and  suggests  that  "there  were  no
    military objectives" located near the site of the incident,  and  there
    were no members of armed groups "in combat function"  observed  in  the
    area.  This led the OHCHR to suggest that it was a "serious  violation"
    of IHL for a party in a  conflict  to  target  civilians  and  civilian
    infrastructure, or to carry out an indiscriminate attack,  highlighting
    the  obligations  upon  parties  to  conflict  to  take  all   feasible
    precautions to avoid harm to the civilian population.  It is not  clear
    to us how the OHCHR could have concluded that there were  "no  military
    objectives" in  the  village  in  question;  the  report  proffered  no
    explanation.  Its suggestion that  there  were  no  "members  of  armed
    groups in combat  function  observed  in  the  area  at  the  time"  is
    ambiguous.  It could mean that the OHCHR was confident that there  were
    no armed militia in the area at all.  Alternatively, it could mean that
    there were such members present, but simply that,  at  the  time,  they
    were not "in combat function" at the time.  If so, that they  were  not
    in combat function at the time does not necessarily mean that they fell
    within any of the established categories of attracting  the  protection
    of being hors de combat.  This, of course, is not to negate the account
    of the incident taking place, but we  do  consider  that  some  of  the
    OHCHR's commentary to the incident merits  further  consideration,  and
    does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that  it  involved  Ukraine
    breaching its obligations under IHL on that occasion.

252. We accept that there appears to have been a pattern  of  workers  close
    to civilian water  installations,  and  the  installations  themselves,
    being targeted.  The August to November 2017 OHCHR  report  records  at
    [24] ten incidents affecting  water  facilities  in  conflict  affected
    areas.  The First Lift  Pumping  Station  of  the  South  Donbas  water
    pipeline was  shelled  on  three  occasions.   The  Donetsk  Filtration
    Station ("the DFS") was shelled repeatedly between  3  and  5  November
    2017, causing damage to a backup  chlorine  pipeline.   However,  there
    does not appear to have been a "direct hit" of the  sort  necessary  to
    destroy the facility; so much is clear  from  the  fact  that  the  DFS
    continued to be a target for future military action,  and  due  to  the
    fact that OHCHR report records that neither the main  pipeline  or  the
    chlorine pipeline received a direct hit.  The fact that the DFS  itself
    remained intact tends  to  suggest  that  a  degree  of  restraint  was
    exercised by the targeting forces.

253. On 17 April 2018, a bus carrying  30  civilian  workers  from  the  DFS
    appears  to  have  been  the  target  of  deliberate  small  arms  fire
    originating from the direction of government-controlled territory:  see
    [22].  Footnote 29 on page 6 of  that  report  gives  reasons  for  the
    OHCHR's view that the bus was deliberately targeted: it was  travelling
    away from the DFS in armed  group-controlled  territory;  the  bus  was
    clearly  marked  with  the  Voda  Donbasa  insignia  and   was   easily
    recognisable; the parties to the conflict in the area are well aware of
    the movement of the bus on the road,  which  carried  civilian  workers
    twice daily; and the parties to the conflict had previously  negotiated
    "windows of silence" to enable the safe transport of civilian staff.

254. The January 2019 attack on three civilian workers  in  a  Voda  Donbasa
    bus (which must have been clearly marked as  such,  given  the  OHCHR's
    earlier observations) suggests a continuation in this tactic,  assuming
    responsibility for the attack lay with the Ukrainian forces (the detail
    of which is not specified in  the  relevant  OHCHR  report).   See  the
    summary at [146], above.

255. The above reports  do  tend  to  suggest  a  wilful  disregard  of  the
    principles of precaution and distinction.  Workers at critical civilian
    infrastructure and their vehicles do appear to have  been  targeted  on
    multiple occasions, despite reportedly clear vehicle  signage,  and  no
    apparent military justification.  However, the reports  do  not  record
    that there were large numbers of civilian  casualties  caused  by  this
    aspect of the conduct of the Ukrainian military.  It  does  not  appear
    that the indiscipline recorded in the reports entailed  wilful  killing
    or other acts contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct  on  a
    sufficiently  widespread  or  systematic  basis  so  as  to  reach  the
    threshold described in Krotov.

256. The evidence  concerning  "targeting"  of  schools  is  mixed.   Again,
    recalling that the context for the conflict is the unlawful  occupation
    of Ukrainian towns and cities by armed groups, the reality of Ukraine's
    military response will necessarily involve the  targeting  of  military
    objectives that are  proximate  to  civilians  and  protected  civilian
    buildings.  At  [172],  above,  we  recorded  the  OHCHR's  summary  of
    shelling which affected schools and a kindergarten in  Novoluhanske,  a
    town  in  government-controlled  territory.   Although  the  appellants
    directed us to this incident, it appears to have  taken  place  at  the
    hands of the armed  groups,  attempting  to  target  Ukrainian  forces,
    rather than the other way round. By contrast, [28] and [29] of the  May
    to August 2019 OHCHR report recorded alleged  heavy  machine  gun  fire
    hitting School No. 30 in Horlivka, in armed group-controlled territory.
     One of the classroom windows was damaged on the first occasion in July
    2019; unspecified damage took place during a later incident  in  August
    2019.  Two further schools in the armed group-controlled Donetsk region
    were also damaged in July that year.  The shelling took place at  night
    when no one was present.  In our view, the evidence  demonstrates  that
    the schools which may have  been  hit  by  government  fire  were  only
    peripherally damaged, and the attacks took  place  at  night  when  the
    schools were empty.  If anything, that demonstrates an attempt  by  the
    Ukrainian military to respect the principles of precaution, distinction
    and  proportionality.   To  the  extent  schools  that  enjoy   special
    protection under IHL, it appears the damage they sustained was  minimal
    compared to that which could be inflicted  pursuant  to  the  firepower
    available to Ukraine.

257. We recall  that  the  November  2019  to  February  2020  OHCHR  report
    documents that Ukraine has joined the "Safe Schools  Declaration".   We
    have not been presented with any evidence of further incidents  at  the
    hands of the Ukrainian forces involving schools since  the  signing  of
    that declaration.

258. Finally on  this  issue,  we  note  the  pre-investigation  preliminary
    activities of  the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  of  the  International
    Criminal Court.  We approach  the  report  with  a  degree  of  caution
    commensurate to  the  early,  preliminary  stage  of  the  Prosecutor's
    activities.   The  Prosecutor  has  simply  outlined  pre-investigative
    concerns, which are presently insufficient to enable the  determination
    necessary under Article 15(3) of the Rome Statute to take place.   Even
    if there were sufficient evidence for such a determination in favour of
    referring the matter to the Pre-Trial Chamber,  the  process  would  be
    with a view to a formal investigation being opened in due course.   Put
    another way, the Prosecutor's  observations  are  preliminary,  as  the
    title of the report suggests.  But they do attract some weight.  It  is
    of some significance that the Office of the Prosecutor  is  considering
    whether to apply to commence a formal investigation which  would  focus
    on the very conduct which we have been asked to assess,  to  the  lower
    standard applicable to protection proceedings.

259. Drawing this analysis together, recalling the Krotov  summary  of  what
    amounts to acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct,  and  the
    need for there to be a policy and system of such conduct  in  order  to
    merit a finding of such conduct, we do not consider that  it  has  been
    demonstrated to the lower standard that the Ukrainian military  engages
    in such conduct during its conflict operations.  There is  no  evidence
    of the widespread, systemic and deliberate targeting  of  civilians  or
    civilian installations.  Undoubtedly there have been incidents of local
    indiscipline   and   poor   targeting   decisions   resulting   in    a
    disproportionate amount of collateral civilian deaths  and  casualties.
    There have been isolated examples of civilians being targeted, such  as
    the targeting of the bus carrying 30 civilian workers of the DFS on  17
    April 2018, but such  conduct  is  not  widespread  and  systemic.   We
    consider the geographical realities  of  the  conflict  and  the  close
    proximity of the contact line to residential areas to be the main cause
    of such casualties, rather than the  widespread  actions  of  a  brutal
    military coupled with official indifference.  Where there are  examples
    of what appears  to  be  the  deliberate  targeting  of  civilians  and
    civilian installations (for example, the backup chlorine pipes  of  the
    DFS as documented in the August to November  2017OHCHR  report),  there
    does appear to have been a degree of restraint.

260. Finally, the evidence of Professor Bowring was  that,  by  March  2020,
    adherence to the ceasefire had been very positive.  Even if  there  had
    previously been the commission by the military of acts contrary to  the
    basic rules of human conduct on a sufficiently widespread or systematic
    basis, the  evidence  now  demonstrates  that  such  conduct  has  been
    curtailed by the ceasefire.

261. For these reasons, we do  not  consider  that  the  Ukrainian  military
    currently engages in acts contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct
    in the conduct of military targeting and use of arms  in  the  east  of
    Ukraine.

262. Anti-personnel mines: The past use of mines and similar  indiscriminate
    munitions, if laid by Ukraine, is deeply concerning.  As  noted  in  BE
    (Iran),  the  position  in  2008  was  that  there  was   an   emerging
    international norm prohibiting the use of  such  munitions.   While  we
    have not heard any argument suggesting that the then-emerging  norm  is
    now settled, that is, of course, irrelevant as Ukraine is a State party
    to the Ottawa Convention.  The continued indiscriminate  use  of  anti-
    personnel and other mines in heavily  populated  or  accessed  civilian
    areas would be conduct capable of amounting to an act contrary  to  the
    basic rules of human conduct.  Their past use, if  they  were  laid  by
    Ukraine, certainly appears to have been in breach of  the  undertakings
    Ukraine gave pursuant to Article 5 of the Ottawa Convention.

263. There are no materials that record that  Ukraine  was  responsible  for
    laying all the mines in question, still less  is  there  anything  that
    demonstrates there to be a continued practice of  laying  landmines  on
    its part.  We do not consider that it is self-evident  that  all  mines
    located in government-controlled territory were laid by  the  Ukrainian
    military, although we accept it is likely  that  Ukraine  has  deployed
    some of the mines and  IEDs  in  question.   The  conflict  in  Ukraine
    involves pockets of Ukrainian territory being "taken" by  Russia-backed
    militia, in breach of international law.  No materials have been  drawn
    to our attention which demonstrate that those same militia could not be
    responsible  for  laying  mines  in  government-controlled   territory,
    especially close to the contact line.  While we note, for example, [22]
    of the November 2017 to February 2018 OHCHR report, which suggests that
    "the parties" to the conflict continued in their placement of IEDs  and
    anti-personnel mines, the report does not detail the basis  upon  which
    those  actions  may  properly  be  said  to  be  attributable  to   the
    government.  Footnote 15 on that page  relies  on  reporting  from  the
    HRMMU which records a tractor driver being injured by a mine  exploding
    in an  area  which  had  previously  been  de-mined,  and  a  trip-wire
    explosive device injuring a woman near her  neighbour's  house.   These
    brief factual summaries do not provide a basis upon which to  attribute
    responsibility to the Ukrainian military; there is no  suggestion  that
    the armed militia groups have engaged in any mine clearing  activities,
    and it is highly illogical to think that the Ukrainian  military  would
    re-mine  an  area  the  government  had  previously   de-mined.    When
    considered alongside Ukraine's efforts to comply with its international
    obligations concerning anti-personnel mines,  this  suggests  that  the
    armed groups were responsible for  the  placement  of  the  mines  and,
    significantly, does not merit a finding that it was  reasonably  likely
    that it was Ukraine.

264. It is more significant that mine-related casualties  are  falling,  and
    that Ukraine has taken positive steps to comply with its  international
    obligations concerning anti-personnel mines.  For example,  the  August
    to November 2019 OHCHR report at [30], which notes that while  residual
    mine-related casualties continued to occur, there had been a  51.3  per
    cent reduction in the number of deaths when compared  to  the  previous
    year.  The same paragraph implies  that  mine  clearance  activity  was
    underway at that time: see the reference to such action being described
    as "still necessary".  In the November 2019 to  February  2020  report,
    the OHCHR recorded a 50 per cent decrease in year on year  mine-related
    casualties: see [24].

265. Similarly, where mines have been deployed near the contact line,  there
    have been attempts to ensure  that  signage  highlights  the  risks  to
    civilians of straying  into  the  areas  concerned:  see  [22]  of  the
    November 2017 to February 2018 report.  While there  were  concerns  on
    the part of OHCHR that the signage could have been more  accurate,  and
    locals did not consider the signs to be reliable,  it  is  nevertheless
    significant that there was an attempt to deploy signs.  There must have
    been improvements, either in signage, civilian awareness,  or  sweeping
    of mines, from the dates covered by this report, given the year on year
    decreases noted by the OHCHR, as outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

266. We also note that the OHCHR considered the fact that Ukraine sought  to
    comply with its obligations under Article 5 of the Ottawa Convention to
    be a positive development: see [26] of  the  August  to  November  2018
    report.  Article 5 obliges a party to  the  Convention  to  destroy  or
    ensure the destruction of all anti-personnel mines in areas  under  its
    jurisdiction (which, for present purposes, we take to mean  exercisable
    jurisdiction, and thus would not cover territory held by  Russia-backed
    rebels).  While the nature of Ukraine's compliance on that occasion was
    to seek an extension for the time in which it was to  comply  with  its
    Article 5 obligations, it  demonstrates  that  Ukraine  is  seeking  to
    ensure compliance with the Ottawa Convention,  even  though  the  mine-
    clearing activities it is undertaking will consume more time  than  the
    initial permitted ten years.  The same OHCHR report also records  as  a
    "positive development" the adoption at the first  reading  of  a  draft
    law, "On mine action in Ukraine" No. 9080-1 of 19 September 2018, which
    is described as creating the legal framework for enhanced  mine  action
    activities in  Ukraine.   We  share  the  sentiment  of  the  OHCHR  in
    regarding this as a positive development.

267. The OHCHR report for August to November 2017 recorded concerns at  [22]
    that the parties to the conflict continued to practice the placement of
    IEDs and anti-personnel mines in populated areas and  near  objects  of
    civilian infrastructure.   Subsequent,  contemporary,  reports  do  not
    record that the practice continues.  Instead, the focus appears  to  be
    on the impact of such munitions, previously laid.   Paragraph  [24]  of
    the November 2019 to February 2020 OHCHR report  records  that,  at  10
    casualties during that reporting period, there had been a 50  per  cent
    decrease during that period.

268. From the materials available to us, therefore, we do not conclude  that
    it is reasonably likely that the  Ukrainian  military  engage  in  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct through the laying of anti-
    personnel  mines.   The  evidence  demonstrates   a   clear   downwards
    trajectory  in  the  number  of  civilian  casualties  caused  by  such
    munitions, and steps taken by Ukraine  which  -  significantly  -  were
    welcomed by the OHCHR, to comply  with  its  international  obligations
    under the Ottawa Convention, and pass domestic legislation providing an
    enhanced legal framework for the clearing of mines already laid.  These
    are not the actions of a military and government that  engage  in  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct on that basis.

269.  Use  of  civilian  property   without   permission,   restitution   or
    reparation, looting: Another common  feature  which  often  accompanies
    reports of civilian homes being destroyed  or  used  by  the  military,
    often without consultation, permission or compensation, is the practice
    of looting with impunity by the Ukrainian  forces  (see,  for  example,
    [118] of the OHCHR November 2017 to February 2018 report).  Most  OHCHR
    reports document instances of this  nature,  culminating  in  the  most
    recent report available to us, the quarterly report to 15 February 2020
    which states at [42] that the OHCHR "continued to document the extended
    military use of property  without  lease  agreements  or  compensation"
    (emphasis added), with residents receiving  utility  bills  for  energy
    used during military use of property.  The Government is said  to  have
    failed to implement judgments awarded against it in  cases  brought  by
    the families of those killed in the conflict seeking  restitution  (see
    the OHCHR May to August 2019 report, at [32]).

270. We do not accept that the Ukrainian government's  allegedly  lacklustre
    approach to  making  post-conflict  reparations,  or  the  practice  of
    looting, amounts to an act contrary to the basic rules of human conduct
    (see [32], above).  The rights at  play  in  such  failures  are  of  a
    different order to those basic human rights reflected and protected  by
    the concept of basic rules  of  human  conduct.   It  is  an  abhorrent
    practice, which fuels an atmosphere of lawlessness for the military and
    helplessness for civilians, but, at its core, looting  is  not  an  act
    which breaches the basic rules of human conduct.

271. Similarly, there  are  other  examples  of  conduct  of  the  Ukrainian
    government that are worthy of criticism, but which  do  not  amount  to
    acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.   For  example,  the
    fact  that  the  Commission  on  Persons   Missing   due   to   Special
    Circumstances, established in April 2019, is yet to commence  its  work
    (see the August to November 2019 OHCHR report at [55]), is not  an  act
    contrary to the basic rules of  human  conduct,  as  suggested  by  the
    appellants at [14(g)] of their skeleton  argument.   Indeed,  the  same
    OHCHR  report  records  that  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  approved   a
    regulation on the management of the register of missing persons.   Such
    delays do not have the characteristic of an act contrary to  the  basic
    rules of human conduct.

272. The appellants have submitted that the Ukrainian military  are  engaged
    in  the  forced  movement  of  civilians,  which   is   prohibited   in
    international law.  In common with the referencing for the remainder of
    the background materials, they have simply cited a page number, with no
    wider context (such as the title of the document) or the  paragraph  of
    the  document  in  question.   This  made  identifying  the  references
    considerably harder than it should have been, especially  in  light  of
    the fact that  many  of  the  page  references  in  the  index  to  the
    appellant's bundle referred to different OHCHR reports, with the result
    that consulting the index to identify the title  of  the  document  the
    appellants sought to rely  upon  would  not  necessarily  identify  the
    correct document.  For example, the index to  the  bundle  states  that
    pages 432 to 463 feature the November 2017  to  February  2018  report,
    whereas those pages, in fact,  feature  the  August  to  November  2017
    report.  Looking at page 235 of the bundle, the sole reference given as
    authority for the proposition that the Ukrainian  military  engages  in
    the forced movement of civilians, one finds the OHCHR report for August
    to November 2019.  Page 235 commences with the  continuation  of  [50],
    which concerns the abduction of a single male in Government  controlled
    territory.  We have  covered  unlawful  abduction  above,  and  do  not
    consider that individual  abductions  can  be  categorised  as  "forced
    movement of civilians".  The other examples given on page 235 relate to
    torture, abduction and forced movement conducted by the  rebel  militia
    in Russia-backed territories, rather than wider movement of  groups  of
    civilians.  We do not, therefore, consider the evidence to  demonstrate
    that there are forced movements of civilians by the Ukrainian military.

273. Recalling our analysis of Krotov and its approach to  what  amounts  to
    an act contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, we do not consider
    that isolated examples  of  utility  services  being  affected  by  the
    conflict to amount to an act contrary  to  the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct.  For example, [41] of the OHCHR  report  for  August  2019  to
    November 2019  highlights  how  the  Government-controlled  village  of
    Novooleksandrivka, which has 18 residents, has been without electricity
    since the beginning of the conflict.  Although the appellants  rely  on
    this example as a specific act contrary to the  basic  rules  of  human
    conduct, we do not consider that a failure to restore electricity to  a
    small village is capable of reaching that threshold.  Our conclusion is
    reinforced when one examines the accompanying commentary in  the  OHCHR
    report, which suggests that the issues faced by  the  village  are  not
    being addressed "in part due to  the  Government's  failure  to  assign
    responsibility to  the  village  to  any  local  authority".   Properly
    understood, this is an allegation of civil society mismanagement, which
    not only does not reach the "acts contrary to the basic rules of  human
    conduct threshold" but appears to be related  to  the  failure  of  the
    government, rather than the military, to adopt the necessary  steps  to
    post-conflict recovery.



PART F: COUNTRY GUIDANCE - CONCLUSIONS  ON  THE  CONDUCT  OF  THE  UKRAINIAN
MILITARY

274. Drawing the above analysis together, we make  the  following  findings,
    to the reasonable likelihood standard:

        a. Elements of  the  Ukrainian  military  engage  in  the  unlawful
           capture and detention of civilians with  no  legal  or  military
           justification.   The  detention  of  some  detainees   will   be
           justified by military necessity or otherwise  permissible  under
           IHL,  but  a  large  number  of  detentions  feature   no   such
           justification and are motivated by the need for  "currency"  for
           prisoner exchanges with the armed groups.

        b.  There  is  systemic  mistreatment  of  those  detained  by  the
           Ukrainian military in the conflict in the ATO, which is  in  the
           east of the country.  This involves torture  and  other  conduct
           that is cruel, inhumane  and  degrading  treatment  contrary  to
           Article 3 of the ECHR.  Even where such detainees are eventually
           transferred into the judicial detention process, there is likely
           to be  official  indifference  to  the  mistreatment  they  have
           received.

        c. There is an  attitude  and  atmosphere  of  impunity  for  those
           involved in mistreating detainees.  No one has been  brought  to
           justice.  Pro-Kyiv militia have been rewarded for their work  by
           formal incorporation into the military.  Lawyers are  afraid  of
           taking on cases due to the risk of retribution.

        d. The systemic and widespread detention practices of the Ukrainian
           military and law enforcement  officials  involving  torture  and
           Article 3 mistreatment amount to  acts  contrary  to  the  basic
           rules of human conduct.

        e. The Ukrainian military has had to engage with armed groups  that
           have  embedded  themselves  in  towns,  residential  areas   and
           civilian  installations  along  the  contact  line.   Legitimate
           military  targets  are  often  in  close  proximity  to   areas,
           buildings or people protected by international humanitarian  law
           ("IHL").  The Ukrainian military's adherence to  the  principles
           of distinction, precaution  and  proportionality  when  engaging
           with such targets has been poor, despite that being a task which
           calls for surgical precision, especially in  the  context  of  a
           conflict in which legitimate military targets have been embedded
           within  civilian  areas,  properties  and  installations.    The
           widespread civilian loss of life and the  extensive  destruction
           of residential property which has occurred in the conflict will,
           in part, be attributable to poorly targeted and disproportionate
           attacks carried out by the Ukrainian military, but the  evidence
           does not suggest that it is reasonably  likely  that  there  was
           targeting of civilians on a deliberate, systemic and  widespread
           basis.

        f. Water installations have been a particular and  repeated  target
           by Ukrainian armed  forces,  despite  civilian  maintenance  and
           transport vehicles being  clearly  marked  and  there  being  an
           established practice of negotiating "windows of silence" on some
           occasions, and despite the protected status  such  installations
           enjoy under IHL.  The background materials suggest  a  continued
           focus on water  and  similar  civilian  installations,  but  the
           evidence does not demonstrate  that  those  targeting  decisions
           were part of a policy  and  system.   Often  such  installations
           serve both sides of the contact  line,  militating  against  the
           conclusion that government forces sought to deprive armed  group
           territory of basic  services  through  the  prosecution  of  the
           strikes and attacks.

        g. Most civilian casualties have been  from  indirect  fire  rather
           than specific targeting.

        h. Civilian casualties continue to fall.

        i. Damage to schools appears to have been collateral or  accidental
           rather than intentional.

        j. It is not clear whether Ukraine was responsible for  laying  any
           of  the  anti-personnel  mines  documented  in  the   background
           materials.  Mines are no longer deployed  by  either  side,  and
           Ukraine is committed to complying with its  international  legal
           obligations under the Ottawa Convention to clear mines that  are
           in areas under its jurisdiction.

        k. While regrettable, we  do  not  consider  the  use  of  civilian
           property without payment or reparation, or looting, to amount to
           acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.

        l. Ukraine has begun steps  to  establish  a  register  of  missing
           persons.  It is not an act (or omission) contrary to  the  basic
           rules of human conduct not to  have  established  that  register
           with greater success or resolve.

        m. There is no evidence that the Ukrainian military is  engaged  in
           the forced movement of civilians.

PART G: CONSCRIPTS AND MOBILISED RESERVISTS, ENFORCEMENT OF DRAFT EVASION

275. The quality of Professor Bowring's evidence  concerning  draft  evasion
    was mixed.  He was reluctant or unable to answer several of Mr  Malik's
    entirely reasonable questions, all of which were within  the  scope  of
    the issues in relation to which he attended to give oral evidence as an
    expert witness.  Other  parts  of  his  evidence  were  speculative  or
    unsupported by sufficient reasons.  However, we consider that, overall,
    much of Professor Bowring's evidence carries weight  commensurate  with
    his reputation and experience, and we ascribe  significance  to  it  as
    outlined below.

276. We accept Professor Bowring's evidence that  it  is  "highly  unlikely"
    that persons with the profile of these appellants would be sent to  the
    ATO.  We note that at [6] of his report, Professor Bowring states  that
    each of the appellants are mobilised reservists; no  doubt  those  were
    his instructions. However, for the  reasons  given  at  paragraph  308,
    below, we explain why  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    relation to PK do not admit of the conclusion that he was found to be a
    reservist. That does not matter for the purposes of this  part  of  our
    analysis, given that more is generally expected of mobilised reservists
    than conscripts. For example, under Article  336  of  the  penal  code,
    mobilised reservists who evade military service may be sentenced to  up
    to 5 years' imprisonment, whereas  conscripts  will  be  subject  to  a
    maximum of three years' imprisonment for evasion of  military  service.
    As such, Prof Bowring's evidence in relation to the minimal  likelihood
    of these appellants being required to serve in the ATO applies with all
    the more force to conscripts. We accept  Professor  Bowring's  evidence
    that the focus of the Ukrainian military is now  to  send  professional
    recruits to  the  ATO,  rather  than  reluctant  forced  conscripts  or
    mobilised  reservists.  That  was  a  theme  which   ran   consistently
    throughout Professor Bowring's  written  and  oral  evidence,  and  the
    sources he relied upon.

277. We find that there is no evidence to  disturb  the  conclusions  of  VB
    that the vast majority of draft evaders are not prosecuted in  Ukraine.
    Professor Bowring's reports were quite clear that he had been unable to
    find any details of any prosecutions for draft evasion that  had  taken
    place.

278. We do not consider  the  five  articles  that  were  put  to  Professor
    Bowring by Mr Metzer part way  through  his  evidence  to  call  for  a
    different conclusion. There was  only  a  single  report  of  a  person
    actually prosecuted for draft evasion  (A  man  will  stand  trial  for
    evading military service, 12 July 2019).  The remaining  reports  which
    purported to outline an increase  in  enforcement  activity,  taken  at
    their highest, do not demonstrate that there is a basis to depart  from
    the conclusions of the tribunal in VB. Even those articles that  record
    the commencement of some form of enforcement activity provide no  basis
    to conclude, to the lower standard,  that  criminal  prosecutions  will
    follow.  For  example,  the  report  dated  29  November  2018  ("Seven
    residents  of  Lviv  region  face  criminal   liability   for   evading
    conscription") records that seven criminal cases had  been  registered,
    and 400 administrative cases, but there was no indication that criminal
    proceedings had followed in even those seven cases. Professor  Bowring,
    of course, said that he had been able to find no examples  of  criminal
    prosecutions actually taking place.

279. In relation to the 22 December 2019 article, How many  Ukrainians  were
    punished for evading the army in 2019,  the  source  is  given  as  the
    "Opendatabot"  platform.   No  other  details  are  given  as  to   the
    provenance or reliability of this  platform.   The  article  itself  is
    internally inconsistent. It suggests that "most" of the 280 convictions
    related to those who evaded  the  mobilisation  call,  and  gives  that
    specific figure  as  being  45.   That  contrasts  with  the  preceding
    sentence, in which it stated that 12 people  had  evaded  mobilisation,
    and  129  had  received  convictions   for   "evasion   from   military
    registration or special fees".  The figures  do  not  add  up.  In  any
    event, we recall that Professor Bowring's own research had revealed  no
    such data.  We prefer the evidence of the  established  expert  in  the
    field to a poorly referenced online article, in relation  to  which  we
    were given no details of the publication in which it featured, nor  the
    general reliability of the underlying source.

280. We also note that the suggestion of future law reform to  increase  the
    penalties for draft evasion  is  still  at  the  draft  proposal  stage
    (Zelensky proposes to fine  Ukrainians  for  evading  mobilization,  29
    May).  The increase in penalties recorded in the article  relates  only
    to financial penalties, rather than criminal convictions. The proposals
    feature within a package of other reforms. They  include  lowering  the
    conscription age to include men aged 18 to 19 and making provision  for
    the preservation of pre-military employment roles  for  those  forcibly
    recruited into the military, presumably to cater  for  those  who  fear
    losing their jobs during a period of  military  service.   The  article
    also indicates an intention for those reserve officers aged under 43 to
    be  subject  to  future  mobilisations.  To  the  extent  this  article
    demonstrates a likely increased zeal for the  forcible  recruitment  of
    conscripts and the mobilisation of reservists  in  the  future,  it  is
    correspondingly silent on the prospect of enhanced criminal  penalties,
    in particular, custodial disposals.

281. We do not find that there is any evidence to suggest that  Ukraine  now
    has a sophisticated computerised system that operates at the border  to
    detect suspected draft evaders upon their arrival. As Professor Bowring
    noted in his first report, he has no evidence concerning this issue. To
    the extent he thought that it is likely there would be such  a  system,
    we consider his evidence to be speculative. Again, there was nothing in
    any of the  remaining  background  materials  or  media  reports  which
    supports  Professor   Bowring's   estimate   of   the   likely   border
    infrastructure. In fairness to Professor Bowring, he clearly stated  in
    his  report  that  he  was  making  an  informed  guess;  but  it  was,
    nevertheless, speculation.  We do  not  consider  the  findings  in  VB
    concerning the  prospect  of  criminals  convicted  in  absentia  being
    identified at the border  to  be  inconsistent  with  this  conclusion.
    There is a clear distinction between an individual who  has  failed  to
    report for military service who has not  been  prosecuted,  still  less
    convicted, on the one hand, and a person who  has  been  convicted  and
    sentenced in absentia on the other, which was the context in VB.

282. Similarly, there is no evidence that the new ID card system  is  likely
    to result in any increase in the detection  of  draft  or  mobilisation
    evaders in general life. It is speculative to  suggest  that  ID  cards
    have been linked in this way to  the  vast  numbers  of  draft  evaders
    clearly circulating in Ukraine. We recall that  Professor  Bowring  had
    been unable to find any  reports  of  draft  evaders  being  prosecuted
    following the evidence he gave in  VB;  it  is  precisely  within  that
    timeframe that the ID cards have begun to be rolled out across Ukraine.
    There is no suggestion in any of Professor Bowring's evidence,  or  the
    other background materials (putting to one side  the  unclear  and,  at
    times, internally inconsistent news reports to which Professor  Bowring
    was referred by Mr Metzer at the end of his  evidence,  which  are  not
    reliable for the reasons set out above) that the new ID card system has
    in any way been responsible for an increase in prosecutions.

283. Professor Bowring was also clear that it would be very  unlikely  that,
    even  if  prosecuted,  either  appellant  would  serve  a  sentence  of
    custodial imprisonment. We consider that it is  not  reasonably  likely
    that a draft or mobilisation evader  would  be  placed  into  pre-trial
    detention at the border. Professor Bowring's evidence is ambivalent  on
    this. On the one hand, he states that, where a  person  such  as  these
    appellants has previously fled the country, that may be an  aggravating
    factor leading  to  their  pre-trial  detention.  On  the  other  hand,
    Professor Bowring notes that the "relatively lenient punishments  could
    mean release on bail, perhaps with electronic tagging". We  have  found
    above that the evidence does not  demonstrate  that  it  is  reasonably
    likely that a person would be flagged up as  a  draft  or  mobilisation
    evader at the border. We also recall that there is no support in any of
    the background materials for persons returning to Ukraine as  draft  or
    mobilisation evaders being identified as such at the border, still less
    their being detained on that basis. Bearing in  mind  that  the  future
    legislative and enforcement focus  of  the  government  of  Ukraine  in
    relation to draft evasion appears to be to increase the  fines  imposed
    for draft evasion, we consider that it is highly unlikely that a  draft
    evader would be detained pending trial at the border,  given  that  the
    enforcement focus is on fines, rather than custody.

284. Conscripts are entitled  to  establish  a  conscientious  objection  to
    military service on religious grounds, pursuant to Article  35  of  the
    Ukrainian constitution.  We accept Professor  Bowring's  evidence  that
    conscientious objector status is not available to mobilised reservists.



285. Article 14 of the 1992 law makes provision for  a  medical  examination
    of a conscript  or  reservist  to  result  in  a  number  of  different
    outcomes.  There is a graduating scale of seriousness  of  the  medical
    conditions, or other reasons  preventing  service,  with  corresponding
    consequences  according  to  the  circumstances   of   the   individual
    concerned.    The  examination  may  result  in  a  decision  that  the
    individual is fit for service in the military.  Alternatively,  it  may
    result in a temporary deferment of military  service,  pending  medical
    treatment, or a finding that  the  individual  is  unfit  for  military
    service in peacetime, but in  wartime,  may  be  placed  on  restricted
    duties.  At the other end of the spectrum, there is the possibility  of
    a decision that the individual is unfit for military service and  shall
    be excluded from registration.  The article also  makes  provision  for
    what appears to be a  special  subset  of  registration  applicable  to
    servicemen "previously convicted to imprisonment, restraint of liberty,
    arrest, correctional labour for committing a crime of small  or  medium
    gravity, including with release from  serving  a  sentence".   Finally,
    there is the possibility of what appears to be permanent exclusion from
    military registration on the grounds that the individual concerned  had
    previously been sentenced to imprisonment for a serious or particularly
    serious crime.

286. It is possible to defer military service as a conscript on  grounds  of
    ill health, under Article 14 of the 1992 law, or on one  of  the  bases
    set out in Article 17 of the 1992 law.  Whether those exceptions  would
    be available as a fact-specific question.

Part H: Country guidance: conscripts and mobilised reservists

287. In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  we  give  the  following  country
    guidance:

        a. The Ukrainian military relies upon professional soldiers in  its
           conflict with Russia-backed armed groups  in  the  east  of  the
           country, in  the  Anti-Terrorist  Operation  zone  ("the  ATO").
           Forced conscripts or mobilised reservists are not sent to  serve
           in the Anti-Terrorist Operation zone ("the  ATO")  and  play  no
           part in the conflict there.  It is not  reasonably  likely  that
           conscripts  or  mobilised  reservists  would  provide   indirect
           support to the Ukrainian military effort in the ATO, for example
           through working in an arsenal.

        b. It remains the case  that,  at  the  current  time,  it  is  not
           reasonably likely that a draft evader avoiding  conscription  or
           mobilisation in Ukraine would face  criminal  or  administrative
           proceedings for that act.  The guidance given by VB and  Another
           (draft evaders and prison conditions)  Ukraine  CG  [2017]  UKUT
           00079 (IAC) remains in force.

        c. Although the Ukrainian criminal code provides  at  Articles  335
           and  336  respectively  for  sentences   of   imprisonment   for
           conscripts and reservists who have unlawfully  avoided  military
           service, absent some special factor, it is highly unlikely  that
           a person convicted of such an offence will  be  sentenced  to  a
           period of imprisonment.

        d. It is  not  reasonably  likely  that  conscripts  and  mobilised
           reservists who have avoided military service would be identified
           as such at the border.  Where a person has  been  convicted  and
           sentenced in absentia, the guidance given in VB concerning their
           likely treatment at the border remains applicable.


        e. It is possible to defer military service as a conscript on
           grounds of ill health, under Article 14 of the 1992 law, or on
           one of the bases set out in Article 17 of the 1992 law.  Whether
           those exceptions would be available as a fact-specific question.

        f. There is no evidence that it is reasonably likely  that  the  ID
           card system introduced in 2016 will lead to an increased risk in
           a draft evader or mobilised reservist being prosecuted.


        g. It is highly unlikely that a draft evader would be detained
           pending trial at the border, given that the enforcement focus is
           on fines, rather than custody.

PART H: THE INDIVIDUAL APPEALS

PK

288. PK was born on 31 January 1981.  He and his wife claimed  asylum  on  5
    March 2017, having entered the United Kingdom  clandestinely  in  2013.
    The claim was based, in part, on the risk said to  face  the  appellant
    that his military service would entail acts contrary to the basic rules
    of human conduct.  His claim was refused by the Secretary of State on 5
    September 2017, and he appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  a
    decision promulgated on 25 October 2017, Judge Frankish  dismissed  the
    appeal.  PK appealed to the Upper Tribunal which,  in  a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 2 May 2018, found  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    have made an error of law, and remade the decision  itself,  dismissing
    the appeal.  PK appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal;  the  appeal  was
    allowed: see (PK (Ukraine) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1756).  The court's order set  aside  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in its entirety, including the finding that the decision
    of Judge Frankish involved the making of an error of law.   It  follows
    that our task in relation to the decision of Judge Frankish is first to
    determine whether it involved the making of an  error  of  law,  before
    addressing the issue of whether, and if so how, the decision should  be
    remade, in light of the country guidance we have given above.

289. Judge Frankish found that military conscription papers  had  been  sent
    to the appellant's parents' address in Ukraine on 5 October 2016 and 24
    February 2017.  The judge found that, even though the appellant was  at
    those times older than 27, which had  previously  been  the  upper  age
    limit for conscription, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine had led
    to the draft age being extended to an upper limit of 47.  Although  the
    appellant's brothers had not received conscription  notices,  that  was
    because one had a leg injury and the other was  wheelchair-bound.   The
    judge accepted that PK had previously received call-up papers, but  had
    successfully applied to defer conscription, on the basis of an  illness
    at the time. The judge  also  found  that  the  appellant's  ill-health
    persisted, accepting his evidence  that  he  had  been  diagnosed  with
    cerebral arachnoiditis, and that he had difficulty remembering  things.



290. The judge dealt with the implications of those findings  only  briefly.
    Addressing a submission made by Ms Norman, who also appeared before us,
    that the appellant would be required to engage in acts "contrary to the
    basic rules of human conduct"  as  a  member  of  the  Ukrainian  armed
    forces, the judge listed some of the background materials he  had  been
    invited to consider, although did not engage  with  their  contents  in
    detail.  He  held  that  the  IHL  issue  was  determined  against  the
    appellant by VB.

291. The judge found that PK would likely be dealt with by  way  of  a  fine
    for his draft  evasion.   There  were  no  aggravating  features  which
    militated in favour of a finding that a harsher penalty was  reasonably
    likely.  The appeal was dismissed.

292. It is clear from the approach of the Court of Appeal at [27]  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had  failed  properly  to  consider  the  extensive
    background materials that were before it.  The finding at [29] that  PK
    would not be required to engage in acts contrary to the basic rules  of
    human conduct was  reached  without  sufficient  reasons,  and  without
    having regard to the contents of  the  background  materials  that  the
    tribunal had been invited to consider.  We find that  judge  failed  to
    give  sufficient  reasons  and  failed  to  have  regard  to   relevant
    considerations.

293. The judge also failed to give reasons why he did not consider  that  PK
    would be detained upon his arrival, which was a significant omission in
    light of the findings in VB that those detained in Ukraine  would  face
    treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.   Although  it  was  clear
    that the judge considered that the appellant would not be detained upon
    arrival (as to which, see the judge's discussion at [30]  that  one  of
    the appellants in VB would  have  been  subject  to  lengthy  detention
    pending trial, which was not a factor that applied to PK), he  gave  no
    reasons for that finding.

294. To determine whether the above errors were material,  we  will  address
    the three country guidance questions identified for our resolution.

1.   Whether military service by PK in Ukraine would or might  involve  acts
which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct?

295. We find that it is not reasonably likely that military  service  by  PK
    would entail the commission of or participation in acts contrary to the
    basic rules of human conduct.  While the conflict detention  activities
    of the Ukrainian military in the ATO do, as  a  matter  of  policy  and
    system, entail acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, it is
    not reasonably likely that PK would be sent to  the  ATO  or  otherwise
    involved in such activities.  The army relies on professional  soldiers
    in the conflict in the east of the country.  The  background  materials
    and the evidence of Professor Bowring do not  demonstrate  that  it  is
    reasonably likely that PK's role would involve the commission  of  acts
    contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, or that it is  reasonably
    likely that any tasks that PK would perform would provide indispensable
    support to the preparation or execution of acts contrary to  the  basic
    rules of human conduct.

296. Moreover, we do not consider the  prospect  of  PK  being  required  to
    perform any military service to be reasonably likely.  We have set  out
    below our reasons for rejecting  the  submission  that  Judge  Frankish
    found PK to be a reservist; PK's understanding of that term related  to
    his prior receipt of call-up papers, in relation to which he obtained a
    deferment on medical grounds: see [308]. PK has  never  served  in  the
    military previously, still less is he liable  to  be  called  up  as  a
    mobilised reservist. He is not a reservist.  However, even if he  were,
    he is now aged 39. Professor Bowring accepted under  cross  examination
    that, in view of PK's age, it is unlikely that he would be  called  up.
    PK also experiences a number of medical conditions.

297. In light of our answer to question 1 concerning  PK,  question  2  does
    not need to be addressed.

3. If the answer to issue (2) is "no", whether...

(a) PK, on return to Ukraine, would be subjected to  prosecution  for  draft
evasion?

298. In an unchallenged finding of fact, Judge Frankish found that PK  would
    be prosecuted and fined upon  his  return.   The  prosecution  is  most
    likely to be for the administrative offence of failing to appear in the
    military recruitment office, without good reason, under Article 210  of
    the Code of Administrative Office.  In view  of  PK's  age  and  health
    conditions, we do not consider that it is  reasonably  likely  that  he
    will be prosecuted for breach of Article 335 of the penal code.   He is
    too old for military service, whether as a conscript  or  a  reservist,
    and he has  a  number  of  health  conditions,  as  outlined  by  Judge
    Frankish.  In a further unchallenged finding of  fact  reached  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, Judge  Frankish  noted,  at  [29],  that  "I  have
    accepted that [PK] is not a well man.  There  is  a  strong  likelihood
    that he will not pass a fitness test, still more that he could not play
    a role in direct conflict..."  There was no medical report, so  we  are
    unable to supplement the summary health findings reached by the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

(b) If PK will be  prosecuted,  whether  he  would  receive  any  punishment
following that prosecution, such as, fine, probation, suspended sentence  or
a custodial sentence?

299. For the reasons set out in the preceding  paragraph,  the  most  likely
    punishment that PK would face  would  be  an  administrative  fine  for
    failing to report that the  military  recruitment  office.   The  vast,
    vast, majority of draft evaders are  not  punished  at  all  for  their
    conduct.  The evidence suggests that a sentence of imprisonment is very
    unlikely.  It is not reasonably likely that PK will be imprisoned.

(c) Whether the prospect of that prosecution or punishment means that PK  is
a refugee?

300. PK would receive a modest fine  for  failing  to  report  for  military
    service.  Even had he been required to  perform  military  service,  it
    would not  have  entailed  the  commission  of,  or  the  provision  of
    indispensable support to, the military's commission of acts contrary to
    the basic  rules  of  human  conduct.   There  can,  therefore,  be  no
    Convention nexus on that basis.

301. It was submitted on behalf of PK that, as he is a member  of  the  pro-
    Russian party of the regions, he is ideologically committed  to  defend
    and uphold the rights of ethnic Russians and speakers  of  the  Russian
    language in Ukraine.  Accordingly, PK claims to  have  a  conscientious
    objection to fighting against his own people. We do not  consider  that
    such conscientious objections entitle PK to refugee status. It is  well
    established that there is no general right under international  law  to
    conscientious objection, nor that the convention is  capable  of  being
    engaged on that basis in isolation: see Sepet.  No part of the evidence
    demonstrates that PK would be subject  to  more  severe  punishment  on
    account of his pro-Russian views, nor that he  would  be  targeted  for
    enforcement of his evasion of the draft on a  discriminatory  basis  on
    account of those views. Indeed, his case is that he has previously been
    able to obtain a  legitimate  deferment  of  his  military  service  on
    account of his health conditions.  His  ability  to  have  done  so  is
    entirely inconsistent with the suggestion that he will be targeted in a
    disproportionate or discriminatory manner for holding those views.

302. It follows, therefore, that the prospect of PK's punishment  lacks  the
    necessary Convention nexus in order for  him  to  be  recognised  as  a
    refugee.

303. Drawing the above analysis together, therefore, we find that PK is  not
    entitled to be recognised as a refugee.

304. In contrast to the appellants in VB,  PK  has  not  been  convicted  in
    absentia.  There is no evidential basis to suspect that his status as a
    draft evader makes it reasonably likely that he will be detained at the
    border upon his return, with the effect that his appeal cannot  succeed
    on Article 3 grounds.

305. PK did not seek to rely on Article 8 ECHR.

306. It follows that the decision of Judge  Frankish,  while  involving  the
    making of an error of law, did not involve an error of law such that it
    must be set aside.

307. We dismiss the appeal of PK.

Postscript: PK

308. There had been a suggestion in  cross  examination  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that PK was already a military reservist, which  PK  appeared
    to accept: see [25] of Judge Frankish's decision.  However, he  had  no
    documentation or  even  basic  knowledge  of  what  being  a  reservist
    entailed.  The judge found that PK had  misunderstood  the  concept  of
    being a military reservist, and that he had attributed his  receipt  of
    call-up papers previously to being a reservist: "It  emerged  that  his
    concept of military service was that he had  been  called  up  before",
    wrote the judge in the same paragraph.  His poor memory  explained  the
    answers he gave, and the prior history of being called up added to  the
    plausibility of his claim, found  the  judge.   These  findings,  which
    accept the core narrative of PK's case, have not been  challenged.   It
    follows that PK is a conscript and not a reservist.

OS

309. OS was born in October 1975.  He entered the United Kingdom on a  visit
    visa on 7 November 2014 with his wife and sons, born in June  2012  and
    March 2014.  OS claims to have trained as  a  pilot  cadet  in  Ukraine
    between 1993 and 1997, after which  he  signed  a  five-year  contract,
    serving as a reserve Lieutenant until 1999.  He claims to have left the
    military after 2 years because planes were destroyed, the military  was
    disarmed, and there was little for him to do.  In order  to  break  his
    contract early, he had to acquiesce in being dismissed for  inaptitude.
    He claims that, shortly after arriving in the United  Kingdom,  he  was
    told by his father that he had received a notification  from  the  army
    that he was being sought for active service.  His father's address  was
    visited 10 times, he claimed.  By April 2015, his father was told that,
    if OS did not report for duty, a prosecution file would  be  opened  in
    relation to him.  This threat was made five times  and  accompanied  by
    the threat of five years' imprisonment.

310. OS claimed asylum on 23 March 2015.  The claim was  eventually  refused
    by the respondent on 14 February 2018.  In a decision promulgated on  9
    May 2018, First-tier Tribunal Judge Allen dismissed OS's appeal against
    the refusal.

311. The decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Allen  was  found  to  have
    involved the making of errors of law by a deputy  judge  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The deputy judge found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred by requiring the appellant to have  demonstrated  that  he  would
    either necessarily or be likely to be involved in human  rights  abuses
    or war  crimes,  given  the  then  leading  House  of  Lords  authority
    suggested that the threshold was whether an individual "would or might"
    be involved in such activities.  The judge had failed  to  engage  with
    the extensive background materials  documenting  IHL  breaches  by  the
    Ukrainian military and had not made any findings concerning the Article
    3 risk of detention in  Ukraine.   There  were  no  challenges  by  the
    respondent  to  the  judge's  findings  of  fact  that  supported   the
    appellant's case, and the deputy judge noted at [20]  of  her  decision
    that the judge's credibility findings remained intact.

312. We turn now to remaking the decision in the case of OS.  Again,  we  do
    so through the lens of the country guidance  questions  identified  for
    our consideration.

1.   Whether military service by OS in Ukraine would or might  involve  acts
which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct?

313. The analysis we set out in relation to  PK  at  paragraph  295,  above,
    applies  with  equal  measure  to  OS.   In  summary,  as  a  mobilised
    reservist, OS would not be sent to the ATO.  He would not  be  required
    to engage  in  the  conflict  detention  activities  of  the  Ukrainian
    military.  Any military role he would be required to perform would  not
    entail acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, nor would  he
    provide the required "indispensable support" to the commission of  such
    acts.

314. In his oral evidence, Professor Bowring said that, at 44 years old,  it
    was unlikely that OS would now be required  to  perform  service  as  a
    mobilised reservist in any event.  We agree.

315. In light of our answer to question 1 concerning  OS,  question  2  does
    not need to be addressed.

3. If the answer to issue (2) is "no", whether...

(a) OS, on return to Ukraine, would be subjected to  prosecution  for  draft
evasion?

316. The preserved findings of fact in relation to OS are as  follows.   The
    First-tier Tribunal judge accepted the  appellant's  account  of  being
    told by his father he was wanted for military service [50].  The  judge
    ascribed significance to the fact that he had not heard anything  since
    2015, and there was no indication that he had been  tried  in  absentia
    [51].  The appellant's account of poorly  equipped  military  personnel
    was consistent with the background materials considered  by  the  judge
    [52].  His military record said he had been dismissed  for  inaptitude,
    and the threats of prosecution had not been carried out.  The appellant
    had not been convicted in absentia [61].

317. We find that it is not reasonably likely that OS  would  be  identified
    at the border as a mobilised reservist who had  failed  to  report  for
    duty, in light of the country guidance we  give  above.   We  were  not
    invited  to  consider  additional  evidence  post-dating  the   judge's
    findings that, since 2015, there had been no interest in the appellant;
    there is no evidence of any continued  interest  on  the  part  of  the
    authorities in him.  He has  not  been  prosecuted  or  convicted.   We
    accept, however, the appellant has a profile  which  may  result  in  a
    revival of the interest of the military authorities, in the event  that
    they become aware of his return, given his past  profile  and  military
    service, and the sustained interest of the authorities in 2014 - 15, as
    accepted by  the  judge.   As  OS  explained  at  question  52  of  his
    substantive asylum interview, his father explained  that  he,  OS,  had
    left the country to the military authorities.

(b) If OS will be  prosecuted,  whether  he  would  receive  any  punishment
following that prosecution, such as, fine, probation, suspended sentence  or
a custodial sentence?

318. We accept that if the authorities become aware of OS's  return  to  the
    country, they may resume their enforcement activities.  We  accept  the
    evidence of Professor Bowring at [44.b] of his first  report  that  the
    most likely punishment OS would  face  would  be  a  fine.  At  [44.f],
    Professor Bowring opines that a sentence of imprisonment  is  "possible
    but very unlikely".

 (c) Whether the prospect of that prosecution or punishment  means  that  OS
is a refugee?

319. Our findings in relation to PK at 300, above, apply equally  to  OS  in
    this respect.  The fine that OS would be liable for would not be for  a
    refusal to perform military service that would  or  might  involve  the
    commission of acts contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.  There
    is no evidence that any subsequent prosecution would be targeted  on  a
    discriminatory basis.  We note OS's concerns that he would  be  singled
    out for prosecution as a result of his past work in  Russia,  following
    his dismissal from the Ukrainian military  (see  [14]  of  his  witness
    statement prepared for the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal),
    but find no support for that fear in any of the  background  materials.
    Certainly OS's own  expert,  Professor  Bowring,  was  silent  on  this
    prospect  of  enforcement  activity  targeting   those   with   Russian
    connections.  If OS is prosecuted, it will be because,  as  a  military
    reservist, he failed to answer the mobilisation call.   The  imposition
    of a fine for military desertion is not a  disproportionate  punishment
    in those circumstances.  OS does not meet the definition  of  "refugee"
    and his appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds.

320. It is not reasonably likely that OS will be  subject  to  any  form  of
    detention in connection with the proceedings he fears will  be  brought
    against him.  His appeal therefore also fails on Article 3 grounds.

321. OS did not seek to rely on Article 8 ECHR.

322. We dismiss the appeal of OS on asylum and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

323. We maintain the anonymity orders already in force.

Notice of Decision

Both appeals are dismissed on asylum and human rights grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
