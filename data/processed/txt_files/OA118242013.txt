                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

    1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I will refer to
       the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 28th December 1989.
       She applied for entry clearance to come to the UK as the  spouse  of
       Mr Shamim Chowdhury a British citizen on  28th  January  2013.  This
       application was refused on 24th April 2013  and  she  appealed.  Her
       appeal against the decision was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
       Roopnarine-Davies  in  a  determination  promulgated  on   the   1st
       September 2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Ford on 9th October 2014 on the basis it  was  arguable  that  Judge
       Roopnarine-Davies had erred in law  in  not  applying  post-decision
       evidence correctly to the date of decision and in failing to look at
       whether there  were  factors  which  made  it  unduly  harsh  before
       considering Article 8 ECHR outside of the Immigration Rules.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. Mr Jarvis relied  upon  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  his  skeleton
       argument, and also made oral submissions. In summary he contends  as
       follows.

    6.  Judge Roopnarine-Davies needed to look at the totality of  evidence
       provided by the sponsor with respect to his financial  situation  in
       relation to the six month period prior to application which  started
       on 28th July 2012 and finished on 28th January 2013.

    7. When assessing whether the  financial  documents  submitted  by  the
       appellant met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE it  could  be  seen
       that there was no evidence  before  her  that  in  relation  to  the
       sponsor's employment with Big Saving that money was  paid  into  his
       bank account corresponding to the  amounts  shown  on  the  payslips
       prior to 29th October 2012. Thus evidence of such payments in failed
       for the period 28th July 2012 to 29th October 2012 and the appellant
       could not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  It  was
       also argued that the letters from the employers could not  meet  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules with respect to their content.



    8. Mr Jarvis conceded that he could not show there was a  problem  with
       the appellant's English  certificate  and  so  this  point  was  not
       pursued.

    9. It was also submitted that it was not appropriate for Article 8 ECHR
       to be used to circumvent the  Immigration  Rules  as  there  was  no
       unjustifiably  harsh  outcome   and   there   were   no   compelling
       circumstances relating to why family  life  could  not  continue  in
       Bangladesh.

   10. Mr Bhuiyan accepted, when I put it to him, that the appellant  could
       not show payment in to his bank account of income  from  Big  Saving
       during the period 28th July 2012 and 29th October 2012. He therefore
       conceded that the appellant could not succeed under the  Immigration
       Rules because Appendix FM-SE paragraph  A1  2(c)  made  this  was  a
       mandatory requirement. He therefore accepted that Judge  Roopnarine-
       Davies had erred in law in allowing the appeal on this basis.

   11. I informed the parties that I found that the First-tier Tribunal had
       erred in law for the reasons set out below. The  decision  of  Judge
       Roopnarine-Davies was therefore set aside.

Conclusions - Error of law

   12. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Roopnarine-Davies erred in  law  at
       paragraph 8 of her determination in finding that the  appellant  had
       provided evidence which met all the requirements of the  Immigration
       Rules to come to the UK as a spouse.

   13. The refusal notice set out  that  the  appellant  had  not  met  the
       requirements of the  Appendix  FM-SE.  Judge  Roopnarine-Davies  was
       entitled to take  all  evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant  into
       account but it had to relate  to  the  six  month  period  prior  to
       application.

   14. Mr Jarvis has identified, and Mr Bhuiyan agrees, that there  was  no
       evidence to meet the requirements of Appendix FM-SE paragraph  A1  2
       (c) showing payments in of salary for Big Saving into the  sponsor's
       bank   account   before   Judge   Roopnarine-Davies.     This    was
       understandable as the sponsor was paid in cash and did  not  realise
       this was going to be a necessary requirement at that point  in  time
       to bring his wife to the UK. However the appellant was still  unable
       to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  at  the  time  of
       decision.

   15. As a consequence of the above error of law  Judge  Roopnarine-Davies
       has also erred in law when determining and allowing the appeal under
       Article 8 ECHR, as it could not be said that the decision to  refuse
       entry clearance under the Immigration Rules was  not  in  accordance
       with the law as is done at paragraph 9 of the determination. Clearly
       further reasoning was required given that the  appellant  could  not
       succeed under the Immigration Rules and the decision to  refuse  was
       in accordance with the law.

 Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

   16. Mr Shamim Chowdhury adopted his witness statement and  confirmed  it
       was true and correct to the best of his  knowledge  and  belief.  In
       brief summary the statement says  that  the  appellant  married  the
       sponsor in Bangladesh, and they continue to speak to each other on a
       daily basis via Skype and the telephone. He has two jobs:  one  with
       Big Saving Energy Market and  the  other  with  Jaipur,  and  Indian
       restaurant. He had supplied bank  statements,  payslips,  employment
       contracts, P60s regarding these employments.  He  earned  �7725  per
       annum from Jaipur and �10,920 per annum from Big Saving. In addition
       the sponsor also had income from a  property  he  owned  in  Cardiff
       which paid him �500 a month rent. His wife had passed  the  approved
       English test. He had been living in the UK  since  1997  and  worked
       hard all his life here: he does not want to live in  Bangladesh  due
       to his work and investments in this country. He  does  not  wish  to
       live apart from his wife and cannot visit her as much  as  he  would
       like given his level of earnings.

   17. In cross-examination he added that he accepted his  full  wages  had
       only been paid into his account from Big Saving since  approximately
       28th October 2012. He had had a solicitor in the UK when he made his
       application and his wife had taken advice from the outsourced  agent
       where she made her application in Sylhet Bangladesh.

   18. Mr Jarvis submitted that he relied upon  the  refusal  notice  dated
       24th April 2013 and the reasons in  the  entry  clearance  manager's
       review. The date of the decision remained 24th April 2013 however as
       the ECM review was not a new decision. In order to succeed under the
       Immigration Rules the appellant had to show three types of  evidence
       to corroborate the sponsor's income from UK employment:  six  months
       of wage slips, six months of  bank  statements  showing  money  from
       those wages going into a  bank  account  and  employer  letters.  He
       submitted that the appellant could not show the wages going into the
       bank account for Big Savings  (as  set  out  in  the  error  of  law
       decision). He also submitted that the  letters  from  the  employers
       also did not meet all the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  as
       they did not specify the amount of pay  given  over  the  six  month
       period in accordance with Appendix FM-SE paragraph A1 2 (b)(iii)  in
       respect of the work for Jaipur Restaurant.

   19. I asked Mr Jarvis to consider whether the income  from  the  sponsor
       renting his property  in  Cardiff  could  be  used  instead  of  the
       employed income from Big Savings. We identified that Appendix  FM-SE
       paragraph 2A 10 (a) sets out  the  documentation  required  to  show
       rental income.  At  paragraph  2A  10  (a)(ii)  12  months  of  bank
       statements were required  for  the  period  prior  to  the  date  of
       application (i.e. January 2012 to January 2013) showing  payment  in
       of the rental income. The appellant had not included bank statements
       for this entire period so could not rely upon his rental  income  to
       succeed under the Immigration Rules.

   20. Mr Jarvis submitted that I could not allow the appeal outside of the
       Immigration Rules under Article 8 ECHR as there was no  good  reason
       to consider the matter beyond the Immigration Rules. It was conceded
       by the respondent that the appellant  and  sponsor  had  a  genuine,
       subsisting marriage and intended to  live  together  permanently  as
       husband and  wife.  There  would  be  some  cost  in  making  a  new
       application but this was required so that  the  Secretary  of  State
       could be absolutely sure that the  sponsor  was  in  a  position  to
       support the appellant financially in the UK. Due to the lack of  the
       specified documentary evidence the sponsor had failed to show  this.
       The Rules at Appendix FM-SE are very detailed  but  ultimately  they
       are also very clear. He did not  pursue  any  issue  of  failure  to
       comply with the requirements with respect to  the  English  language
       certificate, although it may be that  the  entry  clearance  officer
       might raise further issues about this if the appeal was allowed.

   21. Mr Bhuiyan pointed out that the appellant had taken  a  new  English
       language test due to a request from the entry clearance officer  and
       it had been accepted  by  the  respondent  at  paragraph  3  of  the
       determination of the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant met this
       requirement. He accepted that whilst the sponsor did earn  over  the
       amount set by the Immigration Rules that he had not produced all the
       documents  required  by  the  Immigration  Rules  to   support   the
       appellant's  application  and  appeal.  However  the  appellant  had
       supplied additional documents not required by the Immigration  Rules
       such as P60s so I should find that the sponsor did earn over �18,600
       to the standard of proof I must assess this factor, i.e. the balance
       of  probabilities.  This  was  a  matter  that  should  properly  be
       considered in relation to the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

   22. It would be wrong to expect the appellant and Mr Chowdhury  to  have
       their family life in Bangladesh. Mr Chowdhury had lived  in  the  UK
       for 17 years; he is a British citizen;  he  had  two  jobs  in  this
       country; he owns a property in the UK; he is of good  character  and
       at his age (43 years) it would be unduly harsh  to  require  him  to
       relocate to Bangladesh.

   23. It would  also  wrong  to  require  the  appellant  to  make  a  new
       application. It would cost a further large fee; it might be  refused
       again; it would take two or three months to be  processed  and  this
       application had been going on now for nearly two years.

   24. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions - Remaking

   25. The appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
       with respect to showing payments in of wages from  his  job  at  Big
       Saving into his bank account for the full six month  requirement  as
       set out under Appendix FM-SE at paragraph A1 2 (c). The  application
       also fails under the Immigration Rules as before me there  were  not
       bank statements showing payment in of  rent  for  the  twelve  month
       period from the sponsor's rental property, which could  comply  with
       Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2A 10 (a)(ii). I  do  not  agree  that  the
       letter of employment from Jaipur failed to meet the requirements  of
       paragraph A1 2 (b)(iii) of Appendix FM-SE. The  salary  paid  during
       the period relevant to the application was specified in the letter.

   26. As a result the  sponsor  had  only  shown  sufficient  evidence  in
       accordance with Appendix FM to verify his  employment  with  Jaipur,
       and thus to show a gross salary of �7725. Even if  he  had  produced
       his bank statements for the full twelve month period for his  rental
       income (which he did not give any reasons  why  he  could  not  have
       done) this would only have evidence income of �440 per month (as per
       bank statements for the relevant period which were before me)  or  a
       further �5280, and thus this would not have  brought  the  sponsor's
       gross annual income to �18,600 as required by Appendix  FM.  It  was
       clear at the time  of  application  the  appellant  could  not  have
       produced the necessary six months of bank statements showing payment
       in of income for his work for Big  Saving  Energy  Market  prior  to
       October 2012 as he had not paid his cash wages into his bank account
       in total each month before this time.

   27. Mr Jarvis argues I am not permitted to go on and consider the matter
       in accordance with  Article  8  ECHR  at  large.  He  says  that  in
       accordance with Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules -  correct  approach)
       [2013] UKUT 00640 I should not go  on  to  examine  Article  8  ECHR
       unless there are arguably good grounds for granting leave outside of
       the Rules. I do not accept that this is what Gulshan means.  I  find
       that it is appropriate to conduct an Article 8 ECHR analysis outside
       of the Immigration Rules in this case. As was said in MM (Lebanon) v
       SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985  at  paragraph  128:  "I  cannot  see  much
       utility  in  imposing  this  further,  intermediary  test.  If   the
       applicant cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or there  is
       not a further Article 8 claim. That will have to  be  determined  by
       the relevant decision-maker."

   28. I find that the correct approach in the circumstances of  this  case
       where the appellant could not succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules
       relating to marriage as set out at Appendix FM due to the manner  of
       his payment for his work and his perfectly lawful  practice  of  not
       paying all of his funds in to his bank account  on  payment  of  his
       cash salary for the full period  prior  to  his  application  is  to
       conduct a full fact specific analysis under Article 8 ECHR.

   29. It is accepted by me and all parties that the appellant is  lawfully
       married to the sponsor, and that they have a genuine and  subsisting
       marriage and intended to live together permanently. Refusal of entry
       clearance significantly interferes with the their family life as the
       sponsor is working full time in the UK and does not have the time or
       funds to visit his spouse as much as he  would  like.  Although  the
       appellant and sponsor are in daily contact via Skype  and  telephone
       this  is  clearly  not  sufficient  to  maintain  a   full   married
       relationship.

   30. I note what was said by the Supreme Court in  Quila  v  SSHD  [2011]
       UKSC 45 by Lord Wilson at paragraph 43 about not following  the  old
       authority of Abdulaziz v UK 7 EHRR  471,  and  that  issues  of  the
       possible reasonableness of family  life  being  exercised  elsewhere
       should be dealt with in consideration of  whether  the  decision  to
       refuse  entry  clearance  is  justified.  The  Supreme  Court   also
       clarified that no difference should be made between family  life  in
       an entry case as opposed to an  expulsion  case,  as  there  was  no
       different standard in relation to positive or negative obligations.

   31. The refusal of entry clearance is in accordance with the law as  the
       appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules  as  detailed  above.
       The respondent  justifies  the  interference  with  the  appellant's
       private life in the interests of the maintenance of  economic  order
       by applying a consistent system of immigration control. The evidence
       before me shows the appellant has no criminal record and is of  good
       character.

   32. I have finally to consider whether the significant interference with
       the appellant's family life rights that refusal of  entry  clearance
       represents is justified as proportionate, and a fair balance between
       the competing considerations of the appellant's family life and  the
       respondent's  desire  to  maintain  economic  order  by  applying  a
       consistent system of immigration control.

   33. In favour of the respondent is the fact that weight must be given to
       the refusal under the Immigration Rules as special consideration has
       been given to making these compliant with the UK's obligations under
       Article 8 ECHR. I also note that a narrow failure to meet the Rules,
       in this case by virtue of having insufficient documentation, is  not
       to be seen as a matter which can be  cured  in  an  Article  8  ECHR
       balancing exercise, see Patel and others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC  72.  I
       therefore give no weight to any argument that a near miss under  the
       Immigration Rules assists the appellant to succeed in this balancing
       exercise. In this case I also consider the fact that the sponsor  is
       of Bangladeshi origin and speaks the language of that  country,  and
       so would find relocation to  Bangladesh  easier  by  reason  of  his
       background, as a matter supportive of the respondent's decision.

   34. When considering the public  interest  s.117A  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 requires me to have  regard  to  the
       factors at s.117B of that Act. I take consideration of the fact that
       effective immigration control is in the public interest.

   35. I also note that it is in the public interest that  persons  seeking
       to enter the  UK  should  speak  English  and  the  fact  that  this
       appellant has shown her ability to do this through provision of ESOL
       A1 certificates from City & Guilds which show she has passed  spoken
       and listening tests.  The  appellant  was  asked  to  re-take  these
       qualifications by the entry clearance post in May 2014 as  a  result
       of some problems with City & Guilds prior to that time, and duly did
       so in June 2014 again obtaining pass results.

   36. I also note the public interest in the appellant  being  financially
       independent. I am satisfied that the appellant  can  show  that  she
       will be financially independent and not a burden on taxpayers at the
       date of decision. The sponsor has satisfied me that at the  date  of
       decision he had a gross income of  �10,916  from  his  work  at  Big
       Saving Energy Market. He has provided a  P60  for  the  year  ending
       April 2013 showing this to be  his  gross  annual  salary,  he  also
       provided six months of payslips to the entry clearance officer  some
       of which were also before me, I have seen his contract of employment
       and it is accepted that he provided  4  months  of  bank  statements
       showing his income entering his personal bank account with  Barclays
       directly prior to the decision.

   37. I am also satisfied that the sponsor earned a gross amount of  �5280
       from rental income for his  property  in  Cardiff  at  the  time  of
       decision: in support of this I  have  seen  six  payments  into  his
       Barclays bank account from his managing  agent  in  the  six  months
       prior to the decision, the title deeds for  the  property,  and  the
       terms of letting from his managing agent Mr Homes.

   38. I am also satisfied that the sponsor earned a gross amount of  �9094
       from his employment with Jaipur restaurant at the time of  decision.
       In support of this I have seen his P60 for  the  year  ending  April
       2013 giving this as his gross annual income, I have  also  seen  his
       statement of terms and conditions for  his  employment  with  Jaipur
       Restaurant,  a  letter  relating  to  his  employment  with   Jaipur
       Restaurant, and the respondent is satisfied that there are  payments
       in of salary for the six months prior to the date of  decision  into
       his Barclays bank  account  and  has  seen  his  payslips  for  this
       employment some of which were also before me.

   39. The appellant may not have met the precise requirements of  Appendix
       FM but I must assess whether  I  am  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
       probabilities that the sponsor  is  working  and  earning  money  by
       renting a property  as  he  claims  so  as  to  assess  whether  the
       appellant will be financially independent in accordance with  s.117B
       of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. I am more  than
       satisfied that the total gross income of the sponsor was �25,290  at
       the time  of  decision  given  the  documentation  set  out  in  the
       paragraph above. I find that this means the sponsor could  show  she
       would be financially independent.

   40. In favour of the appellant is the fact that the  sponsor  cannot  be
       reasonably be expected to relocate to Bangladesh by  virtue  of  his
       British citizenship which he has held since 2009. In Sanade & Others
       (British Children -Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT 48 at point  5  of
       the head note it says as follows:  "Case C-34/09 Ruiz  Zambrano  now
       makes it clear that where the child or indeed the  remaining  spouse
       is a British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European  Union,
       as a matter of EU law it is not possible to require the family as  a
       unit to relocate outside of the European Union or for the  Secretary
       of State to submit that it would be reasonable for them to  do  so."
       Further as Blake J said in MM, agreeing with  Sedley  LJ:  "in  the
       generality of ordinary cases, the abandonment of the citizen's right
       of residence in order to enjoy family life with his or her spouse is
       an unacceptable choice, and a disproportionately high price  to  pay
       for choosing a  foreign  spouse  in  an  increasingly  international
       world."  This appellant has lived in the UK  for  17  years;  has  a
       property he owns in this country; has two employed jobs and  thus  I
       find has an extensive private life in the UK.

   41. Ultimately I find that it would not be proportionate under Article 8
       ECHR for the appellant to be refused  entry  clearance  despite  the
       weight to be given the public interest in immigration control  given
       the strength of her  family  life  with  the  sponsor;  her  English
       language skills; the financial and accommodation provision available
       to her in the UK and the sponsor's citizenship and private life ties
       to the UK.

   42. I do not find the possibility of a further application (which may or
       may not be successful - it is clearly not for me to speculate on the
       outcome  of  any  such  application)  under  the  Immigration  Rules
       relevant to this exercise. This  appellant  has  complied  with  the
       procedure laid down to enter the UK and applied for entry  clearance
       abroad. I must assess and decide whether refusal of entry  clearance
       was a breach of Article 8 ECHR at the date of decision  and  this  I
       have done.

Decision

   43. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   44. The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set-aside  with  no
       findings preserved.

   45. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  re-made  dismissing  the
       appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowing it under  Article  8
       ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award. I have decided to make  no  fee  award
for the following reasons. The appeal was allowed on the basis  of  evidence
which was produced during the appeal process. I was not asked  to  make,  or
given any reasons to make, a fee award by the appellant's representative.
