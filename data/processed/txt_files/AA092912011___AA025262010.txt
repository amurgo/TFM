                            DECISION AND REASONS


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008


 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This is the remaking of  the  Appellants'  appeals  on  protection  and
    Article 8 ECHR  grounds.   The  matter  comes  back  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal following remittal by the Court of Appeal in an order dated 16
    October 2014.  The specific direction in  the  order  states  that  the
    remaking should deal with the "following discreet issues";

         "A.  The safety and reasonableness of internal relocation: and

           B. The impact of the respondent's accepted failure to  trace  the
             appellants' families when they were minors, and the consequent
             benefit the appellants should  receive  under  the  corrective
             injustice principle.  This will necessarily include an  up-to-
             date consideration of the Article 8 right of the appellants."

 3. The order from the Court of Appeal was accompanied by  a  Statement  of
    Reasons.  This reads as follows:

         "1.  In summary  the  Appellants,  Afghan  nationals  and  paternal
             cousins, arrived in the UK as  minors.   They  claimed  asylum
             which was refused, although they  were  granted  discretionary
             leave to remain as  minors,  and  they  appealed  against  the
             refusal of  their  asylum  claims  by  the  Respondent.   They
             averred that they would face a real risk of  serious  harm  in
             Afghanistan from the Taliban due to  their  imputed  political
             opinion (i.e. their  fathers  administered  and  taught  in  a
             school in  Baghlan  province,  and  taught  girls,  and  their
             families had been threatened  and  persecuted  on  that  basis
             including  the  kidnap  of  the  Appellants'  brother/cousin).
             Furthermore, they averred that  there  is  no  sufficiency  of
             protection or safe part of the country (and which would not be
             unduly harsh) to which they could internally relocate.

          2. The Appellants' appeals were each dismissed by a panel of  the
             First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)   in
             determinations  dated  24  February  2012  and  3  June  2010,
             respectively.  The Appellants applied  for  and  were  granted
             permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
             Asylum Chamber) and ultimately the  Upper  Tribunal  found  an
             error of law such that their cases were linked and reheard  in
             the Upper Tribunal.  Positive  findings  from  the  First-tier
             Tribunal's assessment with regard to risk in their  home  area
             were preserved) (�16 of the Upper Tribunal determination).

          3. In a determination promulgated on 13 March 2013 Upper Tribunal
             Judge Hanson found that the Appellants would be at  real  risk
             of serious harm at the hands of the Taliban if  they  returned
             to their home area (�48) and 'that there was no sufficiency of
             protection from the authorities (�48).'  These  findings  must
             be preserved for any future hearing.

          4. However, Judge Hanson then went on to  consider  whether  they
             could safely and reasonably be expected to relocate to  Kabul,
             found that they could and  dismissed  their  appeals  on  that
             basis.

          5. On the issue of internal relocation, the UT did not  expressly
             refer to the leading authorities (Januzi and AH Sudan) and  at
             various points did not  distinguish  between  the  appropriate
             test for relocation, and the separate  issue  of  whether  the
             Appellants would face a risk of treatment in Kabul contrary to
             Article 3 ECHR.  The Respondent acknowledges  (a)  that  there
             are two  significant  passages  in  which  the  UT  makes  key
             findings where the issues are not properly distinguished (�59,
             �63), and (b) that it can be properly said that by  virtue  of
             not considering the proper test throughout the  UT  failed  to
             give  attention  to   the   individual   characteristics   and
             background of each Appellant (see Lord Bingham in AH Sudan  at
             �5).

          6. The approach of the UT was to consider  that  the  Appellants'
             position was no different from any other young  man  going  to
             live in Kabul (�57, 59, 61), without considering  sufficiently
             the individual position of the Appellants  and  in  particular
             the fact that the  Appellants'  family  had  been  subject  of
             persecution, their brother/cousin kidnapped and that they  had
             no contact with any family  members.   The  Respondent  agrees
             that had the UT considered their particular circumstances  and
             the  expert  reports,  it  might  have  reached  a   different
             conclusion on the issue of undue harshness and reasonableness.

          7. The Respondent agrees that the UT's approach to  the  question
             of affordable housing is also open to criticism (�54)  on  the
             basis that the UT concluded that housing  would  be  available
             merely because there had been a  fall  in  rental  costs  from
             their previously very high level, without  addressing  whether
             the fall in  rental  costs  was  sufficient  to  enable  these
             Appellants to find somewhere to live.

          8. The Respondent also accepts that the UT did not  give  any/any
             adequate reasons why it did not  accept  the  expert  evidence
             called on behalf of the Appellants as to the risk  that  their
             presence  might  come  to  the  attention  of   the   Taliban,
             especially considering the preserved findings  in  this  case.
             It is accepted that the expert Mr Marsden in his report  found
             that  it  is  'highly  likely'  that  'information   on   [the
             Appellants'] family history would reach the network of Taliban
             informants   in   Kabul,   particularly   in   the    southern
             neighbourhoods  of  the  capital  where  they  have  a  strong
             presence.  It would not be difficult, in such a situation, for
             the Taliban to kill or abduct them, or forcibly recruit  them.
             At the very least, I would expect them to be at high  risk  of
             being abducted and taken in for questioning  by  the  Taliban.
             Once held by the Taliban, they would be particularly at risk.'
              He further finds: 'I would therefore expect [the  Appellants]
             to face a greater level of risk  of  targeted  action  by  the
             Taliban,  if  they  were  living  in  one   of   the   Pushtun
             neighbourhoods of southern Kabul, than an  individual  who  is
             not perceived as collaborating, either directly or through his
             or her family, with international military presence and within
             the  Government  of  President  Karzai.'    Furthermore,   the
             Respondent accepts that the UT does not give any/any  adequate
             reasons for not accepting the expert evidence that there would
             be no sufficiency of protection against the Taliban  in  Kabul
             from either the Afghan National Police  or  the  International
             Security Force (ISAF).

          9. Furthermore the UT's treatment of  the  issue  of  tracing  is
             incomplete in  the  UT's  determination  (�71  appears  to  be
             missing the whole or part of a sentence) and no clear  finding
             was made on whether the Appellants were in contact with  their
             family, which was denied (�38) and which appears to have  been
             implicitly accepted at (�70).  The Respondent also accepts  as
             per AA (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department,
             [2008] EWCA Civ 579 that the absence  of  evidence  cannot  be
             used to justify a positive finding  (i.e.  that  there  is  no
             evidence to  show  that  the  mine-clearing  uncle  could  not
             provide assistance and as such there are family in Afghanistan
             - (�71).  However, the UT did accept that  if  the  Respondent
             had undertaken to trace the Appellant's family when they  were
             minors this may have made a material difference to the outcome
             of  their  asylum  claims  (�71).   For  these   reasons   the
             Respondent also accepts that the UT erred in law in a material
             way in considering whether the Appellants could  benefit  from
             the corrective injustice principle  and  this  aspect  of  the
             determination will have to be remade.

         10. The Respondent accepts that the matter should be  remitted  to
             the UT to reconsider the issue of internal relocation and  the
             tracing point, which will necessarily include a  consideration
             of Article 8 up to the date of the new hearing.  The  findings
             of risk on return  to  the  home  area  and  insufficiency  of
             protection there are preserved (�48)."

 3. The Statement of Reasons  sets  out  the  details  of  the  Appellants'
    protection claims and the history of their appeals such  that  more  is
    not necessary here. The finding from [48]  of  the  decision  of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Hanson promulgated on 26 February 2013 is as follows:

         "Based on the country expert's  report  and  the  profile  of  this
         family, who appear to be relatively well off but to  have  come  to
         the adverse attention of the Taliban  as  a  result  of  which  the
         appellants were sent to the United Kingdom, I find it proved to the
         lower standard applicable to this appeal that if returned to  their
         home area there is a real risk  that  whilst  making  enquiries  to
         locate family members their  presence  will  become  known  to  the
         Taliban who would perceive them as targets.  The  country  material
         makes it clear that should this happen they (sic) is no sufficiency
         of protection from the  authorities  in  Kabul.   It  is  therefore
         necessary to consider whether, if neither Appellant can  return  to
         their home area, there is an internal  flight  alternative  to  any
         other part of Afghanistan."

 4.  The  submission  for  the  Appellants   before   me   was   relatively
    straightforward given the preserved findings and the country  evidence.
    The material on Afghanistan and threats from the Taliban  in  Kabul  in
    particular showed that the situation for an individual with the profile
    of the Appellant's had become more difficult even than that  identified
    in the reports of Dr Marsden. He  has  retired  but  provided  a  brief
    comment dated 3 March 2016 ([92] of the Appellants' bundle (AB)) to the
    effect that he considered that the  high  risk  of  identification  and
    mistreatment by the Taliban in Kabul remained  the  same.  The  country
    evidence at [403] onwards showed that the situation in Kabul for  these
    Appellants deteriorated in  2015  and  2016  after  the  withdrawal  of
    international forces and upsurge in  Taliban  activity.  The  materials
    included numerous reports from 2015 and 2016  showing  an  increase  in
    violent attacks by the Taliban  in  Kabul.  The  reports  from  Amnesty
    International [405 AB], Human Rights Watch [424 AB], UNHCR [414 AB] and
    other sources [416, 422, 428, 431, 435 and 439 AB] confirmed  that  the
    last year has seen a notable escalation of civilian casualties and that
    the Taliban were a major source of those attacks, potentially  as  much
    as 60% or higher.

 5. The evidence before me was therefore that the Appellants  face  a  real
    risk of serious harm in their home area and in Kabul from  the  Taliban
    and that there is no sufficient protection for them.  The risk of  harm
    arises from their imputed political or religious opinions as members of
    a family perceived to be liberal or against the political or  religious
    tenets of the Taliban. The Appellants have therefore  shown  that  they
    are refugees and also entitled to protection under Article 3 ECHR.

Notice of Decision

 6. The appeal is remade as allowed on asylum and Article 3 ECHR grounds.
