                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant, a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  28
    May 1980, against the decision of the Respondent dated 12 June 2013  to
    refuse to him the issue of a residence card as confirmation of a  right
    of residence under European Community law  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    national  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United   Kingdom.    The
    application was refused because it  was  said  that  "your  EEA  family
    member has failed to provide evidence that they are a qualified  person
    as set out in Regulation 6 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006".



2.   The Appellant's appeal against that  decision  was  determined  at  his
    request on the papers at Taylor  House  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Wellesley-Cole who in a determination promulgated on 13  November  2013
    dismissed the appeal.  The First-tier Judge was not satisfied that  the
    Appellant or his sponsoring wife had:

         "... made out that there is adequate evidence of  current  economic
         activity so  as  to  meet  the  requirements  of  Regulation  6  of
         Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  Regulation 6 states that to be
         a qualified person means one has to be an EEA national in the UK as
         a job seeker, worker, self-employed person, self-sufficient one  or
         a student.  I conclude that he has failed to provide evidence as an
         EEA  Sponsor  his  wife  is  exercising  treaty  rights  and  as  a
         consequence the appeal therefore does not  succeed  for  the  above
         cited reasons".


3.    Those  "cited  reasons"  included  at  paragraph  7  of  the   judge's
    determination the following:

         "the gist of the refusal was that the document submitted  with  the
         application did not demonstrate economic activity so as to  satisfy
         the Secretary of State that the Portuguese wife  of  this  Nigerian
         Appellant was actually currently working.  As a consequence, I have
         had particular regard to the  tax  document,  bank  statements  and
         employment letters in the indexed bundle referred to in the body of
         this  determination.   The  Dunmade  Associates  Certified   Public
         Accountants' letter of 20 June in the penultimate paragraph confirm
         she is registered with Revenue and Customs for tax and NI  purposes
         and has complied fully within the necessary regulations relating to
         the establishment of a business.  That  letter  does  not  actually
         confirm she is working.  But the accounts for the tax  year  ending
         in April 2012 prepared by the same solicitors give a net profit  of
         �7,733, with an income of �11,776.  The HMRC  letter  of  31  March
         2012 last year refers to a payment due of �87.50 which they  expect
         to receive no later than 31 July 2012.  Such a low  payment  due  I
         find is not tantamount to economic activity so as to satisfy me, on
         balance, in  the  absence  of  further  documentation,  she  is  in
         employment.   The  accounts  were  prepared   by   solicitors   not
         accountants and are self-serving and as such I place limited weight
         on them, in relation to the �7,733 net profit". (Emphasis added).


4.   The Appellant successfully obtained permission to appeal that  decision
    and in granting such permission on 14 January 2014 First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Andrew had this inter alia to say:

         "This was a paper determination.  The sole issue in the appeal  was
         whether the Appellant's spouse was exercising treaty rights.


         It is arguable that in her determination, the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge incorrectly referred to  the  accounts  for  the  Appellant's
         spouse's business as having been prepared by  a  solicitor  and  as
         such, placed limited  weight  on  the  same  (paragraph  7  of  the
         determination).


         Further, it is arguable there is reference in the determination  to
         the Appellant's spouse working as the Appellant's case is that  she
         is self-employed.


         Accordingly I find that there is an arguable error of law".


5.   Thus the appeal came before me on 12 March 2014, where  my  first  task
    was to  decide  whether  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on  a  point  of  law  such  as  may  have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

6.   Immediately before the hearing, the Tribunal received from what  I  now
    best describe as the Appellant's former solicitors, Messrs Chancery  CS
    Solicitors, a letter dated 11 March 2014 as follows:

         "We write to inform the court that we are not able  to  attend  the
         hearing fixed for 12 March 2014 as our client could not put  us  in
         funds.


         Therefore, it is our client's  instructions  that  this  matter  be
         dealt with on papers as already indicated on the notice  of  appeal
         form".


7.   In those circumstances Mr Melvin who appeared before me  on  behalf  of
    the Respondent agreed there was no reason why I should not proceed with
    the hearing  of  the  appeal  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 38 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

8.   Most helpfully and in my  view  realistically,  Mr  Melvin  immediately
    informed me that he accepted that the judge's mistaken conclusion  that
    the  sponsoring  wife's  account  "were  prepared  by  solicitors   not
    accountants" and were therefore "self-serving" and that  as  such,  the
    judge placed "limited weight on them in  relation  to  the  �7,733  net
    profit" was a material error of law and had "led to unfairness".

9.   Mr Melvin continued:

         "Whilst the Appellant has been content to have  the  error  of  law
         hearing determined on the papers, that in my  view  still  requires
         the appeal as  a  whole,  to  be  determined  afresh  and  I  would
         therefore ask that the  appropriate  course  in  the  interests  of
         justice is for this matter to be remitted for fresh hearing to  the
         First-tier Tribunal even if  in  the  event,  the  Appellant  still
         decides that the appeal be determined on the papers."


10.  Mr Melvin continued that there was still an issue to be decided  as  to
    whether the Sponsor's accounts were properly understood and that as the
    sole issue to be determined was  whether  the  Appellant's  spouse  was
    exercising treaty  rights  at  the  material  time,  this  necessitated
    careful understanding.

11.  I found myself in agreement with Mr Melvin's proposal.   However  as  I
    observed to him, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  oversight  may  well
    have been allayed had the Appellant chosen  to  avail  himself  of  the
    opportunity to give oral evidence on his behalf. Whether the  Appellant
    sought to avail himself of that opportunity  at  the  remitted  hearing
    would be a matter for him.

12.  In consequence of my findings,  it  follows  that  there  has  been  no
    satisfactory hearing of the substance  of  this  appeal  at  all.   The
    scheme of the Tribunal's Courts Enforcement Act 2007  does  not  assign
    the function of primary fact finding to the Upper  Tribunal.   In  such
    circumstances Section 12(2) of the TCEA 2007 requires us to  remit  the
    case to the First-tier or remake it ourselves.  For the above  reasons,
    I have concluded that the decision should be remitted to  a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  Wellesley-Cole  to
    determine the appeal afresh with all issues at large at  Taylor  House.
    I am satisfied there are  highly  compelling  factors,  falling  within
    paragraph 7.2(b) of the Senior Presidents Practice  Statement  decision
    that the decision should not be remade by the Upper  Tribunal.   It  is
    clearly in the interests of justice, that the appeal of  the  Appellant
    be heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

13.  For that purpose it would seem to me that a time  estimate  of  one  to
    one and a half hours would be appropriate.  In the event that there  is
    to be an oral hearing, it will be for the Appellant to notify the First-
    tier Tribunal in good time should an interpreter is required.  It  will
    be a matter for the administration at Taylor House to find  a  suitable
    date for the hearing of the remitted appeal upon  which  the  Appellant
    will be advised.  It is however incumbent on the Appellant upon receipt
    of the  appropriate  Notice  of  Hearing,  to  immediately  advise  the
    Tribunal at Taylor House if he continues to require his  appeal  to  be
    determined on the papers or seeks an oral hearing.

DECISION

14.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that their  decision  in  the
    present appeal should be set aside.  I remit the remaking of the appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House to be heard before a  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wellesley-
    Cole.

15.  I note that no anonymity direction has been made.
