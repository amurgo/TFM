                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Courtney promulgated on 1st October 2014, following  the  hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 8th September 2014.  In the determination, the judge
    dismissed the appeals on the basis that there  were  no  valid  appeals
    before her.  The Appellants subsequently applied for, and were  granted
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are all citizens of Bangladesh.  The principal Appellant
    is Mr Md Anwaruzzaman.  He was born on 31st January 1969.  His wife  is
    the second Appellant, Shanjida Anwar, and she was born  on  5th  August
    1975.  Their first child is Miss Tasnia Zaman, and she was born on  6th
    July 2002.  Their second child is the fourth Appellant, Master Mohammad
    Zaman, and he was born on  11th  August  2011  in  London.   The  first
    Appellant entered the UK  on  7th  January  2006  with  a  valid  entry
    clearance certificate as a student until  1st  January  2008.   He  was
    granted successive extensions of leave to remain until 8th  July  2011.
    On 8th June 2011, he was granted further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier
    (Post-Study) Migrant until 8th June 2013.

 3. On 31st May 2013, the first Appellant applied for an extension of leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and his wife and children,
    the  remaining  Appellants,  applied  for  leave  to  remain   as   his
    dependants.

 4. On 11th June 2013, the Respondent wrote to the principal  Appellant  to
    say that:

         "The specified fee has  not  been  paid  in  connection  with  your
         attempted application which you made by post on 31st May 2013.   We
         do not consider that an exception to the requirement to pay the fee
         applies in this case, and therefore your application is invalid and
         we are returning your documents".

    The letter goes on to explain that, "Although credit/debit card details
    had been provided, the issuing bank rejected the  payment.   There  may
    have been insufficient funds in the account or the details provided did
    not match the information held by the bank" (see  paragraph  3  of  the
    determination).

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge had regard to the Upper Tribunal decision  in  Basnet  [2012]
    UKUT 00113, where the Upper Tribunal said that the question of  whether
    the first application was valid "depends not upon whether  the  payment
    was  successfully  processed,  but  on  whether  the  application   was
    accompanied by the fee" (see paragraph 18 of that determination, as set
    out in paragraph 8 of the original judge's determination).   The  judge
    went on to record that in BE (Application fee: effect  of  non-payment)
    [2008] UKAIT 00089, the Tribunal  had  held  that  an  application  "is
    accompanied by" a fee if it is "accompanied by such  authorisation  (of
    the applicant of other person purporting to pay"  as  will  enable  the
    Respondent to receive the  entire  fee  in  question,  without  further
    recourse having been made by the Respondent to the payer (see paragraph
    8 of the determination).

 6. The judge observed that the evidential burden on demonstrating that the
    application was not "accompanied by such authorisation"  falls  on  the
    Respondent Secretary of State (see Basnet at paragraphs 8 to 27).   The
    judge went on to say that the Respondent's letter of 11th June 2013 did
    not give "any specific evidence for his reason as to why the purchasing
    of the payment had failed" (see paragraph 9).  The judge held  that  it
    was

         "more probable than not that  the  Appellant  is  accurate  in  his
         assertion that he  had  provided  the  correct  billing  data;  the
         Secretary of  State  has  not  adduced  sufficient  information  to
         conclude to the contrary.  She has failed  to  establish  that  the
         billing data was accurately used" (paragraph 9).

    However, the judge then went on to say that this was not the end of the
    matter because "it is incumbent on Mr Anwaruzzaman  to  show  that  the
    bank would have paid the UKBA ......without further recourse being made
    to the account holder" (paragraph  9).   Sufficient  funds  had  to  be
    available at the time of the request.

 7. At the hearing before Judge Courtney, Mr Hussain, appearing as  Counsel
    on behalf of the Appellant, submitted that the principal Appellant  had
    paid the amount of �1,051, which was sufficient for him, but  that  the
    "Respondent did not mention exactly  on  what  date  she  attempted  to
    collect the fees although the burden was  upon  herself  to  give  this
    information together with the reasons as  per  the  Basnet  directions"
    (see paragraph 10).   Mr  Hussain  submitted  that  this  was  relevant
    because from 3rd June 2013,  the  principal  Appellant  had  sufficient
    money for his own application (see paragraph 10).

 8. The judge went on to  observe  that  the  bank  statement  showed  that
    between 31st May and 11th June 2013 Mr Anwaruzzaman had  a  balance  of
    between �1,364.65 and �1,042.65 in his Bank  of  Baroda  account.   The
    lowest figures spanned the period from  the  date  of  the  application
    until 3rd June 2013, when �200 was transferred into the account.

 9. The judge observed that "there has been no indication  that  there  was
    any overdraft facility in place on the account"  (paragraph  11).   The
    Administrative Court in Baldwin [2014] EWHC 1604 had held that:

         "The question of  the  validity  crystallises  at  the  moment  the
         request for payment from the payment card was made.   It  does  not
         matter if there are or are not adequate funds before or after  that
         time.  It was incumbent upon the applicant  to  ensure  that  there
         were sufficient funds in the account for the  period  from  posting
         the application ..." (see paragraph 12 of the determination).

10. In the event, the judge concluded that the relevant bank statements

         "do not show that Mr Anwaruzzaman's account had sufficient relevant
         funds to meet a call for the specified fee  on  every  day  in  the
         period during which  the  UKBA  could  have  attempted  to  process
         payment.  That is the case even if only his fee of �1,051 was to be
         collected" (paragraph 13).

    Accordingly, the principal Appellant could  not  succeed,  and  neither
    could his dependants.  The appeals were dismissed.  The  dismissal  was
    on the basis that there were no valid appeals before the judge.

Grounds of Application

11. The grounds of application argue that  the  judge  failed  to  properly
    apply the principle in Basnet, and in particular failed  to  apply  the
    proper burden of proof to the Respondent Secretary of State in relation
    to attempts to collect the fee.   On  7th  April  2014,  permission  to
    appeal was granted.

12. On 20th November 2014, a Rule 24 response  was  entered  by  Respondent
    Secretary of State.  This makes the following points.  First, that  the
    Respondent treated the Appellant's application, as one  which  included
    his named dependants as well, and this being so, there were  inadequate
    funds to meet  the  cost  of  the  visas  for  the  Appellant  and  the
    dependants.

13. Given that the Appellant had specified his dependants as named  on  the
    form of the principal Appellant, this was unsurprising, and accordingly
    there would be no valid appeal for either of them.  Second, it  is  not
    material that it was the Appellant's intention to seek leave  only  for
    himself as it was open to the Respondent to treat  his  application  as
    being for himself and his family.

Submissions

14. At the hearing before me, Mr Hussain repeated the submissions  that  he
    had made before Judge Courtney.  He began by stating that he would have
    to concede that there were insufficient funds for the  dependants,  and
    that no  fees  were  attached  for  their  application.   However,  the
    principal Appellant did submit fees of �1,051, but these fees were  not
    cleared by his bank.  They would have been cleared from Monday 3rd June
    by which time he would have had sufficient funds.

15. However, the acknowledgment of service was sent  to  him  on  3rd  June
    2014, and this being so, he was entitled to conclude that it  was  from
    this date onwards that an attempt  would  be  made  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to secure the  funds  to  process  the  application,
    rather than at a date before.

16. If it was a date before, then the Respondent should have complied  with
    directions and have submitted evidence fourteen days before the hearing
    of Judge Courtney, explaining whether or not attempts had been made  on
    either the Saturday or the  Sunday  before  Monday  3rd  June  2014  to
    withdraw the funds of �1,051 so as to process the principal Appellant's
    application.  This had not been done.

17. Accordingly, he was entitled to conclude that  at  the  time  when  the
    attempt was made to process his application form, namely, following 3rd
    June 2014, the funds were there for the Respondent Secretary  of  State
    to collect.

18. For his part,  Mr  Tarlow  submitted  that  the  reason  given  by  the
    Respondent in the letter of 11th June was that "the specified  fee  has
    not been paid" (see paragraph  3).   However,  if  one  considered  the
    application form of the principal Appellant it was clear here  that  at
    A16, on the application form dated 30th May 2013, there is  a  question
    to the effect "Please circle the amount to be paid",  and  there  is  a
    higher fee and a lower fee, and the Appellant had  circled  neither  of
    them.  He had not circled the fee of �1,051, which was the higher  fee,
    and he had not circled the lower fee either.  The Respondent  Secretary
    of State would have been entitled to  treat  the  application  form  as
    incomplete.  However, the Respondent did not do so.

19. The letter of 11th June 2013 makes it clear that an attempt was made to
    access the funds but these were not  available.   Therefore,  the  only
    decision open to the judge was to conclude that the Appellant could not
    comply with the Rules.  There was no valid appeal before the judge.

20. In reply, Mr Hussain submitted that there were a series of  assumptions
    being made, namely, that the Secretary of State had attempted to access
    the monies at the weekend on Saturday or Sunday, in  order  to  process
    the application.  If the acknowledgment was sent out on Monday 3rd June
    2014, then this is .... time when the funds should have been  accessed,
    and if that had been  done,  there  is  no  reason  why  the  principal
    Appellant's application could not be processed, because the funds  were
    there.

No Error of Law

21. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

22. The submissions before this Tribunal are exactly the same as those that
    were made before Judge Courtney's Tribunal in the First-tier.  However,
    Judge Courtney dealt with these  arguments  perfectly  adequately.   It
    matters not when the funds are crystallised, and whether they did so on
    a date after 3rd June 2014 when the acknowledgment of service was sent,
    or whether they did so before that  date.   It  matters  not  when  the
    Secretary of State attempted to secure  these  funds,  whether  on  the
    weekend of 1st and 2nd June 2014  or  on  Monday  3rd  June  2014,  and
    thereafter.

23. What arguments on behalf of the Appellant overlook, is  the  ruling  by
    the Administrative Court in Baldwin [2014]  EWHC  1604  to  the  effect
    that:

         "The question of validity crystallises at the  moment  the  request
         for payment from the payment card was made.  It does not matter  if
         there are or are not adequate funds before or after that time.   It
         was incumbent on the applicant to ensure that there was  sufficient
         funds in the account for the period from  posting  the  application
         ..." (see paragraph 12 of the determination).

    In the circumstances, therefore, the judge was  correct  in  concluding
    that the Appellant could not succeed.

Decision

24. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

25. No anonymity order is made.
