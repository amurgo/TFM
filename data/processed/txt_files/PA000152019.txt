                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


    1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission a decision  of  First-
       Tier Tribunal Judge Gibbs promulgated on 10 June 2019  in  which  the
       Judge allowed the appellant's appeal, finding  his  deportation  from
       the United Kingdom will breach article 3 ECHR.



Background


    2. AAM is a citizen of Somali born  on  24  February  1996  who  is  the
       subject of an order for his deportation from the United Kingdom.  The
       Judge notes a number of criminal convictions at [7] of  the  decision
       under challenge which include on 28 February 2012  a  conviction  for
       wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for which AAM  was
       sentenced to 4 ï¿½ years in a Young Offenders Institute,  7  July  2015
       when AAM was convicted of possession of a firearm and possession of a
       controlled drug (Class B) cannabis/cannabis resin for  which  he  was
       sentenced to 5 years imprisonment, and on 14 July 2017 for which  AAM
       was convicted of  assaulting  a  prison  officer  for  which  he  was
       sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment.
    3. The Judge notes AAM did not seek to rebut the section 72 Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 certificate which was issued  as  the
       Secretary of State.
    4. The Judge had before  her  a  report  form  Karen  O'Reilly  and  was
       persuaded by Mr  Chelvan's  submissions  that  although  the  country
       guidance case of Somalia does not specifically address  the  risk  to
       those who are apostates on return to  Somalia  there  was  a  finding
       which indicated that there was a real risk  at  [226].  At  [21]  the
       Judge writes:


           "21.   I am satisfied that this appellant  is  an  apostate  and
                that he will be readily identified  as  such;  he  will  not
                attend the mosque, dress appropriately and will not  observe
                Muslim festivals. Further, if asked about his  religion  the
                appellant should not be required to hide this (HJ  (Iran)  v
                Secretary of State the Home Department (Rev 1)  [2010]  UKSC
                31 (07  July  2010))  and  I  am  satisfied  that  he  would
                therefore be identified as  a  non-practising  Muslim  which
                will place him at risk of significant harm."


    5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal which was  granted
       by a Designated Judge of the First-Tier  Tribunal  in  the  following
       terms:


           "1.    The respondent SSHD applies in  time  for  permission  to
                appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the  decision  and
                reasons statement of FtT Judge L K Gibbs that was issued  on
                10 June 2019.  Judge  Gibbs  decided  the  appellant  was  a
                refugee from Somalia.
           2. The grounds challenge the judicial  findings  that:  (i)  the
                appellant would be identified as an apostate if returned  to
                Somalia, and (ii) as a perceived apostate  he  had  a  well-
                founded fear of persecution.
           3. The first ground is not made out because it amounts  to  mere
                disagreement with the judicial findings made.  At  [17]  and
                [18] Judge Gibbs gives sufficient reasons  for  finding  the
                appellant to  be  a  non-practising  Muslim.  It  is  common
                practice in the FtT for judges to treat the  lower  standard
                of proof as being discharged where the respondent's  refusal
                letter identifies that  a  person  may  be  at  risk  for  a
                particular  reason.  If  this  was  not  intended   by   the
                respondent in this case, then  it  was  for  the  Presenting
                Officer to clarify what was and what was not conceded. It is
                evident from the refusal letter and the way the  appeal  was
                defended by the Presenting Officer that  the  focus  of  the
                appeal was whether the appellant's fear was objectively well-
                founded even though it was subjectively well-founded.
           4. The second ground is made  out.  The  second  headnote  under
                "Country  Guidance"  in  MOJ  states   the   following   [my
                emphasis]:
                    (ii)   generally, a person who is "an ordinary civilian"
                    (i.e. not  associated  with  the  security  forces;  any
                    aspect of government or official Administration  or  any
                    NGO  or  international  organisation)   on   return   to
                    Mogadishu after a period of absence will  face  no  real
                    risk of persecution or risk of harm such as  to  require
                    protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article  15(c)
                    of the Qualification Directive. In particular,  he  will
                    not be at real risk simply on account of having lived in
                    a European location for a period of time of being viewed
                    with suspicion either by the authorities as  a  possible
                    supporter of Al Shabab or by Al Shabab as an apostate or
                    someone whose Islamic integrity has been compromised  by
                    living in a western country.
           5. It is arguable  that  Judge  Gibbs  does  not  give  adequate
                reasons for departing from this  guidance.  It  is  arguable
                that Judge Gibbs has failed to give reasons for  relying  on
                the  expert  report  of  Ms  K  O'Reilly  from  the  country
                guideline case."



Error of law


    6. As indicated by Dr Chelvan, the difficulty with  the  grounds  relied
       upon by the Secretary of State is that they refer to  and  rely  upon
       the country guidance case of MOJ and  others  (return  to  Mogadishu)
       Somalia CG [2014] UKUT 442 which sets out an assessment  of  risk  on
       return to Mogadishu. The problem arises as the Secretary of State  in
       the decision letter specifically states that it is not her  intention
       to return the appellant to Mogadishu.
    7.  The  country  guidance  case  regarding  parts  of  Somalia  outside
       Mogadishu  still  remains   AMM   (conflict;   humanitarian   crisis;
       returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011] UKUT  00445  (IAC).  The  point  of
       return is to the north-east of the country to  Puntland.  The  expert
       report considered by the Judge in support of the appellant's claim to
       face a real risk was evidence  not  specifically  challenged  by  the
       respondent before the Judge.
    8. In light of the fundamental error regarding location and in the light
       of the fact it has not  been  made  out  the  Judge's  findings  fall
       outside the range of those reasonably available to the Judge  on  the
       evidence, as accepted by Ms Jones, the appeal must fail.


Decision

    9. There is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

  Anonymity.


   10. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of
       the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


       I make such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
