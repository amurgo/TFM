                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on  [  ]  1971
    and she had made an asylum application in July 2016 which was  rejected
    on 20th January 2017. It was her appeal  against  that  Decision  which
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Rhys-Davies on  3rd  March  2017.
    By a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 22nd March 2017 her appeal was
    dismissed on all grounds.

 2. The basis of her claim was that if returned to Pakistan she will be  at
    risk from her family and the man whom her family  wish  her  to  marry.
    She has refused to marry that man and that is what  would  put  her  at
    risk.  She came to the UK on 11th August 2012 with a two  year  student
    visa which was then extended to expire in August  2016.  She  had  thus
    been in the UK for four years as a student.  It is  part  of  her  case
    that her family only allowed her to come to the  UK  to  study  on  the
    basis that she had agreed to marry the person they wanted  her  to  and
    that she would come to study for a period of only six to twelve months.

 3. The judge heard evidence from both the Appellant and  her  sister,  who
    resides in the UK.  He also had some documents, said to corroborate the
    claim, which were a newspaper from Pakistan and letters  purporting  to
    be from the Appellant's proposed fianc�.  The judge also had a  medical
    report.  The judge made extensive adverse credibility findings  and  it
    is those that are challenged by the Appellant's representatives both in
    the grounds and orally.

 4. The grounds essentially argue that the judge has not  done  a  holistic
    assessment of credibility and that the findings that he has  made  were
    not open to him and fundamentally flawed; indeed so  flawed  that  they
    cannot stand.  One of the paragraphs  in  the  determination  which  is
    challenged is paragraph 17, which says:

         "I find that this appeal should be dismissed.  Notwithstanding  the
         low standard of proof, the broad  consistency  of  the  Appellant's
         account in the retelling, the expert opinion of Mrs Moeen  and  the
         Respondent's acceptance that  at  least  part  of  the  Appellant's
         account is consistent with known country background evidence, I  am
         satisfied that the core of the Appellant's account is  not  at  all
         credible and I reject her account of her  reasons  for  fearing  to
         return to Pakistan in its entirety."

 5. That paragraph cannot be read in isolation.  It has to  be  read  along
    with the following paragraphs that  also  contain  adverse  credibility
    findings and as is accepted it is of course not the  case  that  simply
    because an account is consistent with background country information it
    has to be credible.

 6. The other challenges to the overall credibility findings are  that  the
    judge has not considered all of the evidence  in  the  round  and  that
    means that the judge's consideration of the documentary and potentially
    corroborative evidence was flawed and  the  reason  for  rejecting  the
    witness, the Appellant's sister's evidence, is also flawed.

 7. Looking at the judge's findings the judge found at  paragraph  19  that
    the Appellant had not reconciled a fundamental conflict at the heart of
    her claim and that was the  discordance  between  her  claim  of  great
    family  pressure  to  proceed  with  the  arranged  marriage  and  dire
    consequences for defying this on the one hand against  the  absence  of
    any problems with her family after her arrival in  the  UK  and  before
    early 2016.  I am unimpressed with the argument that she only told  her
    parents in early 2016 categorically that she would not marry  this  man
    because she had already overstayed the length of  time  that  they  had
    permitted her to be here by some three and a  half  years  without  any
    problem and that is a point that the judge also makes in paragraph 20.

 8. At paragraph 21 the judge makes another finding that the Appellant  had
    said that her parents  did  not  pressure  her  to  return  immediately
    because they were preoccupied with concern about  her  sister  and  her
    children after her marriage collapsed.  Even if  that  were  true,  the
    judge says, it does not explain  what  happened  thereafter.   He  also
    noted that the proposed fianc� did not  begin  to  express  any  doubts
    until recently.

 9. The judge at paragraph 22 says that the repeated delay  of  her  return
    home to a period lasting over three times as long as she said  she  was
    allowed to stay without any apparent objections was irreconcilable with
    her evidence to the Tribunal that her parents  were  traditional,  that
    she was kept on a short leash, that  her  marriage  to  the  even  more
    traditional proposed fianc� was set in stone and  that  the  period  of
    study in the UK was always regarded by her family  and  him  as  short-
    term.

10. He notes  that  the  expert  did  not  address  that  issue.   He  also
    considered and found against her on the basis that it was not  credible
    that her  parents  would  permit  her  to  go  abroad  at  all  in  the
    circumstances which she claims.  He considered the documents  in  terms
    of Tanveer Ahmed and gives  very  good  reasons  why  he  rejected  the
    newspaper evidence and indeed it would have been astonishing if he  had
    not.  The single article relied upon is printed in English whereas  the
    rest of the paper is printed in Urdu.  Furthermore, the  family  member
    who, it was claimed, placed the article, speak no English.

11. He gives reasons  for  rejecting  the  letters  because  there  was  no
    evidence that they originated from Pakistan.  The sister's evidence  he
    understandably rejected, looking at things in the round, on  the  basis
    that she is a close family member wishing to  support  her  sister.   I
    find no error of law in the judge's reasoning, which  is  detailed  and
    open to him on the evidence that was before  him.  The  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

12. An anonymity direction was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  will
    continue that.
