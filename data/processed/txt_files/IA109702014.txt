Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr H Olajuwan, Solicitor, Bloomfield Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Vidhyadharan, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the decision  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue her  with  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of her right to reside in the United Kingdom as  a  spouse
    of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and I do not consider that
    such a direction is  warranted  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, whose date of birth is  23  May
    1986.  In her application form she said she had lived  in  the  UK  for
    three years and eleven months.  On 28 June  2013  she  had  married  Mr
    Mbayi Mubedi.  On the  marriage  certificate  he  was  described  as  a
    retailer, and she was described as a receptionist.  She represented  in
    the application form that her husband had embarked on a  permanent  job
    with A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd in Birmingham on 15 July 2013  receiving
    a salary of �200 each week.  He was working 35 hours.  She attached  an
    unsigned employment contract stating, "the employee will will (sic)  be
    paid  weekly  in  arrears  by  BACS".   She  provided   four   payslips
    purportedly issued to her husband in August 2013.   These  were  for  a
    gross wage of �200, with deductions of �9.72 by way of income  tax  and
    national insurance, so as to produce a net pay figure of �190.28.   She
    also produced payslips for the last two weeks of July 2013.

The Reasons for Refusal

 3. On 14 February 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application.  Upon assessing the documents  provided,  the
    Secretary  of  State  had  undertaken  various  checks  to  verify  the
    employment, but had been unable to  do  so.   On  14  February  2014  a
    telephone call was  attempted  to  the  alleged  employer  A1  Teaching
    Solutions Ltd using the number provided in the EEA 2 application  form.
    That number did not lead to A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd but  instead  was
    answered by another company  who  had  never  heard  of  the  sponsor's
    alleged employer.  While  every  attempt  had  been  made  by  UKBA  to
    establish her sponsor's employment, the burden of proof rested with the
    applicant to provide such evidence and  she  had  not  discharged  that
    burden.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Kimnell  sitting  at  Kingston
    Crown Court in the First-tier Tribunal on 3 October 2014.  Both parties
    were legally represented.  For the purposes of the appeal hearing,  the
    appellant's solicitors compiled an  appellant's  bundle  which  contain
    some further documentary evidence relating  to  the  sponsor's  claimed
    employment.  On 24 February 2014 Ernest Nmerukni, personnel manager  of
    A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd,  certified  that  "her"  (referring  to  the
    appellant) current annual salary was �10,400.

 5. At page 25 of the bundle there was a  printout  from  a  Google  search
    showing that A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd  in  Birmingham  came  up  on  a
    Google search.  It was described as an educational recruitment  agency,
    supplying the best teachers to schools and colleges in  the  UK.   They
    provided staff at all levels.

 6. At pages 36 to 42 of the bundle there were  photocopies  of  additional
    payslips purportedly generated between 27 December 2013  and  28  March
    2014.  These were for the same basic pay of �200,  but  there  were  no
    income tax deductions, so the appellant's net pay had apparently  risen
    to �193.88 each week.  The payment method was  said  to  be  cash,  not
    BACS.

 7.  In  his  subsequent  decision,  the  Judge  gave  an  account  of  the
    proceedings at  paragraphs  5  to  17.   Under  cross-examination,  the
    sponsor said that he was a community officer working  for  A1  Teaching
    Solutions.  He commenced employment in  July  2013.   His  job  was  to
    inform people about work as a supply teacher in Manchester.  He  walked
    about the streets handing out  tracks,  advising  that  if  anyone  was
    interested in such work they should go to A1 for Training.  It was  his
    job to hand out leaflets but he did not have any leaflet  with  him  to
    exhibit at the hearing.  He was paid �200 a week, now reduced to �150 a
    week because he had reduced his hours from 35 to 20 in  order  to  look
    after his son.  His wage was paid into his wife's bank  account  as  it
    was too low to open a bank account.  His wife gave money to him  if  he
    needed it.  He had a contract of employment but it was not included  in
    the documents.  Ernest Nmerukni was his manager  and  employer.   There
    was no re-examination.

 8. In her evidence, the appellant said that her husband worked  for  about
    twenty hours a week, for which he was paid, she thought, �7.50 an hour.
     The money was paid into her bank account as her husband  had  no  bank
    account of his own.  There was no re-examination.

 9. In closing submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Olajuwan  invited
    the Tribunal to  find  both  witnesses  credible,  as  they  had  given
    mutually corroborative evidence.  There was no report of the  telephone
    call that the respondent had attempted to make (as referred to  in  the
    refusal  letter),  but  in  any  event  there  were  further  documents
    answering the point.

10. The  Judge's  reasons  for  dismissing  the  appeal  were  set  out  in
    paragraphs 18 to 23.  He rejected the evidence  that  the  sponsor  was
    employed by A1 Teaching Solutions for a number  of  reasons.   Firstly,
    his  evidence  about  his  responsibilities  was  extremely  vague  and
    improbable.  Secondly, he paid particular attention to the fact that he
    was not paid the income he said he earned, which was deposited  in  his
    wife's account.  It was possible that the appellant was employed by  A1
    Solutions, but he found as a fact that her husband was not.  He did not
    accept that if the sponsor was truly employed in the United Kingdom  he
    would not be paid directly and have his own bank account. He continued:
    "his evidence the amount of money he earns is too low  to  justify  the
    opening of an account does not stand up to scrutiny because  his  wife,
    the appellant, who according to the evidence has  no  earnings  of  her
    own, does have an account."

11. He had seen a copy of an RBS bank account belonging  to  the  appellant
    which showed monies  paid  in  as  an  automated  transaction  from  A1
    Teaching Solutions but according to the wage slips he  had  been  shown
    the  husband  was  paid  in  cash.   This  was  a  clear  and   obvious
    discrepancy, and supported a finding that it was in fact the  appellant
    who was employed by A1 Teaching Solutions and that the wage slips  that
    he had been shown were fabricated.

12. He accepted that A1 Teaching Solutions had a website.  But it  did  not
    of itself amount to proof that the appellant's husband was employed  by
    that company.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

13. On 25 November 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge  PJG  White  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.  It was arguable  that  the  Judge  had
    misdirected himself with regard to the evidence  heard,  in  particular
    the reason that the sponsor did not  have  his  own  bank  account  and
    whether the appellant had her own earnings.  It was arguable the  Judge
    failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the  appellant  would
    have  submitted  original  documents  to  the   respondent   with   the
    application.  It was arguable there had been procedural unfairness  and
    that the Judge  relied  on  what  he  considered  to  be  discrepancies
    concerning entries  in  the  appellant's  bank  statement  but  without
    allowing the appellant and the sponsor an opportunity in their evidence
    to address  his  concerns.   Finally,  the  Judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant was employed by A1 Teaching Solutions arguably failed to take
    into account that the company was located in  Birmingham,  whereas  the
    appellant's address was in Manchester.

The Rule 24 Response

14. On 9 December 2014 Karen Pal settled a Rule 24 response  on  behalf  of
    the respondent.  The respondent opposed  the  appeal.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was entitled to make the findings of fact that he did as
    set out in his decision at paragraphs 18  to  22.   The  findings  were
    adequate, and had been supported by reasons.   The  grounds  of  appeal
    were a disagreement with the findings made by the Judge.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

15. At the hearing before me, I reviewed the documentary evidence that  had
    been before the First-tier Tribunal.  This included a set of  RBS  bank
    statements for an account held by the appellant which had been produced
    in the course of the hearing.  I was also shown some  documents  by  Mr
    Olajuwan which he said had been available at the hearing, but which had
    not been tendered in evidence.  These documents related to attempts  by
    Mr Mubedi to open a bank account in June and July 2013.  On 7 June 2013
    RBS rejected his request to  open  a  Select  Silver  account  because,
    following standard security checks, they had found out that he did  not
    meet the criteria required to open a Royal Bank  of  Scotland  account.
    In July 2013 Mr Mubedi had applied to  open  an  account  with  NatWest
    Bank.  On 11 July 2013 NatWest wrote to him thanking him  for  choosing
    to open a Select account with them,  and  setting  out  the  things  he
    needed to do before the account could be open.  I  pointed  out  to  Mr
    Olajuwan  that  the  NatWest  correspondence  did  not  show  that  the
    sponsor's attempts to open an account with NatWest had been thwarted by
    a low credit rating.  Mr Olajuwan relied on the fact that there was  an
    RBS logo at the bottom left of each page of the NatWest correspondence.

16. In any event, he relied on these additional documents as  showing  that
    the Judge had wrongly recorded the sponsor's explanation for not having
    his own bank account.  It was not because his wages were too  low,  but
    because of his  low  credit  rating.   I  asked  him  why  he  had  not
    introduced the documents now sought to be relied upon  by  way  of  re-
    examination.  He said it was because he thought the Judge had  accepted
    the sponsor's explanation for not having a bank account of his own.

17. In support of the submission that the Judge had been perverse  to  find
    that the appellant,  rather  than  his  sponsor,  was  working  for  A1
    Training Solutions, Mr Olajuwan  produced  a  set  of  bank  statements
    relating to another bank account held by  the  appellant.   These  show
    that in the period running up to the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal
    the appellant had been earning a monthly salary  of  about  �1,000  net
    from another employer.  Mr Olajuwan submitted that this showed that the
    appellant could not have been working  for  A1  Training  Solutions  as
    well, particularly as the company was based in Birmingham, whereas both
    she and the sponsor lived in Manchester.

18. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Vidhyadharan submitted that the  burden
    of proof rested with the appellant, and so the responsibility lay  with
    the appellant and his legal advisors  to  ensure  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was provided with all the relevant material to discharge
    that burden of  proof.   The  Judge  had  given  adequate  reasons  for
    dismissing the appeal on the evidence that had been made  available  to
    him.

Discussion

19. According to the employment contract and employment letter,  Mr  Mubedi
    was engaged to provide the services of a community development officer.
     But A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd does not purport to provide a service to
    the community.  Its clients are teaching institutions.  The  Judge  had
    the  benefit  of  seeing  how  the  sponsor  performed   under   cross-
    examination, and it was reasonably open to him to form the belief  that
    the sponsor's vaguely described employment  was  inherently  improbable
    and a complete fabrication.

20. In the  course  of  the  hearing  before  me  I  reviewed  the  Judge's
    manuscript record of the evidence, and his  manuscript  record  accords
    with the typed record  inherent  in  the  decision.   After  giving  an
    account of his wages, the sponsor is recorded as saying that his  wages
    are paid into his wife's account. He gave  the  following  explanation:
    "too low to open account".

21. Given the context, the Judge reasonably understood the  sponsor  to  be
    saying that his wages were too low to open an account, rather than that
    his credit rating was too low to open an account.

22. In the light of the evidence which  has  been  provided  to  me,  I  am
    prepared to accept the  Judge  may  have  misunderstood  the  sponsor's
    explanation.

23. But I do not find that this translates into a material error of law for
    two reasons.  Firstly, the appellant had  at  all  material  times  the
    benefit of  legal  representation,  and  going  into  the  hearing  the
    appellant and her legal advisors were well aware that  the  core  issue
    was the credibility of the sponsor's  asserted  employment.   The  fact
    that there was no evidence of the sponsor's claimed  wages  being  paid
    into a  bank  account  held  by  the  sponsor  clearly  called  for  an
    explanation,  and  it  was  reasonably  foreseeable  that  an   adverse
    inference would be drawn by the Judge if a satisfactory explanation was
    not given, backed up by supporting documentary evidence.   So,  insofar
    as the Judge did make a mistake of fact, the appellant's legal advisors
    are not absolved of blame.

24. Secondly, and in any event, the adverse credibility finding made by the
    Judge still holds good; and indeed it is  arguably  reinforced  by  the
    material that was not shown to the Judge.  The Judge did  not  find  it
    credible that the sponsor was not  able  to  open  a  bank  account  to
    receive the weekly wages allegedly paid to him by A1 Training Solutions
    Ltd.  It is not actually stated in the June 2013 rejection letter  that
    the reason for not allowing the sponsor to open an  account  is  a  low
    credit rating.  But even if this is assumed to be the  reason,  by  the
    time that the sponsor applied to open a bank account  with  NatWest  in
    July 2013, he had allegedly secured an offer  of  permanent  employment
    with A1 Training Solutions Ltd.  So the explanation  that  the  sponsor
    was nonetheless unable to open an  account  is  manifestly  lacking  in
    credibility, and it is not supported by the documentation which has now
    been disclosed.

25. The third reason given by the Judge for disbelieving the claim was  the
    discrepancy between the payslips referring to payment in cash  and  the
    entries in the appellant's bank statements showing her receiving  wages
    from A1 Training Solutions via BACS.  It will be recalled that the bank
    statement evidence was tendered in the course of the hearing to support
    the sponsor's oral evidence that,  because  he  did  not  have  a  bank
    account, his wages were paid by BACS into his wife's bank account.   As
    the appellant was legally represented, I do not consider that there was
    any procedural unfairness in neither  the  appellant  nor  the  sponsor
    being cross-examined about the wage slips  in  the  appellant's  bundle
    referring to payment by cash.  The anomaly was a glaring  one;  and  it
    would have been, or should have been, apparent to the appellant and her
    legal advisors at the outset of the hearing.

26. There was also no procedural unfairness in the Judge failing to explore
    with the appellant the question of whether she had a separate source of
    earnings from employment.  Her witness statement is  completely  silent
    on the topic of employment, and  there  was  no  disclosure  before  or
    during the hearing of bank statements showing her  receiving  a  salary
    from another employer.   Furthermore,  it  was  not  perverse  even  in
    retrospect for the Judge to postulate that the appellant  was  employed
    by A1 Training Solutions Ltd rather than the sponsor.  The total  level
    of earnings which the appellant receives each week on  this  hypothesis
    is not inconsistent with her having two part-time  employments.   There
    was also no perversity on geographical grounds,  as  suggested  in  the
    application for permission to appeal.  The appellant's  case  was  that
    the sponsor travelled  from  Manchester  to  Birmingham  every  day  to
    undertake his employment with A1 Teaching Solutions Ltd, and  so  there
    is no reason why she could not  have  done  the  same.   Moreover,  the
    contract of employment expressly provides  that  the  employee  may  be
    required to work somewhere  else  apart  from  at  the  offices  of  A1
    Training Solutions Ltd in Birmingham.

27. In granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  White  observed  that  the
    appellant is likely to have provided originals  with  her  application,
    and that the Judge arguably failed to take this into account.   But  in
    paragraph 20 of the decision the Judge was referring to photocopies  of
    letters and wage slips in the appellant's bundle,  not  photocopies  of
    documents appearing in the respondent's bundle.  Mr Olajuwan said  that
    he had produced the originals of the  photocopied  wage  slips  in  the
    appellant's bundle in the course  of  the  hearing.   But  the  Judge's
    observation that, "in the age of the word processor such documents  are
    easy to generate and do not necessarily represent the truth" is equally
    applicable to the pristine "originals" which I inspected.

28. In conclusion, I find that the Judge has  given  adequate  reasons  for
    finding that the appellant did not discharge the burden of proving that
    the sponsor was employed by A1 Training Solutions  Ltd,  and  that  the
    proceedings  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  not  vitiated  by
    procedural unfairness.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
