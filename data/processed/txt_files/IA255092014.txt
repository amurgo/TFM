Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Randhawa, solicitor (Sky Solicitors Ltd)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 20 September 1979. His
    appeal against the decision of the respondent dated 28  February  2014,
    refusing his application for an extension of stay as a domestic  worker
    in a private household, was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge S  J
    Clarke in a determination promulgated on 21 November 2014.  The  appeal
    was dismissed both under the rules and on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission against that determination.

 3. It is contended that the Judge misdirected himself by  "misreading  the
    evidence."

 4. At paragraphs 13-15 of the determination, the Judge stated that when he
    looked at the bank statements belonging to the appellant and his  wife,
    the ones shown in the respondent's bundle up  to  January  2014  showed
    only one payment from Mr Malik - the sponsor -  and  the  ones  in  the
    appellant's bundle show one payment of �1500 from Mr Malik and  another
    for �1000 on 10 September and 23 September respectively.

 5. He was not provided  with  any  schedule  showing  how  the  money  was
    adjusted to ensure that the appellant received  reimbursement  for  his
    expenses, and how his wages were adjusted to accommodate  the  payments
    said to have come from customers of his sponsor, Mr Malik.

 6. At paragraph 14, the Judge noted that the  appellant's  account  showed
    payments in of larger sums as the  year  progresses,  and  the  closing
    balances swell to over �10,000. On 15 September there is a  payment  of
    �10,000 to Barclays. There is no evidence to show  whose  account  this
    went into or any more details about it.

 7. Mr Randhawa submitted that the bank statements  referred  to  in  those
    paragraphs were in fact not the appellant's  bank  statements  but  his
    sponsor's bank statements. These had  been  provided  as  part  of  the
    evidence contained in  the  appellant's  bundle  at  pages  27-45.  The
    appellant's bank statements however were produced at pages 12-22.   The
    statements provided however, in fact  relate  to  a  joint  account  at
    Barclays held by the appellant and his wife, Mrs A Kanwal.

 8. These statements show that the appellant's account balance remained for
    most of the period under �300, with the highest  balance  at  any  time
    being �690.59.

 9. Mr Randhawa submitted that the error is compounded by  what  the  Judge
    stated at paragraph 15, namely that the difficulty in  the  appellant's
    case is that the sums of money get bigger and bigger, which  in  itself
    supports the claim that this was not just his occasionally going  to  a
    builder's merchant to pick up some materials because Mr Malik  was  too
    busy.

10. That finding he submitted was thus made on the faulty premise that  the
    Judge thought he was having regard to the appellant's bank  statements,
    whereas they were in fact those belonging to his sponsor.

11. The  Judge  also  referred  to  the  absence  of  documentary  evidence
    including evidence of  payslips  or  evidence  that  he  pays  tax  and
    National Insurance[1].

12. There was also evidence that the appellant on occasion  made  purchases
    on behalf of his sponsor for the improvements that he was carrying  out
    on one of his own properties. He also occasionally  purchased  building
    materials for his sponsor for the sponsor's building business [12].

13. The Judge ultimately found that the appellant had "completely" breached
    the conditions attached to his latest leave because  he  had  not  been
    working as a domestic worker at all [18].

14. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Tarlow  submitted  that  the  appellant
    appears to have admitted that he was engaged in  work  outside  of  his
    contract. There was also a reference to his  not  being  aware  of  his
    contracted working hours. Nor was there much evidence that he was  paid
    as a domestic worker.

15. Mr Tarlow submitted that there was no  evidence  of  tax  and  national
    insurance that had been paid. That had  merely  been  asserted  by  the
    appellant and Mr Malik at the hearing [17]. There is only  one  example
    of the appellant's salary going into his account. The grounds of appeal
    amount to a disagreement with the findings  of  the  First-tier  Judge;
    there was no material error of law. There is only one  example  of  the
    appellant's salary going into his account.

    Assessment

16. I have had regard to the appellant's as well as Mr Malik's evidence  at
    the hearing. The appellant  stated  that  he  was  only  working  as  a
    domestic worker which involves working for his employer and  completing
    some ad hoc demands beyond his contract. He is paid a  monthly  sum  of
    �970. His sponsor used to pay him in cash in  hand  every  month.  This
    involved the transferring of some of his wages through direct  payments
    from some of the sponsor's own clients  and  this  amount  was  in  due
    course adjusted.

17. The payments referred to by the respondent in his account  occurred  as
    his employer used his account from time to time for his  business  use.
    It was not always possible for him to travel to the shops and  that  is
    why he gave the appellant some additional 'cards' in case  he  requires
    anything in a hurry. He had to do things asked of him and was acting on
    his employer's instructions only. He  was  still  in  employment  as  a
    domestic worker.

18. Mr Malik in his evidence stated that the appellant  had  applied  as  a
    domestic worker in a private household to continue working with him  in
    the UK. He had been an employee since 2008. He was required to continue
    as a domestic worker with them.

19. The appellant has been working there as a domestic worker  since  then.
    His family including his wife and son are residing with them.

20. He confirmed that the appellant used to carry out ad hoc work for  him.
    He runs businesses  including  a  fast  food  takeaway  as  well  as  a
    furniture business, including fittings. He sometimes asks the appellant
    to run errands on his behalf in relation to his business as he  is  not
    always able to do so.

21. He confirms that he asked his clients to pay the  amounts  owed  to  Mr
    Malik into the appellant's bank account  to  be  adjusted  towards  his
    monthly wages payments. He 'is also providing  invoices  for  the  work
    carried out' by himself for various clients.

22. I have also had regard to the appellant's employment  contract  entered
    into on 27 February  2014.  The  appellant's  duties  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 1-7, including cleaning the house,  cooking  meals,  washing
    windows and carpets, and performing such duties out of working hours in
    special circumstances authorised by the employer.

23. His hours of work are from Monday to Friday inclusive, between 6pm  and
    9pm and on Saturdays and Sundays from 7.30am to 11.30am and  5.30pm  to
    9.30pm.

24. The appellant and his family are entitled to reside free of cost at the
    house.

25. I find that the Judge has mistaken the owner of the bank account  which
    he was considering. He appears to have confused  the  appellant's  bank
    statements with those of the sponsor.

26. Based upon  that  error,  the  Judge  understandably  reached  negative
    credibility findings against the appellant which,  as  noted  by  Judge
    Foudy in  granting  the  appellant  permission  to  appeal,  might  not
    otherwise have been made.

27. The Judge thus proceeded on the basis of a false premise, resulting  in
    the ultimate negative finding that the appellant had not  been  working
    as a domestic servant in Mr Malik's household.

28. Before arriving at that conclusion, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was
    obliged to have proper regard to the evidence presented  in  regard  to
    the respective bank statements.

29. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appellant has not had his
    appeal decided properly on the basis of the  documentary  evidence  and
    witness statements that he presented before the First-tier Tribunal.

30. I find that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal thus  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law. In the circumstances, I set aside
    the decision.

31. Both parties submitted that this was an appropriate case to be remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision.

32. I have had regard to the Senior President's Practice Statement relating
    to the issue of remitting an appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In
    giving effect to that approach, I  am  satisfied  that  the  extent  of
    judicial finding which is necessary in order for  the  decision  to  be
    made is extensive. The appellant has not had his case considered on the
    basis of the evidence presented. There will have to be a  complete  re-
    hearing with no findings preserved. I  have  also  had  regard  to  the
    overriding objective and conclude that it would be  just  and  fair  to
    remit the case.

33. In the circumstances, I direct that the appeal be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal (Taylor House) for a fresh decision to be made.

34. The necessary administrative arrangements will need to take place.

    Notice of Decision

    The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of
    material errors of law. It is accordingly set aside.

    The appeal is remitted to Taylor House for a fresh decision to be made.



    No anonymity direction is made.

[1]  At the hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  appellant  produced
evidence of those documents including Inland  Revenue  documents  confirming
his payment of tax. However, no application had been  made  under  the  2008
Rules for this evidence to be admitted. I accordingly pay no regard to it.
