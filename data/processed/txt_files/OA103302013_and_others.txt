                               Mehwish Kashif

                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. They appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal against decisions of the Secretary of State of 12  April  2013.
    The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeals in a single  determination
    promulgated  on  27  May  2014.  Judge  Levin  granted  the   appellants
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 28 July 2014.

 2. By way of an e-mail to the Upper Tribunal dated the 2 October  2014  the
    appellants' legal representative states  that  the  appellants  wish  to
    withdraw their appeals.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing that the Secretary  of  State  was  the  successful  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent to the appellants to
    withdraw their cases.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  each  of  these  appeals  are
    recorded as "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is
    a Notice  pursuant  to  rule  17(5)  to  inform  the  parties  that  the
    appellants' cases are withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellants' appeals being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
