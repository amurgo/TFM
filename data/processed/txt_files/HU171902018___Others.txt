                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Warren,  promulgated  on  23rd  April  2019,  following  a  hearing  at
    Manchester on 5th February  2019.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the  appeal  of  the  Appellants,  whereupon  the  Appellants
    subsequently applied for, and were granted, permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The principal Appellant in this case, came to the UK as  a  visitor  on
    7th November 2005 and,  following  various  extensions  of  stay  as  a
    student, remained here, eventually applying outside the Rules for leave
    which was rejected on 23rd June 2010.  His wife, who joined him  later,
    is his dependant.  There  are  children  who  have  been  born  to  the
    Appellant and his wife in the UK.  The Appellant is a citizen of  South
    Africa, although of Pakistani origin, as is his wife.  The Respondent's
    view was that it would be reasonable for the Appellant,  his  wife  and
    siblings to return to either South Africa or Pakistan as a family unit.
     It is true that he had children who were "qualifying" children in that
    they had been in the  UK  for  over  seven  years.   Nevertheless,  the
    appropriate course of action here was for the family  to  return  as  a
    single family unit.

 3. The Respondent Secretary of State gave consideration to  whether  there
    were "exceptional circumstances" to the whole family remaining  in  the
    UK and concluded that there were none.  The Appellant himself was  born
    in Pakistan and lived there until  1999.   He  obtained  settlement  in
    South Africa up  until  2005.   His  wife  was  a  Pakistani  national.
    Neither they as adults, nor their children were British citizens.   The
    eldest child was born on 7th October 2010 in the UK.   The  next  child
    was born on 2nd March 2012.  The third child was born on 21st July 2013
    in the UK.  The fourth child was born on 12th September 2015 in the UK.
     The final child was born on 9th December 2016 in the UK.   Apart  from
    the first and second child, both of whom were now children who had been
    in the UK for over seven years, the others had not.  At the date of the
    hearing before Judge Warren, the second child had not been  in  the  UK
    for over seven years, but by the date of the decision this had changed.



The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge summarised the facts before the Tribunal.  It was  recognised
    that the older children are now established in a local school and their
    reports showed that they are working hard and doing well.   The  eldest
    child, however, has fibular hemimelia, with a leg length discrepancy of
    approximately 3.5cm.  She had been  treated  at  the  Royal  Manchester
    Children's Hospital and is due to have a special frame  fitted  to  her
    left leg with a view to lengthening it (paragraph 19).  That aside, the
    judge's view was that "the  appeal  is  only  to  be  considered  under
    private  and  family   life   provisions   outside   of   the   Rules".
    Nevertheless, the judge did consider the  Rules  (paragraph  20).   The
    reason why the Appellant was  excluded  from  consideration  under  the
    Rules was because he had failed to pay litigation costs awarded against
    him in favour of the Respondent and  "he  was  unable  to  explain  his
    failure to pay to me, and simply argued other points when I  asked  him
    about this" (paragraph 20).

 5. The judge concluded that the decision by the  Respondent  Secretary  of
    State could be upheld.  None of the family were asylum  seekers.   None
    of the children were stateless.  None of the family were  eligible  for
    leave to remain within the  Rules.   The  principal  Appellant  had  an
    unpaid debt to the Respondent.  Moreover, with respect to the  children
    there was no evidence  to  suggest  that  their  education  or  medical
    treatment would suffer as a result.  Indeed, the best interests of  the
    children was to remain as a family unit with their parents  and  travel
    either to South Africa or to Pakistan (paragraph 23).

 6. The appeals were dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge  had  failed  to  apply
    paragraph 276ADE in an appropriate manner.  The grounds also state that
    the judge did not consider the Supreme Court decision in  KO  (Nigeria)
    [2018] UKSC 53.

 8. On 13th May 2019, permission to appeal was granted by the  Tribunal  on
    the basis that the judge failed to consider KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC
    53.   This  was  important   when   considering   reasonableness,   and
    particularly the assessment undertaken (at paragraph 23)  as  to  where
    the balance of considerations fell.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 8th July 2019, the  Appellant  referred  to
    the grounds of application.  He  also  stated  that  he  had  paid  the
    outstanding debt to the Respondent Secretary of State.  He said that he
    had explained  the  matter  to  the  Tribunal  below  that  he  was  in
    discussions with the  Home  Office.   He  had,  in  fact,  received  no
    notification whatsoever that a debt was outstanding.  It was only  when
    he had become aware of this that he had  opened  discussions  with  the
    Home Office about this.  He now handed up  a  confirmation  of  a  visa
    debit to the Home Office dated 23rd March 2019 when  he  had  paid  the
    outstanding debt of ï¿½480 for litigation costs.  This,  of  course,  was
    after the date of the hearing before Judge Warren on 5th February 2019,
    although only just before the decision was promulgated  on  23rd  April
    2019.  The judge cannot be faulted for not taking  this  into  account.
    The principal Appellant, who appeared in person, however, continued  to
    maintain that the application of the eldest child AA, should have  been
    considered under paragraph 276ADE and as such, it would be unreasonable
    to ask this child to return to either  South  Africa  or  to  Pakistan,
    because of the condition described as fibular hemimelia that the  child
    suffered from whereby a special frame was now being fitted to her  left
    leg.  Second, he  submitted  that  KO  (Nigeria)  ought  to  have  been
    considered in relation to her.

10. For his part, Mr Bates submitted that although it is the case  that  at
    the critical place in the determination (paragraph 23) the  judge  does
    not make  express  reference  to  KO  (Nigeria),  to  all  intents  and
    purposes, the issue of "reasonableness" has been properly considered by
    the judge at this paragraph, as  indeed  it  has  been  throughout  the
    determination.  The fact here was that in a "real life"  situation  the
    family will be returned as a single unit.   They  could  either  go  to
    South Africa or to Pakistan from where they originated.  There  was  no
    evidence to suggest that either education or  medical  treatment  would
    suffer as a result of the removal.

11. In reply, the principal  Appellant  submitted  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's own guidance made it clear that it was not reasonable to expect
    a child in the position of AA to leave the UK when  she  was  receiving
    treatment, and his daughter was having a left leg operation  to  extend
    her leg.  The fact was that as far as paragraph 23  was  concerned  the
    judge had failed to take into account the very significant difficulties
    that the family would face if the eldest child  was  also  required  to
    return with them to either South Africa or to Pakistan.  The children's
    needs had to be considered separately from those of the parents who had
    been guilty of immigration offences.  This matter had not been properly
    considered by the judge below.

Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set the decision and remake the decision.   My
    reasons are as follows.

13. First, although the judge has embarked upon a fulsome analysis  of  the
    factual circumstances before the Tribunal,  the  position  of  AA,  the
    eldest child, who has been in the UK for over seven  years,  and  is  a
    qualifying child,  and  undergoing  medical  treatment,  has  not  been
    considered in the context of KO (Nigeria).  This requires  that  it  is
    necessary  to  consider  whether  it  was  "reasonable  to  expect"   a
    qualifying child to leave the UK.  When this is considered a  court  or
    Tribunal must not engage in a balancing exercise, weighing  the  impact
    upon the child against the public interest.  The effect of KO (Nigeria)
    in relation to the proper interpretation of Section 117B(6) of the 2002
    Act is to disprove the Court of Appeal  decision  in  R  (MA)  Pakistan
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705.  In assessing whether it is "reasonable to expect"
    a qualifying child to leave the UK the focus must be exclusively on the
    position of the child.  The Supreme Court has accepted that, of course,
    the immigration status of a parent may be relevant in assessing "in the
    real world the impact a parent's removal may have on  a  child's  'best
    interests', but the focus must be on the position of the child".   When
    regard is had to the position of AA, who has been in the  UK  for  over
    seven years, it cannot be said that, viewed that from  the  prospective
    of reasonableness, that the judge has indeed applied the strictures  in
    KO (Nigeria) to the analysis at paragraph 23.

14. Second, consideration must also be given to the Immigration Directorate
    Instruction Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life  (as
    a Partner or a Parent) and Private Life: Ten Year Routes  August  2015.
    The guidance that is given is to the effect that,

         "the requirement that a non-British citizen child has lived in  the
         UK for a continuous period of  at  least  seven  years  immediately
         preceding the date of the application, recognises  that  over  time
         children start to put down roots and integrate into life in the  UK
         ...".

15. The guidance goes on to say that  in  these  circumstances,  where  the
    balance weighs more in favour of  the  child  such  that  it  would  be
    generally unreasonable to  expect  the  child  to  leave  the  UK,  the
    position is that "strong reasons will be required in order to refuse  a
    case with continuous residence of more than seven years".   This  being
    so, the failure to demonstrate that the judge has had express regard to
    these matters means that the decision must be set  aside  and  remitted
    back to the First-tier Tribunal for a reconsideration.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law.  I set aside the decision of the original judge.   I  remake
the decision as follows.  This appeal is remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal to be determined by a judge other than Judge  Warren,  pursuant  to
Practice Statement 7.2(b) of the Practice Statement.

The appeals are allowed.

An anonymity order is made.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
