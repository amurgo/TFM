Representation:
For the claimant: Mr C Litchfield, instructed by SEB Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, MD Zahedul Hoq, date of birth 16.6.81, is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Martins promulgated  21.7.15,  dismissing  on
    immigration grounds, but allowing on human rights grounds,  his  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 4.2.15, to refuse
    his application for leave to remain in the UK as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student and to remove him from the UK pursuant to  section  47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The judge heard the appeal
    on 24.6.15.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Peart  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.1.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Martins to be set aside and remade, which I do  by  dismissing
    the appeal.

 6. The claimant's application  was  refused  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    following consideration of the relevant requirements of paragraph 245ZX
    of the Immigration Rules. In essence, his  application  was  doomed  to
    failure under 245ZX(l) because his previous leave  expired  on  23.8.14
    and the start of his course was 13.10.14, more than 28 days  after  the
    expiry of his leave.

 7. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first came to the UK as a student in 2007. He obtained  a  Bachelor  of
    Science degree in 2012 and was granted further leave to remain for Post-
    study work, expiring 23.8.14.

 8. In his application made on 22.8.14 he sought leave to remain  to  study
    for a diploma in Healthcare Management from the  UK  Business  College,
    but they failed to issue him with a CAS, as he had  not  submitted  the
    original bank statements they requested from him. It is said that after
    receiving the bank statements the college sought confirmation of an in-
    time application for further leave, which he was unable to provide. The
    precise details are rather unclear. However, he then obtained  a  place
    at an alternative college, Meridian Business School, on a course due to
    start on 13.10.14. They issued a CAS but, the application was  refused,
    for the reasons stated above.

 9. Judge Martins had "some  sympathy"  with  the  claimant's  argument  on
    fairness,  relying  on  Thakur  (PBS  decision  -common  law  fairness)
    Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 151  (IAC)  and  Patel  (revocation  of  sponsor
    licence - fairness) India [2011] UKUT 0021 (IAC), submitting  that  the
    Secretary of State should have considered the time  when  the  original
    application was made with the start date of  the  first  course  at  UK
    Business College. However, the  judge  noted  that  the  new  CAS  from
    Meridian clearly states the start date of the course as 13.10.14,  even
    though the CAS itself is dated 18.9.14. At �22 the judge concluded that
    the appeal was bound to fail on immigration grounds, as the new  course
    did not commence within 28 days of his last period of leave.  There  is
    no challenge to that part of the decision.

10. However, the judge then went on to find in �23 of the decision that the
    claimant had acquired private life in the UK through  his  studies  and
    his time in the UK, and that the interference with  that  private  life
    caused by his removal was disproportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  of
    maintaining effective immigration control. The judge thus  allowed  the
    appeal on human  rights  grounds,  relying  on  CDS  (PBS:  "available"
    Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC), to suggest that  removing  a
    student in the middle of his studies could constitute a breach  of  his
    article 8 rights.

11. However, as both the grounds of application for  permission  to  appeal
    and the grant of permission to appeal point out, those findings in  CDS
    relied on by Judge Martins were in fact obiter to  that  case,  and  in
    Nasim and others (Article 8) [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Tribunal
    stated that there was no justification to extend those obiter  comments
    so as to equate a person whose course of study has not yet ended with a
    person who, having finished their course, is  precluded  by  the  Rules
    from staying on to do something else. Whilst stating that it  would  be
    wrong to stated that an adverse immigration decision in the case  of  a
    person who is here for study or other temporary purposes can  never  be
    found to be disproportionate, it was unlikely a person would be able to
    show an article 8 right by coming to the UK for temporary purposes.

12. Further, in Patel & Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC  72,  the  Supreme  Court
    held that article 8 is not a general dispensing power to be applied  in
    a near-miss case and cannot provide substance to a  human  rights  case
    which is otherwise lacking merit.  "The  opportunity  for  a  promising
    student to complete his course in this country,  however  desirable  in
    general terms, is not in itself a right protected under article 8."

13. In addition to the above case law, section 117B of  the  2002  provides
    that little weight should be given to a private life developed  in  the
    UK whilst a person's immigration status has been precarious, which  has
    been defined by  subsequent  case  law  as  including  a  person  whose
    continued presence in the UK depends on the grant of further  leave  to
    remain.

14. Further, it is relevant to any article 8 ECHR consideration that  there
    are Immigration Rules covering private life claims, particularly  under
    paragraph 276ADE. There was no argument but that the claimant could not
    meet those Rules and in particular nothing to suggest that  there  were
    very significant obstacles to his integration back to  Bangladesh.  The
    judge was in error in �23 to suggest that this inability  to  meet  the
    Rules "merits consideration under article  8."  The  Tribunal  is  only
    justified in doing so where  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
    adequately addressed in the Rules so as render the decision  to  remove
    him unjustifiably harsh. The judge  did  not  identify  any  compelling
    circumstances that would or could  justify  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules on the basis of article 8 ECHR private life. Nor  can
    I find any such compelling circumstances on the facts of this case.

15. Frankly, even if there were any compelling circumstances to  justify  a
    proportionality assessment outside the Rules, and recognising that each
    case must be considered on its individual merits, following the  Razgar
    five-step approach, it is abundantly clear  that  there  is  absolutely
    nothing of significance in the claimant's circumstances to suggest  but
    that the decision was anything but entirely  proportionate.  There  was
    nothing  procedurally  unfair  about  the  decision   to   refuse   his
    application. The desire to remain to undertake further study  does  not
    of itself give rise to any human right to remain on grounds of  private
    life.  He  will  be  able  to  take  advantage   of   the   educational
    qualifications already obtained on return to Bangladesh. If  he  wishes
    to undertake further  study  in  the  UK  he  is  free  to  apply  from
    Bangladesh.

16. In  all the circumstances both the application and the  appeal  against
    the refusal were inevitably doomed to failure from the outset.

17. It follows that the reasoning and thus the decision of Judge Martins is
    entirely inconsistent with the prevailing case law, in  error  of  law,
    and cannot stand.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    both immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
