Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Karnik, instructed by Citywide Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, AK, appeals against a decision dated 22 January 2013  to
    make him subject to a deportation order under Section  3(5)(a)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 because the respondent deemed his  deportation  to
    be conducive to the public good.

 2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  we  make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellants. This direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He  was
    born in October 1993.

 4. The appellant came to the UK in June 2005 with his sister.  His  mother
    had already come to the UK and made an unsuccessful asylum  claim.  The
    appellant made an asylum claim on arrival in terms similar to that made
    by his mother. His claim was refused and the appeal was dismissed in  a
    determination promulgated  on  2  October  2007  of  Immigration  Judge
    Cheales.

 5. The appellant, his mother and his sister were  all  granted  indefinite
    leave to remain in February 2008.  According  to  the  decision  of  22
    January 2013 the grant of indefinite leave was made under the  "legacy"
    policy.

 6. On 14 March 2011 the appellant committed an aggravated burglary and the
    offence of possessing an imitation firearm. The facts  of  the  offence
    were that he and two others entered a home, each taking it in  turn  to
    threaten the residents with a knife whilst the others  went  round  the
    house finding items to steal. The appellant was 17 years'  old  at  the
    time of the offence and was sentenced on 15 July 2011  to  3  �  years'
    imprisonment in a Young Offender Institution.

 7. The appellant was informed on 16 December 2011 that deportation  action
    would  be  taken  against   him.   With   the   assistance   of   legal
    representatives he made a number  of  written  submissions  which  were
    accepted as an asylum and human rights claim and he was interviewed. On
    22 January 2013 the respondent  issued  the  decision  which  is  under
    appeal before us.

 8. The decision found that the seriousness of the appellant's crime  meant
    that he fell to be excluded from the Refugee Convention by operation of
    s.72 of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and  from
    Humanitarian  protection  by  operation  of  paragraph  339D   of   the
    Immigration Rules.  In  addition,  the  substance  of  the  appellant's
    protection claim was not found credible.  The respondent did not accept
    that deportation amounted to a breach of his rights  under  Articles  3
    and 8 of the ECHR.

 9.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   in   a
    determination promulgated on 22 March 2013, his appeal was  refused  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade and Mr G H Getlevog.

10. The First-tier Tribunal approached the appeal on  the  incorrect  basis
    that the respondent's decision had been made under Section 32 of the UK
    Borders Act 2007.  The decision also failed to  address  the  issue  of
    exclusion from the Refugee Convention and Humanitarian Protection.  The
    First-tier  Tribunal  found,  however,  that  the  substance   of   the
    appellant's protection claim failed in so far as it was the same as his
    earlier claim rejected by Judge Cheales. A further protection claim  of
    risk arising from the appellant's profile as a  criminal  deportee  was
    not found to have merit.

11. The First-tier Tribunal also found that the appellant's Article 8 claim
    failed where his offence was so serious and because, at  [9],   in  his
    oral evidence the appellant had continued to be  untruthful  about  the
    circumstances around his offence, something he had  also  tried  to  do
    when arrested, essentially seeking to  minimise  his  involvement.  The
    First-tier Tribunal also found at  [9]  that  the  appellant  had  been
    untruthful about contact after conviction with  his  co-accused.  Their
    comments on these points were as follows:

         "9. There can be no question that  the  offence  committed  by  the
         Appellant in 2011 was one of utmost seriousness.  He  was  sent  to
         custody for a period of three and a  half  years  for  offences  of
         aggravated burglary and possession of a firearm. It is apposite  to
         quote the learned judge in his sentencing remarks when  he  said  a
         follows:-

             "This  was  a  well  organised   offence   with   professional
             hallmarks. The three of  you  obviously  planned  the  offence
             together before it was committed. You targeted the house where
             you expected there  to  be  valuable  items  for  taking.  You
             expected the house to be occupied otherwise you would not have
             taken  the  knife,  the  imitation  firearm   and   worn   the
             balaclavas. You had  obviously  obtained  the  knife  and  the
             imitation firearm with the purpose of committing this offence.
             You wore masks and/or balaclavas. You wore gloves  plainly  to
             avoid leaving fingerprints. ... You, [AK]  had  the  imitation
             firearm ... Whilst you took turns to  guard  the  victims  for
             about twenty minutes the house was  comprehensively  ransacked
             by those who were not keeping guard."

         We note that despite all three of the defendants being caught  red-
         handed inside the property it was the Appellant, who  according  to
         the judge "tried to blag your way out of it  with  some  lies".  We
         find it of some concern now that at the appeal  hearing  before  us
         the Appellant when invited by his representative to give an account
         of the offence was content to continue to  tell  lies  by  claiming
         before us that he knew not why he as going to the  house  with  his
         two associates but simply went along without having  any  intention
         to do wrong. Not only is this a fabrication we  hold  it  to  be  a
         worrying sign that even after all of this time  the  Appellant  has
         not taken anything like full responsibility for the  serious  crime
         that he has committed. Still we noted that he attempted to give the
         impression at the hearing that  following  his  conviction  he  has
         disassociated himself from his co-accused  [AN]  when  in  fact  we
         noted from the OASys report that not only were the two of  them  in
         the same prison  together  but  also  that  the  Appellant  and  AN
         continued to have regular contact  such  that  they  both  remained
         friends and were happy to continue their friendships."

12. The  appellant  appealed  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Permission was granted on all grounds in a decision dated 11 April 2013
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Nightingale. On 2  July  2013  the  appeal
    came before Upper Tribunal Judges Perkins  and  McKee.  The  respondent
    conceded material error on ground 1  as  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    treated the appeal as if it  was  against  automatic  deportation.  The
    Upper Tribunal also found  ground  2  made  out  where  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had not applied the principles set out  in  Maslov  v  Austria
    [2008] ECHR 546.

13. Having found those errors of law, the First-tier Tribunal did not  deal
    with grounds 3 or 4. Ground 3 is at paragraph 14 of the written grounds
    dated 3 April 2013, thus:

         "The Appellant respectfully submits that the Tribunal unfairly  and
         irrationally concluded that the Appellant continued to  tell  lies.
         His evidence about the circumstances leading up to the offences was
         cut short by the Tribunal, as will be made clear by an  examination
         of the record of proceedings, the Appellant was not seeking  to  go
         behind the conviction but rather explain the circumstances  of  the
         conviction in order to provide an explanation for what was  on  the
         face of it conduct that was out of character. For the  Tribunal  to
         fairly  reach  conclusions  that  the  Appellant  told   lies   and
         fabrications then not only does it have a  duty  to  hear  all  the
         evidence, it also has a duty to provide a reasoned  explanation  as
         to why it reaches such conclusions."

14. Ground 4 maintained that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  as  the
    country evidence  showed  that  criminal  deportees  faced  a  risk  of
    mistreatment on return to DRC.

15. However, as above, the Upper Tribunal did find grounds 1 and 2 made out
    and proceeded to set aside and re-make the appeal,  allowing  it  under
    Article 8 ECHR in a determination promulgated on 15 July 2013. Part  of
    the reasoning for allowing the appeal was that  Maslov  required  "very
    serious reasons" for deportation where  the  appellant  was  a  settled
    migrant who had spent a major part of  his  childhood  in  the  UK  and
    committed the offence whilst a minor.

16. The respondent appealed the decision of the Upper Tribunal to the Court
    of Appeal on the ground  that  Maslov  had  been  applied  incorrectly.
    Permission was granted by Elias LJ in an order dated  4  November  2013
    and the case linked with another for  the  question  of  how  to  apply
    Maslov to be addressed by the Court.

17. In a decision reported on 8 July 2014 as Akpinar v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ
    937 in which this appellant was referred to as AV, the Court of  Appeal
    found that the Upper Tribunal had erred in its application  of  Maslov.
    The Court found that although the issue of long residence  as  a  child
    and offending whilst a juvenile were  relevant  factors  there  was  no
    "very serious reasons" test.

18. In an order of the same date, this appeal was  remitted  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in these terms:

         "The SSHD's appeal against the decision of the Upper Tribunal in AV
         v SSHD is allowed and the  matter  is  remitted  to  a  differently
         constituted Upper Tribunal:

               a. to determine whether there  was  any  material  procedural
                  error or unfairness in the proceedings  before  the  First
                  Tier Tribunal; and

               b. to  determine  for  itself,  or  remit  to  a  differently
                  constituted First Tier Tribunal, the questions of  whether
                  AV's deportation would breach his rights under Articles  3
                  and/or 8 of the ECHR and/or under the Refugee Convention."

19. We also found [57] to [59] of Akpinar of assistance in establishing the
    scope of the remittal:

         "AV

         57. AV had committed a serious  offence  involving  violence.  That
         fact does not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that  he
         should be deported. My difficulty with  the  determination  of  the
         Upper Tribunal is that the only error of law that it found  on  the
         part of the First-tier Tribunal,  namely  the  mistaken  assumption
         that his was a case of an automatic deportation order, did not bear
         on the First-tier Tribunal's findings of primary facts.  The  Upper
         Tribunal made  no  finding  that  justified  its  making  different
         primary  factual  findings  from  those  made  by  the   First-tier
         Tribunal. Moreover, since the Upper Tribunal did not hear any  oral
         evidence, it was in  no  position  to  make  findings  as  to  AV's
         credibility or his remorse (or lack of  it)  differing  from  those
         made by the First-tier Tribunal which had heard his oral evidence.

         58. Counsel for AV contended before the  Upper  Tribunal  that  the
         First-tier Tribunal had cut short his evidence to  it,  and  should
         not have done so. However, the Upper Tribunal made no finding as to
         whether this contention was justified, and if so whether there  was
         a material irregularity. A tribunal may be entitled to cut short  a
         witness's evidence if, for example, it has  become  repetitious  or
         irrelevant.

         59. In these circumstances, it seems to me that this  Court  should
         allow the Secretary of State's appeal and remit AV's appeal  to  be
         heard afresh by a differently-constituted Upper Tribunal which  can
         determine  whether  or  not  there  was  any  unfairness   in   the
         proceedings  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  if   so   the
         consequences, and in particular  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         made any material procedural error. The Upper  Tribunal  will  then
         determine AV's claim on the facts  established  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal or by the Upper Tribunal itself."

20. We can deal with the procedural error challenge relatively quickly.  Mr
    Karnik, counsel for the appellant before the First-tier  Tribunal,  did
    not have a record of  proceedings  from  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He
    indicated that there was no prospect of obtaining  one  even  after  an
    adjournment. The hand-written record of  proceedings  on  the  Tribunal
    file did not assist in identifying if or how  the  appellant  was  "cut
    off" or otherwise prevented from giving evidence on his  conviction  or
    any other matters. Ground 3 of the written grounds dated 3  April  2014
    is clearly predicated on there being such a record  of  proceedings  to
    support the challenge. We did not find that this ground could  be  made
    out without one.

21. Mr Karnik sought to  argue  that  the  conclusions  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal at  [9]  of  the  decision  were  not  permissible  given  the
    appellant's evidence in his witness statement and elsewhere  about  his
    offence and that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not  given  sufficient
    reasons for their findings at  [9]  as  to  the  appellant  seeking  to
    minimise his offence. He suggested that was also the  case  as  regards
    the finding at [9] that the  appellant  had  not  been  truthful  about
    contact after conviction with his co-accused.

22. That, however, to our minds, attempts to re-formulate what is  said  in
    ground 3 as an adequacy of reasons challenge or rationality  challenge.
    This ground was manifestly based on the allegation that the  First-tier
    Tribunal prevented the appellant from giving  evidence  on  a  material
    matter. The wording clearly indicates that the challenge would be  made
    out relying on a record of proceedings. There  is  no  such  record  of
    proceedings. Further, nothing is said  at  all  in  ground  3  about  a
    challenge to the finding  on  the  appellant's  contact  with  his  co-
    accused.  Further, the terms of the remittal from the Court of  Appeal,
    made very clear at [58] of Akpinar, concern only "procedural  error  or
    unfairness" not inadequacy of reasons or rationality.

23. This submission appeared to us to be additionally without  merit  where
    the sentencing remarks recorded  at  [9]  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination show  a  level  of  premeditation  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant that left it entirely open to the Tribunal to  conclude  that
    that the appellant's statement of not knowing why he went to the  house
    was a "fabrication" and "a worrying sign that even after  all  of  this
    time the Appellant has not taken anything like full responsibility  for
    the serious crime he has committed."

24. We can also deal economically with the  appellant's  protection  claim.
    The appellant does not appear ever to have  challenged  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's failure to deal  with  the  respondent's  decision  on  s.72
    certification of his  asylum  claim  and  exclusion  from  Humanitarian
    Protection. The Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal say  nothing  on
    the matter in their decisions. Where the  Court  of  Appeal  refers  in
    terms in the order of 8 July 2013 to the requirement for us to  address
    the appellant's refugee  claim,  however,  possibly  out  of  too  much
    caution, we address the point now.

25.  The  exclusion  from  Humanitarian  Protection  must  stand   as   the
    appellant's 3 � year sentence brings him within  paragraph  399D(i)  of
    the Immigration Rules. As  well  as  a  serious  offence  attracting  a
    sentence of 2 years' or more being required, exclusion from the Refugee
    Convention under s.72  also  requires  a  finding  that  the  applicant
    constitutes a danger to the community of the UK. It appears  to  us  on
    the basis of the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  at  [9]  on  the
    appellant's "worrying" failure to take  responsibility  for  his  crime
    that  the  presumption  of  his  being  a  danger  was  not   rebutted,
    notwithstanding the lack of  offending  since  2011  and  low  risk  of
    reoffending identified by the Probation Service.

26. If we are wrong on the certification of the asylum  claim,  the  extant
    protection claim still cannot succeed. There was no  challenge  to  the
    finding of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellant's  protection
    claim based on ethnicity and events prior to his  leaving  DRC  failed.
    The claim before us concerns only the appellant's profile as a criminal
    deportee. That matter has been settled against the appellant by BM  and
    Others (returnees - criminal and non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] UKUT 00293
    (IAC). Quite sensibly, the legal representatives did not seek the  take
    the protection aspects of the appeal any further before us.

27. It therefore remains for us  to  re-make  the  Article  8  ECHR  appeal
    against deportation on the basis of the findings of fact of the  First-
    tier Tribunal. After an adjournment for Mr Karnik to take instructions,
    we heard up-dating evidence from the  appellant  and  his  mother.  The
    appellant's mother was  able  to  give  her  evidence  in  English,  no
    suggestion being made at any point that she had not understood or  been
    unable to give her answers accurately.

Re-making the Appeal

28. Since this appeal was last considered, Section 19  of  the  Immigration
    Act 2014 has inserted Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 with  effect  from  28th  July  2014.  All  deportation
    appeals heard after that date, whether the decision to  deport  or  the
    deportation order was made prior to that date or not,  are  subject  to
    this new statutory scheme; Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74 applied.

29. The relevant parts of section 117A-C are as follows:

         117A Application of this Part

           (1)    This Part applies where a court or tribunal  is  required
                to determine whether a decision made under  the  Immigration
                Acts-

                (a)    breaches a person's right to respect for private  and
                    family life under Article 8, and

                (b)    as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the
                    Human Rights Act 1998.

           (2)    In considering the public interest question, the court or
                tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

                (a)    in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
                    117B, and

                (b)     in  cases  concerning  the  deportation  of  foreign
                    criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.



           (3)    In subsection (2), "the public interest  question"  means
                the question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's
                right to respect for private and family  life  is  justified
                under Article 8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

           (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
                the public interest.

           (2)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,
                that persons who seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
                Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons  who  can
                speak English-

            [pic] [pic]  [pic]

                (a)    are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b)    are better able to integrate into society.

           (3)    It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
                interests of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,
                that persons who seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
                Kingdom are financially independent, because such persons-

                (a)    are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                (b)    are better able to integrate into society.

           (4)    Little weight should be given to-

                (a)    a private life, or

                (b)    a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that
                    is established by a person at a time when the person  is
                    in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5)     Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
                established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                immigration status is precarious.

           (6)    In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
                the public interest does not require  the  person's  removal
                where-

                (a)    the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a qualifying child, and

                (b)    it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                    leave the United Kingdom.

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

           (1)    The deportation of foreign criminals  is  in  the  public
                interest.

           (2)    The more serious  the  offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                criminal, the greater is the public interest in  deportation
                of the criminal.

           (3)    In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not  been
                sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more,
                the  public  interest  requires   C's   deportation   unless
                Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.

           (4)         Exception 1 applies where-

                (a)    C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                    for most of C's life,

                (b)    C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                    Kingdom, and

                (c)    there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                    integration into the country to which C is  proposed  to
                    be deported.

           (5)    Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and  subsisting
                relationship with a qualifying partner,  or  a  genuine  and
                subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child,
                and the effect of C's deportation on the  partner  or  child
                would be unduly harsh.

           (6)    In the case of a foreign criminal who has been  sentenced
                to a period of imprisonment of  at  least  four  years,  the
                public interest requires deportation unless there  are  very
                compelling circumstances, over and above those described  in
                Exceptions 1 and 2.

           (7)    The considerations in subsections (1) to (6)  are  to  be
                taken into account where a court or tribunal is  considering
                a decision to deport a foreign criminal only to  the  extent
                that the reason for the decision was the offence or offences
                for which the criminal has been convicted.

30. The Immigration Rules have also been amended and for our  purposes  are
    as follows:

         Deportation and Article 8

         A398. These rules apply where:

         (a) a foreign  criminal  liable  to  deportation  claims  that  his
         deportation would be contrary to the United  Kingdom's  obligations
         under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

         (b) a foreign criminal applies for a deportation order made against
         him to be revoked.

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
         Convention, and

         (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

         (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;

         (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law, the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i) the child is a British Citizen; or

             (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least
             the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration
             decision; and in either case

             (a) it would be unduly harsh for the  child  to  live  in  the
             country to which the person is to be deported; and

             (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK
             without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and

             (i) the relationship was formed at  a  time  when  the  person
             (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status
             was not precarious; and

             (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in  the
             country to which the person is  to  be  deported,  because  of
             compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
             paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to  remain  in
             the UK without the person who is to be deported.

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -

         (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his
         life; and

         (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles  to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

31. The appellant does not claim to have a relationship  with  a  child  or
    partner for the purposes of paragraph 399. He  has  not  been  lawfully
    resident in the UK for most of his  life,  having  obtained  indefinite
    leave to remain only in 2008, so cannot come within the  provisions  of
    paragraph 399A.  For  the  same  reasons  he  also  falls  outwith  the
    substantive provisions of section 117C.

32. Following paragraph 398, therefore, we must assess  whether  there  are
    very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  described  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A which  can  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    deportation.

33. The head note of Chege (section 117D - Article  8  -  approach)  [2015]
    UKUT 00165 (IAC) states:

         "The correct approach, where an appeal on human rights grounds  has
         been brought in seeking to resist deportation, is to consider:

             (i) is the appellant a foreign criminal as  defined  by  s117D
             (2) (a), (b) or (c);

             (ii) if so, does he fall within paragraph 399 or 399A  of  the
             Immigration Rules;

             (iii) if not are there very compelling circumstances over  and
             beyond those falling within 399 and  399A  relied  upon,  such
             identification to  be  informed  by  the  seriousness  of  the
             criminality and taking into account the  factors  set  out  in
             s117B.

         Compelling as an adjective has the meaning of having a powerful and
         irresistible effect; convincing.

         The purpose of paragraph 398 is to recognize circumstances that are
         sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh  the  public   interest   in
         deportation but do not fall within paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         The task of the judge is to assess the competing interests  and  to
         determine whether an interference with a person's right to  respect
         for private and family life is  justified  under  Article  8(2)  or
         whether   the   public   interest    arguments    should    prevail
         notwithstanding the engagement of Article 8.

         It follows from this that if an appeal does not  succeed  on  human
         rights grounds,  paragraph  397  provides  the  respondent  with  a
         residual  discretion  to  grant  leave  to  remain  in  exceptional
         circumstances where an appellant cannot succeed by invoking  rights
         protected by Article 8 of the ECHR."

34. In addition to the clarification in Chege on the assessment to be made,
    when doing so we must also apply the provisions of  paragraph  117B  of
    the Immigration Rules.

35. It did not appear to us that the provisions of paragraph 117B  assisted
    the appellant  in  making  out  sufficiently  compelling  circumstances
    outweighing the public interest in  his  deportation.  Where  he  is  a
    foreign national criminal, the public interest weighs very strongly  in
    his deportation where he committed this very serious offence. He speaks
    English but the operation of s.117B does  not  mean  that  this  weighs
    positively in his favour; see AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC)
    and Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC)  applied.
    We accept that the appellant is working, is financially independent and
    is helping to support his mother and younger siblings. Again,  he  does
    not gain positive weight from that.

36. Section 117B(5) mandates that  little  weight  should  be  given  to  a
    private life that is established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious. AM (S  117B)  Malawi  [2015]
    UKUT 0260 (IAC) states at paragraph 5 of the head note that:

         "5. In some circumstances it may also be that even  a  person  with
         indefinite  leave  to  remain,  or  a  person  who   has   obtained
         citizenship, enjoys a status that is  "precarious"  either  because
         that status is revocable by the Secretary of State as a  result  of
         their deception, or because of  their  criminal  conduct.  In  such
         circumstances the person will be well aware that he has  imperilled
         his status and cannot viably claim thereafter that  his  status  is
         other than precarious."

37. It was our view that the appellant has known since March 2011  when  he
    committed his offence that his presence in the UK  was  precarious  and
    that little weight attracts to the private life  developed  thereafter.
    Certainly, he was informed by the respondent of the intention to deport
    him as long ago as 16 December 2011. Good behaviour since then, in  the
    light of that knowledge, to our minds, carried less weight, really only
    being what should be expected and not capable here of amounting to very
    compelling  circumstances  beyond  what  is  already  provided  for  in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.

38. The appellant does not qualify for consideration under section  117B(6)
    where he is subject to deportation.

39. Part of the appellant's case against deportation is that he came to the
    UK from DRC when he was 11 years' old, some  10  years'  ago,  has  not
    returned since and has little knowledge of the country.  We  noted  his
    mother's evidence that he went to school there, however.  The  evidence
    is  also  that  the  family  retained  some  links  to  DRC  where  the
    appellant's younger brother was there being cared for by a third  party
    until quite recently. We accept  that  the  appellant  does  not  speak
    fluent French but he has grown up in a household  where  this  was  the
    main language used between his mother and the children and  he  accepts
    that he has some knowledge of the language.

40. We also took into account that the appellant's offence occurred when he
    was a minor and the low risk of reoffending that has been identified by
    the  probation  service.  We  accept  that  he   has   acted   entirely
    appropriately and cooperatively with the criminal justice system  since
    conviction and has been successful in education and work since  leaving
    prison. There is also a public interest  in  deportation  acting  as  a
    deterrent and expression of public revulsion at serious offending  such
    as this, however, matters that still fall to  be  weighed  against  the
    appellant even if the risk of reoffending is low.

41. We accept that he has good relationships with his  mother  and  younger
    siblings and that all will be badly affected by his deportation.

42. It remains the case that, in our view, even considering the evidence in
    his favour at its highest, the appellant has not shown "very compelling
    circumstances"  that  can  outweigh  the   public   interest   in   his
    deportation. We must therefore dismiss the appeal.

Decision

43. The appeal is re-made as dismissed.
