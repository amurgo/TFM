For the Respondent:    Mr. Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal ("FtT")
    Judge Hollis promulgated on 9th January 2018.  The FtT Judge dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 5th
    February 2017 refusing her application for leave to enter the UK as the
    spouse of Mr. Imran Zubair, a British Citizen.


 2. Broadly stated, the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant's
    sponsor is employed as claimed, by AV Asia Enterprises Ltd as a Machine
    Operator and that he was earning �18,720.00, as claimed.  The
    respondent noted that the appellant had previously applied for a spouse
    visa that had been refused because the Entry Clearance Officer was not
    satisfied that the appellant's sponsor's employment was genuine, and
    the appellant had not addressed the concerns regarding that employment.




 3. The appeal was dismissed by FtT Judge Hollis.  Permission to appeal was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Black on 1st August 2018. The matter
    comes before me to consider whether or not the decision of FtT Judge
    Hollis involved the making of a material error of law, and if the
    decision is set aside, to re-make the decision.


 4. At the conclusion of the hearing before me, I announced that in my
    judgement, the decision of the FtT is infected by a material error of
    law and the decision of the FtT is set aside.  I informed the parties
    that as to the disposal of the appeal, it is appropriate for me to
    remake the decision and I do so allowing the appeal, on human rights
    grounds.  I said that I would give the reasons for my decision in
    writing.  This I now do.


The decision of the FtT Judge


 5. The FtT Judge set out a summary of the findings and reasons for the
    decision at paragraphs [19] to [41] of the decision.  The Judge found,
    at [32], that the appellant's sponsor is genuinely employed as claimed
    by AV Asia Enterprises Ltd as a Machine Operator.  The Judge went on to
    consider whether the minimum income requirements set out in the
    Immigration Rules are met.  At paragraph [35], the Judge stated:


         "I, therefore conclude, on the evidence taken as a whole that the
         Appellant's sponsor is genuinely employed as claimed but that his
         gross annual income for the relevant period prior to the date of
         the application before me, namely, the 24th January 2017, was less
         that the minimum of �18,600 required by the rules."


 6. The Judge noted that the appellant and her husband have maintained
    their married life using modern methods of communication and there is
    no evidence that family life could not continue in that way whilst a
    fresh application is made. The Judge found that there was no reason why
    the sponsor cannot travel to Pakistan during his annual holidays and
    maintain any family life, and that there are no exceptional
    circumstances to show the refusal of the application is in breach of
    the appellant's Article 8 rights.  The Judge was not satisfied that the
    appellant and sponsor have a family life that ought to be protected by
    Article 8.  The Judge stated, at [42], as follows:


         "In the light of the above conclusions, I find that the decision
         appealed against would not cause the UK to be in breach of the law
         or its obligations under Article 8 [of] the 1950 Convention.  The
         UK Government has done no more than apply its valid Immigration
         Rules and Law to the Appellant's application in furtherance of its
         legitimate aims of proper immigration control and the economic well-
         being of the UK in refusing the application and the Appellant has
         failed to show, on the balance of probabilities, that she met the
         relevant rule."


Error of Law


 7. The appellant accepts that paragraph E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM requires
    an applicant to provide specified evidence of a gross annual income of
    at least �18,600.  The appellant claims that the FtT Judge erred in his
    analysis of whether the minimum income requirement could be met because
    the FtT Judge relied upon a P60 for the year ending 5th April 2017 that
    showed a gross annual income of �17,484 for the period 6th April 2016
    to 5th April 2017.  The drop in the appellant's earnings during that
    tax year was caused by unpaid leave in April and May 2016.  The
    appellant claims that Appendix FM-SE requires, in respect of salaried
    employment in the UK, payslips covering a period of 6 months prior to
    the date of application if the person has been employed by their
    current employer for at least 6 months, as here.  The applicant claims
    that there was evidence in the form of wage slips for the 6-month
    period between June 2016 and December 2016 that established that the
    appellant's sponsor was paid �1560 gross per calendar month, amounting
    to �18,720 per annum.


 8. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Marrington submits that the FtT Judge
    erred in resolving the question as to whether the minimum income
    requirement found in the immigration rules could be met, by reference
    to the P60 for the year ending April 2017.  He submits that the
    evidence before the FtT Judge established that the appellant's sponsor
    had been employed by AV Asia Enterprises Ltd since 11th May 2015, and
    that there was evidence before the FtT Judge, in the letter from AV
    Asia Enterprises Ltd, that the appellant's sponsor was paid �1560 gross
    per calendar month.  He submits that there was also evidence in the
    form of wage slips for the 6-month period between June 2016 and
    December 2016 (at pages 42 to 55 of the appellant's bundle) that
    establish that the appellant's sponsor received a gross salary of �1560
    per month and the wage slips were supported by the corresponding
    cheques and personal bank statements for the same period, showing that
    the salary has been paid into an account in the name of the appellant's
    sponsor.


 9. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Diwnycz submits that it is unfortunate
    that the wage slips for April and May 2016 (that are to be found at
    pages 37 and 38 of the appellant's bundle), do not explain that the
    reduction in hours during those two months was caused by unpaid leave.
    He accepts, properly in my judgment, that the wage slips for the 6-
    month period between June 2016 and December 2016 that were before the
    FtT Judge, establish that the appellant's sponsor received a gross
    salary of �1560 per month, and that that amounts to a gross salary
    exceeding the required �18,600 per annum.


10. Paragraph E-LTRP.3.1(a)(i) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules
    requires that the appellant must provide specified evidence of a gross
    annual income of at least �18,600.  Insofar as is relevant, Appendix FM-
    SE A1(2) provides as follows:


         In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph
         9 applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:


         (a)  Payslips covering:


             (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application if
             the person has been employed by their current employer for at
             least 6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix
             does not apply); or


             (ii) any period of salaried employment in the period of 12
             months prior to the date of application if the person has been
             employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or
             at least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph
             13(a) of this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied
             upon by a self-employed person.


         (b)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at
         paragraph 2(a) confirming:


             (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;


             (ii) the length of their employment;


             (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the
             level of salary relied upon in the application; and


             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
             agency).


         (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s)
         as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of
         the person and their partner jointly.


         ...


11. The appellant made her application on 24th January 2017.  She was
    required to provide payslips covering a period of 6 months prior to the
    date of application (i.e. June 2016 to December 2016), and personal
    bank statements corresponding to the same period.  For the relevant 6
    months prior to the application, the FtT Judge had before him the
    payslips and bank statements relating to the sponsor's employment,
    which the FtT Judge found to be genuine, that demonstrated that the
    appellant's sponsor received a gross salary of �1560 per month.  That
    amounts to a gross salary exceeding the required �18,600 per annum.


12. In my judgement, the FtT Judge erred in his analysis of the sponsor's
    gross salary by reference to the P60 for the year ending 5th April
    2017.  Although it is right that during that tax year, the appellant's
    sponsor in fact received a gross annual income of �17,484, that did not
    undermine the evidence from the sponsor's employer that the appellant's
    sponsor received a gross salary of �1560 per month, amounting to a
    gross annual income of �18,720.  The shortfall during the tax year
    ending 5th April 2017 was explained by the unpaid leave that the
    appellant's sponsor had taken during that tax year in April and May
    2016, to travel to Pakistan to visit the appellant. Appendix FM-SE only
    required the appellant to provide payslips covering a period of 6-
    months prior to the date of application, as the sponsor had been
    employed by his current employer for at least 6 months, together with
    personal bank statements corresponding to the same period as the
    payslips showing that the salary has been paid into an account in the
    name of the appellant's sponsor.  That specified evidence was indeed
    provided, and was before the FtT Judge.


13. Having found that the appellant's sponsor is genuinely employed as
    claimed, in my judgement, the FtT Judge erred in concluding that the
    minimum income requirement was not met.  The Judge failed to consider
    the explanation for the reduced earnings during the tax year to 5th
    April 2017 and failed to appreciate that Appendix FM-SE required the
    appellant to establish the minimum income requirement by refence to
    payslips and bank statements covering a period of 6-months prior to the
    date of application, because the sponsor had been employed by his
    current employer for at least 6 months.


14. In any event, the FtT Judge appears, at paragraph [42] to simply find
    that the decision to refuse entry clearance is not in breach of Article
    8 because the respondent has done no more than apply the immigration
    rules in furtherance of the legitimate aims of proper immigration
    control and the economic well-being of the UK, in circumstances where
    the appellant has failed to show, on the balance of probabilities, that
    she met the relevant rule.  The judgments of the Supreme Court in
    Agyarko -v- SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 and in MM (Lebanon) establish that the
    fact that the rules cannot be met, does not absolve decision makers
    from carrying out a full merits-based assessment outside the rules
    under Article 8, where the ultimate issue is whether a fair balance has
    been struck between the individual and public interest, giving due
    weight to the provisions of the Rules.


15. It follows that in my judgement, the decision of the FtT Judge is
    infected by a material error of law and must be set aside.


Re-making the decision


16. The only ground of appeal  available  to  the  appellant  is  that  the
    respondent's decision is unlawful under s6  of  the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998.  As to the Article 8 claim, the  burden  of  proof  is  upon  the
    appellant to show, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  she  has
    established a family life with her husband, and that her exclusion from
    the UK as a result of the respondent's decision, would  interfere  with
    that right. It is then for the respondent to justify  any  interference
    caused. The respondent's decision must be in accordance  with  the  law
    and must be a proportionate response  in  all  the  circumstances.   If
    Article 8 is engaged, the Tribunal may need to look at  the  extent  to
    which an appellant is said to have failed to meet the  requirements  of
    the rules,  because  that  may  inform  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise that must follow.


17. As to the human rights claim on Article 8 grounds, I adopt the approach
    set out by Lord Bingham  in  Razgar  [2014]  UKHL  27.   I  must  first
    determine whether Article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all.  If  Article
    8 is engaged, I should go on to  consider  the  remaining  four  stages
    identified in Razgar.


18. The respondent did not claim that the appellant is not married  to,  or
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship with her  partner,  who  is  a
    British Citizen.  At paragraph [19] of  his  decision,  the  FtT  Judge
    noted that the appellant's age, gender, nationality, and marital status
    are not in dispute.


19. I find that the appellant enjoys family life with her husband.  I  also
    find that the decision to refuse the appellant leave to enter may  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8.  I accept that the interference is in  accordance  with  the
    law, and that the interference is necessary  to  protect  the  economic
    well-being of the country.


20. The issue in this  appeal,  as  is  often  the  case,  is  whether  the
    interference is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved.  In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held that the claimant's ability  to  satisfy
    the immigration rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
    Tribunal, but is capable of being a weighty, though  not  determinative
    factor, when deciding whether such  refusal  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control.


21. The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant's sponsor is
    employed and paid as claimed.  The FtT Judge found that the appellant's
    sponsor is genuinely employed as claimed by AV Asia Enterprises Ltd.
    That finding is not challenged by the respondent. Before me, Mr
    Diwnycz, very fairly, accepted that the evidence before the FtT Judge
    was sufficient to satisfy the minimum income requirements set out in
    Appendix FM by reference to Appendix FM-SE.  Appendix FM-SE required
    the appellant to provide payslips relating to her sponsor's salaried
    employment covering a period of 6 months prior to the date of
    application (i.e. June 2016 to December 2016), and personal bank
    statements corresponding to the same period.  There is before me, the
    required evidence that demonstrates that the appellant's sponsor
    received a gross salary of �1560 per month.  That amounts to a gross
    salary exceeding the required �18,600 per annum.  There is also in the
    appellant's bundle (at pages 6 to 8), a copy of the appellant's
    sponsor's passport that shows that the appellant's sponsor travelled to
    Pakistan in April 2016.  He entered Pakistan on 14th April 2016 and
    exited on 13th May 2016.  I accept the explanation given by the
    appellant's sponsor that he took unpaid leave between mid-April and mid-
    May 2016, and that is why the P60 for the year ending April 2017
    discloses a gross income during that tax year of �17,484.


22. I remind myself that section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 requires that in considering the public interest
    question, I must (in particular) have regard to the considerations
    listed in section 117B.  I acknowledge that the maintenance of
    effective immigration controls is in the public interest. On the
    evidence before me, and in light of my findings and the unchallenged
    findings made by the FtT Judge, I am satisfied that the appellant is
    able to meet the substantive part of the rules.  There is nothing in my
    judgment that weighs against the appellant in a proportionality
    assessment.


23. Having carefully considered the evidence before me, and taking all the
    relevant factors into account including those in S117B of the 2002 Act,
    I am satisfied, on the facts here, that the decision to refuse the
    appellant leave to enter the UK as a partner, is disproportionate to
    the legitimate aim of immigration control. Accordingly, I am satisfied
    that the decision to exclude the appellant would be in breach of
    Article 8.


24. It follows that I set aside the decision of the FtT Judge and the
    appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds.


Notice of Decision


25. The decision of the FtT Judge involved the making of an error of law
    such that it is set aside.


26. I re-make the decision and allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.


27. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT


FEE AWARD


Although I have allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds, I decline to make
a fee award in favour of the appellant.  The appeal has been allowed based
on the evidence before me, including the explanation for reduce earnings
during the tax year to 5th April 2017 and the evidence of the appellant's
sponsor having travelled to Pakistan in April 2016, that was not before the
respondent at the time of the decision appealed.
