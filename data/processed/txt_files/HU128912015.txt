                    Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hindson made following a hearing at North Shields on 11th May 2017.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  10th  March  1986.   He
    applied to come to the UK as the spouse of a person present and settled
    here but was refused on the grounds that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    did not accept that he was in a genuine and subsisting relationship nor
    that the financial requirements were met.

 3. The Immigration Judge found that the relationship  between  the  couple
    was genuine and subsisting and there is no challenge to that aspect  of
    his decision.

 4. So far as the financial requirements of  the  Rules  are  concerned  he
    wrote as follows

         "I now consider the sponsor's financial  circumstances.   She  gave
         oral evidence about her earnings which show that she just meets the
         18,600 threshold.  She has provided her self-assessment tax returns
         for the financial years 2015 to 16 and 2016 to 17.  Both  show  her
         total earnings to be  in  excess  of  19,000  per  annum  which  is
         sufficient to meet the threshold.  I  accept  that  she  failed  to
         provide the specific  evidence  in  connection  with  the  original
         application.  However I am satisfied on the basis of the  documents
         available to me, and on her oral evidence, that she  does  in  fact
         earn sufficient to meet the financial requirements."

 5. The judge acknowledged that the appellant had  not  met  the  specified
    evidence requirements of the Rules, but given that the couple have been
    living  apart  for  two  years  he   concluded   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate to require them to continue to do so in order  that  a
    further application could be made and considered.

 6. On that basis he allowed the appeal.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    it was not clear  what  the  basis  was  for  the  Immigration  Judge's
    conclusions that the claimant had met the income threshold, or that the
    requirements had in fact been met.  Neither had the judge undertaken  a
    proper balancing exercise  in  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the
    decision, given that the specified evidence Rules clearly  reflect  the
    policy of maintaining the  integrity  of  the  immigration  system  and
    ensuring that decision making is fair and consistent.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Omotosho on 7th December 2017
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

 9. Following the  grant  of  permission  the  claimant  filed  a  detailed
    response setting out the evidence which  was  before  the  judge  which
    formed the basis of his  decision,  and  arguing  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to reach the decision that he did.



Submissions

10. Mrs Petterson accepted that the judge was entitled to allow the  appeal
    on  human  rights  grounds  even  given  that  the  specified  evidence
    requirements of the Rules had not been met.  However she submitted that
    it was simply not at all clear from the determination  what  the  basis
    was for the judge concluding that the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules had been met.



Findings and Conclusions

11. This determination lacks detail which makes it  vulnerable  to  appeal.
    However it is clear that in fact the  evidence  was  before  the  judge
    which enabled him to see that the sponsor's income was in excess of the
    �18,600 threshold.

12. The sponsor  has  three  sources  of  income.   Her  income  from  paid
    employment is undisputed.  She  has  two  further  sources  of  income,
    namely from self-employment and rental income.

13. So far as that is concerned, the sponsor provided  evidence  of  a  tax
    calculation for the relevant tax year, which was in fact 2014 to  2015,
    stating that she had �11,188 from her employment, �6,892 from her self-
    employment and �1,540 from her land and property,  making  a  total  of
    �19,620.  She also had a self-assessment statement for the  same  year.
    Mr Macreadie told me, and Mrs Petterson did not dispute, that  the  tax
    calculation from HMRC would have been based upon a tax return from  the
    sponsor and so, whilst there was not a tax return  for  that  tax  year
    before the Immigration Judge, the tax calculation  established  that  a
    return would have been made.  There were tax returns for the subsequent
    years.

14. In relation to the rental income, the sponsor provided evidence of  her
    purchase of the property and a tenancy agreement.  She also provided  a
    set of bank statements for the relevant years to the judge which showed
    the income being paid from 9th March 2015 on a monthly basis.

15. So far as the self-employment  is  concerned  the  sponsor  provided  a
    letter from her accountant stating that she was self-employed and  that
    they had prepared an account for the year ending 5th April 2015 for the
    submission of her  self-assessment  tax  return.   According  to  their
    accounts, her self-employed income for  the  period  was  �6,892.   The
    judge also heard oral evidence from  the  sponsor.   She  was  able  to
    identify the credits in the bank account  which  came  from  her  self-
    employment.  She does private care work and deposits the money into the
    account herself.

16. I have sympathy  with  the  Secretary  of  State  in  that  it  is  not
    sufficiently clear from this determination what the evidence was before
    the Immigration Judge.  However, having gone through that  evidence,  I
    am in fact satisfied that it was before him and that he was entitled to
    conclude that the financial requirements of the Rules were met.

17. Whilst the reasoning on its face appeared to be thin,  given  that  the
    evidence was in fact before him, any defects are not material.

18. Mrs Petterson made it clear that she was not  challenging  the  judge's
    decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds in  relation  to  the
    lack of specified evidence.  The judge recorded that  his  reasons  for
    doing so were the lengthy separation of the couple from 2015  when  the
    sponsor left Pakistan following their marriage in 2012.   She  did  not
    demure from Mr Macreadie's argument that whilst ECOs are bound  by  the
    strict  requirements  of  Appendix  FM/SE,  Courts  and  Tribunals  are
    prevented to take a more flexible approach when deciding what  evidence
    they require to establish that the minimum income  threshold  has  been
    met (R on the application of MM Lebanon  Appellant  v  SSHD  Respondent
    [2017] UKSC 10). The quality  of  evidence  necessary  to  satisfy  the
    financial  requirements  in  a   particular   case   are   matters   of
    practicality, rather than principle (Lord Reed, Agyarko).



Notice of Decision

19. The original judge did not err in law.  His decision stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
