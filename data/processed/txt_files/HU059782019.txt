                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kaler, promulgated on 17 June 2019. Permission to appeal was granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan on 12 August 2019.



Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. On 29 September 2011 the appellant applied for leave to remain on  long
    residency grounds in a false identity, that of a failed  asylum  seeker
    referred to as BXL, who made an  asylum  claim  in  March  1997.   When
    detained on 23 March 2015, the  appellant  claimed  to  have  illegally
    entered the United Kingdom during 1997 by ship. He made a human rights'
    claim in the name "Zuchao Weng", born in 1965. That claim  was  refused
    and certified as clearly unfounded. The appellant lodged seven sets  of
    further submissions between 2016 and 2017, all of which  were  rejected
    under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.

 4. On 8 February 2018, the appellant  sought  leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds in his own identity of Zu Chao Weng, born in 1969. It is
    the refusal of that application, by way of a decision  dated  15  March
    2019, which is the  subject  of  this  appeal.  The  substance  of  the
    appellant's human  rights  claim  is  that  he  relied  upon  his  long
    residence as well as his relationship with a  British  partner,  namely
    (BBL).  The respondent noted the appellant's claim to have entered  the
    United Kingdom on 9 May 1997 but commented that this  had  "never  been
    confirmed with evidence." The respondent  decided  that  the  appellant
    could not meet the immigration status eligibility  requirement  because
    of his claim to have remained in the United Kingdom without valid leave
    for 7580 days. It was accepted that the appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his partner but not that  there  were  any
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside  the  United
    Kingdom. It was suggested  that  the  appellant  could  apply  for  the
    correct entry clearance to return to this country. The application  was
    refused with reference to R-LTRP 1.1(d)(ii) and (iii) of Appendix FM as
    well as 276ADE(1)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of the Rules.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. Following  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  judge
    accepted that the appellant had been residing  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 1997 and working throughout  most  of  that  time,  in  differing
    identities. Nonetheless, she identified a gap in the  evidence  between
    2003 and 2005 as well as inconsistencies in the oral evidence she heard
    and concluded that his residence was not continuous.  Accordingly,  the
    judge concluded that the appellant could not meet the  requirements  of
    276ADE(1)(iii) or indeed all the requirements of any  of  the  relevant
    Rules. She concluded that his Article  8  claim  was  not  sufficiently
    strong to outweigh the public interest in immigration control.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal argued that the judge misdirected herself  as  to
    the oral evidence and that there were no inconsistencies. Reference was
    made to counsel's note of the proceedings.

 7. A further misdirection identified was that of the  judge's  failure  to
    refer to and make findings regarding the unchallenged evidence of BBL's
    daughter to the effect that the appellant was known to her  since  2001
    and that he had been living in the United Kingdom  for  20  years.   An
    additional challenge was raised to the judge's findings  that  BBL  had
    not been truthful to the psychologist.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis sought.

 9. The respondent did not file a Rule 24 response.

The hearing

10. Mr � Ceallaigh submitted that  the  error  of  law  concerned  one  key
    finding that the appellant had not established residence in the  United
    Kingdom for the two financial years, covering 2003-2005.  He  made  the
    following points. The judge failed to record the  appellant's  evidence
    correctly and she had failed to  consider  the  witness  evidence.   In
    relation to the judge's recording of the evidence,  at  [18],  she  had
    wrongly noted that the appellant's oral evidence was that he had  moved
    in with his wife before 2003. As the  judge  further  noted,  this  was
    unlikely, as this was when the appellant's wife  was  living  with  her
    late husband. In the same paragraph, the judge had also noted the  oral
    evidence of the appellant and written evidence of  his  wife  that  the
    appellant moved in with her in 2007/8. These findings  were  internally
    inconsistent. At [21] the judge applied the wrong test in  saying  that
    it could not be ruled out that the  appellant  may  have  left  the  UK
    between 2003 and 2005 and re-entered. The attendance  note  of  counsel
    who presented the appeal listed the evidence taken and at no point  had
    the appellant suggested that he had moved into his wife's home when her
    husband was alive. Counsel's note was more plausible than  the  judge's
    conclusions in that the note was internally consistent.

11. Mr � Ceallaigh stated that in any event, the events under consideration
    were now around fourteen years old. The appellant's adult  stepdaughter
    K attended the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  and  was  cross-
    examined. Her evidence was that she had known the appellant  since  she
    was a child and that she knew him at  the  time  of  the  period  under
    consideration. There were also several other statements from people who
    had known  the  appellant  for  between  fifteen  and  nineteen  years.
    Furthermore, there was  evidence  from  the  appellant's  home  village
    committee which said that he had not  returned  there  since  1995  and
    which confirmed that his parents were deceased.  The latter  point  was
    relevant to the judge's finding that the appellant had family in China.
    The judge was wrong to reject the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  wife
    regarding the feasibility of accompanying the appellant to  China.  The
    wife was from Vietnam, was a grandmother  and  there  was  unchallenged
    evidence that she suffered from a mental health condition.

12. For the respondent, Mr Singh said the following. The issue was the  gap
    in residence and if an error was found in relation to the first ground,
    the  remaining  grounds  need  not  be  considered.   The   appellant's
    stepdaughter  was  aware  that  the  appellant  was  in   the   country
    continuously and, if accepted, this would mean that there was  no  need
    to look at the judge's consideration of the psychological report of the
    appellant's wife.

13. As he was without a verbatim  note  from  the  presenting  officer  who
    attended the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  Mr  Singh  was
    unable to assist further.

Decision on error of law

14. In view of the contents of the attendance note of Mr Alexander Swain of
    counsel which makes no reference to the appellant living with his  wife
    prior to 2007, which I could see no reason to reject, I accept that the
    judge erred in her recording of  the  oral  evidence.  Her  record  was
    inconsistent both the appellant's written and oral evidence and in fact
    made no sense as this would have meant the appellant  living  with  his
    wife while her late husband was still alive.  This  error  led  to  the
    judge finding that the appellant had not been honest about his presence
    in the United Kingdom between 2003-2005, a period  when  there  was  no
    supporting documentary evidence. The judge further erred in failing  to
    consider the evidence of the appellant's stepdaughter K who is now aged
    32. In her statement, she said that he was a family  friend  from  2001
    and that  he  became  her  stepfather  in  2007.  That  statement  went
    unchallenged during the hearing.  The evidence of the stepdaughter  was
    clearly relevant and ought to have been taken into consideration by the
    judge in considering whether the appellant had given a credible account
    of being resident in the United  Kingdom  during  2003-2005.  In  these
    circumstances, I find that the judge made a material error of  law  and
    her findings relating to this period are set aside.

Remaking

15. Having found a material  error  of  law,  I  proceeded  to  remake  the
    decision, with all findings preserved other than those relating to  the
    period   2003-2005.   I   invited   further   submissions   from    the
    representatives. Mr � Ceallaigh argued  that  it  was  clear  that  the
    appellant was residing in the UK either side of 2003-2005. The evidence
    of the appellant,  his  wife,  stepchildren  and  other  witnesses  was
    consistent, plausible and pointed to continuous residence in the United
    Kingdom. In addition, his village committee in China confirmed that  he
    had not returned there since 1995. It was  far  more  likely  that  the
    appellant was residing in the UK than he briefly  left.  There  was  no
    reason for him to leave, no indication that he would take such  a  risk
    and no suggestion that he was  able  to  come  and  go.  There  was  no
    suggestion that he had left the  UK  at  any  time,  all  the  evidence
    pointed one way.

16. In reply, Mr Singh stated  that  the  only  issue  was  whether  I  was
    satisfied that the appellant was present in the  UK  for  twenty  years
    including 2003-2005, bearing  in  mind  that  there  were  no  official
    records for that time. He drew my attention  to  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant's wife and supportive witness statements which  covered  that
    period of time. Nothing else was suggestive of  the  appellant  leaving
    the UK.   Mr Singh was content to leave the decision in my hands.

17. At the end of the hearing, I allowed the appeal on human rights grounds
    on the basis that I accepted that the appellant  had  resided  in  this
    country continuously for twenty years.

Decision on remaking

18. I adopt the unchallenged findings of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kaler
    set out at [15] of her decision as follows; "I accept on the  basis  of
    the documentary evidence that the Appellant has been in  the  UK  since
    sometime before 20/08/1997. I accept that the Appellant had entered the
    UK 20 years before he  submitted  the  application."   Furthermore,  at
    [24], the judge summarises her findings as follows; "I  find  that  the
    Appellant has established that he entered the UK in 1997  and  that  he
    worked from 1997 until the tax  year  ending  in  April  2003.  He  was
    present in the UK and there were no breaks in continuous  residence.  I
    am also satisfied he worked in  the  tax  year  commencing  April  2005
    onwards and has been present in the UK."

19. I have carefully considered the period  from  April  2003  until  April
    2005, when it is acknowledged that there is no confirmation  from  HMRC
    that the appellant was employed in the United Kingdom. The  appellant's
    explanation for the absence of documentary evidence for this period can
    be found in counsel's note of the hearing, that he  was  working  part-
    time and not paying any tax during this period. I can see no reason  to
    reject this explanation and indeed Mr Singh did not ask me  to  do  so.
    The appellant also relies upon a number of witnesses to  his  residence
    in the United Kingdom. These include his wife  and  her  children,  who
    have known him since 2001 when he visited their  home  as  a  guest  of
    their late husband/father. A number of other witnesses have written  to
    confirm that they have known the appellant to be living in  the  United
    Kingdom for more than 15 years and in one case for more than 19  years.
    There is also the evidence from the village committee  in  China  which
    confirms that the appellant has not returned there. In addition,  there
    is a complete absence of any evidence to suggest that the appellant has
    left the UK since  his  arrival  in  1997.  Furthermore,  there  is  no
    plausible reason for him to have done so.

20. Considering all the evidence, I accept that the appellant  has  resided
    in the UK continuously since 9 May 1997, a period of more  than  twenty
    years. According to the decision of  14  March  2019,  the  appellant's
    application did not fall for refusal on the grounds of suitability.  In
    these circumstances, I find  that  he  can  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of the Rules.

21. It is not in dispute that the appellant has  developed  a  private  and
    family life in the United Kingdom. He has resided  and  worked  in  the
    United Kingdom since 1997. Furthermore, he has been in  a  relationship
    with his wife for more than a decade and they married in 2015.  Nor  is
    it in dispute that the decision to remove the appellant would amount to
    a substantial interference with his private and family  life  and  that
    Article 8 is engaged. Owing to the  appellant's  ability  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, it cannot be said that such interference  is
    in accordance with the law.

22. I am obliged to have regard to the factors set out in section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act. I have taken into consideration that the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls is in  the  public  interest,  that  the
    appellant's private and family life was developed at a time when he was
    unlawfully present in  the  United  Kingdom,  that  he  worked  without
    permission and using an identity other than his own and  that  he  does
    not speak English.

23. The appellant is aged 50, is financially independent, his  parents  are
    deceased, he has lived in the UK for 22 years, he  has  a  longstanding
    relationship with his wife who  is  a  British  citizen  of  Vietnamese
    origin, he has stepchildren  and  step-grandchildren.  The  appellant's
    wife lost her late husband suddenly and in tragic circumstances  which,
    according to  medical  evidence,  has  adversely  affected  her  mental
    health. The appellant meets the requirements for a grant  of  leave  on
    the basis of his unlawful, continuous, residence of  in  excess  of  20
    years.  In  these   circumstances,   the   proposed   interference   is
    disproportionate to  the  legitimate  end  of  the  maintenance  of  an
    effective system of immigration control.

Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision to be re-made.

I substitute  a  decision  allowing  the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds
(Article 8).



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
for the following reason. At  the  time  of  the  appellant's  human  rights
application insufficient evidence  had  been  provided  to  demonstrate  the
length and continuous nature of the  appellant's  residence  in  the  United
Kingdom.
