Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Ume-Ezeoke, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, is appealing against the decision
    of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nicholls promulgated on 30 July
    2018 to dismiss his appeal against the decision of the respondent to
    refuse his application for entry clearance to the UK on human rights
    grounds.

 2. The issue before me is whether to set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal because of a procedural irregularity.

 3. Over a week prior to the hearing the appellant's solicitor wrote to the
    Tribunal requesting an adjournment on the basis that notice of the
    hearing had not been sent to them and they had only discovered that the
    hearing was listed for 13 July 2018 because the information was within
    the bundle served by the respondent.  The request for adjournment
    submitted that the appellant's sponsor was in Nigeria and was not in a
    position to proceed with the appeal on 13 July 2018.

 4. It is clear that the judge was not aware of the application for an
    adjournment, as it is not referred to in the decision and the judge
    stated that no explanation had been given for the non-attendance of the
    sponsor and/or the appellant's representative.

 5. Although the judge cannot be faulted for not adjourning when he was not
    aware of the application, there has still been an error of law: the
    adjournment application should have been considered and it was not. The
    decision is therefore set aside. Both parties submitted (and I agree)
    that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be
    heard afresh.

Notice of Decision

 6. The decision contains a material error of law and is set aside.

 7. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh
    before a different judge.

 8. No anonymity direction is made.
