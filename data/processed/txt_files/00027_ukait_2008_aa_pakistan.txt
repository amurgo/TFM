                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

                                   Between

                                                                   Appellant

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

Representation
For the Appellant:           Mr M Khan, Legal Action Forum
For the Respondent:          Mr. C. Avery

Convictions that are 'spent' for the purposes of the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act 1974 should not normally be the subject of reference in
appeals before the Tribunal.  The exception is in s 7(3) of the Act, which
allows spent convictions to be proved if the interests of justice require
it: it is for the Respondent to prove that they do.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is a case where the Tribunal  has  ordered  reconsideration  of  a
    decision of Immigration Judge McWilliam, sitting at Taylor House on  15
    October 2007, allowing on long  residence  and  article  8  grounds  an
    appeal by a citizen of  Pakistan.  The  senior  immigration  judge  who
    considered the application on the papers identified an  arguable  error
    of law in taking account of a conviction of the appellant's  which  was
    spent by reason of the Rehabilitation of Offenders  Act  1974;  but  he
    also  pointed  out  that  some  of  the  appellant's  apparent  14-year
    residence in this country might fall to  be  excluded  under  paragraph
    276B(i)(b) of the Immigration Rules.


History

 2. The relevant dates are as follows:

    09.10.1989         appellant given leave to enter as student
    17.05.1991        leave  to  remain  as  working  holiday-maker  till
   27.06.1993
    10.05.1993        last enters this country: leave to remain  continued
                 under s. 3(3)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971
    09.06.1993        applies for leave to remain as student
    28.06.1993        leave to remain refused
    03.11.1993        applies for leave to remain as  husband  of  British
                 citizen
    03.11.1994        leave to remain refused
    05.02.1997         sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment  for  attempting
                 to leave this country on false Belgian passport
    10.02.1997        appeal against refusal of leave to remain as husband
                 dismissed
    13.03.1997         police notify Home Office of conviction and sentence
    22.04.2002        applies for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as  long
                 resident
    16.05.2002        indefinite leave to remain refused
    12.11.2003         makes further application for  indefinite  leave  to
                 remain
    24.08.2007          further  application  refused,   with   notice   of
                 liability to removal


Qualifying residence

3. On 24 August 2007, the date of the decision  under  appeal,  it  is  now
   accepted that the appellant  had  been  continuously  resident  in  this
   country since 10 May  1993,  more  than  the  14  years  required  under
   paragraph 276B(1)(b)  of  the  Rules.  That  sub-paragraph  goes  on  to
   exclude:

        "... any period spent in the United Kingdom  following  service  of
        notice of liability to removal or notice of a decision to remove by
        way of directions under paragraphs 8  to  10A,  or  12  to  14,  of
        Schedule 2 to the  Immigration  Act  1971  or  section  10  of  the
        Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 Act, or of a notice of intention to
        deport him from the United Kingdom."


            In this case no deportation notice, nor notice of  any  decision
    to remove, was ever served; and no notice of liability to  removal  was
    given till the date of the decision under appeal. Despite the making of
    two appealable, and one unappealable immigration decisions between  the
    appellant's last arrival and that  date,  Mr  Avery  conceded  that  no
    notice of liability to removal was given during that  time  either.  It
    follows that the appellant is qualified for indefinite leave to  remain
    as a long resident, unless there are public interest reasons  why  that
    would be undesirable, in terms of paragraph 276B (ii).

Public interest reasons

 4. Mr Avery also helpfully conceded that there  were  no  public  interest
    reasons for the appellant not to be allowed to  stay,  except  for  the
    facts revealed by his conviction. He did submit that the  Tribunal  was
    entitled to take account of those independently of that conviction; but
    no other evidence  of  the  appellant's  misconduct  with  the  Belgian
    passport was offered: we shall  deal  with  this  point  when  we  have
    discussed the effect of the conviction itself. The general position  is
    set out in s. 4 of the 1974 Act:

        "(1) Subject to sections 7 and 8 below, a person who has  become  a
        rehabilitated person for the purposes of this Act in respect  of  a
        conviction shall be treated for all purposes in law as a person who
        has not committed  or  been  charged  with  or  prosecuted  for  or
        convicted of or sentenced for the offence or  offences  which  were
        the subject of that conviction; and, notwithstanding the provisions
        of any other enactment or rule of law to the contrary, but  subject
        as aforesaid-
        a) no evidence shall be admissible  in  any  proceedings  before  a
           judicial authority exercising its jurisdiction or  functions  in
           Great Britain to prove that any such  person  has  committed  or
           been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced
           for any offence which was the subject of a spent conviction ..."


 5. For the avoidance of any possible doubt, s. 6 of the Act provides:

        "For the purposes of this section and section 7 below  "proceedings
        before a judicial authority" includes, in addition  to  proceedings
        before any of the ordinary courts of law,  proceedings  before  any
        tribunal, body or person having power-
             a) by virtue of any enactment, law, custom or practice ...
        to  determine  any  question  affecting  the  rights,   privileges,
        obligations or liabilities of any person, or  to  receive  evidence
        affecting the determination of any such question."

       Following table A under s. 5 of  the  1974  Act,  the  rehabilitation
   period for someone over 18 on conviction, and sentenced to  imprisonment
   for no more than six months, is one of seven years. It follows that this
   appellant's sentence of three months' imprisonment  in  1997  was  spent
   well before the date of the decision under appeal in 2007, and,  subject
   to any of the exceptions provided by s. 4, he was entitled to be treated
   as someone who had never committed the offence with the Belgian passport
   in the first place. Subject again  to  those  exceptions,  that  is  the
   answer to Mr Avery's proposed  reliance  on  the  facts  underlying  the
   conviction.


Exceptions

 6. Section 8 of the 1974 Act applies to defamation actions, and we are not
    concerned with it. Section 7(1) applies to various procedures following
    a conviction: that is, for

      a) pardons, and quashing or commutation of convictions or sentences;
      b) enforcement of fines or other payments;
        c) breach of conditions or requirements of the sentence;
              d)  disqualifications,  disabilities,  prohibitions  or  other
                 penalties lasting beyond the rehabilitation period.

   None of (a), (b) or (c) applies to this case, which involves a  decision
   leading to notice of  liability  to  removal.  The  full  text  of  what
   exception (d) applies to follows:


        "the operation of any enactment by virtue of which, in  consequence
        of any conviction, a person is subject, otherwise than  by  way  of
        sentence, to any disqualification, disability, prohibition or other
        penalty the period  of  which  extends  beyond  the  rehabilitation
        period applicable  in  accordance  with  section  6  above  to  the
        conviction."


   That does not in terms apply in this case either; but it may be  helpful
   if we give our view, even though not necessary to the decision  in  this
   case,  as  to  the  effect  of  that  exception  in  deportation  cases.
   Provisionally  we  think  a  recommendation  for  deportation   by   the
   sentencing judge, which is treated, at least  for  appeal  purposes,  as
   part of the sentence, would fall outside the exception for that  reason.
   As for a decision to deport on "conducive" grounds by the  Secretary  of
   State, that is something to which the person  concerned  is  liable  (it
   being discretionary), rather  than  subject  to  under  the  immigration
   legislation. It follows that we do not think exception (d)  would  apply
   in deportation cases either.




 7. Section 7(2) of the 1974 Act applies to  types  of  proceedings  (other
    than those following the conviction itself)  where  evidence  of  spent
    convictions may be received. Here exception  (a)  relates  to  criminal
    proceedings, and (b), (bb),  (c),  (cc)  and  (d)  to  other  types  of
    proceedings with which we are not concerned.  Exceptions  (e)  and  (g)
    have been repealed, and (f) provides an exception where  the  party  or
    witness concerned consents to admission of the spent conviction,  which
    does not arise here either. No order has been made by the Secretary  of
    State under s. 7(4) to exclude immigration proceedings  generally  from
    the operation of s. 4(1); so the only generally relevant exception from
    its opinion in such proceedings is provided by s. 7(3).

Interests of justice

 8. Section 7 (3) of the 1974 Act provides as follows: (we  have  left  out
    the exceptions under s. 7 (2), s. 7 (4)  and  s.  8,  for  the  reasons
    already given):

        If at any stage in any proceedings before a judicial  authority  in
        Great Britain ... the authority is satisfied, in the light  of  any
        considerations which appear to it to  be  relevant  (including  any
        evidence which has been or may thereafter be put before  it),  that
        justice cannot be done in the case except by admitting or requiring
        evidence  relating  to  a  person's   spent   convictions   or   to
        circumstances ancillary thereto, that authority may  admit  or,  as
        the case may be, require the evidence in  question  notwithstanding
        the provisions of subsection  (1)  of  section  4  above,  and  may
        determine any issue to which the evidence relates in disregard,  so
        far as necessary, of those provisions.



 9. So far as the present appeal is concerned, it was for the  Home  Office
    to satisfy the judge that she could not do  justice  without  admitting
    the appellant's spent conviction. They did not attempt  this  task,  or
    even draw her attention  to  the  statutory  provision  which  made  it
    necessary. The use of 'require' as well as 'admit' suggests that it  is
    quite open to a judge to consider the interests of justice for  herself
    in this connexion. Again she did not do so; and to rely  on  the  spent
    conviction as she did, but not consider whether justice could  be  done
    without it, was in our view an error of law. Since no other substantial
    reason has been put forward for the appellant's not being  entitled  to
    indefinite leave to remain  as  a  long  resident,  it  was  clearly  a
    material error of law, unless consideration of the interests of justice
    would have been bound to result in evidence  of  the  conviction  being
    admitted.



10. It follows that we need to consider whether justice could not  be  done
    in this case without admitting evidence of  this  appellant's  ten-year
    old conviction and sentence of 3 months'  imprisonment  for  trying  to
    leave this country on a false  Belgian  passport,  on  which  the  Home
    Office had taken no action at the time, nor made any attempt to  secure
    his removal following it for 10� years after. In our view it is  enough
    to put the question in those terms, not only to see that it was  by  no
    means bound to lead to the admission of the evidence, but to answer  it
    in this appellant's favour. Other  sets  of  facts  may  well  lead  to
    different decisions in cases of this kind on the operation of s.  7(3);
    but in this case the result is that the appeal must be allowed.

    The original Tribunal made a material error of law and we substitute a
    determination allowing the appeal.
