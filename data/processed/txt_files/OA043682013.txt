For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Moore instructed by J D Spicer Zeb Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision of
      the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge   Onoufriou)   which   allowed   the
      appellant's appeal against a refusal to grant him entry  clearance  as
      the spouse of a British citizen under Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
      Rules.  Although Judge Onoufriou was not satisfied that the  appellant
      met the requirements of  Appendix  FM,  in  particular  the  financial
      requirements in E-ECP3.1, the Judge allowed the appeal under Article 8
      of the ECHR.

   2. For convenience, I  will  refer  to  the  parties  hereafter  as  they
      appeared before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

Background

   3. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria who was born on 26 October 1973.
       He first came to the UK as a visitor on  24  July  2003.   His  leave
      expired on 24 January 2004 and he remained as an overstayer in the  UK
      until 9 November 2012 when he voluntarily returned to Algeria.

   4. On 26 April 2012, whilst in the UK,  he  married  a  British  citizen,
      Sharon Elizabeth Medjdoub.  On 13 November 2012, the appellant applied
      for entry clearance on the basis of his marriage.  On 3 December 2012,
      the ECO refused the appellant's  application  and  that  decision  was
      confirmed by the Entry Clearance Manager on 26 June 2013.  The refusal
      was based upon three grounds.  First,  the  appellant  had  failed  to
      disclose material facts concerning his previous entry to the UK in his
      application (para S-EC2.2 of Appendix FM).   Secondly,  the  appellant
      had failed to establish that the sponsor's income from her  employment
      was at  least  �18,600  gross  per  annum  as  required  by  E-ECP3.1.
      Thirdly, the appellant  had  failed  to  show  that  his  Entry  Level
      Certificate in ESOL Skills for Life (Speaking and Listening) (Entry 1)
      satisfied the English language requirement in E-ECP4.1.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

   5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
      heard by Judge Onoufriou and at that hearing, in addition to a  number
      of documents being submitted, the sponsor gave oral evidence.

   6. On the basis of that evidence,  Judge  Onoufriou  concluded  that  the
      appellant had not dishonestly failed to disclose material facts in his
      application which had been mistakenly  filled  in  (without  any  such
      intent) by his previous legal representative.  It was accepted by  the
      Presenting Officer that the appellant's English language qualification
      fulfilled the requirements of Appendix FM.

   7. The remaining  issue  was,  therefore,  whether  the  appellant  could
      establish that the sponsor earned at least a gross income  of  �18,600
      per annum.  At para 20, the  Judge  set  out  the  sponsor's  evidence
      concerning her employment  by  Somerset  County  Council  and  it  was
      accepted, on the basis of the documentary evidence produced, that  she
      had a gross annual income of �15,500.  In addition, the sponsor relied
      upon further income which she claimed she earned  from  GI  Protection
      Ltd where, in addition to her employment with Somerset County Council,
      she worked as a sales representative between  August  2012  and  March
      2013.  However, the  Judge  was  not  satisfied  that  there  was  the
      required documentary evidence to establish that she earned the claimed
      income with GI Protection Ltd which, if added to her income  from  her
      employment with Somerset County Council, would have exceeded  �18,600.



   8. Judge Onoufriou concluded, therefore, that as a result  the  appellant
      could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

   9. Having made that finding, Judge Onoufriou went on to consider  Article
      8 of the ECHR.  Applying the well known five-stage test  in  Razgar  v
      SSHD [2004] UKHL 24 at [17], the Judge was satisfied that the decision
      interfered with the appellant's family life with the sponsor and  that
      that interference was of sufficient gravity  to  engage  Article  8.1.
      He accepted that the interference was in accordance with the  law  and
      was for a legitimate aim,  namely  the  economic  well  being  of  the
      country and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.   The
      Judge identified that the crucial issue was whether that  interference
      was a proportionate interference with the legitimate aims  identified.



  10. Judge Onoufriou found  that  the  interference  was  disproportionate.
      First, at para 22 of his determination  he  found  that  the  parties'
      relationship was a genuine one amounting to family  life  as  did  the
      appellant's relationship with the sponsor's daughter.  In para  22  he
      concluded:

           "...I accept that to expect the sponsor and her daughter  to  go
           and live in Algeria in view of the fact that  they  are  British
           citizens and the sponsor's daughter would lose contact with  her
           natural father, that this would be an insurmountable obstacle."

  11. The Judge then set out a lengthy extract from the decision of Blake  J
      in R (MM) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) at [100], [126], [145]-[146]
      and [153(ix)].  At [146], Blake J concluded that the  �18,600  minimum
      income set out in Appendix  A  was  a  disproportionate  measure.   At
      [153(ix)], Blake J concluded:

           "I recognise that  there  maybe  some  circumstances  where  the
           character, conduct or immigration history of the foreign  spouse
           and the economic circumstances of the United Kingdom are so dire
           that this was the  foreseeable  consequence  of  the  particular
           marriage, but in the vast  bulk  of  ordinary  cases  where  the
           relationship is genuine and subsisting and there is  no  adverse
           history of the spouse to weigh in the balance, the imposition of
           such a stark choice is precisely what  Sedley  LJ  described  as
           indirectly sending the citizen into exile.  I agree that in  the
           broad generality of  ordinary  cases,  the  abandonment  of  the
           citizen's right of residence in order to enjoy family life  with
           his  or  her  spouse  [poses]  an  unacceptable  choice,  and  a
           disproportionately high price to  pay  for  choosing  a  foreign
           spouse in an increasingly international world."

  12.  At  para  23,  Judge  Onoufriou  reached  his  conclusion  that   the
      respondent's decision was disproportionate as follows:

           "In the circumstances, within the context of  MM,  I  find  that
           clearly the economic circumstances of the parties are  not  dire
           and whilst the appellant's immigration history is poor  in  that
           he was an overstayer for many years, he  did  voluntarily  leave
           the United Kingdom to make a proper application.  In effect,  Mr
           Justice Blake has found that the application of the  Immigration
           Rules in respect of financial  requirements  as  they  currently
           exist are disproportionate when applied to British citizens  and
           recognised refugees in the majority of cases except where  their
           financial circumstances are dire."

  13. As a result, the Judge allowed the appeal under Article 8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

  14. The ECO sought permission to appeal and on 14 January 2014 the  First-
      tier Tribunal (Judge J M Holmes)  granted  the  Secretary  of  State's
      permission to appeal on the following grounds:

           "Accordingly  whilst  the  Judge  purported  to  rely  upon  the
           decision in MM & Others  [2013]  EWHC  1900  to  find  that  the
           decision was not proportionate he failed to engage with the full
           extent  of  the  failure  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the
           Immigration Rules, or to undertake any  adequate  assessment  of
           the proportionality of the decision itself.   In  the  light  of
           that failure, it  is  arguable  that  the  Judge's  analysis  of
           proportionality was flawed.

           In any event it is arguable that the Judge's approach  discloses
           a misunderstanding  of  the  decision  in  MM,  and  the  proper
           approach to such factual situations.  Arguably he proceeded from
           the wrong starting point in appearing to assume that MM required
           the appeal to be allowed outright notwithstanding the failure to
           meet  the  requirements  of  the   Immigration   Rules.    Since
           permission to  appeal  has  been  granted  in  relation  to  the
           decision in MM then the attack upon that  decision  advanced  in
           the ground may also be argued."

  15. In his submissions on  behalf  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Mr
      Richards relied upon the grounds and  submitted  that  there  were  no
      compelling  circumstances  which  entitled  the  Judge  to  reach  the
      conclusion that the appellant could succeed  outside  the  Rules.   He
      submitted that in effect, the Judge had misread the judgment in MM and
      concluded that the mere fact that the appellant only  failed  to  meet
      the financial requirements of the Rules resulted in the decision being
      disproportionate.

  16. Mr Richards submitted that if the error of law was  established  then,
      as there were no compelling features  outside  the  Rules,  given  the
      appellant's past  history  and  that  the  parties  had  entered  into
      marriage in full knowledge that the appellant had no right to live  in
      the UK, the  legitimate  aim  or  public  interest  reflected  in  the
      Immigration Rules outweighed the  appellant's  circumstances  and  the
      appellant's exclusion was proportionate.

  17. Mr Moore, who represented the  appellant,  relied  upon  his  skeleton
      argument.  He submitted that the Judge had not wrongly applied MM  but
      had, instead, properly carried out the proportionality exercise  under
      Razgar.  He submitted that although the appellant overstayed his visit
      visa, he voluntarily left the UK.  The Judge had  considered  all  the
      salient features of the evidence  including  that  the  appellant  and
      sponsor had married before his immigration status was  determined  and
      had also taken into account the appellant's relationship with his step-
      daughter.  Mr Moore submitted that the Judge was entitled to take into
      account, in the light of MM, that the  sponsor's  income  was  �15,500
      even though it did not meet the requirements of the  rules  which,  in
      principle, Blake J considered to be disproportionate in MM.   Mr Moore
      submitted that the Judge had made his decision on  the  basis  of  the
      totality of the evidence before him.

  18. Mr Moore further submitted that, if an error of law were  established,
      taking all of these factors into account I should remake the  decision
      allowing the appellant's appeal under Article 8.

Discussion

  19. It is common ground that on the Judge's finding  the  appellant  could
      not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules because the sponsor
      could not demonstrate that she had an income of at �18,600  gross  per
      annum.  Her established income was �15,500.

  20. The Judge also found, and it is not now challenged, that  the  sponsor
      and her daughter (whom I was told was ten years of age) could  not  be
      expected to live with the appellant in Algeria because they  are  both
      British citizens and the sponsor's daughter would  lose  contact  with
      her natural father.  The  Judge  found  that  there  were  insuperable
      obstacles to the parties' continuing their family life in Algeria.  In
      fact, the effect of the  respondent's  decision  is  that,  until  the
      sponsor can demonstrate income of at least �18,600, the  parties  will
      not be able to continue their family life and the family life with the
      appellant's step-daughter as they will be required to  live  apart  in
      the UK and Algeria respectively.

  21. The fact that the appellant  could  not  establish  that  he  met  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules was a powerful expression of the
      public interest weighing heavily against his and his  family's  rights
      under Article 8.  The  case  law  clearly  identified  that  where  an
      individual cannot meet the requirements of the Rules it will  only  be
      where there are "exceptional"  or  "compelling"  circumstances  giving
      rise to unjustified hardship as a consequence that an  individual  can
      succeed outside the  Rules  (see  R(Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
      (Admin); MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Gulshan (Article
      8 - New Rules - Correct Approach) [2013]  UKUT  00640  (IAC)).   Those
      cases were, however, decided in the  context  of  the  removal  of  an
      individual  already  in  the  UK.   Even  if  unsuccessful,  such   an
      individual would have an opportunity to apply for entry clearance once
      they had left the UK.  That latter situation is, of course,  the  very
      situation of this appellant.

  22. It is clear that the Judge did  fully  consider  all  the  appellant's
      circumstances or, as Mr Moore put it in his submissions, the "positive
      and negative" features of the appellant's  case.   The  Judge  clearly
      took into account that the appellant had  overstayed  his  visit  visa
      from January 2004 until he left the UK in November 2012  and  returned
      to Algeria.  The Judge also expressly took into account (at  para  22)
      that the parties had entered into the marriage fully  aware  that  the
      appellant lacked any immigration status in the UK and,  as  the  Judge
      put it, "the consequent risks of entering  into  the  marriage".    He
      also expressly recognised  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules in that he could  not  meet  the
      financial requirements.   The Judge also, however, noted that Blake  J
      in MM considered that the figure of �18,600 in the Rules  might  well,
      depending   upon   an    individual's    circumstances,    impose    a
      disproportionate measure when applied to British citizens such as  the
      appellant's wife.

  23. I reject Mr Richards' submissions that the Judge  applied  MM  on  the
      basis that the appellant could succeed simply because of  that  latter
      factor.  On the contrary, it is clear from reading  the  determination
      as a whole that the Judge  did,  as  Mr  Moore  submitted,  take  into
      account all the factors including that latter factor  as  relevant  to
      the issue of proportionality.  He did so in  the  context  of  a  case
      where he accepted (and it is not  in  any  way  challenged)  that  the
      relationship between the appellant and the  sponsor  and  between  the
      appellant and the sponsor's daughter amounted to family life and  that
      there were insuperable obstacles to that  family  life  continuing  in
      Algeria rather than in the UK which was the only other alternative.

  24. In SSHD v Huang [2007] UKHL 11,  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill  at  [20]
      identified the crucial issue in assessing proportionality as follows:

           "...The ultimate question for  the  [Tribunal]  is  whether  the
           refusal of leave to enter or remain, in circumstances where  the
           life of the family cannot reasonably be expected to  be  enjoyed
           elsewhere, taking full account of all considerations weighing in
           favour of  the  refusal,  prejudices  the  family  life  of  the
           applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount to a breach
           of the fundamental rights protected by Art 8."

  25. In my judgement, Judge Onoufriou did no more than  apply,  in  effect,
      the approach of Lord Bingham in Huang.  This  was  a  case  where  the
      parties' family life could not "reasonably be expected to  be  enjoyed
      elsewhere".  The view expressed by Blake J in MM was a relevant matter
      for  the  Judge  to  take  into  account  in  assessing  whether   the
      interference that would result from the appellant's exclusion from the
      UK because  he  could  not  comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules  was
      proportionate. Further, the strength of, and the effect  the  decision
      had on, the  relationships  between  the  appellant  and  sponsor  and
      appellant and sponsor's daughter (which the Judge was best  placed  to
      assess on the basis of the evidence including,  of  course,  the  oral
      evidence of the  sponsor)  were  telling  factors  also  in  assessing
      whether there were unjustifiably harsh consequences of  excluding  the
      appellant which weighed against the  appellant's  immigration  history
      (that he was an overstayer but had voluntarily left the UK)  and  that
      he could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

  26. In my judgement Judge Onoufriou was entitled to find, on the evidence,
      that the public interest was outweighed by  the  consequences  to  the
      appellant, the sponsor and the sponsor's  daughter  if  the  appellant
      could not (as he had sought lawfully to do) gain entry clearance.  The
      Judge took into account all the relevant factors. He did  not,  in  my
      judgement, over-read MM and conclude that the appellant should succeed
      under Article 8 simply because the sponsor had a level of income which
      Blake J considered appropriate and consistent with proportionality  in
      the generality of cases in MM,.  He considered  all  the  factors  and
      although not every Judge  would  necessarily  have  reached  the  same
      conclusion, it cannot in my judgement be said that the  findings  were
      perverse or irrational or otherwise unsustainable in law.

Decision

  27. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the
      appellant's appeal under Article 8 did not involve the  making  of  an
      error of law.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow the  appeal
      stands.

  28. The ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is, accordingly, dismissed.
