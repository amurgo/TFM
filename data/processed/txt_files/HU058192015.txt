Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Mr M Murphy, Counsel

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, the Entry Clearance  Officer  at  Abu  Dhabi,  has  been
    granted permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    N J Bennett allowing the appeal of the respondent who had been  refused
    entry clearance as a visitor so  that  she  could  visit  her  husband,
    Hussain Azeem ("the sponsor").

2.   The sponsor is a British citizen.  At  the  time  of  the  respondent's
    application he was studying for a Bachelors Degree at the University of
    East London and was expected to complete his studies on 31 May 2017.

3.   The respondent wished to visit the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom  for
    four months, starting in August 2015.  She lived with her parents.  She
    was married to the sponsor who was born  on  28  July  1993.   She  was
    supported by the sponsor.  The sponsor would pay for her accommodation,
    living expenses and for the ticket.  The main and sole purpose  of  her
    visit was to see the sponsor because the  sponsor  was  a  student  and
    could not travel to Pakistan as a result of his study commitments.  She
    was financially dependent on  the  sponsor,  but  she  lived  with  her
    parents in Pakistan.  She was making a human rights claim under Article
    8 because the sponsor was currently a full-time student and  could  not
    travel due to his study commitments and he did not meet  the  financial
    threshold as a spouse.

4.   The ECO raised two concerns; the first  was  that  the  sponsor's  bank
    statement showed a large  deposit  of  �16,000  on  29  May  2015  and,
    according to the ECO, was unable to establish the origin of this  large
    deposit.  The second concern was that the ECO was  not  satisfied  that
    the respondent had shown that her ties to Pakistan  were  a  sufficient
    incentive  to  leave  the  UK  at  the  end  of  her  proposed   visit.
    Consequently, the ECO was not satisfied that she genuinely was  seeking
    entry as a visitor or would leave the UK after a limited period.

5.   With regard to the consideration of Article 8, the ECO considered  that
    refusing the respondent's entry clearance application was justified and
    did not impact on her ability to conduct a family life as she had  done
    up until now.  There did not appear to be any insurmountable  obstacles
    preventing her sponsor from visiting her in Pakistan  as  he  had  done
    before now.  Having taken into account the compassionate circumstances,
    the ECO was of the opinion that they  did  not  outweigh  his  concerns
    about her intentions in wishing to enter the UK.

6.   The judge accepted that family life existed between the respondent  and
    the sponsor.  The judge said at paragraph 24 that  the  more  difficult
    question was whether the ECO's decision interfered  with  their  family
    life.  On one view, it might be said that the interference  was  caused
    by the  decision  to  marry  while  the  sponsor  was  a  student  and,
    therefore, while the sponsor could not meet the financial  requirements
    of  Appendix  FM,  the  respondent's  decision  merely  preserved   the
    situation brought about by this decision.  The judge said however  that
    the Upper Tribunal's decision  in  Mostafa,  appeared  to  answer  this
    question and went on to cite the relevant extract from  Mostafa,  which
    was this:

         "Undoubtedly the paradigm Article 8 entry clearance  case  concerns
         applicants seeking to join close family members for the purposes of
         settlement. However it cannot be excluded that where one party to a
         marriage is entitled to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom  a  qualified
         obligation  to  facilitate  spousal  unification  for  the  limited
         purpose of a short visit and sojourn may arise and does arise here.
         Mrs El-Sheikh wanted to return to her country of  nationality  (the
         United Kingdom) for a time and her husband wanted to be  with  her,
         not with a view to settlement but so that he could share  her  life
         and relationships in the United Kingdom. The refusal decision had a
         material impact on their right to enjoy family  life.  He  did  not
         want to settle  but  to  visit  her,  and  subject  to  permissible
         qualifications, he should be entitled to do that. Whilst  it  would
         almost certainly be proportionate to refuse him entry clearance  if
         he did not comply with the rules his, and his wife's, desire to  be
         together in her home area, albeit for purposes of a visit, are very
         human and understandable. Preventing that would not be a 'technical
         or inconsequential interference' (see  Sedley  LJ  in  VW  (Uganda)
         [2009] EWCA  Civ  5)  and  should  be  permitted,  subject  to  the
         proportionate requirements of immigration control."

7.   At paragraph 25 the judge considered the question of whether  exclusion
    in the interests of  enforcing  effective  immigration  control  was  a
    proportionate interference with the respondent's family life  with  the
    sponsor.  He said that the respondent's intentions about the visit were
    of  fundamental  importance  because  exclusion  in  the  interests  of
    maintaining  effective  immigration  control   would   likely   to   be
    proportionate if she did not intend to honour the terms of her visa.

8.   At paragraph 26 the judge  said  that  the  ECO's  concerns  about  the
    respondent's intentions were understandable on the evidence before him.
     There was a large credit to the sponsor's bank account in  the  months
    leading up to the application which, on its face, was incompatible with
    his status as a student.  The respondent did not  appear  to  have  any
    particular ties to Pakistan, now that she was married and supported  by
    the sponsor, and the sponsor was settled here but did not appear to  be
    able to meet the financial requirements for settlement.   However,  the
    reasons for the visit and the deposit had now been explained, which the
    judge accepted.

9.   At paragraph 27 the judge said that the respondent had every reason  to
    return to Pakistan before her visa  expired  and  to  apply  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse because of the disadvantages that flow from being
    here illegally.  The judge gave examples of the disadvantages.

10.  At paragraph 28 the judge said the respondent has every expectation  of
    being able to make a successful application for entry  clearance  after
    the sponsor graduates.  The sponsor will be in a position then to  seek
    employment.  As a young graduate, he has every expectation  of  finding
    employment which will pay him at least �18,600 per annum, but  if,  for
    whatever reason, he did not do this, he would be able to supplement his
    earnings by taking a second job.  The judge said in such  circumstances
    the respondent would be well-advised to go back to Pakistan and not  to
    apply for leave to remain as a spouse because she would find that there
    were significant obstacles that stood in the  way  of  her  doing  this
    successfully.

11.  On balance, the judge was satisfied that the  respondent  did  probably
    intend a short visit to see the  sponsor  while  he  was  studying  and
    unable to sponsor an application for entry clearance as  a  spouse  and
    that she probably did intend to go back to Pakistan before the  end  of
    her visa.

12.  The judge said as follows at paragraph 30:

         "The Upper Tribunal said in Mostafa that a  claimant's  ability  to
         satisfy the Immigration Rules was not determinative but that it was
         a  weighty  factor  when  deciding  whether  exclusion   would   be
         proportionate.  I am unable to identify any factor which  militates
         against granting entry clearance.  I therefore find that  exclusion
         would be disproportionate and allow the appeal under Article 8."

13.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  granted  permission  in  the
    following terms:

         "1.  It is arguable  that  the  judge  has  fallen  into  error  at
             paragraph  30  of  the  decision.   The  judge  referred   the
             claimant's ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules not  being
             determinative but that it was a weighty factor  when  deciding
             whether exclusion would be proportionate.   The  judge  states
             that the  judge  was  unable  to  identify  any  factor  which
             militated against granting entry clearance.   The  judge  then
             states that it was therefore found  that  exclusion  would  be
             disproportionate and the appeal was allowed.


         2.   It is arguable the  judge  has  taken  an  unduly  restrictive
             approach  in  considering  the  elements  which  comprise  the
             proportionality exercise in drawing a conclusion on the  basis
             set out at paragraph 30, immediately  prior  to  finding  that
             exclusion would be disproportionate.  It is arguable that  the
             judge has attached exclusive or undue  weight  to  the  factor
             identified at the outset of paragraph 30  before  drawing  the
             conclusions stated therein.  It is arguable that  the  judge's
             conclusion is therefore vitiated and that the  proportionality
             exercise has not been carried out on a balanced  footing.   It
             is arguable that further factors should have been  taken  into
             account, particularly in the light of the factual matrix."

14.  Mr Whitwell relied on the grounds submitted on behalf of the  ECO.   He
    said there were two main points; the first was the judge's  failure  to
    engage with the case as put; and the  second  was  treating  compliance
    with the Immigration Rules as being determinative of the appeal.

15.  He  submitted  that  the  respondent  has  no  dependent  children,  is
    supported by the sponsor, lives with her parents in Pakistan  and  does
    not work and has no savings of her own.  In the light of  these  facts,
    the respondent could not comply with the maintenance requirement  as  a
    spouse.  Mr Whitwell submitted that there  was  no  engagement  by  the
    judge with the argument about the respondent's intention to  leave  the
    UK at the end of  her  visit.   At  paragraphs  26  and  27  the  judge
    questioned why the respondent would stay.  Mr Whitwell said  people  do
    overstay.  Given all the factors, he submitted that the judge  did  not
    engage with whether Section 41 of the visit Rule could be met.

16.  Mr Whitwell relied on paragraph 27  of  the  decision  in  Kaur  (visit
    appeals; Article 8) [2015] UKUT 00487 (IAC).  The Upper  Tribunal  said
    as follows:

         "27. This background fortifies us in our view that a judge  limited
             by s.88A to deciding whether the refusal of entry clearance to
             an appellant is compatible with Article 8 cannot  -  and  must
             not - avoid  taking  the  factual  situation  as  regards  the
             ability of the appellant to meet paragraph 41  as  a  starting
             point.  In deciding  whether  Article  8(1)  is  engaged,  for
             example, the judge must be satisfied that there is  a  factual
             content to the  claimed  private  and  family  life.   If  the
             evidence relating to the ability to meet the  requirements  of
             paragraph 41 discloses to the judge that the  visitor  has  no
             real family ties or that the visitor does not genuinely intend
             a visit, that may  have  a  direct  material  bearing  on  the
             decision as to whether Article 8(1)  is  engaged.   Similarly,
             evidence  regarding  the  applicant's  ability  to  meet   the
             requirements of the Rules may sound on  whether  the  decision
             constitutes interference and also  on  whether,  if  there  is
             interference,  it  is  proportionate.   Overall,   unless   an
             appellant can show that  there  are  individual  interests  at
             stake covered by Article 8 'of a particularly pressing nature'
             so as to  give  rise   to  a  'strong  claim  that  compelling
             circumstances may exist to justify the grant  of  LTE  outside
             the  rules'  (see   SS  (Congo)  at  [40]  and  [56]),  he  is
             exceedingly unlikely to succeed. That  proposition  must  also
             hold good in visitor appeals."

17.  Mr  Whitwell  questioned  whether  there  were  any  strong  claims  or
    compelling circumstances or evidence of a  compelling  nature  in  this
    case.  The sponsor said that the visit could not take place during term-
    time.  However,  Mr  Whitwell  submitted  that  the  visit  during  the
    holidays could not amount to a pressing nature covered by Article 8.

18.  Mr Whitwell relied on paragraph 7 of the grounds which  submitted  that
    the judge failed to adequately consider the claim that the sponsor  was
    unable to travel due to study commitments.  The  respondent  wished  to
    visit in August 2015 which  would  have  fallen  during  the  sponsor's
    university summer holiday.  The grounds further submitted that  Article
    8 does not afford the choice of where family life should be pursued; in
    any event, it was open to the sponsor to travel to Pakistan during  his
    university holidays.  The refusal did not  interfere  with  the  family
    life of the respondent and the  sponsor,  because  it  did  nothing  to
    change the status quo of their family life relying on modern  means  of
    communication.

19.  Mr Murphy submitted that the respondent  was  refused  entry  clearance
    because of the ECO's fear that she would not go back to Pakistan  after
    the end of her visit.  He submitted that the judge considered  all  the
    issues that were before him.   He  accepted  the  explanation  for  the
    deposit of the �16,000 into the sponsor's account.   The  ECO  accepted
    that the marriage between the sponsor and the respondent  was  genuine.
    The judge accepted the sponsor's evidence.  The judge  found  that  the
    respondent has every reason to return to Pakistan.  He  submitted  that
    this was a very well-reasoned decision.

20.  Mr Murphy submitted that at paragraph 30 the judge was  following  what
    was said in Mostafa.  He submitted that the  judge  did  not  say  that
    compliance with the Immigration Rules was not determinative but that it
    was  a  weighty  factor  in  deciding  whether   exclusion   would   be
    proportionate.  The judge was merely citing what was said in Mostafa.

21.  Having considered all the submissions, I find no error of  law  in  the
    judge's decision.

22.  I find that contrary  to  Mr.  Whitwell's  argument,  the  judge  fully
    engaged with the argument about the respondent's intention to leave the
    UK.   Indeed, Mr. Murphy submitted  that  the  respondent  was  refused
    entry clearance because of the ECO's fear that she would not go back to
    Pakistan.  I find that the judge  fully  addressed  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's intentions about the visit at paragraphs 25 to 29.  While I
    accept Mr. Whitwell's submission that people do overstay  their  visit,
    the judge was satisfied that the respondent did probably intend a short
    visit to see the sponsor while he was studying and unable to sponsor an
    application for entry clearance as a spouse and that she  probably  did
    intend to go back to Pakistan before the end of her visit [29].

23.  I find that the judge  was  well-aware  of  the  facts  in  this  case,
    including the respondent's circumstances in Pakistan. I agree with  Mr.
    Murphy that at paragraph 30 the judge was merely citing what  was  said
    in Mostafa.  As the respondent's application was made under  Article  8
    of the ECHR,  I  find  that  the  judge  was  considering  whether  the
    respondent's exclusion would be disproportionate. I find that the judge
    considered all the factors  and  issues  before  him  in  reaching  the
    conclusion that it would be disproportionate to exclude the  respondent
    from the UK.

Notice of Decision

24.  I find no error of law in the judge's decision.  The  judge's  decision
    allowing the respondent's appeal shall stand.

25.  No anonymity direction is made.
