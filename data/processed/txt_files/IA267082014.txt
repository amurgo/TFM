                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Chipperfield, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State is the appellant in this  case.   She  has  been
    granted permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Lucas allowing the appeal of the respondent against her  decision  made
    on 12 June 2014 to give directions for his removal under Section 10  of
    the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and to refuse to grant him leave to
    remain under the Human Rights Act 1998.  For ease of reference I  shall
    continue to refer to Mr Farai Moyo as the appellant in this decision.

2.   The judge stated that the refusal grounds in this case were narrow  and
    were contained within the refusal letter dated 12 June  2014.   It  was
    accepted by the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  appellant  meets  the
    requirements of LTR and Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.   With
    regard to family life it was also accepted that there were  no  grounds
    for refusing  the  appellant  on  suitability  grounds.   It  was  also
    accepted that the appellant meets the requirements  of  E-LTRP1.2-7  in
    that he is in a settled relationship with Kirsantha  Ventakachellam,  a
    UK citizen who is present and settled in the  UK  and  they  have  been
    living together in a relationship akin to marriage  for  at  least  two
    years.

3.   With regard to EX.1 it was  stated  that  the  appellant  entered  into
    their relationship with Kirsantha Ventakachellam when  his  status  was
    precarious.  It was also noted that he could not meet the  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE.  He is 33 and entered the UK on 19 June 2004.   It
    was not accepted that he has lost all of his social and  cultural  ties
    to South Africa.

4.   The judge stated that the case for the appellant was  set  out  in  the
    skeleton argument dated 3 August 2015.  It was noted that the appellant
    met his partner in 2005 while they were both  students  and  have  been
    cohabiting since 12 February 2007.  The partner of the appellant  works
    for Barclays Bank and earns in excess of ï¿½20,000 per annum.

5.   The judge went noted that  the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM as a partner.  He also meets the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM with regard to suitability.  The only component of Appendix FM  that
    he does not meet is the immigration status requirement set  out  in  E-
    LTRP2.2 and said in paragraph 6

         "In short, the only obstacle to a grant of leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner is the fact that Mr Moyo made his application  from  within
         the UK".

6.   The judge recorded that Mr  Bonavero  the  appellant's  representative,
    agreed that this "technical"  issue  within  the  relevant  Immigration
    Rules must also be considered outside of  them.   Mr.  Bonavero  relied
    upon the principles set out in the well-known and guiding decisions  in
    Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.  At paragraph 10 of the skeleton argument  it
    is stated:

         "Requiring [the appellant] to leave his  partner  to  travel  to  a
         country he has not lived in for over ten years, all in pursuit of a
         successful grant of  entry  clearance,  makes  little  sense.   The
         couple are established here in the UK and it is obvious  from  [his
         partner's] work in the UK that she cannot simply relocate to  South
         Africa to accompany [the appellant] to South  Africa  to  make  his
         entry clearance application".

7.   The judge then said as follows:

         8.   "On behalf of the respondent, Ms Murphy agreed with the  above
             analysis.  She stated that she had taken instructions  from  a
             caseworker with regard to this case and had been instructed to
             request this Tribunal set aside the reasoning of Chikwamba and
             dismiss this appeal.  She made no further submissions.


         9.   Under these circumstances, it is not necessary to  recite  the
             extensive evidence that has been submitted in two  bundles  by
             the appellant in this case.  The facts are  accepted  and  the
             only live issue as between the appellant and the respondent is
             whether it is reasonable to expect the  former  to  return  to
             South Africa to apply for entry clearance.  By agreement, this
             was the only issue in this appeal".

            17.   The Tribunal does not feel  able  to  do  so  in  all  the
             circumstances  of  this  case.   The  disruption   caused   by
             requiring the appellant to return to South Africa to  make  an
             almost inevitable successful application to return to  the  UK
             is indeed false logic.  It is certainly  disproportionate  and
             in the view of this Tribunal, not in any public interest.  The
             Tribunal  concludes  therefore  that  the  removal   of   this
             appellant  is  a  disproportionate   interference   with   the
             (accepted family life of this appellant within the UK.

8.   Mr. Chipperfield submitted that the  judge  did  not  err  in  law  his
    application of Chikwamba and that  his  decision  was  sustainable.   I
    disagreed. I preferred the submissions made by Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  in
    reliance on the grounds.  The circumstances in Chikwamba  were  unusual
    in that there were insurmountable obstacles to the  applicant's  family
    life continuing in Zimbabwe.  I find that the judge failed to  consider
    whether the appellant could return with his partner to  live  in  South
    Africa or whether  there  were  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
    appellant returning to South Africa for a temporary period to  make  an
    application  for   entry   clearance,   which   would   have   included
    consideration as to whether there would be a  significant  interference
    in their family life in the temporary period of separation.   The judge
    failed to take into account that the decision was made under section 10
    of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and so this was an appellant who
    had no lawful basis of stay in the UK.  Consequently, I find  that  the
    judge wrongly applied Chikwamba and failed to grapple  with  the  issue
    that was before him.  For this reason I allow the Secretary of  State's
    appeal.  I set aside the judge's decision.

9.   In remaking the decision I asked the appellant to tell  the  court  why
    he could not return to South Africa to make an  application  for  entry
    clearance to join his partner in the United Kingdom, if his family life
    with his partner could not continue in South Africa.

10.  The appellant said he would need to sustain himself.   He  has  distant
    family whom he has not made contact with since he came  to  the  UK  in
    2004.  In view of the length of  time  he  has  been  away  from  South
    Africa, he will be viewed as a foreigner.   Finding  work  will  be  an
    obstacle.  His partner will not be able to sustain him in South  Africa
    and sustain their household here in the UK.

11.  Following questions from Mr Chipperfield, the appellant said  that  his
    mother and sister live in the UK.  They will not be able to support him
    because they will be running two households.  In South  Africa  he  has
    his maternal grandmother, aunts and uncles.  He has not spoken to  them
    for over ten years.  There was nothing  stopping  him  from  contacting
    them but it would appear that the contact would be  because  he  needed
    help.  Furthermore since his maternal grandfather died there has been a
    dispute over the property he left behind.

12.  Following questions from Ms Willocks-Briscoe, the  appellant  confirmed
    that he holds a South African passport and is a South African national.
     He confirmed that he would be entitled to all the benefits that accrue
    to a South African national.  He submitted that he is  a  Zulu  speaker
    and that if he was in a different environment, he would be viewed as  a
    foreigner and that would affect his job prospects.

13.  Mr.  Chipperfield  submitted  that  the  appellant  would  face  severe
    financial difficulties on his return to South Africa.  In any event  he
    would succeed if he made  an  application  for  entry  clearance.   The
    temporary disruption would not benefit anyone and therefore there is no
    public interest in his removal.

14.  Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that in submitted  that  the  appellant's
    entry clearance application would succeed failed to take account of the
    requirements in Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   The  case  was
    based on whether it would be  disproportionate  for  the  appellant  to
    return to South Africa to make an  entry  clearance  application.   The
    appellant claimed that either his partner nor  his  mother  and  sister
    could support him but there was no evidence that they would not be able
    to.  There was no evidence why he could not re-establish  contact  with
    the family in South Africa to provide him with  financial  support  and
    accommodation.   There  was  no  evidence  that  he  could  not  obtain
    employment.  He was in the UK  as  a  student  and  had  no  legitimate
    expectation that he could remain permanently.  She relied on R (on  the
    application of Chen) (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba-temporary  separation-
    proportionality)IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC)  in which it was held  that
    where there are no children, it is more  unlikely  that  the  applicant
    will be able to show a breach of Article 8.   An  applicant  must  show
    significant interference.

15.  I was not persuaded by the appellant's  evidence  that  he  would  face
    severe financial difficulties if he had to return to South Africa for a
    temporary period in order to make an entry clearance application.   His
    evidence did not amount to a significant  interference  in  his  family
    life.  His evidence that his partner and mother and sister would not be
    able to financially support him while he was in South  Africa  was  not
    supported by any evidence from them.   He  said  his  family  in  South
    Africa would view  his  contact  with  suspicion  because  he  had  not
    contacted them since 2004; yet he did not say that they would not offer
    their support if asked to do so.

16.  The decision of the Upper Tribunal in R (on the application of Chen)  v
    SSHD (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality)
    IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) is pertinent to this case.  In its headnote
    (i) the Tribunal held as follows:


             (i)  "Appendix  FM  does  not  include  consideration  of  the
             question whether it would be  disproportionate  to  expect  an
             individual to return to his home  country  to  make  an  entry
             clearance application to rejoin  family  members  in  the  UK.
             There may be  cases  in  which  there  are  no  insurmountable
             obstacles to family life being  enjoyed  outside  the  UK  but
             where temporary separation to enable an individual to make  an
             application for entry clearance may be  disproportionate.   In
             all cases, it will be for the individual to place  before  the
             Secretary of State evidence  that  such  temporary  separation
             will interfere disproportionately with protected  rights.   It
             will not be enough to rely solely upon the case law concerning
             Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.


         (ii) Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test when he  suggested
             in Chikwamba that requiring a claimant to make an  application
             for entry  clearance  would  only  "comparatively  rarely"  be
             proportionate in a case involving children (per Burnett J,  as
             he then was, in R (Kotecha and Das) v SSHD [2011]  EWHC  20070
             (admin))."

17.  On the evidence put forward by the appellant, I find that  there  would
    be no significant interference with the family life he has  established
    with his partner were he to return  to  South  Africa  on  a  temporary
    separation to make an entry clearance application.  By  the  time  they
    started their relationship the appellant's status in the United Kingdom
    was precarious.  Indeed his last leave to remain as a  student  expired
    on 30 September 2005.  Two applications for leave to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds made on 1 July 2009 was refused on 26 March 2011 without
    a right of appeal and a further application made on 20 March  2013  was
    also refused without a right of appeal.  He was then granted a right of
    appeal against the decision that was made on 12 June  2014.   Therefore
    whilst the appellant satisfies  the  suitability  requirements  and  E-
    LTRP1.2-7, that was not sufficient to allow the appeal on the basis  of
    Chikwamba.  The appellant and his partner have no children.   He  would
    be returning to South Africa where he is a national.   It  would  be  a
    temporary separation.  Objections such as lack of a job and being in an
    area outside of the Zulu community do not in my  view  amount  to  very
    significant obstacles.

18.  Accordingly I dismiss Mr. Moyo's appeal.
