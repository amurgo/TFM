Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. P. Turpin, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr. L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  India  who  on  4  November  2015  made
    application for leave to enter the United Kingdom as the spouse  of  Mr
    Kulwant Singh, a British citizen born on 25 March 1978 ("the sponsor").
     The application was refused and the appellant appealed.

 2. Following a hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 26 January  2017,
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Row dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Pullig.  His reasons for so doing are:-

      1) "The appellant, a national of India seeks permission to appeal,  in
         time, against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Row,
         promulgated on 26 January 2017, dismissing the  appellant's  appeal
         on human rights  grounds  against  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
         decision refusing the appellant entry clearance as the spouse of  a
         British citizen because of an alleged failure to meet the financial
         requirements.

      2) The grounds seeking permission quote from the  respondent's  notice
         of decision, which gives the reason for the decision as being  that
         the sponsor's July (2015) salary was not paid into his bank account
         until the following September.  The appellant had provided a letter
         explaining the late payment.   The  respondent  did  not  find  the
         explanation credible.  That was the only issue  identified  by  the
         decision.  The grounds identify  a  further  problem  in  that  the
         respondent's bundle did not contain the  documents  submitted  with
         the application.  This I find clear from reading it.   The  grounds
         complained that the judge, far from dealing with  that  one  issue,
         dismissed the appeal for want of the  documents  demonstrating  the
         sponsor's income and found the employment not to be genuine.

      3) I agree that the grounds identify  an  arguable  error  of  law  in
         failing to deal with the one issue in the appeal  and  deciding  on
         the basis  of  the  lack  of  documentation  that  was  before  the
         respondent but had wrongly not been copied in to  the  respondent's
         bundle and in respect of which the appellant was at  a  significant
         disadvantage.

      4) Accordingly, I grant permission."

 4. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 5. In making his submissions Mr Turpin relied  upon  the  grounds  seeking
    permission to  appeal  and  expanded  thereon.   In  October  2015  the
    appellant made her application for entry clearance as a  partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).   She  sought
    to join her husband, a British citizen,  following  their  marriage  in
    India on 11 June 2012.   The  issue  in  the  appeal  was  whether  the
    decision amounted to a breach of Article 8 as part  of  that  issue  it
    fell to  the  judge  to  determine  whether  the  application  met  the
    requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  in  Appendix  FM.   With  her
    application the appellant  had  submitted  evidence  of  her  husband's
    employment as a butcher.  The evidence submitted to the Entry Clearance
    Officer consisted of, in accordance with Appendix FM-SE, an  employer's
    letter, payslips covering a period of six months  and  bank  statements
    covering the same period of six months.  The evidence covered  the  six
    months from April to September 2015.  The July salary was not, however,
    paid into the sponsor's account until  September  of  that  year.   The
    application was refused and in the notice of refusal it stated:-

         "You have submitted Barclays  bank  statements  in  your  sponsor's
         name.  However, I note that these show that your  July  salary  was
         not paid until more than a month  later  in  September.   You  have
         provided a letter of explanation; however I do not find it credible
         that you would not be paid for  more  than  a  month  even  if  one
         partner is ill for several weeks.  I  am  therefore  not  satisfied
         that your sponsor's employment and earnings are as stated."

    He went on to submit that the issue for the Tribunal was  therefore  to
    determine whether on the basis of the documents submitted to the  Entry
    Clearance Officer  the  explanation  was  credible  and  the  sponsor's
    employment and earnings were as stated.  Unfortunately at  the  hearing
    the respondent failed to produce the  documents  which  were  submitted
    with the application but nevertheless it was clear that the  issue  was
    not the submission of documents but whether  they  represented  genuine
    employment.  The judge has erred in approaching the issue before him on
    the basis that it was the documents which would have demonstrated  that
    the sponsor was employed as claimed.  The respondent's  contention  was
    not, however, that the documents were absent.  Rather it was  that  the
    documents that had been provided showed a delay between  the  month  of
    employment (July) and the deposit of  the  salary  (September)  thereby
    putting the credibility of the employment at issue.  The  judge  failed
    to make any findings on the credibility of the sponsor  as  a  witness.
    She attended the hearing and gave evidence.  Therefore  the  judge  has
    failed to determine this appeal "properly in accordance  with  the  law
    and the Rules".

 6. Mr Tarlow argued that the judge has shown a "measured  approach  whilst
    interpreting the documentation provided in this appeal" and has  fairly
    found that the appellant's employment was not genuine.   As  stated  by
    the judge it is for the appellant to prove his case.   The  sponsor  in
    this appeal failed to provide the specified evidence in relation to the
    claimed employment.  The judge  directed  himself  appropriately.   The
    appellant  had  a  year  to  provide  photocopies   of   the   relevant
    documentation but failed to do so.  This is a challenge  which  amounts
    to nothing more than a disagreement with reasoned findings.

 7. I find that there is here no material error  of  law.   The  judge  was
    entitled to find that it was "impossible on the evidence" to  say  what
    bank statements or wage slips had been before the respondent  with  the
    application.  Neither the sponsor nor the appellant could give evidence
    about this.  The respondent had not produced the documents  which  were
    submitted with the application.  Whoever submitted the  application  on
    behalf of the appellant did not record which documents were  sent  with
    the application.   The  bundle  that  was  submitted  for  the  hearing
    contained no wage slips at all.  It contained bank statements  for  the
    period 1 April 2015 to 28 August 2015 and not for the  required  period
    of April to October.  They recorded payments of  what  appeared  to  be
    wages on 8 April, 8 May, 8 June and 6 July 2015.   The  payments  which
    are said to have been made in August and September were not shown.  The
    judge then considered other evidence  which  he  found  unsatisfactory.
    The judge took account of the sponsor's evidence (paragraph  6  of  the
    decision) in coming to his  findings.   He  was  entitled  to  conclude
    (paragraph 15 of his decision) that  the  evidence  did  not  show  the
    sponsor was employed as claimed or earned ï¿½18,600  per  annum.   Beyond
    that the balancing exercise required for consideration of Article 8 was
    duly carried out.

 8. These grounds disclosed no material error of law.  The burden of  proof
    rested upon the appellant to prove his case to the  required  standard.
    Quite simply he failed to do so.  That was the judge's  findings.   The
    appellant's remedy is a further application.

 9. There is no material error of law.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
