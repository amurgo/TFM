For the Appellant:     Mr P Armstrong, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Guinea,  date  of  birth  27  August  1992,
    appealed against the ECO's decision dated 24 June 2015 to refuse  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules  HC
    395 (as amended)  (the  Rules).   Her  appeal  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Doyle (the judge), who on 21 March  2006  dismissed  her
    appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal under Article
    8 ECHR.

3.   By a letter and email sent to the Tribunal dated 29 September 2016  the
    Claimant indicated that her Sponsor and fiancï¿½,  Mr  Harald  Horn,  had
    died.  His death was foreshadowed, as recorded in the determination  of
    the judge [D13], where it was noted that  the  Sponsor  was  terminally
    ill.  The Claimant further, in the letter, indicated that  she  has  no
    representative, those she wanted to represent her are unable to do  so,
    she had therefore no-one to appear  for  and  on  her  behalf   at  the
    hearing of the appeal before me.  The Claimant requested a  measure  of
    mercy and indicated that she was living in very miserable circumstances
    from which she hoped to leave.

4.   The ECO raises a  number  of  points  of  challenge  to  the  decision.
    First, but in no particular order, there were no circumstances where it
    could be said that it was not  disputed that the Claimant  and  Sponsor
    were in a genuine  relationship  and  intended  to  marry.   Rather  Mr
    Armstrong confirmed that there was no acceptance of that point  and  it
    is not known on what basis the judge had reached the conclusion that it
    was.  Secondly it was recorded that there was  a  concession  that  the
    Claimant and Sponsor were enjoying a genuine relationship and  intended
    to marry.  Again Mr Armstrong said that there is no  evidence  to  show
    the ECO's representative at the hearing before  the  judge  had  indeed
    made such a concession.

5.   The notes, it seems, of Mr P Stainethorpe, the Presenting  Officer,  do
    not support what the judge has said  of  the  matter.   It  is  also  a
    complaint that the judge when looking at this matter had  not  set  out
    the exceptional circumstances that  justified  looking  at  the  matter
    under Article 8 outside of the Rules but even if there were there was a
    lack of proper reasoning provided as to why going through the necessary
    considerations, a breach of Article 8 ECHR could be established or  the
    ECO's decision was disproportionate.  The analysis was not present  and
    as such since that was the sole basis of allowing  the  appeal  it  was
    flawed and in error of law.

6.   The reality is that, the Claimant's Sponsor being  deceased,  there  is
    no way by that route she might still enter the United Kingdom  and  she
    cannot be granted leave to enter when she is under the particular  limb
    of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration   Rules.    Unfortunately,   but
    necessarily, if the Claimant has any basis to enter the United  Kingdom
    a different and fresh application will have to be made.

7.   I am satisfied that  the  judge's  decision  discloses  an  absence  of
    proper reasons for finding that the appeal should be allowed on Article
    8 ECHR grounds.  I am also satisfied that the judge failed  to  get  to
    grips with the important issue that a medical certificate, which  is  a
    mandatory requirement for such applications, had not been  provided  to
    show that there had been appropriate  screening  for  active  pulmonary
    tuberculosis  and  that  this  tuberculosis  was  not  present  in  the
    Claimant.

8.   In these circumstances, when the  judge  [D  20]  identified  that  the
    prescribed documentary evidence had not been provided, he had failed to
    get the point that was not simply a point that can  be  elided  through
    the process of Article 8 ECHR considerations.  In any event therefore I
    find that the Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand, in respect  of
    the issue of what if any concessions had been  made,  and  therefore  a
    fresh decision must be substituted.
9.      Having considered the papers and, given the death  of  the  Sponsor,
    it is clear that the decision on being remade the Claimant is unable to
    discharge the burden of proof on a balance of  probabilities  that  she
    met the requirements of the rules

Notice of Decision
The appeal of the Claimant is dismissed.

ANONYMITY
