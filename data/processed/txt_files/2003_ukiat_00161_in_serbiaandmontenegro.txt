                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Secretary of State appeals the  determination  of  an  Adjudicator
      (Mr C J Hodgkinson) who allowed the appeal  of  a  citizen  of  Serbia
      (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)  from  a  decision  of  the
      Secretary of State to refuse his application for asylum.  The  removal
      directions are to Kosovo where  it  appears  the  appellant  has  been
      residing from an early age.

2.    The appellant was represented before us as  he  had  been  before  the
      Adjudicator  by  Mr  T  Dedezade  of  Counsel  instructed  by   Vahib,
      solicitors.  Mr G Phillips appeared for the Secretary of State.

3.    The Adjudicator records in paragraph 4 of his determination  that  the
      appellant had been born in Bujanovac in Serbia and that the  appellant
      had moved to Kosovo in 1978 where he had lived with relatives in order
      to attend an Albanian school.  His family had joined him 1984.  He had
      supported the DLK and had distributed leaflets for them.  In  1990  he
      had  undertaken  military  service.   On  10  September  1997  Serbian
      policemen had come to the family home.  The appellant had subsequently
      been interrogated at a  police  station  about  a  gun  which  he  had
      allegedly bought from someone he was told to produce the weapon but as
      he had no gun he was unable to do so and decided to  go  into  hiding.
      He had participated in student demonstrations in  Prishtina  in  March
      1998.  He was told to report to the police following  this.   He  then
      made arrangements to leave the country, arriving on 15 April 1998.

4.    The Home Office was not represented  at  the  proceedings  before  the
      Adjudicator who heard the appeal on 11 April 2003.  he had before  him
      the determination of an appeal by the appellant's  brother.   In  that
      appeal a letter from the UNHCR had been  put  before  the  Adjudicator
      which indicated that "ethnic  Albanians  would  be  refused  entry  to
      Kosovo if they did not originate  from  there  and,  if  they  entered
      Kosovo illegally, would be regarded as illegal  immigrants  and  would
      not be entitled to benefits".

5.    The Adjudicator noted some inconsistencies in the appellant's  account
      but he did not find that any of the inconsistencies went to  the  core
      of the appellant's credibility.  One matter is that the appellant said
      that he  had  gone  to  Kosovo  in  1982  rather  than  1978  (compare
      paragraphs 4 and 23 of the determination).

6.    The Adjudicator was satisfied - indeed it is not really in  dispute  -
      that the appellant was an ethnic Albanian from southern Serbia.  There
      was a summons issued in southern Serbia against  the  appellant  which
      the Adjudicator accepted was a genuine document.  If the appellant was
      returned to southern Serbia the Adjudicator felt there was a real risk
      he would be detained and ill-treated.  The appellant was not aware  of
      the purpose of the summons although the Adjudicator considered it more
      likely that the summons related to  the  appellant's  DLK  activities.
      The Adjudicator was more concerned about  the  appellant  receiving  a
      significant penalty for an offence  not  committed  by  him  than  the
      overall current situation in Serbia which the  Adjudicator  considered
      to have improved.

7.    The Adjudicator allowed the appeal because he felt  it  would  not  be
      feasible for the appellant to be returned to Kosovo on the basis  that
      he was from Serbia.  The removal directions were for  Kosovo  and  the
      Adjudicator  considered  he  would  be  refused  entry   there.    The
      Adjudicator considered that the appellant's  return  to  Serbia  would
      involve a breach of the Refugee Convention.  This was because he would
      be detained on the summons and risk ill-treatment.   He  also  allowed
      the appeal under Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention.

8.    Mr Phillips relied on the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  that  the
      appellant had on any view been in Kosovo from an early age - from 1978
      on one account.   There was a sufficiency  of  protection  for  ethnic
      minorities in Kosovo.  Reference was made  to  the  October  2002  and
      October 2003 Home Office Country Assessments.

9.    Counsel submitted that the appeal should be  dismissed.   It  was  not
      clear whether the appellant had gone to Kosovo in 1982 or 1978 but  he
      did not originate from Kosovo.  He was born in Serbia.  On  the  basis
      of the UNHCR letter he would be refused entry.   The  Adjudicator  had
      found that there was a genuine summons out for the appellant.   As  an
      alternative to dismissing the appeal, it should be remitted.

10.   Mr Phillips submitted that the UNHCR letter  referred  to  originating
      from Kosovo.  The appellant had spent his formative years  in  Kosovo.
      He had resided there for a long period of time.  He was not  a  recent
      or new arrival.  It was not a requirement that he had to  be  born  in
      Kosovo.  He would be provided with appropriate  documentation  on  his
      return.  There was no challenge to the appellant's credibility.

11.   Counsel acknowledged that the October 2003 Country Assessment did  not
      assist him.  Reference was made to paragraph 6.42 of it.

12.   At the conclusion of the submissions we  reserved  our  determination.
      The removal directions in this case are to Kosovo where the  appellant
      had lived from an early age - perhaps from as early  as  seven  if  he
      went there in 1978.  In any  event,  he  was  clearly  an  established
      resident in Kosovo.  We can understand why Counsel  candidly  admitted
      that the October 2003 Assessment did not assist him.  For example,  it
      is recorded in paragraph 6.44 that  on  1  July  2003,  "All  Albanian
      political leaders in Kosovo signed up to  a  statement  urging  ethnic
      Serbs to return to their former homes in Kosovo."   However,  even  on
      the October 2002 Country Assessment it was apparent that the  position
      for Kosovo Serbs had improved enormously - for example  see  paragraph
      6.27 indicating that freedom of movement had improved and that  Kosovo
      Serbs were  increasingly  able  to  drive  unescorted  through  Kosovo
      Albanian areas.  There were still dangers  and  the  situation  varied
      considerably across the province.  Action was being taken  to  improve
      the position of ethnic minorities and  that  appears,  on  the  latest
      position to have borne fruit.

13.   The Adjudicator relied on material that was not  before  him  but  had
      been before another Adjudicator.  This material has  not  been  placed
      before us.  It is not satisfactory for appeals to be conducted in this
      way.  We see no evidence before us to justify the proposition  that  a
      family resident,  and  long  resident,  in  Kosovo  would  be  refused
      admission.  The appellant had been a resident of  Kosovo  from  either
      1978 or 1982 and his family joined him  in  1984.   Given  the  strong
      impetus to encourage and promote returns we find it inconceivable that
      the fact that the appellant was not born in  Kosovo  but  had  resided
      there for a considerable part of his life would result in difficulties
      for him on return.  We do not believe that the  UNHCR  letter  can  be
      read in this way.

14.   The Adjudicator considered the risks to the appellant  in  Serbia  but
      he is not to be returned there.  He is to be returned to Kosovo  where
      as we have said, the situation has vastly  improved  for  Serbs.   The
      appellant  will,  we  are  satisfied,  be  returned  with  appropriate
      documentation.  We see no real prospect of  him  being  returned  from
      Kosovo to the United Kingdom.

15.   For the reasons we have given, the appeal of the  Secretary  of  State
      is allowed and the decision of the Adjudicator is reversed.
