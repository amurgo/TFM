For the Appellant:     Mr J Patel of Legal Comfort Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
        material error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal R  Cooper  (the  judge),  promulgated  on  6  March  2017,
        allowing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision,
        made on 5 May 2015 (and supplemented by  a  decision  dated  4  May
        2016) to refuse his protection  and  human  rights  claims  and  to
        maintain the deportation order issued against him.

Background

     2. The Appellant was born on [ ] 1985. He lived his  life  in  Kirkuk,
        Iraq. He entered the UK clandestinely on or around 7  January  2003
        (approximately 18 years old) and made an  asylum  claim  which  was
        refused on 11 March  2004.  An  appeal  against  this  refusal  was
        dismissed on 16 June 2004. He absconded between 21 April  2005  and
        2009 but came to the attention of the authorities on 28  June  2009
        when he was arrested for affray. He was convicted of an attempt  to
        commit Grievous Bodily  Harm  on  15  March  2010  and  received  a
        sentence of 12 months imprisonment. He was issued with a notice  of
        liability to automatic deportation on  the  31  March  2010  and  a
        deportation order was signed and served on him on 29 April 2010.


     3. On 15 June 2011 the Iraqi embassy issued to the Appellant a  travel
        document and removal directions to Iraq were made for 21 June 2011.
        These were cancelled following an application for judicial  review.
        The judicial review application was  finally  refused  on  7  March
        2014. The Appellant  made  further  representations  for  leave  to
        remain based on his relationship with a British citizen and because
        of the changed situation in Iraq.  The  refusal  of  these  further
        representations (which amounted to a  fresh  protection  and  human
        rights claim) were the subject of the appeal before the  First-tier
        Tribunal.


The 'error of law' hearing


     4. The grounds of appeal relied on by the Respondent at the 'error  of
        law' hearing held on 24 July 2017 reflected the narrow  basis  upon
        which the First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal. The judge  found,
        inter alia, that the Appellant lived in Kirkuk before travelling to
        the UK in 2002, that his father was killed in 1990 and  his  mother
        died in 1993, that he had no  other  immediate  family  members  or
        friends still living in Iraq who could support him, that he had  no
        Civil Status Identity Document (CSID) card, that he  spoke  English
        fluently with a broad London accent, but he was not  well  educated
        although he attended school in Iraq and used to speak and read  the
        Kurdish language. The judge additionally found that  the  Appellant
        undertook barbering skills work whilst in prison, that he was in  a
        relationship with LS and that they only began  living  together  in
        June 2015, that LS has twice become pregnant and on both  occasions
        terminated the pregnancy as she did not want to have a baby if  the
        Appellant  was  going  to  be  deported,  that  the  Appellant  was
        convicted on 26 June 2015 of criminal damage and fined following an
        argument with LS concerning her decision to have an  abortion,  and
        that he did not have  a  genuine  relationship  involving  parental
        responsibility with LS's 2 children.


     5. The judge concluded that the Appellant would be unable to obtain  a
        CSID, that this, in combination with other  factors,  would  expose
        him to a real risk of destitution if returned to Baghdad, and  that
        he would be unable to relocate, upon  return  to  Baghdad,  to  the
        Iraqi Kurdish Region (IKR). Having heard  evidence  from  both  the
        Appellant and LS the judge found that their  relationship  was  not
        strong and that there was no recent medical evidence to  support  a
        claim advanced that there would be a negative impact on her  mental
        health if he  was  deported.  The  judge  found  there  was  little
        evidence demonstrating that the Appellant was fully  integrated  in
        the UK, and indeed very little evidence regarding his private  life
        at all, although the judge accepted that the Appellant spoke with a
        broad London accent and had tattoos and piercings and would  "stand
        out in Iraq." The judge nevertheless also allowed the appeal  under
        article 8 on the basis that, if removed  to  Baghdad,  and  in  the
        absence of any likelihood that he would be able to  obtain  a  CSID
        card, he would be at risk of being rendered destitute  without  the
        means to support and accommodate himself in Baghdad. The fact  that
        the risk of destitution was high  enough  to  meet  the  article  3
        threshold was sufficiently compelling such that it  outweighed  the
        public interest in the Appellant's deportation.


     6. Although the judge did not find the Appellant to be  an  impressive
        witness, noting inconsistencies in  his  account  relating  to  the
        death of his family members and between his evidence and that of LS
        (his partner), I was nevertheless satisfied, for the reasons  given
        in paragraphs 17 to 21 of my 'error  of  law'  decision,  that  the
        judge was rationally entitled to accept the  Appellant's  assertion
        relating to the CSID  card.  In  light  of  the  absence  of  clear
        evidence as to how the National Status Court in  Baghdad  operated,
        or evidence as to the length of time that an application for a CSID
        may take, I was satisfied that the judge was entitled  to  conclude
        that there existed a real risk that the  Appellant,  who  does  not
        come from Baghdad and who has no family  in  the  city  capable  of
        providing him support, would face a real risk of destitution by the
        time any funds provided to him by the Respondent or her  agents  to
        assist his return were exhausted and that it would be  unreasonably
        or unduly harsh to expect him to relocate to Baghdad.


     7. I did however find that the judge's assessment of the  availability
        of internal relocation to the IKR was insufficiently  reasoned  and
        that there was a failure to properly consider the  guidance  issued
        by the Upper Tribunal in the country guidance case of  AA  (Article
        15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544  (IAC).  The  guidance  in  AA  in
        respect of internal relocation was not altered by the appeal to the
        Court of Appeal (see AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944).  The  headnote
        in AA, as amended by the Court of Appeal, reads,
             "19. A Kurd (K) who does not originate from the IKR can obtain
             entry for 10 days as a visitor and then renew this entry
             permission for a further 10 days. If K finds employment, K can
             remain for longer, although K will need to register with the
             authorities and provide details of the employer. There is no
             evidence that the IKR authorities pro-actively remove Kurds
             from the IKR whose permits have come to an end.
             20. Whether K, if returned to Baghdad, can reasonably be
             expected to avoid any potential undue harshness in that city
             by travelling to the IKR, will be fact sensitive; and is
             likely to involve an assessment of (a) the practicality of
             travel from Baghdad to the IKR (such as to Irbil by air); (b)
             the likelihood of K's securing employment in the IKR; and (c)
             the availability of assistance from family and friends in the
             IKR."
     8. The First-tier Tribunal gave no consideration to  the  practicality
        of travel from Baghdad to the IKR, or  to  the  likelihood  of  the
        Appellant obtaining entry to the IKR for 10 days as a visitor,  and
        there was no consideration of  the  likelihood  that  he  may  find
        employment which  would  entitle  him  to  remain  in  the  IKR  on
        registration with the authorities.  Having  identified  a  material
        error of law I adjourned  the  matter  to  enable  evidence  to  be
        provided  by  both  parties   relating   to   the   viability   and
        reasonableness of the Appellant relocating to the IKR.

The resumed hearing

     9. At the resumed hearing, the only new evidence adduced on behalf  of
        the Appellant was a Further Witness Statement signed and  dated  on
        18 September 2017. Although  this  further  witness  statement  was
        ostensibly in the Appellant's own words some of its paragraphs were
        written from the perspective of a third person. In  the  statement,
        the Appellant recalled a previous journey to an airport in  the  UK
        when the Respondent sought to remove him to Iraq. He did not recall
        having any identity or travel documents at that time. He never held
        any identity or travel documents for Iraq, including  the  IKR.  He
        had no  family  or  friends  who  could  assist  him  in  obtaining
        documentation or a job. The Appellant claimed that  his  girlfriend
        was 20 weeks pregnant and that he could not relocate to a  war-torn
        country. He claimed to be totally integrated into  English  society
        and spoke fluent  English.  There  were  said  to  be  no  adequate
        reception facilities for him in Iraq or  the  IKR.  He  claimed  he
        could not speak "the local language of Iraq or the IKR  thereby  it
        would  be  impossible  for  him  to  integrate  in  that  extremist
        society." The statement reiterated that the Appellant spoke with  a
        British accent and had exposed body tattoos which were very  likely
        to identify him as an outsider who did not practice Islam and  that
        this would expose him to a real risk of harm  in  a  society  where
        religious extremists will.


    10. The Respondent only provided copies of the Upper Tribunal and Court
        of appeal decisions in  AA.  There  was  no  additional  background
        evidence relating to the issue of internal relocation to the IKR.

    11.  The  Appellant  adopted  his  statement   and   was   asked   some
        supplementary  questions  by  Mr  Patel,  and  some   clarificatory
        questions by myself. In response to these questions  the  Appellant
        confirmed that he knew no-one in the IKR and had never been  there,
        that he had made no inquiries concerning the IKR, and that  he  did
        not know anything about the region. He claimed  he  could  speak  a
        little Kurdish; he could understand when  spoken  to  but  that  he
        could not fully answer back. The Appellant did not have a religion.
        he undertook a 6 months chef course while in prison and had  worked
        as a chef in a restaurant for only 3 weeks.  He  studied  barbering
        for 8 months in college and  had  attained  levels  1  to  4  in  a
        qualification he could not recall. He said he knew how to cut hair.
        When I asked him why he could not get employment in the  IKR  as  a
        chef or a barber he said he did not know anyone there.


    12. In cross-examination the Appellant confirmed that  he  could  speak
        Kurdish when he  first  entered  the  UK.  he  was  asked  about  a
        disclaimer he signed on 25 March 2010 under the Facilitated Returns
        Scheme (FRS). The Appellant explained that this  occurred  7  years
        ago after he finished his custodial sentence but was detained under
        immigration powers. He had "literally had enough"  when  he  signed
        the disclaimer. At the time the Appellant said he had  an  aunt  in
        Iraq although he did not know where  she  was.  When  I  asked  the
        Appellant about the practicability of travelling to  the  IKR  from
        Baghdad he said Kurdish was his language and  he  could  not  speak
        Arabic. He also said he was no longer a Muslim. He  said  he  could
        not find a job in the IKR and he did not know anyone.


    13. In re-examination the Appellant said he  could  cook  Italian  food
        such  as  pasta,  meatballs  and  calamari.  He  could  cut  normal
        hairstyles such as short back and sides and he could  use  clippers
        and scissors. He was very nervous about the situation in Iraq which
        he said was very bad.


    14. In his submissions Mr Armstrong invited  me  to  hold  against  the
        Appellant the absence of any enquiries made by him about the IKR. I
        was  invited  to  find  that  the  Appellant's  claimed   lack   of
        proficiency in Kurdish was not credible. He  had  arrived  in  this
        country as an 18-year-old speaking Kurdish and it was very unlikely
        that he would have lost the ability to speak the  language  to  the
        extent advanced by him. I was invited to find  that  the  Appellant
        had sufficient skills such as hairdressing to enable him to  obtain
        employment in the IKR. There was nothing preventing him from flying
        to the IKR from Baghdad. He could additionally apply under the  FRS
        scheme to return to Iraq.


    15. Mr Patel reminded me that the Appellant had no friends or relatives
        in the IKR and that he was  fluent  in  English.  It  was  claimed,
        without any evidential support, that  the  Appellant  would  be  in
        difficulties in the IKR because he no longer  regarded  himself  as
        Muslim or having any religion. Although Mr Patel submitted that the
        Appellant's western appearance,  including  tattoos  and  piercings
        would expose him to a real risk of  serious  ill-treatment  in  the
        IKR, he was unable to draw my attention to any background  evidence
        in support of this assertion. Towards the end of  his  submissions,
        after I had repeatedly asked  him  to  draw  my  attention  to  any
        background evidence supporting his various  contentions,  Mr  Patel
        suggested that if such evidence was relevant he should be permitted
        an opportunity to obtain an expert report. I refreshed  his  memory
        of my directions following the error of law hearing  and  indicated
        that all evidence relevant to the issue clearly identified  at  the
        last hearing should have  been  provided  in  preparation  for  the
        resumed hearing. Mr Patel did not identify any expert and  did  not
        make a formal application to adjourn the hearing.

    16. I indicated to the parties at the conclusion of the  hearing  that,
        given the absence of any further background  evidence  produced  by
        either party, that  I  would  consider  the  most  recently  issued
        Country Policy and Information Note produced  by  the  Home  Office
        relating to internal relocation to the IKR. Neither  representative
        objected to this proposal. I have therefore considered the publicly
        available  'Country   Policy   and   Information   Note   -   Iraq:
        Return/Internal relocation (June 2017)'. I reserved my decision.


Discussion

    17. In determining whether it is reasonable or unduly harsh  to  expect
        the Applicant to make his way to the IKR if deported to  Baghdad  I
        draw guidance from paragraph 171 of the Upper  Tribunal's  decision
        in AA, produced below.


             "We have found at paragraphs 112 and 113 above that  there  is
             no Article 15(c) risk to an  ordinary  civilian  in  the  IKR.
             What, though, of internal relocation? So  far  as  a  Kurd  is
             concerned,  the  evidence  of  Dr  Fatah  was  not   seriously
             challenged by the Respondent and we, in any event,  accept  it
             (see esp. paragraph 24 above). The position of Iraqi Kurds not
             from the IKR is that they can gain temporary entry to the IKR;
             that formal permission to remain can be obtained if employment
             is secured; and that the authorities in the IKR  do  not  pro-
             actively remove Kurds whose  permits  have  come  to  an  end.
             Whether this state of affairs is such as to make it reasonable
             for an Iraqi Kurd to relocate to the IKR is  a  question  that
             may fall to be addressed by judicial fact-finders,  if  it  is
             established  that,  on   the   particular   facts,   permanent
             relocation  to  Baghdad  would  be  unduly  harsh.   In   such
             circumstances,  the  person  concerned  might  be   reasonably
             expected to relocate to the IKR.  In  this  scenario,  whether
             such further relocation would be  reasonable  will  itself  be
             fact sensitive, being likely to involve (a)  the  practicality
             of travel from Baghdad to the IKR (such as to Irbil  by  air);
             (b)  the  likelihood  of  securing  employment;  and  (c)  the
             availability of assistance from  friends  and  family  in  the
             IKR."

    18. Neither party produced any evidence relevant to the  practicability
        of travel from Baghdad to the IKR. There was no evidence  presented
        to me as to how the Appellant would arrange travel from Baghdad  to
        the IKR, or how he would afford the journey  whether  by  plane  or
        road. It was suggested in AA that a returnee may be able to  travel
        by air to Irbil but I have not  been  provided  with  any  evidence
        relating to this possibility. I do not know how far in  advance  he
        would be able to purchase a plane ticket,  how  much  it  costs  to
        undertake travel, or what documentation, if any, needs to be  shown
        before one can purchase a ticket or board a flight. I remind myself
        that headnote 17 of AA states that the authorities in  the  IKR  do
        not require an  Iraqi  national  to  have  an  expired  or  current
        passport, or laissez passer in order to gain entry. It  is  unclear
        what documentation, if any, would be required to enter the IKR.


    19. In AA (at [80]) the Respondent  submitted  that  returnees  receive
        assistance under the Voluntary Assisted  Return  and  Reintegration
        Programme ('VARRP'), and that a 'Start Card' containing  the  first
        �500 [of a possible maximum of �1,500], is provided at the  airport
        as the returnee leaves. It is unclear whether the  VARRP  programme
        is the same as the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS). I take judicial
        notice of the fact that funds provided  through  the  FRS  are  not
        available to individuals who have appealed  beyond  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, although funds can  exceptionally  be  provided.  On  the
        basis of the evidence given in AA, and assuming  the  Appellant  is
        able to receive those funds, it appears that he would only  receive
        those funds at the airport when he leaves. If so, he would  not  be
        able to purchase a ticket in advance using funds  provided  by  the
        Respondent. I note from the  appeal  papers  that  the  Appellant's
        partner was in receipt  of  Job-Seekers  Allowance  and  Child  Tax
        Credits, suggesting that she may struggle to provide the  Appellant
        with funds to support himself either in Baghdad or the IKR.


    20.  The  Applicant  would  therefore  be  returned   to   Baghdad   in
        circumstances where he is unlikely to have  pre-purchased  a  plane
        ticket to take him directly to Irbil. There is no  evidence  as  to
        whether he would be able to purchase a ticket immediately on return
        to Baghdad, or the likelihood of him getting a seat at  very  short
        notice. I  remind  myself  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  judge's
        conclusions that it would be unreasonable or unduly harsh  for  the
        Appellant to remain in Baghdad. Although Mr  Patel  was  unable  to
        support his assertion that the Appellant would face a risk of  ill-
        treatment as a result of his clearly visible tattoos and piercings,
        I take account of the decision in BA (Returns to Baghdad)  Iraq  CG
        [2017] UKUT 00018 (IAC) which accepted  (at  [83])  that  there  is
        evidence to indicate that those returning  from  Western  countries
        might be at heightened risk  of  kidnapping,  and  that  whether  a
        returnee from the West is likely to be  perceived  as  a  potential
        target for kidnapping in Baghdad may depend on how long he  or  she
        has been away  from  Iraq.  The  Tribunal  concluded  that  it  was
        reasonable to infer that the longer a person has  been  abroad  the
        greater the perception might  be  that  they  have  benefited  from
        opportunities in the West and may be worth targeting. The Appellant
        has been away from Iraq since  at  least  2003,  and  his  physical
        appearance is very likely to lead to a  perception  that  he  is  a
        westernized individual. I note however that the evidence in BA  did
        not suggest that there would be a real risk  to  an  individual  on
        this ground alone.


    21. In light of the above assessment there is considerable  uncertainty
        as to whether the Appellant would be likely to obtain a  flight  to
        the IKR within a reasonable period of time, and that the longer  he
        remains  in  Baghdad,  the  greater  the  risk  he  could  face  of
        destitution or kidnapping, especially given that he does not  speak
        Arabic and the difficulties he would encounter in obtaining a  CSID
        card.


    22. I have nevertheless considered whether it would be  reasonable,  on
        the particular facts of this case, for him to remain in the IKR  on
        the basis that he is able to make his way there.  There  has  never
        been any challenge to the Appellant's assertion that  he  does  not
        have any friends or family in the IKR, and that he  does  not  know
        anyone there. He is therefore unlikely to have any support network.
        It was not suggested by Mr Armstrong that the  Appellant's  partner
        would be able to afford to send the Appellant money if he relocated
        to the KRI. I do not accept that his  proficiency  in  the  Kurdish
        language is as poor as he claims. He entered the UK as an  18-year-
        old and would have spoken  Kurdish  at  that  time.  It  is  highly
        unlikely that he would have  forgotten  the  language  to  such  an
        extent that he has difficulty in answering questions. I  note  that
        many significant aspects of his evidence were rejected by the First-
        tier Tribunal. I am nevertheless prepared to accept the Appellant's
        claim that his proficiency in the language has diminished  to  some
        extent since his arrival in 2003, and that he speaks with a  marked
        English accent.


    23. The Appellant is young and healthy. He does not  however  have  any
        significant academic qualifications or work experience. He has only
        ever worked in a restaurant for 3  weeks,  and  undertook  a  short
        course  in  cooking  while  in  prison.  Although  he  has  studied
        barbering and professes to have some qualifications in this  regard
        he has never been employed as a barber. I acknowledge that  cooking
        and barbering are transferable skills that may enable an individual
        to obtain employment, but  the  Appellant  has  virtually  no  work
        experience  in  either  field.  As  such,  there  must   remain   a
        significant risk that he would be unable to find employment in  the
        IKR within the 10 days granted to him as a visitor,  especially  if
        his proficiency in Kurdish is diminished to some  extent.  Even  if
        the Kurdish authorities do not pro-actively remove Kurds without  a
        work permit there must  exist  a  real  risk  that  the  Appellant,
        without any network of support  and  unfamiliar  with  the  region,
        would soon find himself destitute. I am consequently satisfied that
        it would be unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect the Appellant to
        relocate to the IKR.
