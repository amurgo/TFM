Representation:
For the Secretary of State:     Mr L Tarlow, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr F Singarajah, Counsel instructed by
                             Thiago Crespo Immigration Consultancy (a firm
                             regulated by the OIFC)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing on Article 8 grounds the claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  to
    issue him with a derivative residence card as confirmation of his right
    to reside in the United Kingdom as the primary carer of Kaue Mendes  De
    Souza, whose date of birth is 13 April 1996.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    did not make an anonymity direction, and I do  not  consider  that  the
    claimant or any member of his family should be accorded  anonymity  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a Brazilian national, whose date of  birth  is  3  July
    1961.  His wife has dual British and Brazilian nationality.  They  have
    two grown-up children, one of whom is a British national, and the other
    of whom is a Brazilian national.

 3. The claimant met and married Riamunda Mendes De Souza in Brazil.   They
    came to the United Kingdom in 1998 for their honeymoon.  They  returned
    to Brazil in 1989, when Mrs De Souza discovered she was pregnant.   She
    gave birth to their first son Kaio in Brazil on 31 July 1990.  In  1991
    her sister, who had hosted her on her first visit, asked Mrs  De  Souza
    to come back and support her as she had just gone  through  a  divorce.
    Mrs De Souza responded to this summons, and returned to the UK with her
    husband and child.  After a while they moved  out,  and  Mrs  De  Souza
    started taking English lessons.  She gave birth  to  their  second  son
    Kaue on 13 April 1996  at  St  Mary's  Hospital  in  Paddington.   They
    decided to stay permanently in the UK, as the education system  in  the
    UK was far better than it was in Brazil, and they wanted the  best  for
    their children.

 4. The claimant however returned to Brazil in 1997.  The reasons for  this
    are not directly canvassed in the evidence.  But I  note  from  Mrs  De
    Souza's witness statement dated 12  November  2014  that  in  1996  the
    claimant started studying at Barnet College for a chef's  diploma,  but
    dropped out after  one  year.   So  his  departure  to  Brazil  may  be
    connected to this.  At all events,  the  claimant  remained  in  Brazil
    until the year 2000. He re-entered with valid leave, and had  leave  to
    remain until 31 January 2001.  The claimant is recorded as then  having
    overstayed for just over a  year,  before  making  an  application  for
    further leave to remain on 27 May 2002 in line with  his  spouse.   The
    claimant was granted leave to remain until 31 July 2003.

 5. The  claimant  is  recorded  as  having  made  three  leave  to  remain
    applications in rapid succession between 28 July and 17 September 2003.
     Two of them are recorded as having been rejected, and one of  them  as
    being granted.  The oddity is that the rejections  apparently  postdate
    the one  application  which  was  accepted.   The  last  of  the  three
    applications made on 17 September 2003 for leave to remain in line with
    his wife was apparently granted on 4  October  2003  until  31  October
    2004.  But the earlier two applications made on 28  July  2003  and  22
    August 2003 were apparently rejected on 17 May 2004 and  28  June  2006
    respectively.

 6. To add further confusion, the appellant is recorded as having  made  an
    unsuccessful leave to enter application as a visitor which was  refused
    on 15 June 2004; and an unsuccessful application as a  dependant  of  a
    student, which was also refused on the same day.   But  these  refusals
    coincide with a period when the appellant apparently had limited  leave
    to remain in line with his spouse.

 7. The claimant clearly overstayed after 31 October 2004, and did not seek
    to regularise his status until 1 July 2013,  when  he  made  his  first
    application for a derivative residence card.

 8. In the meantime Mrs De Souza successfully appealed a decision to refuse
    her ILR on the grounds of long residence, and in  due  course  she  and
    their  younger  son  Kaue,  who  was  born   here,   obtained   British
    citizenship. Their elder son Kaio, who was born in Brazil, has  limited
    leave to remain.

 9. The decision under appeal  is  the  refusal  of  the  claimant's  third
    application for a residence card made on 19 March 2014.   The  claimant
    applied on the basis he was a primary carer of Kaue, a British  citizen
    child.  The application was refused on the ground that  Kaue  De  Souza
    had been about to turn 18 when the application was  submitted,  and  so
    the application had been  decided  on  the  basis  that  the  appellant
    claimed to be the primary carer of a British citizen adult.  No medical
    evidence had been provided which would demonstrate that Kaue  De  Souza
    is and would remain wholly dependent on the claimant  for  his  primary
    care.  The evidence he had provided  was  insufficient  to  demonstrate
    that Kaue De Souza would be unable to reside in the United  Kingdom  or
    another EEA state if he was required to leave the United Kingdom.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. The claimant's appeal came before Judge  Fiona  Beach  sitting  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House on 25 November 2014.  The  claimant
    was unrepresented.  In his oral evidence, he said he had  been  working
    as a motorbike courier for the last ten years.  His wife did care work.
     His eldest son Kato was working part-time, and also  had  a  business.
    His  younger  son  Kaue  was  taking  a  gap  year  before  he  started
    university.  He had last been in Brazil in 2004 for  about  six  weeks.
    His parents, two sisters and one brother remained in Brazil.

11. In her evidence, Mrs De Souza said that she had been initially  refused
    a grant of ILR, but she had successfully appealed the refusal decision.

12. In her closing submissions on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  Ms
    Ayodele submitted that the claimant shared responsibility for the  care
    of his sons with his wife.  He  had  remained  in  the  UK  since  2004
    despite knowing he did not have status here.  She  submitted  he  could
    return to Brazil and make an entry clearance application.

13. In her subsequent  decision,  Judge  Beach  set  out  her  findings  at
    paragraphs [23] onwards.  She found the claimant  did  not  fulfil  the
    requirements for a derivate residence card as there was no evidence  to
    suggest that his  youngest  son  required  care  over  and  above  that
    required by an adult child.  There was also  insufficient  evidence  to
    suggest that the claimant was the primary carer of the  youngest  child
    since both he and his wife worked full-time.

14. At paragraph [27] the judge said  that  the  claimant  also  relied  on
    Article 8.  But he could not fulfil the requirements of Rule 276ADE  as
    he had not spent more than twenty years in the UK.  He had returned  to
    Brazil at various times during his time in the  UK  including  spending
    three years in Brazil from 1997 until the year 2000.  He had family  in
    Brazil.  There was  no  suggestion  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to him returning to Brazil.

15. The judge went on to  consider  Appendix  FM.   The  claimant  had  two
    children in the UK, but they were now both over the age of 18 and so he
    could not qualify under the parent route.  He had a partner  here,  who
    was settled in the UK.  But he  did  not  have  entry  clearance  as  a
    partner.  He only potentially fulfilled the requirements of Appendix FM
    if he fulfilled paragraph EX.1.  Paragraph EX.1 was  not  freestanding.
    It  was  only  accessible  to  those  who  had  successfully  met   the
    requirements under paragraph R-LTRP.  The claimant  could  not  do  so,
    because there was insufficient evidence that his wife earned  at  least
    ï¿½18,600.  His own salary could not be taken into account because he did
    not have permission to work in the UK.

16. Furthermore, there was insufficient evidence before her  to  show  that
    there would be insurmountable  obstacles  in  his  wife  relocating  to
    Brazil with him.  She had ties to Brazil.  There would be  no  language
    difficulties.  She had employment in the UK but there was no suggestion
    she could not utilise the same skills to find employment in Brazil.

17. At paragraph [31] she said she  had  to  consider  whether  there  were
    compelling circumstances that meant it would be  appropriate  to  grant
    leave to remain outside the Rules.  She held there was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with the claimant and his wife, and that  there
    remained  sufficiently  compelling  circumstances  such  that  it   was
    appropriate to consider whether  leave  to  remain  should  be  granted
    outside the Rules.

18. The judge went on to refer to the five-stage Razgar test.  At paragraph
    [33], she found the claimant had established a private and family  life
    in the UK, and that removal of the claimant from the UK would  lead  to
    an interference of sufficient gravity as to engage Article 8.

19. At paragraphs [35] to [37], the judge considered  proportionality.   He
    had lived in the UK for fourteen years.  Much of his time in the UK had
    been without leave although he did make a number of applications and so
    he kept in contact with the Secretary of  State  during  much  of  this
    time.  He was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a  British
    national, and he had two British national children who  were  now  aged
    over the age of 18.  There might well be an argument  that  little  was
    served in expecting the claimant to return to Brazil simply to make  an
    application for entry clearance when his circumstances were  such  that
    he might be separated from his wife and children for a period  of  time
    whilst the application was made.  In general it would be considered  in
    the interests of immigration control for a person to leave the UK where
    they  did  not  fulfil  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  or  the  EEA
    Regulations.  She had also taken account of the general public interest
    considerations contained in Section 117 as amended by Section 19 of the
    Immigration Act 2014:

         I note that  the  [claimant]  speaks  English  and  is  financially
         independent even discounting his unlawful employment (there was  no
         suggestion this employment wouldn't continue if he were lawfully in
         the UK)  which  weakens  the  public  interest  argument.   He  has
         remained in the UK without leave  to  remain  and  his  immigration
         status has been precarious.   However,  the  relationship  was  not
         formed at a time when the [claimant's] status was precarious.  I do
         not find that it would be proportionate for the [claimant] to leave
         the UK with his spouse permanently because she clearly  has  strong
         family and other connections to the UK  and  has  lawful  leave  to
         remain in the UK as do her children.  However, an  application  for
         entry clearance would not lead to the  claimant  being  permanently
         separated from his spouse or to his spouse having to  give  up  her
         employment and relocate to Brazil.

20. It was not only the spouse  who  would  be  affected  by  the  claimant
    returning to Brazil to make an entry clearance application.   His  sons
    would also be affected.  Although they were over the age  of  18,  they
    lived as a family unit and the impression given at the hearing was that
    they were a particularly strong  family  unit  "probably  partly  as  a
    result of the claimant's  immigration  issues  over  the  years".   The
    claimant had remained in Brazil between 1997 and the year 2000  without
    attempting to return to the UK at a time when his sons were young.  But
    that was some time ago, and the claimant had  since  formed  what  came
    across as a strong relationship between him and his sons.  The claimant
    leaving the UK to make an entry  clearance  application  would  mean  a
    separation  of  the  family  unit.   The   claimant   was   financially
    independent and spoke English, and he had strong relationships  in  the
    UK.  Having taken into account all the evidence and the  relevant  case
    law such as Shahzad, she found it would not be proportionate to  expect
    the claimant to return to Brazil  to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

21. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State.   It  was
    submitted the judge had erred in her application of Section  117.   She
    placed weight on the claimant's financial status.  But  having  already
    recorded that this work had been  illegal,  consideration  should  have
    been given to the damage which illegal working has on the  economy  and
    infrastructure.

22. Additionally, the judge had found irrationally that the fact  that  his
    relationship with his wife and children was formed prior to his illegal
    stay should weigh in his favour in the proportionality assessment.   It
    was submitted that credit should not be given in  these  circumstances.
    The relationship may not have begun in the UK,  but  it  was  certainly
    formed and developed here.

23. Given the findings the judge made in relation to the Immigration Rules,
    and the fact that the claimant voluntarily separated himself  from  his
    family for a period of three years in the past, the conclusion that  it
    would be unreasonable to expect him to return to  Brazil  and  make  an
    application for entry clearance was one that was squarely  against  the
    public interest.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

24. On 12 February 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge White granted  permission
    to appeal on the grounds advanced in the  application  for  permission,
    and also in respect of an additional ground identified by him.

25. Given that the claimant had applied for an EEA residence card,  it  was
    arguable that Article 8 did not arise as the Secretary of State had not
    served a Section 120 notice, citing Lamichhane [2012] EWCA Civ 260.

26. In any event, it was arguable that in performing the balancing exercise
    the judge had given insufficient weight to the fact that  the  children
    were adults (Kugathas); the claimant returned to Brazil for a number of
    years without his  family;  and  the  claimant's  lack  of  immigration
    status.  Furthermore, there appeared to be an arguable contradiction in
    the judge finding that there was insufficient evidence  to  show  there
    were insurmountable obstacles in family life between the  claimant  and
    his wife continuing in Brazil, and yet the judge also finding  that  it
    would not be proportionate to expect the claimant to return  to  Brazil
    to make an application for entry clearance.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

27. At the hearing before me, Mr Tarlow adopted what he  described  as  the
    Robinson obvious point  that  had  been  raised  by  Judge  White  when
    granting permission.

28. In reply, Mr Singarajah submitted that the case of Lamichhane had  been
    wrongly decided.  The earlier Court of Appeal decision in JM  (Liberia)
    [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1402  had  not  been  considered  by  the  court  in
    Lamichhane.

29. In Ahmed (Amos; Zambrano; reg 15A(3)(c)  2006  EEA  Regs)  [2013]  UKUT
    00089 (IAC) Mr Deller on behalf of the Secretary of State had  conceded
    that JM (Liberia) remained good law:

         Mr Deller submitted that although the decision  at  issue  in  this
         case - refusal of a permanent residence card - was  not  a  removal
         decision, it would appear, on JM (Liberia)  [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1402
         principles, that the Tribunal should consider the case on the basis
         that a putative consequence of the refusal  decision  is  that  the
         respondent would proceed to direct her removal to Pakistan.

30. In  respect  of  the  other  ground  of  challenge,  he  relied  on  MR
    (permission to appeal: Tribunal's approach) Brazil  [2015]  UKUT  00029
    (IAC), Mukarkar v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 1045 and Aissaoui v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2008] EWCA Civ 37.  In the last case, the Court of  Appeal  noted  the
    following submission by Counsel for the appellant at paragraph [31]:

         Mr Cox submits that many applicants under the  14  year  rule  will
         inevitably have used a false name to obtain work.   He  points  out
         that under the  Immigration  Directorate  instructions  which  were
         published in April 2007  (and  therefore  not  applicable  to  this
         appeal), it will not normally be in the public  interest  to  grant
         indefinite  leave  to  remain  to  a  person  unless  he  has  been
         economically self-sufficient for a significant period of  the  time
         he has spent here  (my  emphasis).   Thus,  he  submits,  the  main
         purpose of the long residence rule is to enable  persons  who  have
         been working here albeit unlawfully to regularise  their  position.
         He submits, as Miss Fielden did, that if persons like the appellant
         are excluded from the benefit of the  long  residence  rule  solely
         because they have assumed a false name in order to work, then  most
         of those eligible to take advantage of the rule will be excluded.

31. The significance of this passage, according to Mr Singarajah,  is  that
    it showed that the judge had not erred in law in not  placing  decisive
    weight on the fact that the claimant had been  working  illegally.   It
    was perverse for the Secretary of State to have a policy in place which
    required an applicant to be self-sufficient as a condition of  granting
    ILR on the grounds of long unlawful residence, but in  this  particular
    case to hold against the claimant the  fact  that  he  was  financially
    independent through working illegally.

Reasons for finding an Error of Law

32. On the reasoning of the Court of  Appeal  in  Lamichhane,  Judge  Beach
    should not have entertained an Article 8 claim by the claimant, as  (a)
    he was not facing removal; and (b)  he  had  not  been  served  with  a
    Section 120 notice.

33. Giving the leading judgment of the court, Stanley Burnton LJ  expressly
    disapproved the earlier Court of Appeal decision in Mirza  &  Others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 159.

34. In Mirza, the court found that the Secretary of State  had  a  duty  to
    serve a one-stop notice because it  had  "duties  of  fairness  towards
    individuals whose lives are on hold, and who may well be  committing  a
    criminal offence by their mere presence, while they await an appealable
    decision".

35. Stanley Burnton LJ described this approach as judicial legislation, not
    interpretation.  He went on to reject the submission that the Secretary
    of State was under a duty to serve a Section 120 notice, or indeed that
    she was under such a duty unless there was a good reason not to do  so.
    The  Section  conferred  a  discretionary  power,   as   held   in   AS
    (Afghanistan).

36. He went on to conclude at paragraph [41] that an appellant on  whom  no
    Section 120 notice has been served may not raise  before  the  Tribunal
    "any ground for the grant of leave to remain different from that  which
    was the subject of the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  appealed
    against".

37. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in JM (Liberia) contains  an  echo
    of that to be found in the reasoning of the Court of Appeal  in  Mirza.
    At paragraph [17] of JM (Liberia) Laws LJ said as follows:

         On the AIT's view of the question, namely  that  the  human  rights
         issue is not  justicable  on  a  variation  of  leave  appeal,  the
         unsuccessful appellant in such  a  case,  if  he  has  a  potential
         Article 8 claim which would so to speak come live on  his  removal,
         surely faces a very unsatisfactory choice.  Either  he  leaves  the
         United Kingdom, as the criminal law says he must, without his human
         rights  claim  being  determined,  or  he  remains  until   removal
         directions are given, anticipating that at that stage  he  will  be
         able to ventilate his human rights claim before the AIT.

38. But these observations  were  obiter  dicta,  as  were  the  subsequent
    observations in  Mirza  cited  above  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Lamichhane rejected. The ratio of Lamichhane is not in conflict with JM
    (Liberia).  In the latter case, the Court of Appeal did not purport  to
    address a situation where the Secretary of State has  deliberately  not
    served a Section 120 notice.  In JM  (Liberia)  a  Section  120  notice
    accompanied the Secretary of State's refusal to  vary  the  appellant's
    leave: see paragraph  [23].   So  although  there  was  not  a  removal
    decision in JM (Liberia), the Tribunal had  jurisdiction  to  entertain
    JM's appeal on Article 8 grounds because he had raised Article  8  ECHR
    in response to a Section 120 notice. On the reasoning of the  Court  of
    Appeal in Lamichhane, the human rights claim advanced by the  appellant
    in JM (Liberia) was properly before the Tribunal because a Section  120
    notice had been served.

39. In short, JM (Liberia) is distinguishable from both this case  and  the
    case of Lamichhane on the facts.  I am not persuaded that Lamichhane is
    per incuriam, as submitted by Mr Singarajah, and I find that it  should
    be followed.  Accordingly, Judge Beach had no jurisdiction to entertain
    an alternative Article 8 claim, having dismissed the claimant's  appeal
    under the Regulations 2006. Her attention was not drawn to  Lamichhane,
    but the law always speaks.

40. If I am wrong to find that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, I consider
    that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  her  freestanding  proportionality
    assessment.  The judge was wrong to treat as assisting  the  claimant's
    case the fact that his relationship with his wife had been formed  when
    his immigration  status  was  not  precarious.   He  did  not  have  an
    immigration status at all when he met and married his wife.  They  were
    both living in Brazil.  What was  relevant  was  that  the  couple  had
    developed a private and family life in the United Kingdom when  at  all
    material times the  immigration  status  of  the  claimant  was  either
    precarious or unlawful.  His wife's status was also precarious up until
    the time that she obtained ILR on the grounds of  long  residence.   So
    they established family life in the United Kingdom together in the full
    knowledge that they might not be able to carry on family  life  in  the
    United Kingdom on a permanent  basis  unless  and  until  the  claimant
    qualified for ILR or was otherwise able to regularise  his  immigration
    status.

41.  The  judge  also  erred  in  treating  the  "financial   independence"
    consideration as helping to tip the scales in  the  claimant's  favour,
    rather  than  the  opposite.   There  is  no  definition  of  financial
    independence in the statute, and so it must be interpreted and  applied
    in the context of relevant case law and Appendix FM of the Rules.   The
    claimant did not satisfy the financial requirements for leave to remain
    as a spouse under Appendix FM as his wife  was  not  earning  at  least
    ï¿½18,600 per annum. I was told that she is currently earning ï¿½16,000. As
    explored in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 at  inter  alia  paragraph
    [32] the significance of the ï¿½18,600 threshold from  the  Secretary  of
    State's perspective is that it is the minimum level of income at  which
    a couple is unlikely to need to have recourse to public funds:

        Mr Peckover therefore summarised the policy intention of  the  SSHD
    as follows:

        "As reflected in paragraph 76 of the Statement of Intent  published
        on 11 June 2012....the Secretary of State's intention therefore  is
        that those who choose to establish their family life in the  UK  by
        sponsoring a non-EEA partner to settle here should have  sufficient
        financial independence to be able  to  support  themselves  without
        becoming a financial burden on the taxpayer,  and  moreover  should
        have the financial wherewithal to ensure that their migrant partner
        is able to participate in everyday life beyond a subsistence  level
        and therefore able to integrate in British society".[11]

42. Since the claimant is not financially independent from the  perspective
    of the Rules, he cannot be treated as financially  independent  from  a
    public interest perspective.  For to do so  would  be  to  subvert  the
    policy underlying the annual minimum income threshold.

43.  Another  reason  for   not   treating   the   financial   independence
    consideration as operating in the claimant's favour is  illuminated  in
    Shahzad (Art 8, legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 85 at paragraph [105]:

         Applying the main principles we  have  derived  from  case  law  on
         Article 8(2) to the judge's assessment of the claimant's  case,  it
         will be immediately apparent that the judge wrongly  addressed  his
         task when considering the proportionality of the legitimate aim  of
         "economic  well-being"  (which  was  the  only  legitimate  aim  he
         considered to  be  engaged).  Although  making  reference  to  "the
         legitimate aim of securing the economic well-being  of  the  UK  by
         sensible immigration control" (which clearly identified  that  this
         head extended to the general (or "macro") level, he wholly confined
         his  actual  assessment  of  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
         legitimate aim pursued by the decision of  the  SSHD  to  a  simple
         calculus at the individual or  "micro"  level,  so  that  all  that
         appeared in the balance sheet were the funds the claimant had  paid
         in course fees and the fact that he  had  enough  to  maintain  and
         accommodate himself. He wholly overlooked that even in cases  where
         there is no cost to the state incurred by an individual student  in
         terms of fees and maintenance and  accommodation,  the  immigration
         rules reflect  an  assessment  made  by  the  government  with  the
         sanction of Parliament of what requirements are necessary in  order
         to ensure sufficient control on the number of persons entering into
         or being able to stay in the UK and for how  long  and  under  what
         conditions. Their terms quintessentially require an  assessment  at
         the "macro" level. He failed to take into account  whether  general
         aspects of "economic well-being", including the need to  limit  the
         numbers who have access to public services and the benefits of  the
         NHS and who are able to compete for housing and for employment with
         those already here: see FK & OK [11] (supra [78]).

44. Illegal working is damaging to society  on  a  macroeconomic  level  as
    those without the requisite status  potentially  take  jobs  away  from
    others who are settled here or have the requisite status.  Moreover, at
    the lower end of the earnings spectrum, the  amount  that  the  illegal
    worker pays in tax is unlikely to offset the social and  economic  cost
    of the increased strain on public services such as the NHS to which  an
    illegal migrant will have free access.

45. Mr Singarajah submits that it is perverse to treat the claimant's self-
    sufficiency through illegal working as a public interest  consideration
    militating in favour of his removal when historically the Secretary  of
    State treated such self-sufficiency as  a  positive  factor.   But,  as
    submitted by Mr Melvin, policies change.  It is not in dispute  that  a
    more liberal regime was in place before the  introduction  of  the  new
    Rules in July 2012; and that under the old fourteen year  Rule  working
    illegally would not have counted against the claimant.  But at  a  time
    when it was much easier to obtain further leave to remain, the claimant
    was nonetheless  unable  to  obtain  such  leave;  and  so  he  had  no
    legitimate expectation of being able to regularise his  status  through
    an in-country application after  the  Rules  were  tightened,  and  the
    fourteen year Rule was withdrawn and replaced by a twenty year Rule.

46. In short, the judge was wrong to find that the claimant was financially
    independent "even discounting his unlawful  employment",  and  she  was
    wrong to find  that  the  public  interest  argument  was  weakened  in
    consequence.  She ought to have  found  that  the  claimant's  lack  of
    financial independence strengthened the public interest  in  him  going
    back to Brazil, with or without his wife.

47. In R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -   temporary   separation   -
    proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) Upper Tribunal Judge  Gill
    held that Appendix FM does not include consideration of the question of
    whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual to  return
    to his home country to make an entry clearance application  to  re-join
    family members in the UK.  There may be cases in  which  there  are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the  UK
    but where temporary separation to  enable  an  individual  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance may be disproportionate.  In all cases,
    it will be for the individual to place before the  Secretary  of  State
    evidence   that    such    temporary    separation    will    interfere
    disproportionately with protected rights.  It will  not  be  enough  to
    rely solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL
    40.

48. The  difficulty  faced  by  Judge  Beach  was  that  the  claimant  was
    unrepresented, and the Presenting Officer invited her to make a finding
    on the viability of the claimant returning to Brazil  to  obtain  entry
    clearance - despite the fact that the claimant had not in  the  grounds
    of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  in  the  witness  statement
    evidence relied on before the First-tier Tribunal advanced a case  that
    temporary separation would be a disproportionate outcome.

49. The upshot was that the judge did  not,  and  indeed  could  not,  give
    adequate reasons for allowing the claimant's  appeal  under  Article  8
    ECHR on the ground that it would be disproportionate to require him  to
    regularise his status by returning to Brazil and making the appropriate
    application for entry clearance once he met the financial  requirements
    (as a result of his wife taking on extra hours or  obtaining  a  second
    job  or  the  family  making  good  the  income  shortfall  through  an
    accumulation of savings).

The Remaking of the Decision

50. Both parties were in agreement that I should remake the decision on the
    evidence that was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Accordingly,  I
    remake the decision in favour of the Secretary of State.

51. As discussed in my error of law ruling, the First-tier Tribunal had  no
    jurisdiction to entertain an alternative claim under Article  8  as  it
    had not been advanced in response to a Section 120 notice.

52. But if I am wrong about that, the Article  8  claim  failed  under  the
    Rules as the criteria of EX.1 were not satisfied (as the  judge  found,
    and in relation to which there is no cross-appeal);  and  the  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal did not and does not disclose  a  viable
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules, having regard to the Chikwamba  line
    of authority (which includes Hayat - see below) and to Chen.

53. In Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 at paragraph [50] Elias LJ said that  the
    first instance judge had rightly focused on three  matters  which  went
    both to the substantive merits of an Article  8  claim  and  were  also
    relevant to the question of whether it was in any event  legitimate  to
    require the applicant to make his application from Pakistan;

         The first is that, as persons only permitted to be  temporarily  in
         the UK, neither the applicant  nor  his  wife  had  any  legitimate
         expectation of a right to remain.  The second is  that  the  family
         life could continue  in  Pakistan,  although  the  wife  would  for
         obvious reasons not wish to return.  The third was  any  period  of
         separation would be short.  In Chikwamba  Lord  Brown  specifically
         identified the length and degree of family disruption as  a  factor
         which would be highly  relevant  to  the  question  whether  it  is
         proportionate to insist that the application be made from abroad.

54. At paragraph [51], Elias LJ said these were all  proper  considerations
    to weigh in the balance when considering the merits of  the  Article  8
    claim.  As the Secretary of State pointed out in her submissions, there
    was strong Strasbourg and domestic authority to the effect that only in
    exceptional circumstances would a couple who had formed a union in full
    knowledge of the precarious immigration status of  either  of  them  be
    entitled to remain pursuant to Article 8 rights: see Y v Russia  [2010]
    51 EHRR 21 at paragraph [104].

55. The claimant has not sought to show that requiring  him  to  return  to
    Brazil to seek entry clearance would be unjustifiably harsh, and  hence
    disproportionate.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  the  claimant's  appeal
under the EEA Regulations did not contain an error of law,  and  accordingly
the decision stands.

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal
under Article 8  ECHR  contained  an  error  of  law,  and  accordingly  the
decision is set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is  substituted:  the
claimant's  appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR  is  dismissed   for   want   of
jurisdiction, alternatively on the merits.

No anonymity direction is made.
