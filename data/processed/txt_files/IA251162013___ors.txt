Representation:

For the Appellants:    Present but not represented
For the Respondent:    Mr P Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fox dismissed these appeals by a  family
   of four from Nigeria.  The first  named  appellant  is  the  husband  and
   father in the family.  He was last given leave in May 2010 as  a  Tier  1
   (Post-Study Work) Migrant.  In March 2012 he applied for leave to  remain
   and this was refused in a decision dated 3 June 2013.  Refusal  decisions
   were also made in respect of the first appellant's wife and two  children
   as his dependants in the application.

2) The fourth appellant was born in the UK on 7 March 2011.  The second  and
   third appellants did not enter the UK with the first appellant  but  were
   granted entry clearance as visitors in February 2010.  They  entered  the
   UK together on 29 March 2010.

3) The first appellant originally came to the UK as a  student  in  December
   2007.  His application in March 2012 for leave  to  remain  was  made  on
   human rights grounds on the basis that his two children  require  medical
   treatment.

4) In the refusal decisions the respondent intimated that the second,  third
   and fourth appellants had no right of appeal as they did not  have  leave
   at the time their applications were made.  The question of validity arose
   prior to the appeals being listed and the Duty Judge indicated that  this
   should be addressed at the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   It
   does not, however, appear to have been raised on behalf of the Respondent
   at the First-tier Tribunal.

5) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  had  evidence  before  him  showing
   that the second appellant has had Hepatitis B and is a  carrier  of  this
   disease.  The  disease  is  well  controlled  but  she  requires  regular
   reviews.  The judge considered  that  there  would  be  adequate  medical
   facilities in Nigeria.

6) The judge also had before him medical  reports  in  respect  of  the  two
   children.  The third appellant has had some minor ailments but these have
   been treated and were unlikely to cause any concern or  difficulty.   The
   fourth appellant has been inoculated to protect against Hepatitis  B  and
   the judge was satisfied that she would receive adequate medical attention
   in Nigeria.

7) The judge  considered  the  best  interests  of  the  children.   He  was
   satisfied that their best interests were served by their being with their
   parents.  The older child was 9 years old and the  younger  one  was  1�.
   The younger would have had little exposure to the culture  and  lifestyle
   of the UK as she was an infant.  The older child had had the  benefit  of
   three years' education in a primary school in the UK.  Although he  would
   have formed attachments, at his age it would not have a  profound  effect
   upon him if he were to be removed from his school  and  his  friends  and
   neighbours.  He would be able to adapt to life in Nigeria.

8) The judge found  that  the  first  appellant  is  a  very  well-qualified
   network engineer and would have no difficulty in securing employment.  He
   might return to the polytechnic from where he  was  sent  with  financial
   support to study in the UK.  The  older  child  had  attended  a  private
   nursery school in Nigeria and would be able to adapt to life in  Nigeria.






Application for permission to appeal

9) The application for permission to appeal was prepared by  the  appellants
   personally.  The first appellant takes issue  with  the  finding  by  the
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal that adequate medical  facilities  would
   be available in Nigeria.  The first appellant states  that  there  is  no
   comparable health care available for Hepatitis in Nigeria  compared  with
   the UK.  The first appellant had been told by a doctor that if his father
   and a cousin had been monitored and  received  good  treatment  for  this
   disease they would not have developed cancer of the liver and would still
   be alive.  The second appellant records that she  had  tests  in  Nigeria
   when she was pregnant with her first child but none of the  tests  showed
   that she had Hepatitis B.  She only became aware that  she  was  carrying
   the disease when she was pregnant in the UK.

10) The second appellant takes issue with  the  judge's  finding  about  her
   employment in Nigeria.  The judge noted that when she applied  for  entry
   clearance she described herself as a marketing manager in  an  investment
   company buying oil and gas on behalf of investors.  In his  evidence  her
   husband said that his wife was a worker in a petrol station.   The  judge
   commented  that  there  was  a  vast   difference   between   these   two
   descriptions.

11) In the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  the  second  appellant
   confirms that she was a marketing manager in an investment  company.   In
   her role the words "gas" and "petrol"  were  used  interchangeably.   Her
   husband said her work involved dealing with petrol and she maintains that
   this is the same as what she said.  She maintains that there has  been  a
   misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the evidence.

12) The second appellant refers in the  application  to  her  second  child,
   whose age is 2 years and 7 months and not 1� years  as  recorded  by  the
   judge.  She was due to have a further vaccination at the age  of  3�  and
   would be monitored until 5 years old to ascertain that she would not have
   Hepatitis.   This evidence had been disregarded.   The  second  appellant
   said she would like her daughter to finish the vaccination process so she
   would not be infected.

13) In summary the appellants state that the Tribunal did not take  all  the
   evidence into consideration and did not reach correct findings.

14) In the grant of permission to appeal it was recorded  that  the  grounds
   took issue with the judge's adverse findings  on  credibility  about  the
   appellant's intentions and the medical evidence.  The grounds were  found
   to be arguable because the determination  contained  such  a  significant
   number   of   textual   errors   that,   in   parts,   sentences   became
   incomprehensible  and  the  reasoning  for  findings  was  unclear.   The
   determination was not checked by the judge before it was sent out and  it
   was accordingly arguable that the  appellants  had  been  deprived  of  a
   proper consideration of their appeal.  Additionally,  although  this  was
   not raised in the grounds, the determination did not show that the  judge
   engaged with any of the new Immigration Rules when considering the  human
   rights claims.

Submissions

15) At the hearing I explained the background to the  appeal  and  was  then
   addressed by the first appellant.  He referred me to a doctor's letter at
   page 4 of the appellant's bundle relating to the  second  appellant.   He
   challenged the finding by the  judge  that  treatment  for  Hepatitis  in
   Nigeria was adequate and referred to news articles in  relation  to  this
   which were lodged  for  the  hearing  before  me.   The  first  appellant
   explained that his wife and son were to attend medical specialists.   His
   wife was due to have an investigation  of  a  fibrocystic  breast  on  20
   January 2014.  His son was due to attend  the  orthopaedic  and  fracture
   clinic on 6 February 2014 and had an appointment with  a  physiotherapist
   on 25 March 2014.  The first appellant explained that he was also waiting
   for checks and vaccination in respect of Hepatitis B in case it had  been
   transferred to him from his wife.

16) On behalf of the respondent Mr Mangion addressed me in relation  to  the
   determination and the numerous textual errors it  contains.   Mr  Mangion
   suggested  that  the  determination  had  been   prepared   using   voice
   recognition software but submitted that the reasoning could be  followed.
   He referred to some of the errors, as follows.  At  paragraph  13,  where
   the judge referred to "they had four is tuition  fees  ..."  that  should
   read "they paid for his tuition fees ..."   At  paragraph  15  where  the
   determination referred to "the 25th of  debris  2010"  that  should  read
   "25th of February 2010".  At paragraph 16 when the judge  refers  to  the
   second appellant as having "described a rule was buying oil and gas" that
   should be "a role".

17) Mr Mangion suggested the biggest mistake was in paragraph 23  where,  in
   relation to the third appellant, the judge wrote "These  of  inadequately
   treated and are likely to cause any  concern  or  difficulty."   In  this
   context the judge was referring to the health of the third appellant.  Mr
   Mangion submitted that it was clear from the context that  the  negatives
   in the sentence had been transferred and the sentence  should  read  that
   the appellant's ailments were being adequately treated and were  unlikely
   to cause any concern or difficulty.  Mr Mangion acknowledged there was  a
   mistake in paragraph 26 over the age of the younger child, who was 2�  at
   the time of the hearing.  There was discussion of a sentence in paragraph
   22 beginning: "The mosses satisfied on the evidence before me  ..."   The
   proper reading was assumed to be "I must be  satisfied  on  the  evidence
   before me ..."  Mr Mangion submitted that these  were  isolated  mistakes
   and the reasoning could be seen.

18) Mr Mangion then turned to the human rights issues.   He  submitted  that
   the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had not engaged with Appendix FM but
   had referred only to Razgar.  The judge did not consider paragraph 276ADE
   or paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.  This was an error of law in  terms  of
   MF (Nigeria) but the judge had considered the appeal in the area where it
   was most likely to succeed.  The judge did not follow the  order  of  the
   questions in Razgar but did not miss any of the steps.

19) On the medical issues the judge dealt  with  the  health  of  the  third
   appellant at paragraph 23.   There  was  some  mention  at  the  previous
   hearing of the  third  appellant  receiving  therapy  but  no  report  in
   relation to this.  It would not reach the threshold for Article 3.  Under
   Article 8 it was a question of the best interests of the children.   They
   were unlikely to have greater problems in Nigeria than they had here  and
   they were not in need of specialist treatment.

20) In response the  first  appellant  explained  that  his  son's  arm  was
   injured at birth.  His problems with his arm were raised by his school in
   the UK and his son attended the doctor.  He was sent for x-ray and  there
   was found to be nerve damage.  This affects his ability to lift his hand.
    It had improved with therapy.  He had been referred to a new  department
   and a further appointment had been made.

21)  The  first  appellant  reiterated  that  his  daughter  was   receiving
   vaccination against Hepatitis and another vaccination was due at 3� years
   of age.  The first appellant further explained that he came to the UK  to
   study and as time went by  events  unfolded.   He  did  not  foresee  his
   present situation which was not of his making.  There was a risk  of  his
   wife contracting liver cancer.  Her Hepatitis  had  not  been  tested  or
   diagnosed in Nigeria.

Discussion

22) The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  may  rightly  be  criticised  for
   failing to check and revise his determination prior to  its  promulgated.
   The findings made by the judge and the reasons  expressed  are,  however,
   not unintelligible.  The determination is a poor  advertisement  for  the
   work of the First-tier Tribunal but it does not necessarily  follow  from
   this that it contains an error of law.

23) The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  follow  the  two  stage
   approach set out in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and did not look at
   paragraph  276ADE  or  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   These
   provisions were, however, addressed by the respondent in the reasons  for
   refusal given in respect of the first appellant.   In  the  view  of  the
   respondent the first appellant would not succeed under these  provisions.
   The  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did   not   rely
   specifically upon Appendix FM and it  may  be  inferred  that  the  judge
   accepted that the appeal would not succeed under the  Immigration  Rules.
   On this basis the judge would have  been  justified  in  considering  the
   appeal under Article 8 outwith the Rules, as he was asked to  do  in  the
   grounds of appeal.

24) In this regard the judge considered the family's circumstances  and  the
   best interests of the children  and  found  that  removal  would  not  be
   disproportionate.  As Mr Mangion acknowledged, the judge  considered  the
   Razgar questions, although not in the correct order.  The  judge  clearly
   recognised that the significant issue was  that  of  proportionality  and
   directed his findings and reasoning to this.

25) The question arises as to whether the judge had  proper  regard  to  the
   medical evidence.  The judge referred to the second appellant as being  a
   carrier of Hepatitis B.  He had before him the doctor's letter at page  4
   of the appellant's bundle but did not refer specifically to the  test  in
   respect of the second appellant's fibrocystic breast or to a chronic skin
   condition from which she suffers.  So  far  as  the  skin  condition  was
   concerned, the letter records  that  this  had  settled  completely  with
   appropriate treatment.  The second appellant now uses a gel for dry skin.
    The issue was not expected to recur or be a problem in the future.   The
   anticipated breast examination was  said  to  be  unlikely  to  need  any
   treatment because there was no direct family history  of  breast  cancer.
   At the time of the hearing before me the test was still awaited but there
   was no reason to question the opinion set out in the doctor's  letter  at
   page 4 of the appellant's bundle.

26) The news items submitted to me in relation to  treatment  for  Hepatitis
   in Nigeria were not before the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal.   I  do
   not consider they would have made a material difference to his  findings.
   It is reported that Hepatitis is spreading and that the main danger  from
   it is that many people are unaware that they are carriers.  By  the  time
   symptoms begin to appear the liver has suffered severe  damage.   In  the
   case of the second appellant, however, she had  been  diagnosed  in  this
   country as a carrier.  The judge's finding was that the disease  is  well
   controlled in the second appellant and there was no prognosis that  would
   be detrimental to her general health.  She would require regular  reviews
   but the judge was satisfied that the condition  could  be  contained  and
   that adequate care would be available.  On the basis of the evidence this
   was a finding the judge was entitled to make.   One  of  the  news  items
   produced before me referred to neglect of the health  sector  in  Nigeria
   and the tendency of political leaders and their families to go abroad for
   treatment but it does not follow from this that treatment  would  not  be
   available in Nigeria.

27) As far as the fourth appellant is concerned, the judge had before him  a
   letter from the GP dated 7 October 2013.  This refers to eczema, which it
   is said tends to be a  childhood  illness  and  there  was  certainly  no
   ongoing or major  skin  condition.   She  had  had  a  full  schedule  of
   Hepatitis B vaccinations and blood tests showed a good response to these.
    She is not a carrier of Hepatitis herself.  She was due to have a  fifth
   dose of Hepatitis B at the age of 3� years along with pre-school boosters
   in the community.  These could be taken wherever the family  was  living.
   No further investigations or blood tests were required as this was just a
   precaution because of maternal Hepatitis B.

28) As Mr Mangion submitted,  the  medical  conditions  experienced  by  the
   members of the family fall far short of the threshold for the appeals  to
   succeed under Article 3.   The  evidence  indicates  that  treatment  and
   monitoring for Hepatitis B would be more costly in Nigeria than in the UK
   but there was evidence on which the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  that
   treatment would be available.

29) Having assessed the medical evidence,  the  judge  considered  the  best
   interests of the children, which were to remain with the family unit as a
   whole.  The children would be able to adapt to a return to Nigeria.   The
   judge was entitled  to  reach  this  conclusion,  having  regard  to  the
   decision of the Supreme Court in Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74.

30) Although there are significant criticisms  which  may  be  made  of  the
   determination, particularly in relation to the judge's failure to  revise
   and correct his text, the criticisms do not amount to  an  error  of  law
   such that the determination should be set aside.  The conclusions reached
   by the judge were sustainable on the basis of the findings made  and  the
   reasons expressed.

31) There is a further question  as  to  the  validity  of  the  appeals  in
   respect of the second, third and fourth appellants.  As no point has been
   taken in the course of the appeal by the respondent on this matter and as
   the appeals have anyway been dismissed, I do not consider it is necessary
   to consider this matter further.

Conclusions

32) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

33) I do not set aside the decision.

34) The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  anonymity  direction.   Having
   regard, however, to the ages of the children and the medical  evidence  I
   consider it would be appropriate for such an order to be made in terms of
   Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  preventing
   the publication of any material identifying the appellants.
