For the Respondent:    Ms H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Phull promulgated on 18 July 2019 dismissing the Appellant's appeal  on
    protection grounds.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Namibia born  on  11  October  1991.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom on  20  February  2018  and  applied  for
    asylum on the same date.  A screening interview  was  conducted  on  21
    February 2018, and a substantive interview on 14 March 2018.   At  that
    stage the Appellant advanced his protection claim  by  reference  to  a
    family dispute in respect of inherited  property.   Subsequent  to  the
    asylum interview, further representations were made on his behalf on 21
    March 2018 in which an issue in respect of his  sexuality  was  raised.
    In consequence the Respondent arranged for  the  Appellant  to  be  re-
    interviewed on 11 April 2018, and this aspect of the  Appellant's  case
    was explored further in the course of that interview.


3.   The Appellant claims  to  be  bisexual.   He  related  having  had  two
    encounters with men  whilst  living  in  Namibia,  the  first  being  a
    relationship of approximately 1-2 years,  and  the  second  essentially
    being a one-off incident following attendance at  a  friend's  wedding.
    The Appellant also related that at  the  time  of  his  departure  from
    Namibia he was in a relationship of some  two  years  standing  with  a
    woman to whom he was engaged to be married and who  was  expecting  his
    child.


4.    The  Appellant's  application  for  protection  was  refused  by   the
    Secretary of State in respect  of  both  aspects  of  his  case  -  the
    property dispute and sexuality - for reasons set out in a 'reasons  for
    refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated 24 April 2018.


5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


6.   The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the decision  of  Judge
    Phull.


7.   The Appellant applied for permission to  appeal,  which  in  the  first
    instance was refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro on 15  August
    2019, but was subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 17
    September 2019.  The grant of permission to appeal is in material  part
    in these terms:

         "Arguably, as asserted in the first ground,  the  Judge  failed  to
         take into account the evidence of two arguably material witnesses".




8.   One of the witnesses was 'NT', a  national  of  Namibia  who  had  also
    claimed asylum on the grounds of sexuality and had  succeeded  in  that
    claim.  NT spoke in a witness statement dated 25 March 2019  of  having
    met the Appellant in the United  Kingdom  and  having  discussed  their
    respective sexualities.  NT attended the hearing before the  First-tier
    Tribunal and gave evidence in support of his witness statement.


9.   The other witness referred to in the grounds of appeal  and  the  grant
    of permission to appeal is The  Reverend  David  Babbington,  a  priest
    within the diocese  of  Lichfield,  and  a  member  of  the  Bishop  of
    Lichfield's consultancy group on LGBT+ issues. He is  also  a  regional
    ambassador for an inclusive church, and  a  family  pastor  for  Emmaus
    Christian LGBT+ asylum seeker and refugee support group.  The  Reverend
    Babbington states in a letter dated 6 June 2019  that  he  is  gay  and
    lives openly as such.


10.  The Reverend Babbington offered supporting testimony by way of  a  five
    page letter. It contains considerable detail in  respect  of  both  the
    Appellant and  wider  matters.   In  part  the  letter  refers  to  the
    methodology of evaluating asylum claims from  LGBT+  people,  and  also
    refers to the church's function and roles in respect  of  such  matters
    and matters of sexuality generally. More pertinently, the  letter  also
    speaks as to the writer's own experience of meeting the Appellant,  and
    his assessment of the Appellant.  The  Reverend  Babbington  states  in
    clear terms  that  he  is  confident  as  to  the  Appellant's  claimed
    sexuality.  It is also  indicated  that  the  discussions  between  the
    Appellant and the writer were in  part  in  the  context  of  exploring
    reconciliation of faith and sexuality. It  seems  to  me  that  it  may
    reasonably be inferred that discussing such reconciliation  involves  a
    consideration of personal feelings at some depth.


11.  The sexuality of the Appellant is of course a  starting  point  in  his
    case and is not inevitably favourably determinative:  for  example,  it
    would be necessary in due course to give consideration to the  guidance
    in HJ (Iran) in respect of lifestyle choices that the  Appellant  might
    adopt, and whether such lifestyle choices are  influenced  by  fear  of
    oppression or persecution or for other reasons.   Potentially  this  is
    particularly pertinent in the instant case given that at  the  time  of
    the Appellant's departure from Namibia he had been  in  a  longstanding
    relationship with a woman to whom he was engaged to be married, and  he
    did not report having had any sexual encounters  with  men  during  the
    currency of that relationship.


12.  In what is otherwise  for  the  main  part  a  coherent  and  carefully
    reasoned decision, it seems to me clear that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge has fallen into a significant material error of law in reaching a
    conclusion that it was "not credible that he  is  bisexual"  (paragraph
    35) because there is no apparent consideration of, or otherwise reasons
    for rejecting, the testimony of  either  of  the  witnesses  identified
    above.  This was significant testimony in respect of a core element  of
    the Appellant's claim. He was entitled to a reasoned  analysis  of  its
    substance if it, and his claim to be bisexual, were to be rejected.


13.  There is a reference at paragraph 6 of the Decision to  the  fact  that
    NT attended the hearing and gave evidence  via  the  court  interpreter
    relying upon his witness statement.  There is a further reference to NT
    where the Judge sets out  the  submissions  made  by  the  Respondent's
    Presenting Officer who argued "The witness does not take the matter any
    further because he doesn't  know  about  the  Appellant's  fiancï¿½e  and
    child" (paragraph 12).  There is no further reference to the  testimony
    of NT at any point in the Decision.  This means that the  substance  of
    NT's testimony is not set out anywhere in the  Decision:  far  less  is
    there any analysis or finding in respect of the testimony.


14.  There is a complete failure to make any reference to  the  evidence  of
    the Reverend Babbington.  The passing reference to the  fact  that  the
    Judge had taken  into  account  the  Appellant's  bundle  of  documents
    (paragraph 5) is not remotely adequate in the context of the  facts  of
    this particular case and the nature of the testimony  of  the  Reverend
    Babbington.


15.  Ms Aboni, having had the opportunity of considering  the  substance  of
    the challenge and having had sight of the  witness  statement  and  the
    Reverend Babbington's letter,  acknowledged  that  she  was  not  in  a
    position to resist the challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's Decision.
    She also acknowledged that the only appropriate outcome  was  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal be set aside and that the Appellant
    be afforded  a  further  opportunity  of  putting  his  case  before  a
    different Judge in the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

16.  The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  material  error  of
    law.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


17.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull,  with
    all issues at large.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
