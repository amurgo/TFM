Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Nnamani, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    M I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
        material error of law in the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal S  Meah,  promulgated  on  20  March  2017,  in  which  he
        dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
        dated 14 July 2015 refusing her entry clearance application  as  an
        adult dependent child of a former Ghurkha.


     2. In an 'error of law' decision promulgated  on  6  February  2018  I
        found that judge Meah erred  in  law  by  approaching  the  earlier
        decision of  Judge  Beg,  promulgated  on  13  June  2012,  without
        considering  the  likelihood  that   Judge   Beg   may   have   too
        restrictively interpreted the authority of Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ
        31 when considering whether the appellant enjoyed family life  with
        her parents, and, in particular, her  mother.  I  was  additionally
        satisfied that Judge Beg may have set too high the threshold needed
        to demonstrate family life between an adult child and  her  parent.
        In Kugathas the Court of Appeal indicated that support by a  parent
        of an adult child had to be 'real' or 'committed'  or  'effective'.
        The use of the conjunctive by Judge Beg  (who  required  "...  real
        committed and  effective  support")  suggests  that  she  may  have
        applied an unduly  restrictive  test.  In  Rai  v  Entry  Clearance
        Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320  the  Court  of  Appeal  saw
        force in similar submissions (see paragraph 36). Judge Meah did not
        consider this aspect of Judge Beg's decision.


     3.  Having  found  material  legal  errors,  and  having   heard   the
        representations from both parties, I agreed that the  appeal  would
        remain in the Upper Tribunal but that  it  would  be  adjourned  to
        enable further evidence to be provided.

   Factual Background


     4. The appellant is a national of Nepal, date of birth 30 May 1981. On
        26 September 2013 she applied for leave to  enter  the  UK  on  the
        basis of her relationship with her parents. Her father, Hukum Singh
        Pun Suk Bahadur Gurung, was discharged from the Brigade of Ghurkhas
        on 27 June 1982 and was granted Indefinite Leave to Enter the UK in
        late 2009 following a change in the Home Office policy relating  to
        former Ghurkhas. He entered the UK in July  2010.  The  appellant's
        mother, Purnakali Pun, was granted Indefinite  Leave  to  Enter  in
        early 2010 and she entered the UK in September 2012. She has  since
        made several trips back to Nepal to see the appellant.


     5.  The appellant previously applied for leave  to  enter  the  UK  in
        2011. This application was refused on 4 November 2011 and an appeal
        dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Beg on 13 June  2012.
        Judge Beg did  not  find  that  the  appellant  had  established  a
        sufficiently strong family life with her parents so as  to  trigger
        the operation of article 8 ECHR.


     6.  The  entry  clearance  application  made  in  September  2013  was
        initially  refused  on  3  December  2013  but  this  decision  was
        withdrawn the day prior to an appeal hearing. The  application  was
        reconsidered  and  again  refused  on  14  July  2015  because  the
        appellant did not meet the requirements of Annex K of Chapter 15 of
        the Immigration Directorate Instructions (IDIs), which sets out the
        requirements for a grant of entry clearance for adult  children  of
        former Ghurkhas, as she was over the age of 30 when her application
        was   made.   The   respondent   considered   whether   article   8
        considerations might warrant of grant of leave to enter but was not
        satisfied that the appellant had established family life  with  her
        parents.


     7. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing on 3 March 2017 the  appellant's
        representative conceded that she could not meet the requirements of
        the immigration rules  or  the  respondent's  policy  at  Annex  K,
        Chapter 15 of the IDIs. It was accepted by the respondent that  the
        appellant was under the age of 18  at  the  time  of  her  father's
        discharge and that a settlement application would have been made by
        her  before  2009  had   the   option   been   available.   Neither
        representative resiled from these stated positions  in  the  appeal
        before me.  In  addition,  Mr  Jarvis  indicated  that,  if  I  was
        satisfied  that  family  life  existed  (article  8(1)),  then  the
        requirements of article 8(2) would be met (in other words, that the
        refusal of entry clearance would be disproportionate based  on  the
        historical injustice identified in Gurung v Secretary of State  for
        the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 2546).


The resumed hearing

     8. At the  resumed  hearing  the  appellant  relied  on  a  bundle  of
        documents that was before the First-tier Tribunal hearing,  running
        to 121 pages, and a supplementary bundle of documents running to 20
        pages. The original bundle contained, inter alia,  statements  from
        the appellant, her mother and father all dated 24 February 2017,  a
        copy of the appellant's passport, copies of her parents' passports,
        details relating to her father's military service with the  British
        Army and his pension, various educational certificates and diplomas
        awarded to the appellant including her School  Leaving  Certificate
        Examination  and  Higher   Secondary   Education   Board   Academic
        Transcript, a letter from Dillibazar Kanya Multiple Campus dated 26
        August 2013 indicating the appellant was  in  the  3rd  year  of  a
        Bachelor's  Degree  having  enrolled  in  2011,  and  bank  account
        statements relating to the appellant's parents. The original bundle
        additionally contained a number of money transfer receipts  showing
        funds sent by both of the appellant's parents to her from  2013  to
        2016.


     9. The supplementary bundle contained a supplementary  statement  from
        the appellant's father, dated  19  March  2018,  various  documents
        confirming his travel to Nepal at the beginning of 2018,  and  some
        medical  documents  originating  from  Nepal  indicating  that  the
        appellant recently suffered from abdominal pain.  The  bundle  also
        contained some additional money transfer  receipts  in  respect  of
        funds sent by the appellant's mother to her on 3 occasions in 2017.


    10. During  the  hearing  the  appellant's  mother  provided  documents
        purporting to be the appellant's telephone  records  that  included
        calls received by her from the United Kingdom covering  the  period
        from November 2016 to February 2017.


    11. In her statement the appellant said she lived on  her  own  in  the
        family home in Nepal. She described a  terrible  road  accident  in
        which her kneecap was destroyed and  her  need  for  reconstructive
        surgery and a long period of rehabilitation. Without the  help  and
        constant support of her parents she did not think  she  would  have
        recovered as quickly. The mental scars from the bike accident still
        haunted  the  appellant;  she  still  feels  very  scared  to  ride
        motorbikes and usually stays inside the family home.  Although  she
        attended Dillibazar Kanya Multiple Campus from  2011  it  took  her
        almost 1ï¿½ hours to walk there and, although she took  a  taxi  when
        she felt tired, this was very expensive. The appellant  claims  she
        later lost interest and could not continue her  studies,  and  that
        she sometimes still feels pain in  her  knee.  She  is  lonely  and
        desperate most of the time, and very sad. She  misses  her  parents
        all the time and, although they try to keep in touch by  telephone,
        this is not the same as being together in real life.  She  cries  a
        lot when she speaks to her parents.  The  appellant  described  how
        someone has been knocking and bashing her door at midnight  once  a
        week and that this is been going on a long time, and that  she  has
        had men's underwear and trousers and stones thrown at  her  window.
        She did not want to report these matters to  the  police  believing
        that this would only escalate the consequences.  The  appellant  is
        also concerned about the possibility of another serious  earthquake
        striking the country. The appellant confirms that she is single and
        unemployed and financially reliant on her parents.


    12. The following is a summary of the evidence given by the appellant's
        father in his statements. The appellant was still  emotionally  and
        financially dependent on him and his wife.  He  confirmed  that  he
        would have applied  for  settlement  together  with  his  dependent
        family had he been given the opportunity to do  so,  and  that  the
        appellant would have then  qualified  for  settlement  as  a  minor
        dependent when he was discharged from the army on 27 June 1982. The
        appellant's father has 2 sons, Hari, who is present and settled  in
        Hong Kong with his wife  and  children,  and  Kamal,  who  is  also
        present and settled in Hong Kong  with  his  wife  and  child.  The
        appellant's sister, Sindhu, is married and working in  Spain  where
        she lives with her husband. The appellant continues to live on  her
        own. After his discharge from  the  British  Army  the  appellant's
        father obtained work as a Security Guard in Brunei  in  the  Gurkha
        Reserve Unit. The appellant's  father  maintained  that  she  would
        become depressed as soon as she was left on her own and would often
        cry so much that her parents would have to travel back  to  console
        her  and  reiterate  that  she  had  not  been  stranded.  A  brief
        description was given of the serious motorbike accident suffered by
        the appellant. Although she is able to walk, she sometimes  suffers
        aches and pain.


    13. It is the duty of the appellant's father to find a proper match for
        her and sent her to her husband's home. In Nepalese society  it  is
        unacceptable for young women to live  without  their  parents.  The
        appellant would work in Nepal if she had the opportunity to  do  so
        but it was difficult to find jobs without  personal  contacts.  The
        appellant's father was additionally  concerned  that,  as  a  young
        woman, she would be vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. The
        appellant's father and his wife were very anxious  for  her  safety
        and she was living on her own. He maintained that they were a  very
        close family and that  his  family  life  with  the  appellant  was
        unbroken. He recently travelled urgently to Nepal as the  appellant
        said she was very ill. She was scared and had no one to look  after
        her. The appellant was said to be in a miserable  condition  and  a
        doctor advised her father that she was not eating good food. If the
        appellant is refused entry clearance her father indicated  that  he
        and his wife will be forced to return to Nepal.


    14. The following is a summary of the evidence given by the appellant's
        father at the hearing. He speaks to her  daily.  He  and  his  wife
        previously visited the appellant in November 2017 but only he  went
        back in February 2018. In cross-examination the appellant's  father
        explained that, although the appellant could undertake small  jobs,
        there may be a perception that she was unable to work and  men  may
        therefore not want to marry her. He had not looked  for  a  husband
        for her because the appellant could have found a  husband  herself.
        After some confusion the appellant's father stated that  his  other
        daughter got married in 2012 and went to Spain in  2014.  Prior  to
        Sindhu moving to Spain she lived with the appellant in  the  family
        home in Nepal. Both his sons settled  in  Hong  Kong  around  1994.
        Although in the 2012 appeal the appellant's father said  that  Hari
        was planning to move back to Nepal this did not happen as he wanted
        to continue working in Hong Kong. The appellant's grandmother  died
        in June or  July  2017  and  her  paternal  uncle,  from  whom  the
        appellant's  father  had  'separated',  had  his  own  family.  The
        appellant experienced some problems from drug addicts who  harassed
        her and threw stones at the windows of her home.


    15.  The  appellant's  father  initially  claimed  that   her   serious
        motorcycle accident occurred after he had entered the UK.  He  then
        explained that he might have forgotten when this occurred.  He  did
        not know whether the appellant had undertaken any further education
        since she stopped attending the Dillibazar Kanya  Multiple  Campus.
        The appellant did not  work  on  agricultural  land  owned  by  her
        family, which was located in a village and  not  in  Kathmandu.  In
        response to questions from me the appellant's father confirmed that
        they only communicated by telephone and not the Internet.  Although
        the appellant undertook a hairstylist course she was unable to find
        a job. In re-examination the appellant's father explained that  his
        brother lived with his  wife,  his  son  his  daughter-in-law,  his
        daughter and grandson.


    16. The following is  a  summary  of  the  evidence  contained  in  the
        statement written by the  appellant's  mother.  The  appellant  has
        always been dependent on her and  her  husband  for  financial  and
        emotional  support.  She  and  the  appellant  used  to   spend   a
        considerable amount of time together in Nepal.  They  used  to  eat
        their meals together and would  go  on  holiday  together  visiting
        family and friends. The appellant's mother waited nearly 2 years to
        enter the UK pursuant to her grant of ILE  because  she  could  not
        leave the appellant on her  own  and  hoped  that  the  appellant's
        previous application would  be  successful.  She  and  her  husband
        travelled back and forth to Nepal on numerous occasions to see  the
        appellant and it was very difficult to leave her behind  when  they
        returned. When she first came to the UK pursuant to  the  grant  of
        ILE the appellant's mother felt she had no choice. The  appellant's
        mother claims that she does not have the courage  to  live  without
        her beloved daughter and that her heart is torn to pieces.  She  is
        anxious about the appellant's safety given that she  lives  on  her
        own and that she has been facing harassment. The appellant's mother
        had to look after the appellant and her siblings when their  father
        was serving in  the  Gurkha  Reserve  Unit  for  almost  10  years.
        Although the family had some relatives in their  village  they  had
        their own financial problems and it was the duty of the appellant's
        parents to look after her and find an appropriate match for her.


    17. The following  is  a  summary  of  the  appellant's  mother's  oral
        evidence. She and the appellant sometimes  spoke  daily,  sometimes
        every other day. They communicated by  telephone.  The  appellant's
        mother produced a number of standard phonecards that she would  use
        to telephone the appellant.  She  last  visited  the  appellant  in
        November 2017, returning in  December  2017.  She  did  not  go  in
        February 2018 because they did not have enough money,  because  she
        had only been there 22 days beforehand,  and  because  her  husband
        would deal with the hospital and the x-rays. The appellant's mother
        wanted the appellant to live in the UK because she was very worried
        about her, and because the appellant was alone  and  because  there
        was no one to  look  after  her  and  her  husband.  Prior  to  the
        commencement of cross-examination  the  appellant's  mother  became
        tearful and emotional and I gave her some time to  compose  herself
        before resuming of the hearing.


    18. In cross-examination, after describing the immigration  history  of
        her other children, the appellant's mother explained that  children
        in Nepal normally lived with their parents until they got  married.
        Although there was no cultural expectation  that  the  young  woman
        should not live alone, a young woman  could  not  live  with  other
        people if not married. The appellant's  mother  was  aware  of  the
        harassment problems her daughter was having and had advised her  to
        stay indoors, to  stay  calm  and  not  to  mix  with  others.  The
        appellant used to take a micro-bus  and  3-wheeler  transport  when
        available to her college. She stopped  studying  around  2014/2015.
        The appellant's mother confirmed that the  appellant's  grandmother
        died in June/July 2017, and that the appellant's paternal uncle was
        more than 84 years old. He could not look after the appellant as he
        was often in hospital and his family had  their  own  problems  and
        they had to look after their own family first. The appellant  could
        either get married through a love match or if a boy's  family  made
        overtures about marriage. Neither had occurred in  respect  of  the
        appellant. It was suggested that the  appellant's  mother  and  her
        husband were exaggerating the appellant's difficulties because they
        wanted her to have a better life  outside  Nepal.  The  appellant's
        mother said that they could look after the appellant when she  came
        to the UK and that she  would  be  able  to  look  after  them.  In
        response to questions from me the appellant's mother said  she  did
        not worry about her other daughter  as  she  was  married  and  was
        looked after by her husband. At this point the  appellant's  mother
        again became tearful. In  re-examination  she  explained  that  she
        always worried about the appellant who was alone. She did not  stop
        the appellant from getting married.


    19. I heard submissions  from  both  representatives  and  reserved  my
        decision.

Findings of fact and reasons


    20. Having set aside the decision of Judge Meah, I  must  approach  the
        earlier decision of Judge Beg in  accordance  with  the  Devaseelan
        (Second Appeals - ECHR - Extra-Territorial Effect) Sri Lanka Lanka*
        [2002] UKIAT 00702 principles. I regard Judge Beg's decision as  my
        starting point. Although not binding on me  I  am  not  hearing  an
        appeal against it and, as an assessment of the  matters  that  were
        before Judge Beg it should  simply  be  regarded  as  unquestioned,
        although it may be built  upon.  I  must  however  also  take  into
        account, for the reasons given in my 'error of law'  decision,  the
        possibility that Judge Beg may have too  restrictively  interpreted
        the principles enunciated in Kugathas and that she may have set too
        high the threshold needed to demonstrate  family  life  between  an
        adult child and her parent (applying Rai v Entry Clearance Officer,
        New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320, (Singh & Anor v Secretary  of  State
        for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630, PT (Sri Lanka) v Entry
        Clearance  Officer,  Chennai  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  612,  and  Butt  v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 184).  I
        additionally note that Judge Beg did not hear  oral  evidence  from
        the appellant's mother, who remained in Nepal until after the First-
        tier Tribunal's 2012 decision. A further change in circumstances is
        that the appellant's brother in Hong Kong is no longer intending to
        return to Nepal.

    21. Paragraphs 24 and 25  of  Judge  Beg's  decision  are  particularly
        relevant and I set them out below.


         24. The appellant also  stated  at  paragraph  13  of  her  witness
         statement that she is "inseparable" from her mother.  I  find  that
         there is little evidence that the appellant is inseparable from her
         mother. The fact that she may choose to go shopping with her mother
         and have a degree of moral support from her mother because  she  is
         self-conscious about her scars  on  her  leg  does  not  in  itself
         provide cogent evidence that the appellant's relationship with  her
         mother goes beyond normal emotional ties to a relationship or [sic]
         real committed and effective support. As a [sic] adult child  I  do
         not find that the appellant's relationship with  her  parents  goes
         beyond normal emotional ties to a relationship  of  real  committed
         and effective support and I therefore find that it is not a  family
         life within the purpose and meaning of Article 8. I find that  even
         if the relationship can be  deemed  to  be  a  family  relationship
         within the spirit of Article 8, I do not find that any interference
         in the appellant's Article 8 rights would  be  disproportionate  in
         all the circumstances.


         25. I find that the appellant is able to live in a  home  owned  by
         her  mother.  She  has  access  to  university  education.  She  is
         financially supported by family members. I find that the  appellant
         has private life which  can  continue  in  Nepal.  The  appellant's
         mother has never been to the  United  Kingdom  and  has  chosen  to
         remain in Nepal when the sponsor came to  the  United  Kingdom  for
         settlement. I find that even if the appellant's mother  chooses  to
         go and live in  the  United  Kingdom  because  she  has  settlement
         rights, there is no reason why the appellant would not be  able  to
         continue living in her own home in Nepal. The sponsor gave evidence
         that his son Hari who presently lives in Hong Kong is  planning  to
         move back to Nepal. The sponsor said that he  intends  to  transfer
         the family home into the name of his son Hari in due course.  There
         is no evidence that the appellant would not  be  able  to  continue
         living in the same home and to have the  additional  moral  support
         from her brother.

  22. Judge Beg found that the appellant's mother  gave  her  a  "degree  of
      emotional support", although the judge did not  find  that  this  went
      beyond normal emotional ties to a relationship of "real committed  and
      effective support" (the  judge  wrongly  used  the  conjunctive  'and'
      rather than the disjunctive 'or'). The emotional  support  was  partly
      based on the appellant's self-consciousness with the  scars  from  her
      accident. This is clearly an element of a  relationship  not  commonly
      seen in those between adult children and their parents.  I  found  the
      evidence from the appellant's mother to be measured and  genuine.  She
      gave her evidence in an open and forthright manner and  there  was  no
      discernible attempt at any embellishment. Her evidence was  consistent
      with the documents before me and internally consistent  with  her  own
      evidence. I found the appellant's mother to be a credible witness. The
      fact that the appellant's mother  became  very  emotional  during  her
      evidence is also indicative of the existence  of  a  strong  emotional
      bond between her  and  the  appellant,  although  it  is  clearly  not
      determinative.

  23. Until her mother entered the UK in 2012  she  and  the  appellant  had
      always  lived  together.  The  mother's  evidence  that  she  and  the
      appellant went shopping  together,  would  eat  together  and  holiday
      together  was  not  challenged  and  is,  in  any  event,   inherently
      plausible. In light of my  evaluation  of  the  manner  in  which  the
      appellant's mother gave her evidence I accept that they have  a  close
      relationship. This is reinforced by  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
      mother waited nearly 2 years to enter the UK following  her  grant  of
      entry clearance so as to remain with her daughter.


  24. I have no reason to doubt the appellant's assertions in her  statement
      that she does feel lonely, desperate and sad, and that she cries a lot
      when she speaks to her parents, evidence that was corroborated at  the
      hearing. The appellant had always lived with  her  mother  and  it  is
      entirely plausible that she would have developed  a  strong  emotional
      relationship, particularly having undergone a  serious  and  traumatic
      motor vehicle accident in the past. I additionally note  that  it  was
      the  appellant's  mother  who  would  have  raised  her   whilst   the
      appellant's father was serving in the Gurkha Reserve  Unit  in  Brunei
      for nearly 10 years after being discharged from the British Army. This
      suggests that the appellant's mother was the principle parent for much
      of the appellant's formative years and is likely  to  have  reinforced
      the strength of the relationship between the appellant and her mother.


  25. The appellant's assertion that the bike accident still haunts her,
      although not supported by any mental health evidence, is inherently
      plausible given the seriousness of the accident. I am satisfied that
      the appellant's mother has provided a significant degree of emotional
      support to the appellant following a serious accident. Although there
      is no medical evidence that the bike accident has any continuing
      physical effect on the appellant I am satisfied that the accident
      reinforced the strong parent-child relationship between the appellant
      and her mother. I take into account that it has been over 15 years
      since the bike accident. The accident may nevertheless have
      established a stronger than normal relationship between the appellant
      and her mother. This is supported by reference to the unchallenged
      evidence of the high frequency that the appellant and her mother
      communicate, and the unchallenged evidence that the appellant's mother
      has returned to Nepal at least twice a year since entering the UK. It
      is also supported by the powerful emotion exhibited by the appellant's
      mother when talking about the impact on her of being separated. I find
      that the continued separation is having a significant detrimental
      impact on the appellant and her mother and I accept the mother's vivid
      description that her heart "is torn into pieces."

  26. The letter from Dillibazar Kanya Multiple Campus dated 26 August 2013
      indicates that the appellant was in the 3rd year of a three-year
      Bachelor's Degree and that she participated in several extra-
      curricular activities. The appellant's attendance at university and
      her involvement in extracurricular activities suggests that she has
      established a private life of her own. The more developed a person's
      private life is, the greater the probability that they are not
      dependent on a parent or parents. The evidence that the appellant has
      attended university until, at the very least, her 3rd year, and her
      involvement in extracurricular activities suggests that she has a
      relatively developed private life. There is however no further
      evidence of the nature and quality of the other private life
      relationships she has developed. I remind myself that the fact that a
      person may have a relatively developed private life does not exclude
      the concomitant existence of strong emotional dependency on close
      family members. I additionally note that the appellant's grandmother,
      who previously lived close by and from whom the appellant may have
      been able to obtain some degree of emotional support, died in
      June/July 2017. I also note the unchallenged evidence that the
      appellant's aged paternal uncle is not in a good state of health and
      that his family have their own priorities.


  27. Although Judge Beg found that the appellant was able to travel, study
      and work between 2004 and 2011, she did not find that the appellant
      had actually worked. Indeed, Judge beg found, at [25], that the
      appellant was financially supported by family members. Both the
      appellant's parents maintain that she has never worked and the
      appellant's financial dependency on her parents was not challenged by
      Mr Jarvis. This is further confirmed by a number of documents,
      including the letter from Dillibazar Kanya Multiple Campus dated 26
      August 2013, and the various consistent money remittal slips relating
      to funds sent by the appellant's parent to her. I therefore find that
      the appellant is financially dependent on her parents.

    28. I find that the appellant has persuaded me that, on the balance  of
        probabilities,  she  has  not  remained  single  in  an  effort  to
        demonstrate emotional dependence on her parents, but that  she  has
        not been approached by anyone with the designs of marriage and that
        she has simply not met anyone with whom she would wish to be  in  a
        relationship. The fact of being single does not of course render  a
        person emotionally dependent on a parent. But  being  single  is  a
        factor that I am entitled  to  take  into  account  as  tending  to
        support the appellant's claim that she  does  have  more  than  the
        normal bonds of  love  and  affection  between  an  adult  and  her
        parents.


    29. Having carefully  considered  the  decision  of  Judge  Beg  as  my
        starting point, and having cumulative regard to the above findings,
        I am satisfied, for the reasons given above, that the appellant  is
        being provided with real or committed or effective support  by  her
        mother and that this relationship does contain  elements  elevating
        it beyond the normal emotional  ties  between  adult  children  and
        their parents. I consequently find there is family life between the
        appellant and her mother within the terms of article 8(1) ECHR.


    30. Having found that there is family life, and in  light  Mr  Jarvis's
        concession in respect of article  8(2),  I  find,  particularly  in
        light  of  the  historic  injustice,  that  the  refusal  of  entry
        clearance constitutes a disproportionate interference with  article
        8.
