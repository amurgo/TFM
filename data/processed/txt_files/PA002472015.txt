                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal against a  decision  that  was  decided  under  the  "Fast
Track" rules. The decision being appealed has been set aside by  the  First-
tier  Chamber  President  and  will  be  decided  again  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal.

Understandably, the parties have not responded to an invitation  to  explain
what would served by an oral hearing to determine the appeal  in  the  Upper
Tribunal.

In the circumstances I dismiss the appeal in the Upper  Tribunal  without  a
hearing.

|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 23 December 2015               |
