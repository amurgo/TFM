Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms E Lagunju
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria  who  applied  for  permanent
    residence on the basis of being a family member of an EEA national  and
    that he has resided in the United Kingdom with  that  EEA  national  in
    accordance with the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    for a continuous period of five years.   His  application  was  refused
    because it was said that he had not  provided  evidence  that  the  EEA
    national resided in the UK in accordance with those Regulations  during
    that five year period.

 2. The Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  noted  that  the  appellant  provided
    evidence of his residence and employment in the United Kingdom  and  of
    his divorce from his wife Ms A Fragkaki, a  Greek  national.   However,
    the appellant provided no acceptable evidence of how  the  sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights in the UK from April 2008 to  April  2010  and
    this was the reason for the refusal.

 3. It was the appellant's  case  before  the  First-tier  Judge  that  his
    estranged EEA spouse had been exercising treaty rights by way of  self-
    employment  for  which  she  submitted   yearly   self-assessment   tax
    calculations  and  paid  self-employed  class  2   national   insurance
    contributions as and when due.

 4. A family member of an EEA national who is not himself an  EEA  national
    but who has resided in the United Kingdom  with  the  EEA  national  in
    accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period of  five  years
    acquires a right to reside permanently in the UK (Regulation 15(1)(b)).
     What was argued then and was put in submissions at the hearing  before
    me was that the respondent failed to take into consideration that  even
    if the appellant's application was refused under Regulation 15(1)(b) he
    ought to have succeeded under Regulation  10(5)(b)  because  there  was
    compelling evidence that the marriage subsisted for  five  years,  that
    the parties lived in the UK for the duration of five  years  and  there
    was evidence that the EEA national exercised treaty rights  by  way  of
    self-employment up until the date of termination of the marriage.

 5. The submission was that the appellant did not need to  prove  that  his
    former spouse was exercising treaty rights for a continuous  period  of
    five years in  order  to  establish  that  he  retained  the  right  of
    residence under Regulation 10. A perusal of Regulation 10(5)  indicates
    that the focus is on whether the wife retained the status of worker  at
    the time of the  divorce  and  not  on  whether  she  had  that  status
    throughout the years preceding the divorce. Following the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge to dismiss the appeal the grounds seeking
    permission quoted passages from the cases of Amos [2011] EWCA  Civ  552
    and Samsam (EEA: Revocation and  Retained  Rights)  Syria  [2011]  UKUT
    00165 (IAC). It is argued that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  focussed
    on whether the appellant was able to prove that  his  former  wife  had
    worked for a continuous period of five years before the application for
    the right of permanent residence was made.  He did not investigate  and
    did not make the necessary findings of fact as to whether the appellant
    satisfied the requirements of Regulation 10.

My considerations.

 6. In the determination the judge sets out the background facts  and  also
    recites Regulations 10 and 15 in their  entirety,  so  he  was  clearly
    aware that  those  Regulations  were  applicable  to  the  appeal.   At
    paragraphs 9 and 10 the judge appears to make a  finding  that  by  the
    time the application was made in 2012, and presuming that the appellant
    and his wife entered the UK in October 2006, the appellant  would  have
    been in the UK for some six years. On that basis the marriage lasted at
    least three years and the appellant and his former spouse would seem to
    have resided together in the UK for one year prior to  the  divorce  in
    April 2012.  The judge  then  went  on  to  say  that  nonetheless  the
    appellant still needs to show for permanent residence on the  basis  of
    his five years' residence that  his  ex-wife  was  a  qualified  person
    during that period, i.e. that she was  working  and  exercising  treaty
    rights.

 7. Whereas I agree with Ms Lagunju that that is the  wrong  test  to  find
    that the appellant  did  or  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Regulations and I would have found that there is a  material  error  of
    law in  the  determination,  in  the  particular  circumstances,  as  I
    announced at the hearing, the judge has not erred materially. The judge
    found, as described in paragraph 51, that because of substantial  flaws
    in the evidence of claimed employment of the EEA sponsor since 2006 the
    whole edifice purporting to establish the exercise of treaty rights  is
    a contrivance and fiction erected by the  appellant  himself  with  the
    help of equally dishonest third parties.

 8. The point about that finding is that the judge set out many reasons  as
    to why he did not accept the evidence provided by the appellant to show
    that his wife was a qualified person for the purpose of the Regulations
    for the five year period prior to the application being made  but  that
    reasoning also disclosed, read overall, that the judge did  not  accept
    that the appellant's wife was a qualified person at  the  date  of  the
    divorce in 2012. The entirety of the evidence purporting to  prove  the
    exercise of treaty rights was as applicable to  the  situation  at  the
    time of the divorce as to the earlier years,  and  the  judge  did  not
    accept it as true.

 9. Because the judge was entitled to conclude as he did  for  the  reasons
    given there was no good evidence before him that  the  appellant  could
    prove that he retained the right of residence under  Regulation  10(5).
    The judge found that a national insurance notification claim  dated  31
    March 2012 (therefore  close  to  the  date  of  the  decree  absolute)
    addressed to the appellant's wife at 50 Commercial Way for due  payment
    of ï¿½65 which bore a Post Office stamp showing payment in Lewisham on 11
    July 2012 did not provide good evidence that the appellant's  wife  was
    working at the relevant time.  Why he came to that finding is explained
    by paragraphs 40 onwards of the  determination.  The  judge  refers  at
    paragraph 44 to -

         "obscurity and confusion (of the appellant's evidence)  is  typical
         of the evasive and conflicting, even incoherent,  evidence  on  the
         circumstances surrounding  the  submission  of  the  2009-2010  tax
         return, which contradicts the evidence of the accountants that this
         was merely to be explained on the basis of a 'delay'."

10. In paragraph 47 the judge found that it was open to any third party  to
    submit online tax returns in the appellant's wife's  name  without  her
    having actual knowledge that this was the case, and indeed it was  open
    to such third party to pay such tax as was due. Also  at  paragraph  48
    there  is  reference  to  the  appellant  himself  paying  minimal  tax
    liability as was due from the EEA National on two occasions and also to
    the minimal national insurance payments that were made.

11. Although the judge focussed on paragraph 15 of the Regulations only and
    not, additionally, Regulation 10 his conclusions for the reasons  given
    show inevitably that the appellant failed to prove on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that he can meet the requirements of the Regulations. Any
    error therefore on the part of the judge was not material on the  facts
    as found as the appeal would inevitably have failed in any event.

12. For these reasons the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge stands.

13. I note that there was an Article 8 claim made in the  original  grounds
    of appeal.  The judge deals very briefly with this in paragraph  51  of
    the determination.  No issue was  taken  with  that  finding  that  any
    private life dimensions arising from the appellant's presence in the UK
    since 2006 cannot be engaged and therefore that  matter  has  not  been
    taken further.

14. No anonymity direction was made given  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant has based his application upon a fiction and I  see  no  good
    reason for an anonymity direction to be made now.
