For the Appellant:     Ms J McKinlay, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge R
    L Walker, promulgated on 21 July 2017, dismissing  his  appeal  on  all
    available grounds.

 2. The grounds of appeal to the UT may be summarised thus:

      (1) Misdirection in law, in terms of PJ (Sri Lanka) v  SSHD  [2015]  1
      WLR 1322.   Failure  to  engage  with  the  fact  that  the  appellant
      submitted the original of his father's Al-Fursan membership card,  and
      to assess whether  the  respondent  had  a  duty  to  investigate  the
      authenticity of that document.

      (2)  Failure to engage with the  appellant's  evidence.   (i)  It  was
      incorrect to say that his  evidence  was  that  his  siblings  had  no
      problems: it was that one brother was a refugee in Germany, one sister
      was in a refugee camp in Iraq, and the whereabouts  of  the  rest  was
      unknown.  (ii) The appellant said he worked while in Baghdad  only  in
      2004 - 2006, not in 2014, as the judge appeared to think.  (iii)   The
      judge said the appellant acknowledged he had no problems  in  Baghdad,
      but he had given evidence of an incident  at  a  checkpoint  in  2005.
      (iv)  The judge found that  the  evidence  did  not  explain  why  the
      appellant is an Arabic speaker, but his statement at  �40  included  a
      detailed explanation.  (v)  The appellant's explained in his statement
      the apparent discrepancy over his father  dying  2  years  before  Al-
      Fursan came  into  existence  -  the  respondent  and  the  background
      evidence mistook  two  organisations.   The  judge  at  �37  said  the
      appellant had not answered the point, when he had.

      (3) Failure to have due regard to the expert opinion of Dr Fatah.  The
      judge at �31 said the expert should know if the appellant spoke with a
      Moslawi accent, but that would be  relevant  when  the  appellant  was
      speaking Arabic, not a Kurdish language, and the report specified only
      that they spoke in Kurdish.

      (4) Failure to consider objective evidence  of  abuses  against  Sunni
      Muslims in Baghdad.

      (5) Failure to consider criteria and guidance in AA (in the UT and  in
      the Court of Appeal).

 3. Having heard submissions, I  indicated  my  view  of  the  grounds,  as
    follows.

 4. There is nothing in ground (1).  When the  document  was  sent  to  the
    respondent, it was not accompanied by any argument that the  respondent
    had a duty to authenticate it.  That point was developed  only  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the UT, far too late.

 5. While I do not seek to pre-empt future debate, it was  not  shown  that
    this  case  might  fall  within  the  category  where  the  respondent,
    exceptionally, has a duty to authenticate a document.  (I  also  record
    Mr  McVeety's  submission  that  in  any  event  the  opinion  of   the
    appellant's expert was that if the appellant's father was a  member  of
    Al-Fursan, that was not a matter which placed the appellant at risk.)

 6. There is nothing in grounds (4) and (5) either.  These are  generalised
    disagreements coupled with vague reference to background  evidence  and
    country guidance.  They do not show that the evidence required the  FtT
    to go beyond guidance, or that he established  any  case  which  should
    have succeeded within the guidance.

 7. The  judge  appears  to  have  largely  overlooked  that  part  of  the
    appellant's statement where  he  responds  to  points  in  the  refusal
    letter.  Ms McKinlay in submissions identified another slip.  The judge
    said at �31 that the expert did not have before him "the most important
    document which is the appellant's witness  statement  for  this  appeal
    hearing".  However, the statement is listed in  the  report  among  the
    documents which solicitors placed before the  expert.   I  was  advised
    that it was then in substantially the same terms as the  final  version
    adopted at the hearing.

 8. The evidence from the appellant was  undoubtedly  confusing  about  the
    extent of his command of Kurdish Bardini.  However, the  judge  appears
    to have misled himself into finding it adverse that the appellant has a
    good command of Arabic.  That was the general language of education and
    public life.  There is nothing in the evidence to make it unlikely that
    he would be fluent in Arabic.

 9. The judge went wrong about whether the appellant said his siblings  had
    experienced any difficulties.

10. The points at ground (2)  (ii)  and  (iii)  I  find  of  minor  if  any
    significance. However, the rest of grounds (2) and  (3),  as  submitted
    upon by Ms McKinlay, show error such that the  decision  cannot  safely
    stand as a resolution of the case.

11. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

12. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

13. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge R L Walker.

14. The FtT made an anonymity direction, although no reason is stated.  The
    matter was not addressed in the UT,  so  anonymity  has  been  retained
    herein.
