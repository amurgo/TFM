Representation:

For the appellant:           Miss R Chapman (counsel instructed by Fuad
Osman)
For the respondent:          Mr P Deller

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by someone who claims to be a Tunni citizen of Somalia
   against a decision of an adjudicator, Mr K Robb, sitting  at  Birmingham
   on 15 September 2003 dismissing her appeal  on  both  asylum  and  human
   rights grounds. The adjudicator did not accept her origins  or  personal
   history, for detailed reasons which he gave.   He also  took  the  view,
   when it came to the question of risk on return, that the appellant would
   have available the protection of her husband, who was with her  in  this
   country.


2. It is agreed that this particular finding was  wrong.   The  appellant's
   husband is not and has never had been with her here.  It  is  not  clear
   where the adjudicator came by the finding which he made on  this  point.
   Miss Chapman suggested that it might have come  from  the  other  Somali
   case, which she told us was before him in the  same  list.    Given  the
   adjudicator's very careful findings on the other features of  the  case,
   we are more than prepared to assume in his  favour  that  this  was  so.
   Inevitably the way in which cases requiring  the  same  interpreter  are
   booked together  places  serious  demands  on  adjudicators'  powers  of
   distinction between cases from the same country. This was very  much  an
   isolated lapse by this adjudicator who, whatever view may  be  taken  on
   the merits of his decision, did in  general  do  an  extremely  thorough
   piece of work on this case.

3. It follows that, on that particular point,  dealing  with  the  risk  on
   return for someone who now turns out to be a lone woman, the  case  will
   need further consideration, on the basis of whatever turn out to be  the
   relevant individual features of the appellant's  case:  as  we  are  not
   equipped to take oral evidence without an undesirable adjournment,  this
   will have to be done  by  an  adjudicator.  Whether  that  is  the  same
   adjudicator or another one will depend on the view we take of Mr  Robb's
   credibility findings, to which we now turn: they are subject to a number
   of clear challenges in the grounds of appeal, and so we shall deal  with
   them in that order.

4. Ground 3.1 challenges the adjudicator's decision that the appellant  was
   not a Tunni/Bravanese on the basis of his findings  about  the  language
   spoken in her family. The first challenge is based on a letter  from  Dr
   Virgina Luling, which in turn is based on somebody she describes  as  "a
   respected Bravanese MS Banafunzi of the Somali  Bravanese  community  in
   Redbridge".    This gentleman has apparently been responsible for a  set
   of guidelines produced for the borough of that name; but we know no more
   about him than that.   The evidence of Mr Banafunzi was  that  "Bravans,
   especially those who lived outside Bravanese community are  most  likely
   to speak the language spoken in the places  where  they  were  born  and
   lived".

5. So far as that is concerned,  the  view  taken  by  the  adjudicator  at
   paragraph 18 was not based on what might be described  as  the  inherent
   improbability of a Bravanese not speaking Bravanese (which  is  a  Bantu
   language, common to them and the Tunni, although  they  claim  different
   origins). The adjudicator's findings at paragraph 13 are based  on  what
   the appellant said about the use of the Bravanese language  in  her  own
   family.    So far as those findings are concerned, our view is that  the
   adjudicator was entitled to them.   We do not think that Mr  Banafunzi's
   evidence, as relayed by Dr Luling necessarily casts any doubt  on  them.



6. The other element of this point concerns the evidence of the appellant's
   two supporting witnesses before the  adjudicator,  Messrs  Mohammed  and
   Idow.  These were gentlemen who had both been given asylum by  the  Home
   Office: in the case of Mr Mohammed, we have before us the material which
   the Home Office had  in  his  case,  and  this  indicates  that  he  was
   specifically claiming to have been persecuted as a Bravanese.   There is
   no such material in the case of Idow; but his  witness  statement  shows
   that this was at least what he said he had been saying.

7. The challenge to the adjudicator's decision about them relates partly to
   the language point, and partly to the  general  attitude  taken  by  the
   adjudicator (at paragraph  34)  to  their  evidence.    So  far  as  the
   language point is concerned the importance of their  evidence  was  that
   they said that  they  themselves,  although  Bravanese/Tunni,  spoke  no
   Bravanese.    As Mr Deller pointed out, ignorance of anything is an easy
   claim to make, and hard to disprove; and the adjudicator was careful  to
   say that this had been their evidence.   He did not himself however take
   any specific point about the ease of  claiming  ignorance;  but  he  did
   quite clearly take  into  account  this  particular  point  about  their
   inability to speak Bravanese, in Mr Mohammed's case at paragraph  11  in
   noting Miss Chapman's submissions. The adjudicator  did  not  make  this
   clear on Mr Idow's individual case; but it is clear that he did have the
   general point in mind when dealing with this  aspect  of  the  evidence.
   Again, we think that is all that was required of him.

8. Coming to point  3.2  this  challenges  the  adjudicator's  findings  at
   paragraph 14,   the way he sums those up in the last sentence is:

    The impression I receive from her evidence and placed as evidence before
   me was that she was determined to paint  a  particular  picture  of  her
   background no matter what actual questions were put to her.


   This refers to particular information volunteered by the appellant about
   her  parents'  occupations[1],  which  to   the   adjudicator   appeared
   suspiciously  to  correspond  with  the  list  of   traditional   Bravan
   occupations given in the Minority Groups Report[2] at  paragraph  7.3.2.
    The report, dealing comprehensively with Benadiri, Bravanese and Tunni,
   gives the elders as mentioning "business, fishery, construction,  mental
   work,  carpentry,  tailoring,   weaving   and   goldsmithing"   as   the
   occupational factors of Benadiri.  It is also said that  "The  Bravanese
   and Tunni elders said their people were also  commercially  oriented  or
   working as craftsman".


9. In our view there may well be cases  where  adjudicators  are  perfectly
   justified in inferring that knowledge  of  background  material  in  the
   public domain will have found its way to an individual appellant, and in
   regarding as potentially suspicious correspondence between her  evidence
   and what is in the background material.   We do not think  however  that
   this is one of those cases.   The only piece of evidence referred to  by
   the adjudicator at paragraph 14 which might be described as going beyond
   a natural anxiety to try and give as many details as possible of a  case
   which might be genuine is where he notes that

   She did not just say that her father owned a clothes shop but added that
   he is in commerce.


10. What word in Somali was represented by 'commerce' we do  not  know,  and
   we do not think it matters.    The importance of that  comment  is  that
   the appellant felt obliged to go on beyond her father's ownership  of  a
   clothes shop, which has always been part of her case from  the  time  of
   her first application onwards, to add that he  was  in  commerce,  which
   would surely have been obvious to anyone.   We do not  think  that  this
   one point justified the adjudicator in  making  an  adverse  credibility
   decision on this ground.

11. There was not in  our  view  any  striking  correspondence  between  the
   occupations the appellant claimed for her parents, and the list  in  the
   Minority Groups Report. The point identified at � 10  above  was  simply
   what appeared to the adjudicator as a suspicious refinement on something
   which has been the appellant's case all along, and which  there  was  no
   specific reason to disbelieve.   So on that point the grounds of  appeal
   must succeed.    This is not  of  course  crucial,  because  it  is  the
   adjudicator's  credibility  decision  as  a  whole  with  which  we  are
   concerned, and we have to take a global view of it.

12. Going on to point 3.3, that turns  on  the  adjudicator's  view  of  the
   occupational history of the appellant's  supporting  witness,  Mr  Idow.
   While it may be that the adjudicator could have taken a more sympathetic
   attitude to the relatively small variations in that evidence, we do  not
   think it could be said either - if that is the test at this stage - that
   it was a mistake of law[3] for him to take the attitude  he  did;  or  -
   which had always been the test before the coming into force of the  2002
   Act - he was clearly wrong in that approach to Mr Idow's  oral  evidence
   in conjunction with that of the appellant.    So  that  point  does  not
   succeed.

13. The next one is a point of a  more  general  nature  at  paragraph  3.4,
   which however turns on a specific  point  made  by  the  adjudicator  in
   dealing with the evidence of Mr Mohammed.  Having noted  at  �  18  that
   there was no direct evidence on how Mr Mohammed had put his claim to the
   Home Office, the adjudicator went on


   It is not open for me to evaluate his claim but on the limited evidence
 about him I could not do so anyway.   However, I am not persuaded that I am
  bound to accept his evidence as credible and in consequence find what he
                  says about the appellant to be accurate.

14. The adjudicator went on (at � 19)

   As indicated I am not satisfied as to  the  appellant's  credibility  as
   regards her explanation for her inability to speak Bravanese if  she  is
   of this clan and has her claimed background.     I am not  satisfied  as
   to her knowledge of her Witness Mr Idow.  Mr Mohammed's evidence was not
   successfully challenged by  cross-examination,  the  appellant  was  not
   shown to lack knowledge of him.   However on the face  of  the  material
   failure in the body of her own evidence, I am not persuaded  that  these
   positive elements cure the defects.

   The adjudicator then took a generally negative view on  the  appellant's
   credibility  at paragraph 20.


15. Miss Chapman's submission on this  point  is  essentially  that,  if  Mr
   Mohammed's  evidence  could  not  be  disproved  to  the   adjudicator's
   satisfaction, then he was bound to accept it as true.  We cannot  accept
   that as a general point.  In a criminal case a jury  might  have  to  be
   directed that, unless they were sure Mr Mohammed  was  not  telling  the
   truth, they must take his account of events as established.  In  a  case
   such as this,  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the  appellant,  and  the
   adjudicator was well entitled as  he  did  to  weigh  all  the  evidence
   together, and to come  to  the  view  that  he  could  not  believe  the
   appellant's case, taken as a whole.  That is the general position.

16. We have however to go back to what the adjudicator said at paragraph  14
   about  the appellant giving what seemed to  him  suspiciously  too  much
   detail about her parents' occupations.   While we take the view,  as  we
   have said, that points of this kind might be sometimes be justified,  we
   have come to the conclusion that this one was not.  If it had  been  the
   only point in the adjudicator's credibility findings which ought not  to
   have been taken against the appellant, or which went in her favour, then
   his decision on credibility could have been upheld. However, taking  the
   adjudicator's findings at paragraph 14 together with those  he  made  in
   Mohammed's favour, as he very fairly and clearly accepted at  paragraphs
   18 and 19, we have come to the conclusion that, whatever  is  the  right
   approach to factual points of this kind (see � 12 above),  his  decision
   cannot be upheld.

17. It follows that there will have to be a fresh hearing of the whole  case
   before another adjudicator.  We should however say that we do not  think
   Mr Robb ought in any way to be discouraged by this decision.   He  dealt
   with the case very clearly and in  a  great  deal  of  detail,  and  was
   evidently not particularly helped by what may politely be  described  as
   the lack of energy of the presenting officer before him.   We have  been
   in a more fortunate position, and have heard the whole case fully argued
   on both sides. However we have decided that the appeal must be  allowed,
   and the case remitted, not to Mr Robb.

                                                                       [pic]
