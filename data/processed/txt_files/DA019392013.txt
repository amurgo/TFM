                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant, as he was before the  judge  and  I
    will continue to refer to him as the appellant, against  the  Secretary
    of State's decision of 26 June 2013 to make a deportation order against
    him on the grounds that  his  personal  conduct  represents  a  genuine
    present and sufficiently serious threat  to  the  interests  of  public
    policy and is accordingly justified under  Regulation  21  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

2.   I do not think it is necessary for me to set out all the evidence  that
    was before the judge. In summary there was a history of offending.  The
    appellant arrived in the United Kingdom from Portugal at the age of  13
    in 1996 and some five years later the first  offence  referred  to  was
    committed.  This culminated in a sentence of  six  years'  imprisonment
    after a conviction of two counts of possessing a  prohibited  fire  arm
    and one count of possession a fire arm without a  certificate  and  the
    sentencing date  was  13  October  2011  and  the  judge  set  out  the
    sentencing remarks  from  the  sentencing  judge,  set  out  the  legal
    framework, the reasons why the respondent decided a  deportation  order
    was appropriate and the points made on behalf of the appellant and then
    also the written and oral evidence of the appellant and of his  partner
    and his sisters who also gave evidence.

3.   The judge set out the relevant provisions of the  Regulations  and  the
    relevant legal tests, noted that the OASys Report found that he posed a
    medium risk of offending and that the  harm  to  the  public  would  be
    serious and then at paragraph 28 he turned to consider  proportionality
    having found at paragraph 27 that the appellant was entitled to no more
    than the minimum level of protection, namely that his  deportation  had
    to be justified on grounds of public policy and there is  no  challenge
    to that finding which arose as a consequence of an  assessment  of  the
    evidence in the context of the tests set out in cases such  as  MG  and
    Tsakouridis.

4.   The judge then set out the terms and the  effect  of  Regulation  21(6)
    and  the  matters   to   be   taken   into   account   in   considering
    proportionality,  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and   economic
    situation,  length  of  residence  in  the  UK,  social  and   cultural
    integration to the UK and the extent  of  links  with  the  country  of
    origin, and those factors were all considered.  In passing referring in
    relation to his relationship with his partner he noted that as she  had
    not been aware until it was put to her in cross-examination that he had
    served a period of imprisonment during  the  relationship  for  a  drug
    offence of eight months, this did not inspire confidence and the  level
    of influence she was likely to have on him in enabling  him  to  reduce
    the risk he posed to society.

5.   The judge then went on at paragraph 28(e) to say that

         "The sincerity and commitment of his family members and his partner
         to his rehabilitation persuade me that the appellant stands  better
         prospects of rehabilitation in the United Kingdom than he would  in
         Portugal.  Their support has been consistent over  the  years.  The
         likelihood of the appellant drifting back  into  a  life  of  crime
         would be much greater in Portugal than it would be  in  the  United
         Kingdom where he would have the  support  of  his  family  and  his
         partner."

6.   The judge then went on to say at paragraph 29:

         "I recognise the compelling public interest  in  considerations  in
         this case namely, the protection  of members  of  the  public  from
         harm in the light of the level of risk that  the  appellant  poses,
         and the lower level of protection to which he is entitled.

         In my view in the assessment of  proportionality  the  factor  that
         tips the balance in the appellant's favour is the  shared  interest
         that the EEA countries have in helping an  individual  to  progress
         towards a better form of life."

7.   The Secretary of State sought and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal
    against  the  decision  on  the  basis  that  there  was  an   arguable
    misdirection in terms of proportionality and referring to decisions  of
    the Upper Tribunal in Essa and Vasconcelos and these are  matters  that
    understandably since they are the basis on which permission was granted
    Ms Isherwood relies on today and Mr Plowright on the other hand  argues
    that the judge  assessed  the  evidence  properly  and  considered  the
    relevant matters to be taken into account in proportionality  and  this
    was one of the factors considered which  was  treated  as  tipping  the
    balance as one factor among others and that it was right to do so.

8.   This has to be seen in the context of what was said  in  particular  by
    the Upper Tribunal in Essa and in particular quoting from paragraph  26
    in relation to levels of protection and integration.

         "We agree that the court's reference to genuine integration must be
         directed at qualified persons and their  family  members  who  have
         resided in the host state as such for five years or  more.   People
         who have just arrived in  the  host  state,  have  not  yet  become
         qualified persons or have not been  a  qualified  person  for  five
         years can always be  removed  for  non-exercise  of  free  movement
         rights irrespective of public good grounds to curtail free movement
         rights.  If their presence during this time makes  them  a  present
         threat to public policy it would be inconsistent with the  purposes
         of the Directive to weigh in the balance against deportation  their
         future prospects of rehabilitation."

9.   And then the Tribunal went on to say at paragraph 27:

         "If they achieve rehabilitation on return to their state of  origin
         with whom they have not yet lost links then they can  always  apply
         to revoke the deportation order that would otherwise  prevent  them
         exercising free movement rights in the host state in the future."

10.  So there is this clear statement  which  was  endorsed  subsequently  I
    think in Vasconcelos and one can clearly see the logic behind this.  If
    a person is not integrated in the sense that they are a person who only
    has the minimum level of protection then there is  no  good  reason  in
    effect for them not to return to their country of origin if they are  a
    present threat to public policy because they are not integrated in  the
    host state.  The logic of that I think  is  compelling.   And  this  is
    really the only factor I think that the judge found to be  particularly
    in the appellant's favour in this case.

11.  It was as he said at paragraph 29, the factor that tips the balance  in
    the appellant's favour and although Mr Plowright is right to  say  that
    it is one of the factors considered, it was the factor  that  made  the
    difference in this case and it was a factor that as a matter of law  it
    was wrong for the judge to regard as dispositive in light of  Essa  and
    Vasconcelos.  It was wrong to treat the issue of  rehabilitation  as  a
    relevant one in the case of a person who was entitled to no  more  than
    the minimum level of protection and where he posed a  medium  level  of
    risk of reoffending the harm to the public would be serious  and  these
    are matters dealt with further in some detail at paragraph 27,  setting
    out the concerns that the judge had about the risk of reoffending.

12.  So for these reasons I consider the judge did materially err in law  in
    this case and as a consequence the decision will have to  be  remade  I
    invite the parties' representations as to how we should best proceed on
    this.

13.  In his submissions Mr Plowright  noted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's determination which had just been set aside covered the factual
    issues.  A relevant factor in contrast to the position in  Essa  [2013]
    UKUT 00316 (IAC), and Vasconcelos [2013] UKUT 00378 (IAC) was that  the
    appellant had been living in the United Kingdom since the age of 13 and
    was now 31.  He had therefore spent most  of  his  adult  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  It was appreciated that some of  that  time  had  been
    spent in prison  and so for EU purposes it did not count,  but  he  had
    been here for a long time.  The judge had found that  he  had  no  more
    connections with Portugal and he was in fact originally from Mozambique
    and had been in Portugal  for  eight  years  after  moving  there  from
    Mozambique and all of his family were in the  United  Kingdom  and  his
    partner was British.  So his connections with the United  Kingdom  were
    strong, albeit he did not have a permanent right of residence.  It  was
    relevant that he had a network  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  take
    account of the impact on them if he were deported to Portugal.

14.  The Tribunal was entitled to  take  into  account  the  extent  of  his
    integration into United Kingdom  society.  Prison  was  another  factor
    relevant to proportionality but also it should be  noted  that  he  had
    been at school and college in the United Kingdom, had his  family  here
    and no family in Portugal and had only been back to Portugal once.   He
    had taken courses in prison and posed a medium risk of reoffending.  He
    had the support of his family and his girlfriend.  If  these  were  all
    not taken into account and weighed against  his  criminal  history  the
    balance just about favoured his remaining in the United Kingdom and  it
    being disproportionate to deport him to Portugal.

15.  In her submissions Ms Isherwood referred to the positive  and  negative
    factors identified in the  determination.    She  emphasised  that  the
    appellant did not meet the high level  of  protection  within  the  EEA
    Regulations, and his family had not been able to  stop  him  committing
    the index offence.  He had been clearly aware of what he was doing  and
    the wider  impact  of  guns  in  the  community  but  nevertheless  had
    committed  the offence. It had not been shown that  the  situation  was
    any different from what was said in the OASys Report about  him  having
    committed the offence also because he needed the money.

16.  By way of reply Mr  Plowright made the point  that  the  appellant  had
    been in custody until about four weeks ago, so given the time factor it
    was difficult to say much on the last point, though time would tell and
    he had the family support referred to despite his  past  and  that  had
    been referred to  by  the  sentencing  judge.   Although  much  of  the
    skeleton argument before the First-tier Judge  was  now  academic,  the
    factual history was set out there at paragraph 5 onwards.

17.  I reserved my determination.

18.  I have referred above in the error of law decision to  the  essence  of
    the appellant's immigration history and to the period  over  which  his
    offences  culminating  in  the  sentencing  on  16  December  2008   of
    committing an act or series of acts with intent to pervert  the  course
    of  justice,  possession  of  a  Class  C  controlled  (cannabis),   an
    aggravated vehicle, taking and causing damage to property other than  a
    vehicle under �5,000, a conviction on 27 March 2009 of taking  a  motor
    vehicle  without  consent  and  using  a  vehicle  while  uninsured,  a
    conviction on 6 April 2009 of driving whilst disqualified and driving a
    motor vehicle without consent and a conviction on 5  February  2010  of
    possession of a controlled Class A drug (heroin).

19.  As Mr Plowright said, the  judge's  determination  largely  covers  the
    factual issues.  There is no issue as to entitlement to any  more  than
    the minimum level of protection and therefore his deportation has to be
    justified on grounds of public policy.  I endorse the  judge's  finding
    at paragraph 27  that  the  evidence  demonstrates  that  his  personal
    conduct poses a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the
    interests of public policy.  This is because first,  the  OASys  Report
    found that he posed a medium risk of offending and harm to  the  public
    would be serious, yet over the last twelve months he  had  displayed  a
    level of aggression towards members of staff in  prison  ad  there  was
    little evidence that he had  developed  thinking  skills  necessary  to
    reduce the level of risk he posed to members of the public, that he had
    had the benefit of a written warning informing him  that  he  would  be
    shown leniency if he continued to  reoffend,  and  did  not  heed  this
    warning and his criminal history demonstrate an escalating  pattern  of
    reoffending which in itself points to a  propensity  to  reoffend,  and
    that there was a financial motive to the index offence and the evidence
    suggests that his previous convictions were not wholly unrelated to his
    financial needs, he has little in the way of work  experience  and  has
    not shown  a  genuine  commitment  and  capacity  to  become  gainfully
    employed.  His financial needs in the future and his capacity  to  meet
    them through lawful means are a significant  factor  in  assessing  the
    likelihood that he would reoffend.

20.  Like the judge, I note the factors set out at Regulation  21(6),  which
    require the decision maker to take  into  account  the  age,  state  of
    health, family and economic situation, length of residence in  the  UK,
    social and cultural integration into the UK and  the  extent  of  links
    with the  country of origin of the person to be removed.  The period of
    residence  is  relevant  to  the  proportionality  of  expulsion.   The
    appellant has now lived in the United Kingdom for some eighteen  years,
    having arrived at the age of 13 and has therefore spent  a  significant
    part of his formative years in the United Kingdom.  He  has  no  family
    ties in Portugal and has only visited that country once since  he  came
    to the United Kingdom.  He retains cultural ties with Portugal.  He  is
    fluent in Portuguese and  the  evidence  is  that  he  communicates  in
    Portuguese with his mother.  He is a young man in good health and would
    not be destitute if  removed  to  Portugal.   Although  he  has  family
    support and the support of  his partner, that support appears  to  have
    had no influence on him because he has continued to  reoffend,  and  in
    relation to his partner, she was unaware of the fact that he had served
    a period of imprisonment during their relationship for a drug  offence,
    of eight months.

21.  As I have concluded above in the error of law decision, in the case  of
    a person such as the appellant who is not a qualified person, who is  a
    present threat to public policy, it is inconsistent with  the  purposes
    of the Directive to weigh in the balance against deportation the future
    prospects of rehabilitation.

22.  Taking all  these  matters  together,  it  is  clear  to  me  that  the
    proportionality balance falls very firmly on the  side  of  the  public
    interest in this case and  the  respondent's  decision  to  deport  the
    appellant is upheld and the  appeal  against  that  decision  is  as  a
    consequence dismissed.
