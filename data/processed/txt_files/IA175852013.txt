Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Husnu Dalgin, born on 20 July 1987 is a male citizen  of
    Turkey.  On 13 February 2013, the appellant was refused leave to remain
    as a spouse of a  British  citizen  (Gillian  Dalgin).   The  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Henderson)  which,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 25 October  2013,  dismissed  the  appeal.
    The appellant now appeals to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant came to the United Kingdom as a visitor and  subsequently
    attempted to obtain leave to remain under the Immigration Rules as  the
    spouse of Gillian  Dalgin.   The  parties  accept  that  (a)  that  the
    appellant was badly advised by  his  professional  representatives  and
    that he did not know that he would be unable  to  "switch"  immigration
    categories and; (b) the appellant cannot, as a consequence, succeed  in
    his application under the Immigration Rules.  The  appeal  fell  to  be
    decided under Article 8 ECHR only.

 3. Judge Macleman granted permission in the Upper Tribunal  on  the  basis
    that the appellant had argued that the "Home Office Presenting  Officer
    [HOPO] conceded at the hearing that adequate  maintenance  was  showing
    for the purposes of the Rules."  The Upper  Tribunal  had  subsequently
    received witness statements from Mr J Greer who  appeared  as  advocate
    before the First-tier Tribunal for the appellant and Mr Neil Fuller who
    was the Home Office Presenting Officer.  Mr Fuller was available at the
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal but it was not necessary for  him  to
    call evidence as Mrs Oliver, for the appellant, did not wish to  cross-
    examine him.  Mr Fuller, in his  statement,  claims  that  he  made  no
    concession about  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules, stating,  "given  the  sponsor's  income  in
    2012/2013 from salary it was approximately �302 per month there was  no
    possibility the couple could meet  the  maintenance  requirements."  Mr
    Greer, in his statement, does not suggest that  Mr  Fuller  openly  and
    unequivocally conceded that the appellant could  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules.  Rather, he records  that  Mr  Fuller,  when
    asked by the judge to comment on the adequacy of the sponsor's  income,
    offered no submissions.

 4. Refusing permission in the Upper Tribunal, Judge Zucker, accurately  in
    my view, commented that "the respondent had refused the application  on
    a particular basis that is not the same as [admitting] that  all  other
    requirements were met.  It is trite law that the judge had  to  satisfy
    himself that all requirements of the particular Rule were met."  I have
    to say that there is a qualitative difference  between  an  unequivocal
    concession made by a party in appeal proceedings  and  the  silence  of
    that party as regards any particular issue.  Given the  fact  that  the
    sponsor's income fell so far below  the  figure  provided  for  in  the
    Immigration Rules for maintenance, I  consider  that  it  is  virtually
    inconceivable that the Presenting Officer or any other  officer  acting
    on behalf of the Secretary of State would concede that the  requirement
    could be satisfied.  There is a further important point.  Even assuming
    that  Mr  Fuller  conceded  that  the  appellant  met  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, this appeal  still  fell  to  be
    considered under Article 8 ECHR.  In applying the  law  in  respect  of
    Article 8 (including the decision  in  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900)  it  was
    imperative for the judge to have regard to all the  relevant  facts  in
    the case including the actual income of the sponsor.  I do  not  accept
    that the judge has erred in law by having regard to the income  of  the
    sponsor and the appellant when deciding  the  appeal  under  Article  8
    ECHR.

 5. Judge Henderson adopted a structured approach to analysis of Article 8.
     She acknowledged that the appellant had been "badly advised" but  went
    on to record that "this does not mean the respondent is at fault in the
    consideration of the  appellant's  application  under  the  Immigration
    Rules or that this should mean that the appellant  can  circumvent  the
    Immigration Rules by relying on Article 8  of  the  ECHR."   [29].   At
    [31], Judge Henderson  states  that  "the  sponsor  is  in  receipt  of
    benefits."  As I understand it,  the  sponsor  is  in  receipt  of  tax
    credits.  It was not disputed that the sponsor's income falls below not
    only the sum of �18,600 provided for in the Immigration Rules but  also
    the sum of �13,400  (the  income  level  identified  by  the  Migration
    Advisory Committee  of  the  lowest  maintenance  threshold  under  the
    benefits and net physical approach, identified by Blake J in  MM).   At
    [31], Judge Henderson quoted Blake J's judgment at [123- 124]:

    Although there may be sound reasons in favour of some of the individual
    requirements taken in isolation, I conclude that when applied to either
    recognised refugees or British citizens the combination  of  more  than
    one of the following five features of the rules to  be  so  onerous  in
    effect as to be an unjustified and disproportionate interference with a
    genuine spousal relationship. In particular that it likely  to  be  the
    case where the minimum income requirement is combined with one or  more
    than one of the other requirements discussed  below.  The  consequences
    are so excessive in impact as to be beyond a reasonable means of giving
    effect to the legitimate aim.

    The five features are:

    i.   The setting of the minimum income level  to  be  provided  by  the
    sponsor at above the �13,400 level identified by the Migration Advisory
    Committee as the lowest maintenance threshold under  the  benefits  and
    net fiscal approach (Conclusion 5.3). Such a level would  be  close  to
    the adult minimum wage for a 40 hour week. Further the  claimants  have
    shown through by their experts that of the 422  occupations  listed  in
    the 2011 UK Earnings Index, only 301 were above the  �18,600  threshold
    [16].

    ii.   The  requirement  of  �16,000  before  savings  can  be  said  to
    contribute to rectify an income shortfall.

    iii. The use of a 30 month period for  forward  income  projection,  as
    opposed to a twelve month period that could be applied in a  borderline
    case of ability to maintain.

    iv.   The  disregard  of  even  credible  and  reliable   evidence   of
    undertakings of third party support effected by deed and  supported  by
    evidence of ability to fund.

    v.   The disregard of the spouse's  own  earning  capacity  during  the
    thirty month period of initial entry.

 6. The judge went on at [32] to find that "the  sponsor  cannot  meet  the
    minimum income level outlined above at item (i) without the  assistance
    of public funds."  That statement may not be entirely accurate.  Public
    funds are defined in the Immigration Rules at paragraph 6C:

    "public funds" means




    (a) housing under Part VI or VII of the Housing Act 1996 and under Part
    II of the Housing Act 1985, Part I or II of the Housing (Scotland)  Act
    1987, Part II of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 or  Part  II
    of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1988;




    (b)  attendance  allowance,  severe  disablement   allowance,   carer's
    allowance and disability living allowance under Part III of the  Social
    Security Contribution and Benefits Act 1992;, income  support,  council
    tax benefit and housing benefit under Part VII of that  Act;  a  social
    fund payment under Part VIII of that Act; child benefit under  Part  IX
    of that Act; income based jobseeker's allowance  under  the  Jobseekers
    Act 1995, income related allowance under Part 1 of the  Welfare  Reform
    Act 2007 (employment and support allowance) state pension credit  under
    the State Pension Credit Act 2002; or child tax credit and working  tax
    credit under Part 1 of the Tax Credits Act 2002;




    (c)  attendance  allowance,  severe  disablement   allowance,   carer's
    allowance and disability living allowance under Part III of the  Social
    Security Contribution and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992;, income
    support, council tax benefit and, housing benefit  under  Part  VII  of
    that Act; a social fund payment under Part  VIII  of  that  Act;  child
    benefit under Part IX of that Act; income based  jobseeker's  allowance
    under the Jobseekers (Northern Ireland) Order 1995  or  income  related
    allowance under Part 1 of the Welfare  Reform  Act  (Northern  Ireland)
    2007;

 7. It is not clear from the evidence before either the First-tier or Upper
    Tribunal to what extent the amount of tax credits paid  to  Mrs  Dalgin
    may be influenced by the presence in her household  of  the  appellant.
    If his presence increases the tax credits, then  there  is  clearly  an
    infringement of the Rules as contemplated  in  paragraph  6A.   If  his
    presence has no effect,  then  it  is  arguable  that  the  appellant's
    continued presence would not lead to the couple living  in  the  United
    Kingdom by recourse to public funds.

 8. However, there is a further problem for the  appellant  in  seeking  to
    rely on MM.  As I have quoted above,  Blake  J  concluded  that,  "when
    applied  to  either  recognised  refugees  or  British   citizens   the
    combination of more than one of the  following  five  features  of  the
    Rules  [is]  so  onerous  in  effect  as  to  be  an  unjustified   and
    disproportionate interference with a genuine spousal  relationship."[my
    emphasis]  As Judge  Henderson  noted,  there  was  no  suggestion  the
    appellant has a realistic job offer (v) whilst the issue of third party
    support (iv) had not been raised.  There was also no  evidence  of  the
    sponsor having "anything near the required level of savings" (ii).  The
    requirement of (iii) did  not  arise  in  this  case.   Even  assuming,
    therefore, that feature (i) applied in the present appeal there was  no
    "combination of more than one" of the five features.

 9. In the circumstances, the dismissal of the appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds was clearly  an  outcome  available  to  Judge  Henderson.   In
    reaching  that  outcome,  she  properly   applied   the   jurisprudence
    (including  MM)  and  appears  to  have  had  a  proper  and   accurate
    understanding of the relevant factual matrix.  In the circumstances,  I
    am unable to identify any error of law in her reasoning such  that  the
    determination falls to be set aside.

DECISION

10. This appeal is dismissed.
