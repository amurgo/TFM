                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on  24  October  2019  of
    First-tier Tribunal Garratt  which  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    against a decision of the respondent dated 12 May  2019  which  revoked
    his EEA family permit.

 2. Mr Chatha is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 7 April 1995.

 3. The appellant was granted an EEA family permit valid  from  1  February
    2019 to 1 August 2019 recognising his status  as  the  extended  family
    member (EFM) of his brother, a Portuguese  national  exercising  Treaty
    rights in the UK. The appellant entered the UK  on  20  February  2019,
    relying on that permit. On 21 February 2019 he applied for a five  year
    residence permit recognising him as an EFM. Whilst that application was
    pending, the appellant left the UK on 11 April 2019. When the appellant
    returned on 9 May 2019, he was detained pending further  interview  but
    released on bail on 11 May 2019. In a decision dated 12 May  2019,  his
    six month family permit was revoked and  he  was  refused  entry.  This
    decision appears to have been  served  on  him  on  13  May  2019.  The
    appellant appeared the revocation and also made a  further  application
    for a five year residence permit. That application was  refused  on  27
    June 2019.

 4. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was heard on 17 October  2019
    in Manchester and the decision  dismissing  the  appeal  issued  on  24
    October 2019. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by
    the First-tier Tribunal on 21 February 2020.

 5. A hearing in the Upper Tribunal listed for 24 April 2020 was  adjourned
    as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. On 5 May 2020 the Upper  Tribunal
    directed that the parties provide written submissions  on  whether  the
    Tribunal could make a decision on the papers as to whether there was an
    error of law.

 6. The appellant agreed that the error of law decision could  be  made  on
    the papers. The respondent conceded in a  submission  dated  10  August
    2020 that the First-tier Tribunal decision disclosed errors on a  point
    of law. The submission stated in paragraph 4:

         "The judge has  plainly  become  confused  as  (sic)  the  decision
         actually appealed give (sic) that  the  appellant  was  refused  on
         admission on attempted second us (sic) of a family permit; that the
         case in  general  is  dogged  by  repeated  misstatements  of  what
         documentation was in play and what legal status it bore; and it  is
         not apparent that the correct Regulations framework was applied  to
         the case. It is not our view that the determination is  salvageable
         and would propose that the matter be listed for a further  hearing,
         with representations to follow  on  the  venue.  To  pre-empt  that
         course if agreed, the Respondent  would  take  no  strong  view  on
         remittal or retention but would suggest that the case would benefit
         from careful case management either way."

 7.  Having  considered  all  of  the  materials  including   the   written
    submissions of the parties, the Upper Tribunal finds that the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal discloses the errors of  law  identified  in
    the respondent's submission dan grounds of appeal,  in  particular  the
    approach to the  documentary  evidence,  parts  of  which,  potentially
    material to the decision on  dependency,  were  not  addressed  in  the
    decision. The error of law found is such that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision must be set aside to be remade.


 8. Having had regard to paragraph 7 of Part 3 of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012, and in particular where all
    findings of fact on the core issues of dependency must be  re-made,  it
    is appropriate for the  re-making  to  take  place  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



Notice of Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set  aside  to  be  remade  de  novo  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


Signed: S Pitt                                   Date: 4 November 2020
