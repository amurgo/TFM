               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation
For the Appellants:    Ms M Tariq, Counsel instructed by Immigration Law
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

This has been a remote hearing to which both parties have consented. The
form of remote hearing was video by Microsoft Teams (V). A face to face
hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be
determined in a remote hearing. I did not experience any difficulties, and
neither party expressed any concern, with the process.

                                CONSENT ORDER

Background

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside by a decision  of
    the Upper Tribunal promulgated on 8 March 2021.

 2. At the hearing to re-make the decision, Mr  Deller  conceded  that  the
    appeal of the appellants should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.

 3. The parties agreed (and there is no reason why it is inappropriate)  to
    dispose of the proceedings by way of a consent order.



Decision

 4. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties I make the following order:

 5. The appeal of the appellants against the decision of the respondent  to
    refuse their human rights claims is allowed.
