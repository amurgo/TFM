NOTICE OF DECISION 

Both subparagraphs of rule 40(3) apply to this decision.

The appeal is remitted to be determined de novo by the First-tier Tribunal other than Judge Powell.   

The respondent is directed to serve upon the appellant within 21 days of this decision being sent (i) the respondent’s bundle; and (ii) any evidence relied upon in relation to the issue of the subsistence of the appellant’s marriage, including any evidence from the appellant’s spouse.
