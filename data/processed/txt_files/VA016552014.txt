                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                    Claimant


                             DECISION TO REMAKE

1.   This matter came before me on 25 November  2014  as  an  error  of  law
    hearing.  In a decision dated 2 December 2014 I found a material  error
    of law and set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I
    further directed that within fourteen days of the date of issue of  the
    decision (and in any event no later than 1 January 2015) the  Secretary
    of State prepare and serve written submissions on  the  impact  of  the
    medical evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal under  Article
    8 ECHR.  At the end of December I was forwarded an email  sent  by  the
    Home Office Presenting Officer on 18 December 2014 confirming that  due
    to time constraints and annual leave, it would not be possible for  the
    submissions to be  forwarded  until  after  5  January  2015.   I  have
    received no further correspondence  from  the  Secretary  of  State.  I
    propose now to remake the decision.

2.   The facts are set out in paragraph  2  of  my  previous  decision.   In
    short, the claimant applied for entry clearance to the UK to visit  her
    daughter for a period of four weeks in order to support her through the
    birth and immediate care of her third child.  As  this  was  an  appeal
    against refusal of a visit visa there was a  limited  right  of  appeal
    under section 84 (1)( C) of the 2002 act,  on the grounds of breach  of
    human rights.

3.   Having regard to the evidence that was before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    I am satisfied that there is family life in the context of  visits,  as
    established between the appellant and her sponsor  who  is  her  mother
    (Shamin Box [2002] UKIAT 02212).  There was evidence to  show  that  in
    the context of the short visit there was a dependency above and  beyond
    the normal family ties following the case of  Kugathas  v  SSHD  [2003]
    INLR 170 as confirmed in JB (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 234.  The  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal included the application  form,  details
    of financial evidence, a letter from  a  midwife  and  various  medical
    reports.  The evidence  detailed  severe  depression  suffered  by  the
    sponsor during  the  latter  stages  of  her  pregnancy  and  postnatal
    depression.  There was evidence  to  support  her  claim  that  in  the
    absence of her mother's presence to help her with the birth of her  new
    baby and family (as was their custom in Sudan), her mental health would
    deteriorate. Further of significance was the fact that her  mother  had
    been available to provide help with the births  of  previous  children.
    The report from the perinatal specialist dated 19 March 2014 found that
    she was suffering from depression which was having a detrimental effect
    on the older children and bonding with the new baby. I find that  there
    is an interference with the family life as the  claimant  will  not  be
    able to provide her daughter with support during and  after  the  birth
    nor be available to help with the other children.  The interference  is
    of sufficient gravity to engage Article 8.  The decision made under the
    rules was lawful.  The determinative issue  is  proportionality.  I  am
    satisfied that the decision made was not in the best  interest  of  the
    claimant's grandchildren including the new baby. It  was  evident  that
    all family members would suffer from the sponsor's  depressive  illness
    and that support from the Claimant would be needed.

4.   Under the Immigration Rules the application  was  refused  because  the
    Claimant failed to produce evidence of the  source  considerable  funds
    and it was considered that she failed to show an intention to return to
    Sudan.  I am satisfied that she adduced evidence of  the  existence  of
    those funds before the Tribunal and that there was no other issue taken
    which would count against her immigration  history.   On  the  evidence
    before the Tribunal I find that  the  Claimant  was  genuinely  seeking
    entry as a visitor and that she intended to return at the  end  of  the
    visit. It is necessary to assess the evidence to see if the  merits  of
    the substantive rules are met and which illuminate the  proportionality
    decision (Mostafa (Article 8 in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  00112
    IAC).   I  also  have  regard  to  Section  117  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act, as amended, as regards public  interest.  I
    find no factors capable of outweighing the interests  of  the  sponsor,
    her grandchildren and  the  Claimant  for  this  short  visit  for  the
    purposes of supporting the sponsor during the birth of her third child.



Notice of Decision

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided  to  make  to  make  a
reduced fee award of ï¿½50 .  The Secretary of State failed  to  consider  all
evidence and issues fully.
