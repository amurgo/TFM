For the appellant:     Mr H Kannangara, instructed by Law Direct

For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Charlton-Brown  promulgated  18.2.15,  dismissing  his
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State,  dated  24.4.14,
    to refuse his application made on 10.3.14 for leave to remain as a Tier
    4 student, and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47 of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 26.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge De Haney  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.4.15. When the application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Smith also  refused  permission  to  appeal  on  3.7.15.
    However, an application for Judicial Review was granted,  quashing  the
    refusal of  permission.  In  consequence  the  Vice  President  granted
    permission to appeal on 11.12.15

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 1.3.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I find that there was an error of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    decision of Judge Charlton-Brown should be  set  aside  and  remade  by
    allowing the appeal.

 5. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant first came to the  UK  in  December  2010  with  leave  as  a
    student. His leave was subsequently extended in 2013 for further study,
    with leave to expiry 27.7.15.  However,  the  sponsor  licence  of  his
    college, the 'Academy De  London',  was  revoked  on  4.11.13  and  the
    appellant made no new application. On 9.1.14 his leave was curtailed to
    expire 10.3.14, advising him he should either leave the UK  or  make  a
    new application before the expiry date. He made his new application  on
    10.314, but it was refused on 24.4.14, giving rise to the appeal to the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 6. This case involves an interesting point of construction of the  wording
    of paragraph 245ZX(h):

         "If the course is below degree level the grant of leave  to  remain
         the applicant is seeking must not  lead  to  the  applicant  having
         spent more than 3 years in the UK as a Tier 4 Migrant since the age
         of 18 studying courses that did not consist of degree level study."

 7. The reasons for refusal letter  states  that  he  had  previously  been
    granted leave to study below degree level courses for two years and six
    months. His new application was to study for a  NQF  Level  5  Extended
    Diploma in Management until 16.1.15, a below degree level  course.  The
    refusal decision stated, "A grant of leave to study this  course  would
    result in you having spent more than 3 years in the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student studying courses that do not consist of degree  level
    study, therefore  you  fail  to  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX(h) of the Immigration Rules."

 8. The Secretary of  State's  case  is  that  adopted  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, that paragraph 245ZX(h) is to be construed  as  meaning
    that an applicant must not be in the UK for longer than the  three-year
    period as a student  of  courses  below  degree  level.  Since  he  was
    initially given leave for two years and 6 months, the further period of
    study applied for would, on this interpretation, mean that he would  be
    in the UK for longer than 3 years. In fact, the Rule 24 response, dated
    29.1.16 goes further by asserting that as he came to the UK in December
    2010 and, according to the evidence recorded by the First-tier Tribunal
    at �13, stopped studying in August 2014, he was already over the 3 year
    period before making the application the subject of this appeal.

 9. The appellant's case at the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  his  first
    grant of leave in November 2010 was for a course of two years' duration
    (24 months), as confirmed by the CAS letter dated 3.11.10. He  had  not
    started studied at the second college before its licence  was  revoked.
    His last application was for a one-year course, which would  bring  his
    total period of study in the UK to 3 years.

10. Judicial Review was granted on the basis that there is  arguable  merit
    that the construction of the wording of paragraph 245ZX(h)  should  not
    be that adopted by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  but  that  as  the
    restriction is qualified by the word 'studying,' it renders the  three-
    year limit as one of three years of studying rather  than  three  years
    presence in the UK.

11. In his submissions  Mr  Kannangara's  pointed  to  the  Tier  4  Policy
    Guidance version 08/2014, which at �109 states  that,  "In  calculating
    the maximum amount of time that you spend studying at or  above  degree
    level, we will only include the length of the course and will not  take
    into account the additional periods of leave granted  before  or  after
    your main course of  study  that  are  referred  to  in  the  table  at
    paragraph 98." This table sets out how long a Tier 4 student  can  come
    to the UK for, depending on the type of course and the  length  of  the
    course. However, in respect of each alternative,  the  length  of  stay
    allowed is the full length of the  course  plus  an  additional  period
    after the end of the course.

12. Whilst �109 refers to "at or above degree level," which the appellant's
    course level was not, the table refers to courses that are  necessarily
    shorter than degree-level course, including less than 6 months. This is
    entirely consistent with a construction of paragraph 245ZX(h)  to  mean
    period of time in the UK studying, as opposed to period of leave to  be
    in the UK as a study. Although the appellant's first course was  of  24
    months, he was granted 2 years and 6  months  leave,  again  consistent
    with the appellant's submission that leave to be present in the UK  for
    the purpose of studying is not the same thing as actually  studying  on
    the course. Otherwise, even though his first course was 24  months,  he
    would be prevented from studying up to the maximum period of  3  years,
    just because his initial leave was granted for longer than 2 years. The
    strict interpretation contended  for  by  the  Secretary  of  State  is
    contrary to common sense and inconsistent with her policy  guidance  to
    disregard the additional periods of leave when calculating the  maximum
    amount of time spent studying in the UK.

13. In the circumstances, I find that the  interpretation  adopted  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal was incorrect and thus that  the  decision  was  in
    error of law. In light of this conclusion,  it  must  follow  that  the
    appeal should be allowed on immigration grounds.



Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on
                    immigration grounds.

Consequential Directions

15. Forthwith on receipt of this decision the respondent  shall  grant  the
    appellant leave to remain for such  period  as  is  necessary  to  give
    effect to this determination.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been allowed.
