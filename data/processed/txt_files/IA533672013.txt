                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. R Griffith-Anteson
For the Respondent:     Mr. P Nath, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet allowing the appeal of the appellant
    against the respondent's refusal of her application for leave to remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant pursuant to
    paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules 395, as amended.

2.   The respondent's reasons for refusal set out in the letter of 4
    December 2013.  The appellant was required to show evidence of �2,500
    maintenance for 28 days from 29 September 2013 to 26 October 2013.
    However, the bank statements submitted by her demonstrated possession
    of no more than �1,987.19 at any point during that period.  In addition
    the State Bank of Travancore bank statement dated 20 September 2013 was
    more than one month prior to the application of 5 November 2013.

3.   At the hearing before the First-tier Judge on 5 March 2014, the
    appellant's representative produced a letter from State Bank of
    Travancore dated 14 February 2014 which confirmed that the appellant
    has continued to have the equivalent balance of �3,679 in that account
    and argued that the appellant therefore met the necessary financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

4.   The First-tier Judge accepted his submission and allowed the
    appellant's appeal.

5.   Mr. Nath relied on the grounds submitted on behalf of the respondent.

6.   I find that the First-tier Judge erred in law in considering the bank
    certificate dated 14 February 2014.  Her consideration of the post-
    decision evidence was in breach of Section 85A(4) of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which requires her to consider only
    evidence adduced by the appellant "in support of, and at the time of
    making, the application to which the immigration decision related".

7.   The First-tier Judge's decision cannot stand.

8.   I remake the decision and dismiss the appellant's appeal.
