                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Manyarara, promulgated on 17th July 2018, following a hearing at Hatton
    Cross on 18th June 2018.  In the determination, the judge dismissed the
    appeals  of  the  Appellants,  whereupon  the  Appellants  subsequently
    applied for, and were  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellants

 2. The first Appellant is an Ecuadorian national.  He was born on 29th May
    1982.  He  is  a  male.   He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent dated 14th August 2017  to  refuse  his  application  for  a
    retained right  of  residence  as  the  former  spouse  of  the  second
    Appellant.  She is  a  Lithuanian  national.   She  was  born  on  21st
    February 1983.  She  is  the  first  Appellant's  former  spouse.   She
    appeals against the decision to refuse her  application  for  permanent
    residence.  The third Appellant is the second Appellant's son, born  on
    29th July 2007.  The first and second Appellants' marriage  took  place
    on 8th February 2006 and the decree absolute  was  pronounced  on  28th
    July 2014.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellants' claim  is  that  the  first  and  second
    Appellants met on 4th April 2004, and began their relationship  by  the
    end of August 2004, when they started living together.  They married in
    2006.  The marriage was registered in Lithuania on 8th  February  2006.
    The first Appellant was then granted a residence card as a spouse  from
    27th October 2009  until  27th  October  2014.   The  second  Appellant
    herself worked for PBP in the United Kingdom from 2004 until 2009.  She
    was on maternity leave for one year.   She  studied  between  2010  and
    2013.  She received a jobseeker's allowance ("JSA").  This was  between
    April 2010 and October 2010.  She then worked on a self-employed  basis
    as a cleaner.  As for the first Appellant, he has  worked  continuously
    since being granted a residence card.  He has worked  for  his  current
    employer since 2007.

 4. The Respondent has accepted the second Appellant's employment from  6th
    April 2006 until 18th August 2009.  However, insofar as the question of
    being self-sufficient was concerned from 18th August  2009  until  31st
    July 2014, the Appellants failed to provide evidence to show  that  the
    second Appellant held a  European  Health  Insurance  Card  during  her
    period of self-sufficiency.  There  was  no  evidence  that  there  was
    comprehensive sickness insurance in place in  relation  to  the  period
    during which the second Appellant was a student,  between  12th  August
    2011 and 26th June 2014.  Moreover, there was no evidence that she  had
    been making regular national insurance contributions or  that  her  tax
    affairs were up-to-date by the submission of  a  tax  return,  for  the
    period of self-employment from 18th April  2014  to  the  date  of  the
    application.  It was accepted that the Appellant was exercising  treaty
    rights since the date of divorce but  it  was  not  accepted  that  the
    second Appellant had provided  evidence  to  show  she  was  exercising
    treaty rights until the date of the divorce.

The Judge's Findings

 5. When the appeal came up before Judge Manyarara, a particular feature of
    the appeal was that  there  had  been  a  previous  decision  by  Judge
    Robinson on 3rd April 2017.  Judge Robinson made the following material
    finding:

      1) "She [the Sponsor]  was  supported  by  the  Appellant  [the  first
         Appellant] from November 2009  until  26th  January  2014  and  was
         claiming JSA".

      2) "On 18th July 2014 she started a small  cleaning  business.   Since
         1st August 2014 she has worked for a  specialised  opticians"  (see
         paragraph 10 of Judge Robinson's decision).

 6. At the hearing before Judge Manyarara, it was accepted by the Appellant
    that there was no comprehensive sickness insurance  in  place  for  the
    second Appellant.  Judge Manyarara considered this  to  be  potentially
    fatal.  It was held that the requirement that the second Appellant  has
    comprehensive sickness insurance is one that cannot be circumvented  or
    overcome (paragraph 21).  Judge Manyarara also noted that it  had  been
    accepted that the second Appellant studied between the years  2010  and
    2013 and was in receipt of JSA between April  2010  and  October  2010,
    which was a period of more than  91  days.   Judge  Robinson  had  also
    accepted that the Appellant had worked  for  opticians.   There  was  a
    letter dated 5th June from Special Eyes Opticians and "this shows  that
    the second Appellant was engaged in employment as an optical  assistant
    and supervisor from 6th May 2014 until 21st July 2014" (paragraph  22).
    However, having considered all the evidence cumulatively,  the  judge's
    view was that "the second Appellant was not a  worker  for  the  period
    2009 to 2014 and she did  not  have  comprehensive  sickness  insurance
    during that period.  She was on maternity leave for a year and she  was
    also studying during that period".  The  judge  also  found  that  "the
    second Appellant was claiming JSA between January 2014 and  July  2014,
    as shown by the documentation before me" (paragraph 24).

 7. In concluding, the judge held that,

         "On the basis of the evidence before me, I find that the Appellants
         have failed to show that they can bring themselves within  the  EEA
         Regulations in relation to permanent residence (or a retained right
         of residence in respect of the first Appellant).  I have considered
         all of the evidence that is before me and bear in mind  the  burden
         and standard of proof" (paragraph 42).

 8. The appeals were dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that at the date of the initiation  of
    the divorce the  judge  had  made  a  clear  finding  that  the  second
    Appellant was receiving  jobseeker's  allowance,  because  this  was  a
    period from 26th January 2014  until  18th  July  2014,  when  she  had
    started a small cleaning business.   From  1st  August  2014,  she  was
    employed for a specialised opticians (and this is clear at paragraph 20
    of the determination).  Therefore, the second Appellant was a qualified
    person within the meaning of  Regulation  6,  because  that  Regulation
    describes a "qualified person" both as a person who is  a  "jobseeker",
    as well as a "worker".  The second  Appellant  did  not  have  to  have
    acquired a right of permanent residence, because this is  only  one  of
    the limbs whereby the first Appellant can then go on to  succeed  under
    Regulation 10(5) in getting a retained right of residence.   The  judge
    did not direct her mind to  the  material  date  at  which  the  second
    Appellant was exercising treaty rights.  At paragraph 33,  there  is  a
    reference to "at the time of the divorce" and at paragraph 21, there is
    a reference to the pronouncement of the  divorce  being  on  28th  July
    2014.  There is no finding by the judge whether she adopted the date of
    initiation of the divorce or the date of the decree absolute, as  being
    the material date at which treaty rights should  have  been  exercised.
    However, it was now well established since the decision  in  Baigazeiva
    [2018] EWCA Civ 1088 that it is the date of initiation of  the  divorce
    that is the material date, and on this basis the Appellant  would  have
    succeeded.

10. On 9th October 2018 permission to appeal was granted.

11. On 30th October 2018 a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Respondent
    to the effect that this was a case  where  all  three  Appellants  were
    applying for a permanent right  of  residence,  and  therefore  it  was
    incumbent upon them to show that the second  Appellant  was  exercising
    treaty rights for a period of five continuous years, and this  she  was
    unable to do because she did not have comprehensive sickness  insurance
    for the relevant dates, when she claimed to be studying and  there  was
    insufficient evidence to show that she was a worker or a jobseeker  for
    a continuous five year period.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 15th November 2018, Mr Rene submitted  that
    the divorce was initiated on 27th December 2012.  This  is  clear  from
    the document from the Croydon County Court (which he handed up) and not
    in 2014.  At the date of the initiation of the divorce  petition  being
    filed the second Appellant was exercising treaty  rights.   The  actual
    divorce then took place on 28th July 2014.  The judge was not clear  in
    specifying the  material  date  for  the  purposes  of  EEA  law.   The
    Appellant was relying on a retained rights of residence.  This was  not
    an application for permanent residence.  However, the judge  erred  (at
    paragraph 21) in appearing to focus on the  relevant  date  being  that
    "the decree absolute was pronounced on 28th July 2014" (paragraph  21).
    The focus of the judge, now that the decision in Baigazeiva [2018] EWCA
    Civ 1088 has been handed down, should have been the  actual  initiation
    of the divorce by way of petition being filed on  27th  December  2012.
    The date of the grant of  decree  absolute  was  irrelevant  for  these
    purposes.

13. Second, the judge in applying the Rule in Devaseelan [2003]  Imm  AR  1
    (at paragraph 19) had adopted Judge Robinson's decision to  the  effect
    that the second Appellant (the Sponsor) was claiming JSA from  November
    2009 until 26th January 2014, and this being so,  under  Regulation  6,
    she would have been a "qualified person".  Although the  judge  accepts
    this particular aspect of the finding by Judge Robinson in relation  to
    the second Appellant, she fails to consider the position in relation to
    retained rights of residence for the first Appellant.

14. For her part, Ms Kenny submitted that the second Appellant  (the  first
    Appellant's sponsoring wife) was working up to  2009,  and  this  would
    have to be accepted, but she  did  not  have  comprehensive  healthcare
    insurance.

15. In reply, Mr Rene submitted that there was a confusion here between  an
    application for "permanent  rights  of  residence"  and  for  "retained
    rights of residence".  In this case the Appellants  were  not  applying
    for "permanent" rights of residence.  Yet, the judge had  confused  the
    two, as  is  clear  from  the  final  paragraph  in  the  determination
    (paragraph 42) where she states that, "I find that the Appellants  have
    failed  to  show  that  they  can  bring  themselves  within  the   EEA
    Regulations in relation to permanent residence (or a retained right  of
    residence in respect of the first Appellant)".

Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error of a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  re-make  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

17. First, this is a case where the judge does not  identify  the  relevant
    period during which the second Appellant had to  be  exercising  treaty
    rights.  That period was when the divorce petition was  filed  and  the
    divorce was initiated, this being on 27th December  2012,  and  not  on
    28th July 2014, when the decree absolute was actually  announced.   The
    judge fails to make this clear (at paragraphs 21 to 24).  The reference
    by the judge is to the date when "decree  absolute  was  pronounced  on
    28th July 2014" (paragraph 21).

18. Second, the Appellants are applying for a "retained right of residence"
    and not for permanent rights of residence.  The issue  is  whether  the
    second Appellant was a "qualified person" under Regulation  6,  and  it
    had already been determined by Judge Robinson on 3rd  April  2017  that
    the second Appellant was supporting the first Appellant "from  November
    2009 until 26th January 2014 and was claiming JSA" (paragraph  20)  and
    this was accepted by Judge  Manyarara.   The  findings  made  by  Judge
    Robinson  on  3rd  April  2017,  which  are  set  out  in  the  current
    determination at paragraph 20, cannot be now undermined and must be the
    starting point.  On that basis,  the  Appellants  succeed  because  the
    second Appellant was a  "qualified  person"  because  she  was  both  a
    jobseeker and a worker, as the rest of the chronology  that  the  judge
    sets out makes clear  (from  paragraphs  22  to  24).   The  Appellants
    succeed in their application for retained rights of residence.



Re-making the Decision

19. I have re-made the decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    Immigration Judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that  I
    have heard today.  I am allowing this appeal for  the  reasons  that  I
    have given.



Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    allowed.

21. No anonymity direction is made.

22. This appeal is allowed.
