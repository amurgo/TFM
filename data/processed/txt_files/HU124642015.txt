For the Appellant:     Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Khan, Counsel instructed under Direct Access
                       Scheme


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan  date  of  birth  13th  August
    1989.   On the 6th July 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge AK Simpson)
    allowed her appeal against a decision to refuse to grant her  leave  to
    remain on human rights grounds. The appeal was  allowed  on  the  basis
    that the Respondent qualified for leave to remain under the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ('the Regs').  The  Secretary
    of State now has permission[1] to appeal against that decision.


 2. The findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  can  be  summarised  as
    follows.  The Respondent is lawfully married to a Mr Tehzeeb Ul Hassan.
    At the date of the appeal Mr Ul Hassan had permission to reside in  the
    United Kingdom as the dependent family member of his father, a  Swedish
    national who was exercising treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom.  The
    Secretary of State had  granted  him  a  residence  permit  until  28th
    November 2018.   The Respondent was in turn dependent upon her husband.
     By virtue of Regulation 7(3) of the Regs Mr Ul  Hassan  has  the  same
    rights as a direct family member and  as  such  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed.


 3. The Secretary of State has a number of complaints about that approach.

 4. First, it is submitted, the Tribunal  has  fundamentally  misunderstood
    the rights that Mr Ul Hassan had, and could thereby extend to his wife.
    Mr Ul Hassan was granted a residence permit on the basis that he was  a
    dependent relative of his father, under Regulation 7(1)(b)(ii). He does
    not himself have any locus as a 'sponsor' under the Regs. Before me  Ms
    Khan accepted that this was correct.   She pointed out however that the
    Respondent had never claimed to derive any right of residence under the
    Regs. The relevance of the Regs was simply that her husband had a right
    of residence derived therefrom. As such he did not have settled  status
    and she could not qualify for leave to remain as a 'partner' under  the
    terms of Appendix FM.  That was the very lacuna in the rules which gave
    rise to the Article 8 claim that was  advanced  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, but in the end was not addressed by the determination.

 5. Secondly, it is asserted that it was  an  error  for  the  Tribunal  to
    assume that Mr Ul Hassan continued to satisfy the terms  of  Regulation
    8, since it was apparent from the facts as found that he was no  longer
    dependent upon his  father:  see  for  instance  paragraph  12  of  the
    determination which records that Mr Ul Hassan is a  self-employed  taxi
    driver earning �23,942 per annum in addition to his  employed  earnings
    as a director of Costbuster Retail from which he derives a dividend  of
    �15,000 and a salary of �12,000 per annum.  Before me Mr Bates accepted
    that the author of the grounds here appears to have  misunderstood  the
    position, since Mr Ul Hassan did not derive  his  rights  of  residence
    under Reg 8, but rather Reg 7.  Said author could perhaps  be  forgiven
    for that since the First-tier  Tribunal  determination  itself  is  not
    terribly clear about that  point.  Nevertheless,  Mr  Bates  submitted,
    there was a matter of current dependency to be  considered.    On  this
    matter Ms Khan submitted that Mr Ul Hassan had a residence permit valid
    until 2018. As such he was lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  and
    the Secretary of State had not asked the First-tier Tribunal to  review
    whether he continued to be dependent upon his father.  The  matter  was
    not addressed in either the  submissions  or  the  evidence.   For  the
    reasons set out by Ms Khan I do not find this ground to  be  made  out.
    The Secretary of State cannot reasonably complain that the Tribunal has
    failed to consider a matter when it was not asked to.

 6. Notwithstanding her objection to ground two Ms Khan did however consent
    to the decision being set aside.  She  requested  that  the  appeal  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal so  that  the  Respondent's  actual
    case - that it  would  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  her
    Article 8 rights to remove her from  the  United  Kingdom  -  could  be
    determined. Mr Bates had no objection to that course of action.

 7. As a post-script I note that there was a third  point  in  the  appeal,
    raised  by  Judge  Parkes  in  his  grant  of  permission.  After   the
    determination was promulgated, and grounds drafted, the Upper  Tribunal
    reported the decision in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411
    (IAC). If the Respondent was claiming a right of  residence  under  the
    Regs as an extended family member, there would be no right of appeal on
    this ground.   As is clear from the foregoing, this was not  an  appeal
    against a refusal to grant a right of residence as an  extended  family
    member. It was an appeal brought against a decision to refuse to  grant
    leave to remain on human rights (Article 8 grounds). The Regs were only
    relevant in that they formed the backdrop to why the Respondent  had  a
    family life in the  United  Kingdom  in  the  first  place.   Sala  has
    therefore no application to this case.


      Decisions


 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error
    in approach and it is set aside.


 9. The decision in the appeal will be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.


10. There is no order for anonymity.
