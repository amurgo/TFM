Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mold of Counsel instructed by MT UK Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is a remade decision  following  a  successful  appeal  by  the
        appellant, Mr Lekh Raj, against the decision of Judge of the  First-
        tier Tribunal Andonian which was promulgated  on  12th  August  2016
        dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision
        dated 27 May 2015 refusing his application for leave  to  remain  on
        the basis of the private life he had established in the UK.

     2. In my decision promulgated on 09 May 2017 I  found  that  the  FtJ's
        decision contained material errors of law. These included a  failure
        to adequately assess the evidence from the appellant's witnesses and
        the drawing of inferences based on reasoning that  did  not  support
        such inferences. I was satisfied  that  these  errors  rendered  the
        decision unsafe. The matter  was  adjourned  to  be  reheard  before
        myself.

Background

     3. The appellant is a national of India, date of birth 18  March  1979.
        He claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom by lorry  in  August
        1997. On 10 December 2007 the appellant was served with  a  decision
        informing him of his status as an illegal entrant. He gave  a  false
        name and date of birth when encountered by immigration  officers  on
        26 July 2011. He later applied for leave to remain on the  basis  of
        his human rights. This application was refused on 17 May  2013.   He
        made another application on the same basis which was refused  on  14
        April 2014. A further application was  made  which  eventually  gave
        rise to the decision dated 27 May 2015, which is the subject of  the
        present appeal.

The respondent's decision

     4. In her decision the respondent  noted  that  the  appellant  had  no
        children or partner in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  application  was
        therefore  considered  under  paragraph  276ADE,  which  relates  to
        private life rights. The respondent noted  that  the  appellant  had
        lived most of his life, certainly his formative years, in India.  It
        was not accepted that he had lost all social and cultural  ties.  It
        was noted  that  he  continued  to  speak  Punjabi.  The  respondent
        concluded that there were no 'very  significant  obstacles'  to  his
        integration into India (with reference to paragraph 276ADE(vi)). The
        respondent thereafter  proceeded  to  consider  whether  there  were
        exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant  a  grant  of  leave
        under article 8 outside the immigration rules.  The respondent  made
        brief reference to an assertion by the appellant that he  feared  an
        uncle. The respondent indicated that, if the appellant held  such  a
        fear, he was entitled to make a protection  claim.   The  respondent
        considered, in any event,  that  the  appellant  could  relocate  to
        another part of India. There was said to be no evidence to support a
        claim made by the appellant that he would be detained by the Punjabi
        police as somebody  returning  to  India  after  being  away  for  a
        prolonged period.  The  respondent  finally  acknowledged  that  the
        appellant may have  formed  bonds  and  friendships  in  the  United
        Kingdom,  but  that  these  were  insufficient  to  amount   to   an
        exceptional circumstance capable of warranting a grant of  leave  to
        remain in line with article 8 principles.

Documents Submitted in Connection with the Appeal

     5. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the appellant relied on the
        same bundle of documents that was before the First-tier Tribunal. He
        did not adduce any further documentary evidence for the purposes  of
        the remade hearing.

     6. The documents included, inter  alia,  representations  made  by  his
        former and current legal representatives,  a  copy  of  his  FLR(FP)
        application form, a statement from the appellant signed and dated on
        27 February 2015, a witness statement from  Mohammed  Wahid,  signed
        and dated on 19 January 2015 and supported  by  a  photocopy  of  Mr
        Wahid's passport, a witness statement from  Mohammed  Saquib  Yaqub,
        signed and dated on 19 January 2015 and supported by a photocopy  of
        Mr Yaqub's British passport, a witness statement from  Tehal  Singh,
        signed and dated on 19 January 2015 and supported by a  copy  of  Mr
        Singh's Indian  passport  containing  an  ILR  residence  permit,  a
        witness statement from Shahid Waheed Butt signed and  dated  at  the
        hearing, a witness statement from Jasvir Singh signed and  dated  on
        19 January 2015 and supported by Mr Singh's passport  and  residence
        card,  a  letter  from  the  respondent  dated  2   September   2011
        maintaining the appellant's detention, a decision by the respondent,
        dated 17 May 2013, refusing to grant the appellant leave to  remain,
        a decision dated 11 April 2014 in which the appellant's  application
        for leave to remain was refused,  a  letter  from  the  Guru  Granth
        Gurdwara, dated  9  August  2011  stating  that  the  appellant  had
        worshipped there since 2001 and that he was honest, hard-working and
        God-fearing, a letter from Mr Shamsul Hoque,  dated  4  August  2011
        stating that he knew the appellant since November 1997 and that  the
        appellant resided at his flat in November and  December  1997  as  a
        "family friend", and an earlier letter from Mr Mohammed Wahid, dated
        6th of August 2011 in which he  confirmed  that  the  appellant  was
        resident at his address in 1998 and that he did a lot  of  voluntary
        work in the local temple.

The evidence

     7. I have maintained a record of the evidence given  by  the  appellant
        and  his  witnesses  and   of   the   submissions   made   by   both
        representatives. The following is a brief summary of that evidence.

     8. In his statement, which he adopted at  the  hearing,  the  appellant
        confirmed that he was born in Pind  village  in  Punjab,  India.  He
        completed both  primary  and  secondary  education  and  passed  his
        matriculation examination at a secondary school in March  1997.  His
        paternal uncle, with whom he and his family lived, was a  vindictive
        and controlling man who bullied the appellant and insisted  that  he
        farm the land under  the  uncle's  supervision  rather  than  go  to
        university. The appellant describes his father as  being  a  passive
        and compliant individual who was also continuously  bullied  by  his
        younger brother. The only people who cared about the appellant where
        his  younger  brother  and  his  mother.  She  ultimately  sold  her
        jewellery and made arrangements for  him  to  leave  India  in  1997
        because the appellant  was  unhappy  and  'mentally  unstable'.  The
        appellant arrived clandestinely in August 1997.

     9. At paragraph 20 of his statement the appellant remarks  that,  since
        he left India in 1997, he has had no  contact  with  his  family  in
        India. The appellant's father mysteriously died in 2009. He and  his
        mother believed that the appellant's uncle caused the death  of  his
        father and the appellant claims to have a fear of ill-treatment from
        his uncle. Since the death of his father the appellant's  mother  no
        longer lives  at  the  ancestral  home  and  was  not  reachable  by
        telephone or post. The appellant no longer had any contacts or  ties
        in India and has severed all connections with his country of origin.
        He has valuable relationships with his "family members" and  friends
        (although none  of  the  witnesses  appear  to  be  related  to  the
        appellant). He has established a strong private life in the  UK  and
        he communicates in English. He has integrated with the  English  way
        of life "at every level" and visits pubs, shops like Tesco, Primark,
        Boots and M&S, celebrates  Christmas,  watches  football,  pays  his
        respects on Remembrance Day, is registered on the electoral roll and
        casts his vote  at  the  elections  (although  no  evidence  of  his
        registration on the electoral roll was provided).

    10. In oral evidence the appellant explained that Mohammed Saqib  Yaqub,
        who had written a statement in support of his  appeal,  had  changed
        job and was unable to attend the hearing. The appellant was not able
        to contact Mr Hoque, who wrote a letter dated 04 August 2011 stating
        that the appellant resided at his  flat  in  November  and  December
        1997. The appellant initially stated  that  he  could  not  find  Mr
        Hoque's house and that he did try to  look  for  it.  Later  in  his
        evidence the appellant claimed that he did in fact visit Mr  Hoque's
        home on 2 occasions but Mr Hoque was not at home and  the  appellant
        believed he had moved. The appellant was last in  contact  with  his
        family in India  in  2009,  when  his  father  died.  The  appellant
        discovered that his father had died when a friend, Baljinder  Singh,
        went to India and then told him. The appellant was  asked  where  he
        lived between August and the end of October 1997. He lived  with  Mr
        Shamsul Hoque at his home in Hammersmith. Later in cross examination
        the appellant said all he could remember was staying with  Mr  Hoque
        for a couple of months and that he could not  remember  properly  as
        this occurred 20 years ago. From 2003 to 2006 the appellant lived at
        an address in Southall with 4 or 5 friends, and from 2006 until 2009
        he lived with some of the same  friends  and  some  new  friends  at
        another address in Southall. From 2009 to present the appellant  had
        the use of a room at   [ ] Road,  Southall.  When  asked  about  his
        proficiency in English the appellant said  he  could  understand  "a
        little bit, maybe talk a bit as well. But not  that  much."  He  had
        never worked illegally and was supported by various friends and  ate
        at the Gurdwara. If given permission to work he  could  do  anything
        including gardening, painting and building work.

    11. In cross-examination the appellant explained  that  the  friend  who
        informed him of his father's death  did  not  know  how  his  father
        passed away, and the appellant made  no  enquiries  as  to  how  his
        father died. The  appellant's  friend  returned  to  India  and  the
        appellant asked  him  to  find  out  more  information.  The  friend
        informed the appellant that his mother moved to Kot-is Khan, a  town
        in the Punjab. When pressed, the appellant explained that his mother
        informed his friend  that  the  appellant's  uncle  might  have  had
        something to do with his father's death. When asked  why  he  hasn't
        tried to establish contact with his mother the  appellant  said  she
        was quite elderly and did not have any ideas about  telephones.  The
        appellant met Mr Hoque through a friend he met at the Gurdwara.

    12. The appellant first met Mr Mohammad Wahid at  the  Osterley  cricket
        club in the beginning of 1998. The appellant initially said he was a
        member of the club but then said he had not joined the club and  was
        able to play without being a member.  The  appellant  denied  having
        made an application  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  working
        holidaymaker. The appellant accepted that he gave a false  name  and
        date of birth to Immigration  Officers  when  encountered  in  2011.
        Evidence was briefly reopened during the submissions to  enable  the
        appellant to respond to the allegation in the respondent's letter of
        2 April 2011 that he was served with an IS151A informing him of  his
        legal entry in the UK on 10 December 2007 and that  he  subsequently
        absconded.

    13. Mr Muhammad Wahid adopted his statement in which he confirmed he was
        a British national and owned a catering business. He first  met  the
        appellant sometime in 1998 and they were now good friends and played
        cricket together. Upon the appellant's arrival in the  UK  Mr  Wahid
        offered him accommodation and the appellant  stayed  with  Mr  Wahid
        until 2003. Mr Wahid believed the appellant had developed  a  strong
        social network in the UK.

    14. In examination in chief Mr Wahid said he  saw  the  appellant  on  a
        daily basis from 1998 until 2003 and thereafter saw him about once a
        month. In cross examination Mr Wahid  described  first  meeting  the
        appellant when he came with a friend to play cricket at the Osterley
        cricket club in Southall. Mr Wahid sometimes helped the appellant by
        buying him food and clothes. In response to some questions  from  me
        Mr Wahid indicated that the appellant was not initially a member  of
        the cricket club but became a member in April or May 1998. Mr  Wahid
        knew this because  he  was  playing  cricket  at  the  time  and  is
        currently an executive member of the club. Mr Wahid  indicated  that
        the fees to join the cricket club would have been  between  �20  and
        �30 when the appellant joined. Mr Wahid had no criminal convictions.

    15. In his statement, which he adopted at the hearing,  Mr  Tehal  Singh
        confirmed that he had ILR and had known the appellant since 2001. Mr
        Singh maintained a certain degree of supervision over the  appellant
        as he was a surety in respect of the bail matter. Mr Singh  regarded
        the appellant as a good friend and that all his connections, friends
        and private life existed in the UK.

    16. In examination in chief Mr Singh said he saw  the  appellant  either
        every week, every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks. In cross-examination  he
        described first meeting the appellant at a Gudwara. The  appellant's
        village  was  near  to  Mr  Singh's  village.  Mr  Singh  knew   the
        appellant's mother and brother. Mr Singh last saw them 3 to 4  years
        ago when he last went to India. The appellant asked Mr Singh to meet
        his mother. Mr Singh met the appellant's  mother  and  brother,  who
        were in a poorly condition. This was in a village near Kot-Is  Khan.
        Mr Singh's evidence then became confusing. He initially claimed that
        he tried to see the appellant's family twice during the  same  visit
        but on the 2nd occasion they had moved because of the feud with  the
        appellant's uncle. Mr Singh  then  claimed  that  the  2nd  occasion
        actually occurred during a subsequent visit to India 2 years  later.
        In response to questions from me Mr Singh said  that  there  was  no
        point in giving  either  his  or  the  appellant's  address  to  the
        appellant's mother as neither she nor the appellant's brother  could
        read or write. They did not ask for a contact address in the UK  and
        he did not give one to them.

    17. In his statement Mr Shaheed Butt claimed to have known the appellant
        since 2003 when they met at an Internet cafe operated  by  Mr  Butt.
        The appellant was described as being very honest and trustworthy and
        had very good friends and had developed a strong private life in the
        UK. In examination in chief  Mr  Butt  said  he  saw  the  appellant
        regularly, and in  cross  examination  Mr  Butt  described  how  the
        appellant would usually take out films which were available  at  the
        Internet caf�. Mr Butt did not know what the appellant  did  on  the
        Internet.

    18. In his statement Jasvir Singh said he knew the appellant since 2003,
        that they  had  become  good  friends,  that  they  celebrated  Sikh
        festivals together and other religious festivals such as  Christmas,
        that the appellant was hard-working and honest  and  had  integrated
        himself into  the  British  way  of  life  to  a  large  extent.  In
        examination in chief  Mr  Singh  said  that  he  regularly  saw  the
        appellant. In cross  examination  Mr  Singh  said  that  he  watched
        football and cricket with the appellant at a pub.

    19. Mr Avery invited me to find  that  neither  the  appellant  nor  his
        witnesses were credible and supported this submission  by  reference
        to the inconsistencies in the evidence relating  to  Mr  Hoque,  the
        appellant's  membership  of  the  cricket  club,   the   appellant's
        implausible description of how he obtained accommodation in  the  UK
        and the vague nature of the evidence relating to the  death  of  his
        father. Even if the  appellant  had  entered  the  UK  in  1997  and
        remained continuously he did not meet the requirements of  paragraph
        276ADE(vi). The appellant still spoke  Punjabi  and  had  maintained
        strong cultural links with the Punjabi community in the UK and could
        relocate to another part of Punjab. With reference to the factors in
        s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  the
        appellant's presence had always been precarious, he  had  a  limited
        grasp of English, and the whole basis  of  his  stay  was  based  on
        deception. Whilst he had some friends the public interest outweighed
        the life he established for himself in the UK.

    20. Mr Mold relied on his skeleton argument and invited me to  find  the
        appellant and his witnesses were credible. He  quickly  moved  to  a
        submission that I was entitled  to  allow  the  appeal  outside  the
        immigration rules with particular reference to the authority of SSHD
        v SS (Congo)  &  Ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  and  the  "near  miss"
        principles restated therein. The precariousness of his  presence  in
        the UK had to be contrasted with his very long presence.

The law

    21. Paragraph 276ADE of the immigration rules contain  the  requirements
        to be met by an applicant for leave to  remain  on  the  grounds  of
        private life

         At the date of application, the applicant:

           (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in
           Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5. in
           Appendix FM; and

           (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
           grounds of private life in the UK; and

           (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

           (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
           the UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of
           imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect the
           applicant to leave the UK; or

           (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
           at least half of his life living continuously in the UK
           (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

           (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or above,
           has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years
           (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there would be very
           significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into the
           country to which he would have to go if required to leave the
           UK.

    22. Article 8 of the ECHR relates to the right to  respect  for  private
        and family life. It reads:

          1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
             life, his home and his correspondence.

          2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
             exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the
             law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests
             of national security, public safety or the economic well-being
             of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for
             the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of
             the rights and freedoms of others.

    23. Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
        contains a number of factors that must be considered by a  court  or
        tribunal when considering the public interest factors in an  article
        8 proportionality assessment.

    24. It is for the appellant to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  under
        article 8 and the standard of proof to be applied is  a  balance  of
        probabilities. I can consider any matter which I think  is  relevant
        to the substance of the decision, including evidence which  concerns
        a matter arising after the date of the decision.  The  date  for  my
        consideration is the date of the hearing.

Findings and reasons

    25. It  is  pertinent  to  note  at  the  outset  that,  despite  making
        assertions in his statement suggesting that his uncle would kill him
        if he returned to Punjab, the appellant has not  made  a  protection
        claim. This was, and  remains,  an  option  open  to  him.  Mr  Mold
        advanced the appeal firmly and exclusively on the basis  of  article
        8. The evidence relating to the appellant's uncle is, in any  event,
        vague and inconclusive. Whilst his claim to have been mistreated  by
        his uncle is not inherently implausible there is no evidence of  the
        death of the appellant's father and no evidence of  the  FIR  (First
        Incidence Report) that was said to have been lodged with the  police
        following the death. In his oral  evidence  the  appellant  says  he
        discovered that his father had died when a friend, Baljinder  Singh,
        went to India and then told him. There was no  statement  from  this
        individual and he did not attend to give evidence at the hearing. In
        his oral evidence the appellant  initially  claimed  that  Baljinder
        Singh did not say how his father passed away and later claimed  that
        his  mother  informed  Baljinder  Singh  that   she   believed   the
        appellant's uncle might have had something to  do  with  the  death.
        This  is  highly  speculative  and  without  any   firm   evidential
        foundation. There is simply no evidence to support  the  appellant's
        claim that he has an objective fear of ill-treatment if returned  to
        India.

    26. Nor would there be any reason why the appellant's uncle  would  have
        any continuing adverse interest in  the  appellant  given  that  the
        uncle now appears to have obtained that which he set out  to  obtain
        (the land  belonging  to  the  appellant's  father).  There  was  no
        indication in the  appellant's  evidence  that  his  uncle  had  any
        influence or control over the authorities and there would appear  to
        be no reason why the appellant could not relocate to another part of
        Punjab if he did believe that he was in danger from his uncle.

    27. There are a number of inconsistencies in the appellant's account. At
        paragraph 20 of his statement he maintains that,  since  leaving  in
        1997, he has had no contact with his family in  India.  Yet  at  the
        hearing the appellant stated that  he  last  had  contact  with  his
        family in India in 2009. Within his statement, at paragraph 40,  the
        appellant claims that his mother shared his belief  that  his  uncle
        caused the death of his father and that she had warned  him  not  to
        ever come back home. This is inconsistent with the appellant's claim
        at paragraph 20 of the same statement that he last had contact  with
        his family in 1997 as his mother would not have been  able  to  warn
        him not to come home without some form of contact.

    28. There is a significant inconsistency between  the  appellant's  oral
        evidence and the letter, dated 4 August 2011, from Mr Shamsul Hoque.
        In the letter Mr Hoque states  that  he  knew  the  appellant  since
        November 1997 and that the appellant resided at his flat in November
        and December 1997 as a family friend. In oral evidence the appellant
        was asked where he  lived  between  August  and  October  1997.  The
        appellant stated without hesitation that he lived  with  Mr  Shamsul
        Hoque at his home in Hammersmith.  This  is  inconsistent  with  the
        letter from Mr Hoque confirming that he knew  the  appellant  "since
        November 1997." Nor did Mr Hoque make any mention of  the  appellant
        living with him from August to October 1997. Later in his  evidence,
        when this inconsistency was put to  him,  the  appellant  sought  to
        explain it by reference to  the  long  passage  of  time  since  the
        events. I acknowledge and take into account that a long  passage  of
        time may impact upon an individual's recollection. The appellant was
        however asked a clear and direct question and  was  adamant  in  his
        initial response.

    29. I have additional concerns with the appellant's  evidence  vis-a-vis
        the letter from  Mr  Hoque.  In  his  oral  evidence  the  appellant
        initially said that he could not locate Mr Hoque  because  he  could
        not find Mr Hoque's house. He later  changed  his  evidence  stating
        that he could find Mr Hoch's house but that Mr Hoch was not at  home
        on the 2 occasions that the appellant visited.  The  appellant  gave
        two contrasting descriptions of his attempt to locate  Mr  Hoque.  I
        find that he has failed to provide a reasonable explanation for this
        inconsistency and that this undermines his general credibility.

    30. There was an inconsistency between the  appellant's  description  of
        his involvement with the Osterley cricket club and that given by  Mr
        Wahid. After  initially  claiming  to  be  a  member  the  appellant
        retracted that claim and said he had never joined the club. This was
        in stark contrast to the evidence of Mr Wahid who was sure that  the
        appellant did become a member in April or May 1998. This is  another
        factor undermining the appellant's general credibility and  reducing
        the weight that I can attach to his account both of events in  India
        and of his length of residence in the  UK  and  the  degree  of  his
        integration into British society.

    31. In assessing the appellant's general credibility I additionally take
        into account, as accepted by the appellant  in  his  oral  evidence,
        that he gave a false name and  date  of  birth  (he  claimed  to  be
        Gurwinder Singh, DOB 12/12/1976) when encountered on 26 July 2011 by
        Immigration Officers. This indicates that the appellant has, in  the
        past, resorted to deception when he believed it would benefit him, a
        relevant factor in determining the credibility of his claim. I  note
        the assertions in some of the Home Office letters and  decisions  to
        the effect that the appellant made an entry clearance application as
        a working holiday maker in 2004, that he entered the United  Kingdom
        using a false  French  passport,  and  that  he  was  wanted  as  an
        absconder following  service  of  documents  informing  him  of  his
        illegal status on  10  December  2007.  Mr  Avery  did  not  have  a
        respondent's  file  at  the  hearing  and  these   allegations   are
        unsupported  by  reference  to  any   other   evidence.   In   these
        circumstances I attach no weight whatsoever to these assertions.

    32. I indicated my surprise  at  the  hearing  at  the  absence  of  any
        documentary  evidence  supporting  the  appellant's  claim  to  have
        resided in the UK since 1997. 19 years is  a  very  long  period  of
        time. Other than the evidence from  his  witnesses,  and  a  letter,
        dated 09 August 2011 from the general secretary of the  Guru  Granth
        Gurdwara, claiming that the appellant worshipped  there  since  2001
        and was honest and hard-working and God-fearing, there is  no  other
        evidence of  his  presence.  I  fully  appreciate  however  that  an
        individual who is unlawfully present in the United Kingdom may  well
        encounter  difficulties  in  obtaining  and  retaining   documentary
        evidence confirming their presence. In these circumstances I decline
        to draw an adverse inference based  on  the  absence  of  supportive
        documentary evidence.

    33. There was no attendance  by  Mohammed  Saqib  Yaqub.  The  appellant
        claimed that this individual changed job and was  unable  to  attend
        the hearing because of his employment commitments. There was however
        no letter either from Mr Yaqub or his employers to this  effect.  Mr
        Yaqub maintains that he has known the appellant since 1999 and  that
        they met at a party organised by Mohammed Wahid at a  restaurant  in
        Southall. Other than saying that they remained in contact and became
        friends, and that he knew about the appellant's situation in  India,
        the statement fails to provide any detailed description of the  life
        established by the appellant in the United Kingdom. In  the  absence
        of any opportunity to test Mr Yaqub's evidence, and in  the  absence
        of any letter confirming the reasons for his  non-attendance  (which
        would have been reasonably open to the appellant to obtain), I  find
        I can attach little weight to this statement. In the absence  of  Mr
        Hoque, and for the reasons already given above, I find I can  attach
        no weight to his letter dated 4 August 2011.

    34. Despite the inconsistency between Mr Wahid's evidence  and  that  of
        the appellant relating to membership of the Osterley cricket club, I
        found Mr Wahid's evidence concerning the length of  the  appellant's
        residence in the UK to be generally credible. Mr Wahid gave  a  full
        description of how he first encountered the appellant  in  1998  and
        has consistently maintained, both in his letter dated 6 August 2011,
        in his statement and  in  his  oral  evidence,  that  the  appellant
        resided with him from 1998 until 2003. Mr Wahid  indicated  that  he
        was a person of good character and  there  was  nothing  to  suggest
        otherwise.  He  gave  his  evidence  in  a  direct  manner,  without
        hesitation, and without any discernible attempt at embellishment.

    35. Likewise I found the evidence of Mr Shahid Butt to be  measured  and
        plausible. He stated that he first encountered the appellant in 2003
        and that they had become very good friends. Mr Jasvir  Singh  claims
        to have also met the appellant in 2003 and that they watched  sports
        at a pub together. I did not however find the evidence of  Mr  Tehal
        Singh to be reliable. He gave significantly contrasting accounts  of
        his meeting the appellant's mother  and  brother,  as  disclosed  in
        paragraph [15] of this decision.

    36. Having holistic regard to the evidence from the appellant  and  from
        his  witnesses,  and   despite   having   significant   reservations
        concerning the appellant's  credibility,  I  am  persuaded,  on  the
        balance of probabilities, and based  significantly  on  my  positive
        assessment of the evidence of Mr Wahid, that the appellant has  been
        present in the United Kingdom since at least 1998. It is  impossible
        to ascertain when he actually first entered  the  UK  but  Mr  Wahid
        indicated that the appellant did formally become  a  member  of  the
        Osterley cricket club around April or May 1998, suggesting that  the
        appellant entered the United Kingdom sometime earlier in 1998. Given
        my general adverse credibility findings I do  not  accept  that  the
        appellant was targeted by his uncle in India, even if this assertion
        is not itself inherently implausible. Even  if  I  am  wrong  in  my
        assessment of the appellant's uncle I'm satisfied that the appellant
        would be able to move to another part of Punjab in  order  to  avoid
        any adverse attention by his uncle.

    37. Having satisfied myself that the appellant has  resided  in  the  UK
        since  early  1998,  I  must  consider  whether  he  can  meet   the
        requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE,  the  immigration  rule  giving
        expression to article 8 private  life  rights.  As  the  appellant's
        application was made in February 2015 he  has  not  resided  in  the
        United Kingdom for 20 years prior  to  that  time.  In  his  written
        submissions  Mr  Mold  submits  that  the  appellant  can  meet  the
        requirements of  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  and  that  there  are  'very
        significant obstacles' preventing the appellant returning to India.

    38. For the reasons already given in this decision I  am  not  satisfied
        that the appellant has any reason to fear  his  uncle  in  his  home
        village, and that he could, in any event, relocate to  another  part
        of Punjab, or India. The appellant is not without qualifications  or
        work experience. In his statement he  indicated  that  he  completed
        both primary and  secondary  education,  passing  the  matriculation
        examination  at  a  senior  secondary  school  in  March  1997.  The
        appellant thereafter undertook farming on the family's  agricultural
        land. The appellant is relatively young and there  was  no  evidence
        that he suffered from any physical or mental health  condition.  The
        appellant speaks Punjabi and appears to have spent the  majority  of
        his time in the UK within the  local  Punjabi  community.  There  is
        nothing to indicate that he would have lost his social and  cultural
        connections with India. He lived in that country for  the  formative
        years of his life until, on  his  account,  he  left  aged  18.  His
        friends in the UK have been financially supporting him and there  is
        no reason why they could not continue to do if the appellant returns
        to India until he is able to find a job and support himself. I find,
        having regard to these factors holistically, that there are no  very
        significant obstacles preventing his integration in India.

    39. I must now consider whether there are any compelling factors outside
        the immigration rules, consistent with an article 8  proportionality
        assessment, sufficient to warrant a grant of leave on the  basis  of
        the appellant's  private  life  rights.  I  have  no  hesitation  in
        accepting, having  found  that  the  appellant  entered  the  United
        Kingdom in early 1998, that he has established  a  private  life  in
        this country during his residence of some 19 years. There is however
        very limited evidence of the actual nature and extent of the private
        life  established  by  him  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The   various
        statements   from   the   appellant's    witnesses    make    vague,
        unparticularised  and  highly  generalised   assertions   that   the
        appellant has fully integrated into English society.  The  witnesses
        were not asked to expand upon their vague assertions or to  describe
        in detail the manner and degree of the  appellant's  integration.  I
        accept that the appellant has established a number  of  friendships.
        There is however nothing to indicate that these  friendships,  other
        than  through  the  provision  of  financial  support,  contain  any
        significant elements of reliance or dependency. These  relationships
        could continue albeit through remote forms of contact. The appellant
        is a healthy young man who has lived within  the  Punjabi  community
        since his arrival in the  UK.  His  oral  evidence,  given  via  the
        Punjabi interpreter, indicated that was not in  fact  proficient  in
        English. Other than the weight of years, the friendships established
        by him, and his attendance at the Gudwara, where he helped out,  the
        appellant has failed to show that he  has  integrated  into  English
        society to any significant degree. There is nothing to show that his
        daily social and cultural  experience  and  expectations  have  been
        shaped by his life in the UK to such an extent that  he  would  have
        difficulties integrating in India.

    40. I must additionally take into  account  the  factors  identified  in
        section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.
        The private life established by  the  appellant  occurred  when  his
        immigration status was,  at  all  times,  precarious.  I  take  into
        account his claim that, if permitted to do so, he would work, but no
        evidence of any potential  employment  was  provided.  I  take  into
        account  his  lack  of  proficiency  in  the  English  language.   I
        additionally take into account the public  interest  in  maintaining
        effective immigration controls. I also take into  account  the  fact
        that, based on my findings that the  appellant  entered  the  United
        Kingdom in early 1998, he may meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
        276ADE in early 2018. In Patel [2013] UKSC 72 the Supreme Court held
        that the balance drawn by the  rules,  and  their  context,  may  be
        relevant to the consideration of proportionality, but that,  "...  a
        near-miss under the rules cannot provide substance to a human rights
        case which is otherwise lacking in merit." In SSHD v  SS  (Congo)  &
        Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the Court of Appeal explained  that,  if  an
        applicant can show that there  are  individual  interests  at  stake
        covered by article  8  which  give  rise  to  a  strong  claim  that
        compelling circumstances may exist  to  justify  the  grant  of  LTE
        outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also  a  'near  miss'
        case may be a relevant consideration which tips  the  balance  under
        Article 8 in their favour. For the reasons I have already given I am
        not satisfied there is a strong claim that compelling  circumstances
        exist such as to justify a grant of  leave  to  remain  outside  the
        immigration rules as a result of any 'near miss'.

    41. Having holistic regard to all these factors I am not satisfied there
        are sufficiently compelling reasons to warrant a grant of  leave  to
        remain under article 8. I therefore dismiss the appeal.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed on all grounds
