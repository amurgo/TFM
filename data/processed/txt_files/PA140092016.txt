Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms U. Dirie, Counsel instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, born in 1987.   She  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2016 and made a claim for  asylum  on
    arrival.  In a decision dated 26 September 2016 the respondent  refused
    the asylum and human rights claim.

 2. The appellant's appeal against that  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge C.  H.  O'Rourke  at  a  hearing  on  30  January  2017,
    following which he dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 3. The basis of the appellant's claim for asylum  and  related  Article  3
    claim is that she is of Hazara ethnicity.   She  and  her  family  were
    harassed for about a year by a man named [Z] who wanted to  marry  her.
    The appellant and her family were threatened by [Z] and his associates,
    causing the appellant's family to move to Kabul.

 4. She lived there for 10 years and became engaged.   [Z]  appeared  again
    having tracked her down and made threats to  her  father  resulting  in
    arrangements  made  by  the  appellant's  father  for  her   to   leave
    Afghanistan.

 5. The appellant claims that she and her (now) husband in  the  UK  cannot
    return to Afghanistan because [Z] and those associated with  him  would
    find her and kill her.  Likewise, the security situation is  such  that
    they could not return, and the appellant's Hazara ethnicity  would  put
    her at risk.

 6. In relation to Article 8 of the ECHR, she is married to MH,  a  British
    citizen, who suffers from learning disabilities, and is  a  person  who
    requires a full-time carer.  He would not be able to accompany  her  to
    Afghanistan.  They have a genuine and subsisting relationship  and  the
    appellant is pregnant, her husband being the father.

    The grounds and submissions

 7. Complaint is  made  in  the  grounds  about  the  FtJ's  assessment  of
    credibility with reference to her interview.  The  grounds  state  that
    "shortly before the interview" the appellant had suffered a miscarriage
    and that this was undoubtedly an extremely  upsetting  event  for  her.
    The grounds refer to evidence of the  appellant's  upset  and  distress
    during the interview.  However, the FtJ had said that the appellant had
    been able to give lengthy and detailed answers to questions rather than
    monosyllabic "don't know" answers that might have been expected in such
    circumstances.  The grounds assert that it was  inappropriate  for  the
    judge to impute 'typical' behaviour to the appellant as someone who had
    suffered a traumatic event such as a miscarriage.   His  assessment  of
    discrepancies in her account in that respect was therefore flawed.

 8. As regards the FtJ's conclusion that the appellant is not in a  genuine
    and  subsisting  relationship  with  her  husband,  his  findings  were
    "discriminatory and speculative" in terms of the conclusion that it was
    impossible for a meaningful marriage to  have  taken  place  given  her
    husband's disabilities and that the appellant's role was much more akin
    to that of a carer rather than a wife.  There was  no  evidence  before
    the FtJ to the effect that the appellant's husband lacked  capacity  to
    make decisions for himself, including in terms of whether he  was  able
    to enter into a relationship.  Although the appellant's husband had not
    given evidence, he had attended the hearing to  support  the  appellant
    and he is the father of her unborn child.   It  is  asserted  that  the
    FtJ's approach  is  contrary  to  Article  23  of  the  United  Nations
    Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

 9. Furthermore, the FtJ's comment  that  the  appellant  was,  in  effect,
    trafficked is speculative and without foundation.  If the FtJ genuinely
    thought that the appellant was trafficked there was a duty upon him  to
    refer her to the National Referral Mechanism ("NRM").

10. It is finally asserted in the grounds that the FtJ erred in failing  to
    adjourn the hearing, although in submissions on behalf of the appellant
    that inclusion in the grounds was said to have been in error.

11. In submissions Ms Dirie relied on the grounds.  She confirmed that  the
    challenge to the FtJ's decision was not only in relation to the Article
    8 conclusions, but also in terms of asylum and Article 3.

12. The grounds in relation to the FtJ's approach to the  asylum  interview
    were reiterated.  Although the FtJ said that there was no evidence that
    the appellant had suffered a miscarriage, at the start  of  the  asylum
    interview it was noted that documents in relation  to  the  miscarriage
    had been provided.  Although the appellant in the interview had said in
    answer to question 127 that she wanted to continue with the  interview,
    the question arises as to the extent to which she was  able  to  engage
    with the interview.

13. The conclusion that the appellant is likely  to  have  been  trafficked
    with the connivance of her family and that she had  no  choice  in  the
    matter, is discriminatory and speculative.   Although  the  appellant's
    husband has learning disabilities and epilepsy,  it  goes  too  far  to
    suggest that he therefore lacked capacity to enter into a  relationship
    or marriage with the appellant.  I was referred to the Mental  Capacity
    Act 2005, in particular at section 1(2) to the  effect  that  a  person
    must  be  assumed  to  have  capacity  unless  otherwise   established.
    Furthermore, in terms of the subsistence of the  relationship,  it  was
    relevant that at the time of the hearing the  appellant  was  pregnant,
    and that her husband attended the hearing before the  FtJ,  as  he  had
    done at this present hearing.

14. Mr Melvyn submitted that it was not clear that the grounds of appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal included  complaint  about  the  FtJ's  findings  on
    asylum and Article 3.  His conclusions in those respects do not  appear
    to be challenged, other than in relation to  what  is  said  about  the
    miscarriage some months before the interview.

15. In any event, the appellant's skeleton argument before the FtJ did  not
    rely on that issue and there was no argument before the FtJ in terms of
    the relevance of the appellant's miscarriage.  In the asylum  interview
    the appellant gave lengthy answers to questions.  A  break  was  given,
    and at no time did her representatives ask  for  the  interview  to  be
    'adjourned', and  they  did  not  write  afterwards  to  say  that  the
    appellant had not been given the chance to answer questions because  of
    vulnerability.

16. In terms of  the  nature  of  the  appellant's  relationship  with  her
    husband, the FtJ had set out the evidence and made findings on it.   He
    had considered the medical evidence.  There was a report  in  2010  and
    then another five years later.  The appellant's husband  was  described
    as an "extremely vulnerable adult" and therefore the description of his
    learning difficulties as "severe" was appropriate and open to him.  The
    medical evidence was in any event very sparse.  There was little up-to-
    date evidence at the time of the hearing in relation to his condition.

17. The decision letter considered the medical evidence and challenged  the
    relationship between the appellant and her husband.  It  was  therefore
    encumbent on the appellant to provide up-to-date evidence.

18. Although the FtJ did use the word  'trafficked'  with  respect  of  the
    appellant,  and  a  better  choice  of  words  might  have  been   more
    appropriate, it was nevertheless clear that  the  FtJ  found  that  the
    appellant was brought to the UK to care for her husband, and there  was
    no genuine and subsisting relationship.  The appellant's  grounds  have
    taken the FtJ's use of the word 'trafficking' too literally.

19. Furthermore, it was open to the FtJ on the evidence to  find  that  the
    appellant's husband did lack capacity.  They do not live  together  and
    the reasons given for that were contradictory.

20. In reply, Ms Dirie submitted that the FtJ was  not  in  a  position  to
    assess the appellant's husband's capacity from the evidence before him.
     Furthermore, even if the appellant is her husband's carer,  that  does
    not mean that there is not a genuine relationship.

21.  There  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  unhappy  in   the
    relationship and her evidence was to the  contrary,  stating  that  she
    loved  her  husband.   If  it  had  been  thought  that  she  had  been
    trafficked, some action in that respect should have been taken.

    Conclusions

22. Whilst the grounds could be clearer in this  respect,  I  am  satisfied
    that the grounds do relate to the FtJ's conclusions  in  terms  of  the
    protection claim, as well as his conclusions in relation to Article  8.



23. However, the only complaint in relation to the assessment of the asylum
    claim  concerns  the  FtJ's  treatment   of   the   asylum   interview.
    Specifically, this relates to para 19.ii. of the decision.   Under  the
    hearing "Appellant's Credibility" the FtJ said as follows:

         "I note that the  Appellant  states  that  she  had  a  miscarriage
         approximately two months before her substantive interview and while
         such an event will no doubt be extremely upsetting, it does not, in
         my  view,  without  medical  evidence,  account  for  the   glaring
         discrepancies in her account.  She was asked at the outset  of  the
         interview whether she was feeling well enough to be interviewed and
         she said 'I am well' and went on to give many lengthy and  detailed
         answers to questions, rather than perhaps  monosyllabic  or  'don't
         know' answers that might be expected in such circumstances ...".

24. The FtJ then went on to give reasons as to why the appellant was not  a
    credible witness.

25. As to whether the appellant had in fact suffered a miscarriage prior to
    the interview, later in his decision at para  19.iv.d  he  did  express
    some doubt about that, stating that there was no  medical  evidence  in
    that respect, and that the references in the medical  reports  were  to
    her self-reporting the miscarriage after the event.

26. I was not referred to any direct medical evidence to support the  claim
    that the appellant had suffered  a  miscarriage  prior  to  her  asylum
    interview.  Having said that, this is a matter that the  appellant  has
    been consistent about, and about  which  she  made  repeated  reference
    during the asylum interview.  It is referred to in the medical records,
    albeit that the FtJ was correct to characterise those references as the
    appellant's self-reporting of the incident after the  event,  in  other
    contexts.

27. However, that aside, the FtJ's observations at para 19.ii. appear to be
    predicated  on  the  assumption  that  the  appellant  had  suffered  a
    miscarriage.  Such is evident from his having said that such  an  event
    would no doubt be extremely upsetting.  His reference there to  medical
    evidence seems to me to be a reference to medical  evidence  about  her
    ability to answer questions, rather than medical evidence  in  relation
    to the miscarriage.

28. Just in  relation  to  the  date  that  she  is  said  to  have  had  a
    miscarriage, it was submitted before me that it was in July 2016.  That
    is a date that is consistent with  the  document  at  page  22  of  the
    appellant's supplementary bundle which, albeit very difficult  to  read
    because of the printing,  appears  to  be  a  hospital  admission  form
    stating that she had a miscarriage "2/12 ago", the  date  of  the  form
    being 16 September 2016.

29. Complaint is made about the FtJ having said  that  rather  than  giving
    many lengthy and detailed  answers  to  questions,  her  upset  at  her
    miscarriage  might  be  expected  to   have   resulted   in,   perhaps,
    monosyllabic or 'don't know' answers.  To some extent there is merit in
    that criticism.  It is not clear why the FtJ thought that a  person  so
    affected would give monosyllabic or 'don't  know'  answers.   Grief  or
    trauma plainly may affect different people in  different  ways.   I  do
    consider that that particular comment by the FtJ was without foundation
    and was highly speculative.

30. It is also true, as the grounds suggest, that  the  appellant  said  on
    more than one occasion during the interview  that  she  had  been  very
    deeply affected by the miscarriage.  Indeed, in answer  to  question  2
    she said that since the loss of her baby she had been affected  deeply,
    was very upset and hurt, and could not remember things.

31. However, looking at the interview it is clear that the  appellant  did,
    as the FtJ said, give many lengthy and detailed answers  to  questions.
    Likewise, at the start of the interview the  appellant  confirmed  that
    she was well enough to be  interviewed.   At  question  125,  when  the
    appellant became upset when answering questions about threats that  she
    said  were  made  to  her,  and  after  a  break   of   five   minutes,
    notwithstanding that she is recorded as having  been  crying  and  said
    that she was very upset because of the loss of her baby  she  confirmed
    that she wanted to continue with the interview.  Prior to that, she was
    invited to take five more minutes to try to  compose  herself  although
    she was told that the  interviewer  did  want  to  try  to  finish  the
    interview that day.  No representations in relation  to  the  interview
    were made by her legal representatives after the interview,  once  they
    became instructed.

32. There is plainly an overlap between the asylum/Article 3 claim and  the
    Article  8  aspect  of  the  appeal.   The  FtJ's  adverse  credibility
    findings, both in relation to the  interview  and  generally,  traverse
    both areas.

33. In para 19, his reasons for finding the appellant not to be a  credible
    witness refer to the appellant's "complete inability"  to  recall  even
    the approximate dates for her marriage, her departure from  Afghanistan
    and the recurrence of the threats from [Z].  He noted that recollection
    of precise dates may not be as important in Afghanistan as it is in the
    West, but he noted that she was educated, having attended school to the
    age of 17 or 18.   He  did  not  accept  that  she  would  not  in  the
    circumstances be able to recall even approximate dates for such events.



34. He referred to the appellant's multiple references to  her  husband  as
    her fianc� (referring to the asylum and screening interviews).  He said
    that her excuse that she had forgot that she was married (question 4 of
    the asylum interview) was deeply implausible.

35. He also referred to contradictory evidence as to  whether  or  not  her
    husband had visited her in Afghanistan.  This appears to be a reference
    to inconsistency between her asylum interview  (questions  25  and  26)
    that her husband had come to Kabul to ask for her hand in marriage, and
    her witness statement to the effect that  he  had  never  travelled  to
    Afghanistan, and her brother-in-law's evidence that  the  marriage  was
    conducted over the phone in October 2013.  The FtJ  concluded  that  it
    was simply not credible that she would not remember  that  her  husband
    had not in fact come to Afghanistan and that the entire arrangement and
    the marriage had been conducted over the phone.

36. In relation to the claimed risk from [Z], the FtJ said  that  that  was
    not credible because of her lack of  credibility  generally.   He  also
    said that there was inherent  implausibility  in  [Z]  being  able,  or
    having the motivation, from another province, to track down her and her
    family in a populous city like Kabul, after an interval  of  10  years.
    He by then was 70 or 80 years of age.  He stated  that  it  would  seem
    much more likely that if he was as  powerful  and  influential  as  the
    appellant had claimed, her family would either have not been  able  to,
    or indeed wished to, deny his demands.  In the  alternative,  he  would
    have quickly located them in Kabul, as opposed to 10 years  later.   He
    also said that there was a lack of any corroborative  evidence  of  the
    existence of this person.

37. As I have indicated, the challenge to the asylum and Article 3 claim is
    limited in the grounds to the narrow attack on the FtJ's comments about
    the asylum interview, to which I have  referred.   However,  I  am  not
    satisfied that there is any error of law in the FtJ's conclusions  with
    respect to the interview, notwithstanding what I have  said  about  the
    FtJ's speculation about what answers  the  appellant  might  have  been
    expected to give in the light of her state of mind.

38. Furthermore, the FtJ was entitled to  take  into  account  against  the
    appellant her seeming inability to recall even  approximate  dates  for
    key events, including her marriage; likewise,  the  references  to  her
    husband as a fianc�, rather than her husband, given the contention that
    the marriage took place in October 2013 (and  the  interview  being  in
    August 2016).  The inconsistency in relation  to  whether  or  not  her
    husband ever in fact  went  to  Afghanistan  to  meet  her  before  the
    marriage is similarly a significant matter that the FtJ was entitled to
    take into account.

39. In addition, no complaint is made  in  the  grounds,  or  was  made  in
    submissions before me, in terms of the FtJ's assessment of the inherent
    implausibility of the appellant's account in relation to  [Z]  and  his
    ability or motivation to track her down after an interval of 10  years,
    and the FtJ's further  assessment  as  to  why  that  was  an  unlikely
    scenario.

40. Although the FtJ referred to the lack of any corroborative evidence  of
    the existence of [Z], which I consider to be a very weak basis  for  an
    adverse credibility finding on the facts of this case, no complaint has
    been made about it in the grounds or in submissions.   It  is  however,
    not a central feature of the  FtJ's  conclusions  which  are  otherwise
    legally sustainable.

41. As regards the appellant's relationship with MH, the  central  argument
    relates to the FtJ's conclusion that he lacked capacity to enter into a
    marriage.

42. There is, it seems to me, a real question about whether  the  appellant
    and MH are actually married according to English law.  However, this is
    not an issue that was explored before  the  FtJ,  or  before  me.   For
    present purposes, it is probably not material.

43. The FtJ was required to make an  assessment  of  whether  there  was  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship between them as husband  and  wife,
    or as partners.  He was  entitled  in  that  assessment  to  take  into
    account other aspects of the appellant's credibility, and he did so.

44. The grounds on  behalf  of  the  appellant  mischaracterise  the  FtJ's
    conclusions  at  para  19.iv.c.   The  grounds  suggest  that  the  FtJ
    concluded  that  the  appellant's  husband's   disabilities   made   it
    impossible for a meaningful "marriage" to have taken  place.   However,
    the FtJ in  fact  said  in  that  paragraph  that  the  nature  of  his
    disabilities  renders  it  impossible  that  "any  meaningful  marriage
    ceremony" (my emphasis) could have taken place.

45. It does seem to me that the FtJ was entitled to come to that conclusion
    in the light of the evidence as to MH's mental state.  The GP's  letter
    dated 7 October 2010 at page 13 of the appellant's main  bundle  states
    that he suffers from learning disability and epilepsy, that he has very
    poor communication skills, can only say three words in English and that
    his native tongue  (Dari)  he  is  unable  to  speak  clearly  and  has
    difficulty understanding others speaking it.   It  states  that  he  is
    unable  to  write  and  has  no  concept  of  money  or  numbers.   All
    communication and history was taken through his brother.

46. The more recent evidence dated 16 June 2015 (page  11)  from  the  same
    GP's surgery states that MH is unable to communicate  his  difficulties
    to the doctors.  He  is  again  described  as  having  a  diagnosis  of
    learning disability and  epilepsy.   The  letter  goes  on  to  confirm
    matters previously referred to in the 2010 letter, adding that  he  has
    no concept of money and little concept of  numbers.   Although  he  had
    lived in the UK for a while, his ability to learn the language did  not
    appear to be present.  He was able to dress, wash  and  toilet  himself
    but was not able to cook or make himself a cup of tea.  It  sates  that
    he is "an extremely vulnerable adult" who requires  a  full-time  carer
    and guidance which he is luckily getting from his brother and sister-in-
    law.  He would not be capable of independent  living  without  constant
    guidance from others, it states.  As a matter of interest,  the  letter
    refers to his residency status preventing his access  to  much  of  the
    community services that would benefit him.

47. The evidence before the FtJ was that the marriage  had  been  conducted
    over the phone in October 2013.  In the light of the evidence to  which
    I have referred and which was  before  the  FtJ,  supplemented  by  the
    written and oral evidence of the witnesses, he was entitled to conclude
    that the nature of MH's disabilities rendered it  impossible  that  any
    meaningful marriage "ceremony" could have taken place.  It is difficult
    to see how MH could have communicated  his  assent  to  a  marriage  in
    circumstances where his communication  skills  are  so  poor  that  he,
    effectively, needs to communicate through his brother.

48.  More  widely,  in  terms  of  his  ability  to  assent  to  a  married
    relationship, the same considerations apply. He is described  as  being
    extremely vulnerable, having a learning disability.

49. Whilst it is true that s.1(2) of the Mental Capacity  Act  2005  states
    that a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established
    that he lacks capacity, the fact  is  that  the  medical  evidence  put
    before the FtJ raised a significant question about whether MH does have
    capacity in the legal sense.  It is to be remembered that it is for the
    appellant to prove her case.  In circumstances where there is  evidence
    to raise a question about the capacity of  a  party  to  enter  into  a
    marriage, and indeed to be party to a marriage, it is for the appellant
    to establish that the person concerned does have capacity.  No  medical
    evidence was put before the FtJ  which  indicated  that  MH  does  have
    capacity to enter into a marriage.  Such evidence could  reasonably  be
    expected in the light of the evidence as to his learning disability.

50. Although it appears that MH and the appellant  have,  or  have  had,  a
    sexual relationship which has  resulted  in  the  appellant  now  being
    pregnant, that in fact reveals very little about MH's capacity to enter
    into a marriage.   It  is  not  suggested  that  he  has  any  physical
    disability, except to  the  extent  that  his  physical  abilities  are
    limited by his mental state.

51. More widely, it is also significant that the appellant had been  unable
    to recall even the approximate date for her  marriage.   She  had  been
    inconsistent about her references to him as her fianc� or her  husband.
    In her evidence before the FtJ, recorded at para 14, explaining why she
    could not remember the date of her marriage, she said that she had  not
    read the marriage documents.  The FtJ referred to the entire  focus  of
    her brother-in-law's evidence as being the  requirement  to  find  "any
    wife" for his brother, who could take over the need to  care  for  him,
    following the death of their father.  The phrase "any wife" appears  in
    the FtJ's decision as a quotation from the oral evidence.

52. Furthermore, the FtJ was entitled to take into account  the  fact  that
    the appellant does  not  live  with  MH,  and  there  was  inconsistent
    evidence between the appellant and her brother-in-law as to the reasons
    for that.

53. Whilst the FtJ's assessment that their relationship was "transactional"
    is rather a blunt way of putting it, I do not consider that it  can  be
    said that his conclusion in that respect was in error.   What  the  FtJ
    plainly meant was that this was  not  a  relationship  of  two  persons
    committed to each other with reciprocal or mutual  emotional  feelings,
    but that it was one in which in fact neither party was engaged  in  the
    relationship or committed to it as a married relationship.

54. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the  FtJ  was  entitled  to
    conclude that neither Appendix FM, nor  Article  8  more  widely,  were
    engaged in terms of family life.

55. There is no specific complaint in relation to  the  FtJ's  findings  in
    terms of return to Kabul.  The FtJ noted that  the  appellant's  family
    continued to live there  and,  on  his  findings,  are  not  under  any
    pressure from [Z] and that they could therefore re-accommodate and care
    for the appellant.  She would not therefore be a lone female and  would
    not be at any greater risk in Kabul  than  she  was  before  she  left.
    Although she was in the early stages of  her  pregnancy,  he  concluded
    that there was no reason to assume that her child would not  be  safely
    born in Kabul.  He noted that the appellant clearly missed  her  family
    and feels isolated and neglected in the UK.  He concluded, justifiably,
    that there would not be very significant obstacles to  her  integrating
    in Afghanistan.

56. No wider arguments in relation to Article 8 in terms of the appellant's
    child, or the child's relationship to its father, have  been  advanced.
    In any event, as at present, the child is unborn and as such  does  not
    have protected rights as a child.

57. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any error of
    law in the FtJ's decision in any respect.  His decision to dismiss  the
    appeal on all grounds therefore stands.

    Decision

58. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  Its decision to dismiss the appeal on  all
    grounds therefore stands.
