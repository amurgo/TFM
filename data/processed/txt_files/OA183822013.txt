                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS



    1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Dineen (hereinafter referred to as the  FTTJ)  dismissing  an  appeal
       against a decision to refuse the appellant leave to enter the  United
       Kingdom.




                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015



 Background

    2. On 24 April 2013,  the  appellant  applied,  under  the  respondent's
       family  reunion  policy,  to  be  reunited  with   his   brother,   H
       (hereinafter referred to as the sponsor)  who  was  recognised  as  a
       refugee in the United Kingdom. The  appellant's  younger  brother,  F
       also made an application at  the  same  time,  but  was  subsequently
       kidnapped and killed. At the time of the application,  the  appellant
       was residing in Panian refugee camp in  Haripur,  Pakistan  with  his
       brother F and their mother. The  appellant's  mother,  aged  53,  was
       injured in an attack, which took place in Pakistan in 2011 and cannot
       walk. The appellant faced regular harassment  and  discrimination  in
       Pakistan owing to his Afghan nationality and  F  had  been  kidnapped
       before, in March 2012. The application stressed  that  the  appellant
       was particularly vulnerable in that he was a child living in a female-
       led household.


    3. On 26 August 2013, the ECO refused the  appellant's  application  and
       that of his brother, with  reference  to  paragraph  352D(i)  of  the
       Immigration Rules. The ECO did not  accept  that  the  appellant  was
       related as claimed to the sponsor owing to the recent issuing of  the
       appellant's documents.  Reference  was  made  to  the  "compassionate
       reasons for the application." Account was said to have been taken  of
       reports regarding the sponsor, as well as that the appellant's mother
       was not applying or travelling with the appellant. It was  also  said
       that  no  evidence  or  information  had  been  provided  so  as   to
       demonstrate  that   the   appellant's   individual   upbringing   and
       circumstances merited exceptional consideration beyond the provisions
       of the Rules.

    4. The appellant's grounds of appeal argued that the decision of the ECO
       was not in accordance with the Rules, the law and that  a  discretion
       conferred by the Immigration Rules was not exercised. It was  further
       argued that the  decision  violated  Article  8  ECHR  and  that  the
       decision did not consider the best interests  of  the  appellant.  An
       indication was given that DNA evidence could be arranged in order  to
       provide proof of the relationship between the appellant and sponsor.

    5. An Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)  did  not  review  the  decision  to
       refuse entry owing to a shortage of staff.

    6. Prior to the hearing before the FTTJ, the appeal of  the  appellant's
       brother F was withdrawn owing to reports of his death at the hands of
       his kidnappers. At the hearing before the FTTJ on  13  October  2014,
       the sponsor gave evidence and reliance was  placed  on  an  extensive
       quantity of subjective material and country evidence.  In  dismissing
       the appeal, the FTTJ accepted the account provided by  the  appellant
       and sponsor as credible; that it was common  ground  that  the  Rules
       were not met;  that  the  respondent  exercised  the  discretion  and
       thereby complied with the policy; that section 55 of  the  BCIA  2009
       had no application to children who were abroad and that  there  would
       be  no  interference  with  the  existing  family  life  between  the
       appellant and sponsor.

       Error of law
    7. The grounds of application argue that the FTTJ erred  in  failing  to
       remit the appeal to the respondent  for  a  lawful  decision,  having
       identified compassionate reasons. Alternatively, it was said that the
       FTTJ failed to consider whether this was a case where he could  apply
       the policy directly. It was also argued in the grounds that the  FTTJ
       failed to consider the appellant's emotional and financial dependency
       on the sponsor in concluding that there was no family life  and  that
       the FTTJ failed to consider the relevance of the respondent's  policy
       in relation to his decision on Article 8.






    8. Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.


    9. The Secretary of State's response  dated  3  June  2015  opposed  the
       appeal on the basis that the FTTJ directed himself appropriately.  It
       was said that there was no failure by the respondent to consider  the
       exercise of discretion. With regard to Article 8, it was argued  that
       it was open to the FTTJ to conclude that there  was  no  family  life
       with the sponsor.

       The hearing

   10.  It  was  common  ground  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
       requirements of paragraph 352D(i) of the Rules and that a failure  by
       the respondent to consider the appellant's  circumstances  under  the
       relevant policy would render the decision not in accordance with  the
       law.


   11. After some preliminary discussion, Ms Easty advised us of the process
       to be followed by the respondent under the Entry  Clearance  Guidance
       General Instructions. She referred to extracts of that Guidance which
       had been included in her skeleton argument which was before the  FTTJ
       and which she subsequently supplied to the panel. Ms  Easty  informed
       us that she had not placed much emphasis on this aspect of the policy
       at the hearing before the FTTJ and this issue did not  form  part  of
       the grounds for permission to appeal.


   12. Ms Easty applied to amend  her  grounds  of  appeal  to  include  the
       following; "the Tribunal erred in law in finding  that  the  ECM  had
       properly applied her family reunion policy (at paragraph  37  of  the
       decision) as a) the ECO failed to  properly  consider  whether  there
       were any compassionate circumstances in the present case  and  failed
       to refer the application to NCC5; and b) the ECO  did  not  have  the
       power to consider the matter  once  compassionate  circumstances  had
       been identified."

   13. Mr Naith advised us that he did  not  object  to  the  grounds  being
       amended. We agreed to permit the amendment in view of the  fact  that
       the appeal concerns a  minor  and  the  FTTJ's  findings  as  to  his
       circumstances.


   14. In essence, Ms Easty's submission was that  the  ECO  ought  to  have
       passed the appellant's case to the Home Office for  a  decision  once
       compassionate circumstances were identified. She added that the ECO's
       decision did not clearly indicate whether or not it was accepted that
       there were compassionate circumstances.

   15. Mr  Naith  agreed  that  the  issues  were  whether  the  policy  was
       considered at all or whether it should  have  been  referred  on.  He
       confirmed that the ECM did not review the matter owing to a  lack  of
       resources. He was of the view that it could be said that  there  were
       enough grounds for the ECO to refer the case up. Having discussed  it
       with Ms Easty prior to the hearing, he advised us that he  was  happy
       for the matter to be sent back to the respondent for reconsideration.



   16. At the end of the hearing we indicated that we intended to allow  the
       appeal with a direction that the appellant's case  be  placed  before
       the appropriate person under the terms of the Guidance.  We  set  out
       our reasons below.

   17. We are guided by the decision in AG and others  (Policies;  executive
       discretions; Tribunal powers) Kosovo [2007] UKAIT 00082 and paragraph
       3 of the headnote in particular;


       "(3) If the claimant fails to establish that his human rights compel
       the remedy he seeks, but is able to show that there was at the date
       of the decision a policy in force that governed his case but was not
       taken into account, he may win an appeal on the ground that the
       decision, having been made not in accordance with published policy,
       was 'otherwise not in accordance with the law' within the meaning of
       s84(1)(e)."




   18. The relevant part of the respondent's family re-union  policy  states
       as follows:

       "People who  flee  to  the  UK  to  seek  asylum  can  include  their
       dependants in their application for asylum, if those dependants  have
       travelled with them to the UK. However, we  recognise  that  families
       can become fragmented in cases of asylum, depending on the speed  and
       manner in which the person has fled.

       If you are a recognised  refugee  or  have  been  given  humanitarian
       protection in the UK, our family reunion programme allows you  to  be
       reunited with your family members (that is, those who  were  part  of
       your family unit before you fled).

       Under the Immigration Rules, only your pre-existing family  (husband,
       wife, civil partner or unmarried/same-sex partner, plus any  children
       under 18 who formed part of the family unit when  you  fled  to  seek
       asylum) can apply to enter the UK under the family reunion programme.
       However, we may allow family reunion  for  other  family  members  if
       there are compassionate reasons why their case should  be  considered
       outside the Immigration Rules. "

   19. In terms of the process to be followed by the ECO for applicants  who
       are neither partners nor the minor children of the sponsor, The Entry
       Clearance Guidance General Instructions states as follows:


       "If you consider there are compelling compassionate circumstances
       involved and the appellants do not meet the requirements above, you
       should refer the application to NCC5 in the Home Office for a
       decision. You should say why the application falls outside the normal
       criteria and explain clearly the compassionate circumstances to be
       taken into account."


   20. The ECO's decision refers to an indication of "compassionate reasons"
       for the application but at the same time concludes, that there was no
       evidence or information provided to demonstrate that the  appellant's
       "individual upbringing and circumstances to  date  merit  exceptional
       consideration now  beyond  the  requirement  and  provisions  of  the
       Immigration Rules."


   21. The reasoning of the ECO is far from clear. We find that the phrasing
       of the decision in question  indicates  that  the  ECO,  upon  noting
       compassionate circumstances, went on to  decide  the  matter  without
       reference to NCC5 in the Home Office as should be the case under  the
       Guidance. Alternatively, the  ECO  has  decided  that  there  are  no
       compassionate circumstances, which given the detailed representations
       and substantial supporting evidence sent  with  the  application,  is
       somewhat concerning.

   22. In this case there was also no review  carried  out  by  the  ECM,  a
       process which might have thrown some light on the procedure  followed
       by the ECO in coming to a decision. We are  therefore  not  satisfied
       that the ECO followed the correct process or that  the  decision  was
       reached in accordance with the published policy. It follows  that  we
       conclude  that  the  FTTJ  materially  erred  in  finding  that   the
       respondent exercised discretion and complied with the policy.

   23. The FTTJ accepted the account put forward on the  appellant's  behalf
       by the sponsor whom he found to be a "credible and truthful  witness"
       and owing to the consistency between the sponsor's  account  and  the
       substantial supporting evidence. There is no reason to disturb  those
       findings.

   24. We would wish to emphasise our concern that an application concerning
       a minor, whom the FTTJ subsequently found, at  paragraph  44  of  the
       decision, to be living in "harrowing"  circumstances  and  which  was
       clearly made under the policy from the outset, was not reviewed by an
       ECM after the appellant lodged his appeal.


   25. We accordingly allow the appellant's appeal.


 Decision

       1) We are satisfied that the FTTJ erred in law in dismissing the
          appeal on the basis that the respondent had complied with the
          family reunion policy.

       2) The Entry Clearance Officer has yet to exercise  discretion  under
          the family reunion policy. We therefore allow the  appeal  to  the
          Upper Tribunal to the limited extent that;

           a) the decision of the judge to dismiss the appeal is set aside.

           b) We substitute a  fresh  decision  to  allow  the  appellant's
              appeal against the refusal of leave to enter to  the  limited
              extent that it remains outstanding before the Entry Clearance
              Officer for the matter to be referred to the NCC5 in the Home
              Office for consideration of the discretion  to  be  exercised
              under the family reunion policy.

       3) In reaching that conclusion we have had regard to Mr Naith's view
          that there were sufficient grounds for the appellant's case to
          have been referred to the Home Office and we conclude that it
          would be wrong to confidently anticipate that the only possible
          outcome will be a refusal.

    An anonymity direction was made by the FTTJ and as this case concerns a
    minor, we consider it appropriate to do likewise;

      "Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  we  make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "
